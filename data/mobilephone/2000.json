For starters is a great looking TV (on the outside), looks great in the living room, your wife will not whant to hide it in the closet and most important it looks super great with a DVD player, I just traded my old  50" for this set and on the old set there was hardly any difference  betwen the way my DSS system looked and the way my DVD looked, on the new  set there is a whole world of difference. I had some friends ask me if this  is HDTV. BUT! one thing I really hated about it was that it has a Video out  but not a tunner out, so when I hook it up to my A/V receiver, if I whant  to watch regular TV I have to use 2 remotes, one to set my A/V to TV and  the other one to set the TV to TV, can you belive that? , my old system  1989 model had a Tunner out! , some body at Sony was sleeping on the Job.  Besides this small fall back its a great TV and people will say "wasnt  projection TV supposed to looked bad! "great value buy it!
I found the Sony KV-53S65 53" Projection TV to be the best value among similar size projection TV's. I compared the Sony against comparable RCA, Toshiba, and Phillips models. The Picture was much sharper than other  models. I found the Red, Green, and Black colors to be more pure than more  expensive Phillips and RCA models. I realy like the front S-Video input for  easy hookup of my DVD. I also especialy enjoyed the layout of the remote  control compared to RCA remotes I have used previously (The buttons were  not layed out logicaly on other remotes I have used).
This TV has a great picture quality.  The picture is great.  The sound is awesome.  Eventhough it is very expansive for a TV but if you have the money, this is great TV to own.  If the lights are out and your watching a  movie on this TV it feels like you are at a movie theater.
This is a great TV. Whenever I think of buying something that is technology related, I buy Sony. It is the only brand that I trust, and they have never failed me. This TV has great resolution, and provides great  sound. It has an easy to understand remote and a great picture as long as  it isn't coming from cable. If you are thinking of getting a big screen and  are currently a cable subscriber ask them if you will need a signal  booster.  Although if watching a video or DVD the picture is excellent,  clear as can be. Another thing is that it is light, which makes moving it  very easy.  Go for it!
I just bought one and found it a nice match with the other electronics at my home.  The definition is superb.  The appearance is pretty good, too.  It is a good investment if you don't have a plan to buy another one in the  near future.
The TV is a good one and I am very satisified with its performance. I would definitely recommend buying this.
If you need to have a big TV to see all your favorite movies and TV programmes, this Sony Projection TV is ideal for you. The quality of image is superb, the sound is even more fantastic and functionality is the best I  have ever seen in my life. The proce/value is exceptional. Don't miss it!
