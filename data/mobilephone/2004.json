It's been 3 weeks now and I've only had minor voice mail setup issues.  The phone itself is the best I've had in years.  Clear calls and it gets signals where my previous AT&T service would not.  My guess is that this is partly due to the good Nextel coverage my area gets.As for the phone...I did not particularly like the v60 series.  My flip seemed cheap and I broke the antenna really easily.  This phone feels much stronger and better constructed.  Lucky for me all of my v-series accessories fit, so there were no extra purchases needed.  I'll see what 6 months to a year brings.
I've been a Nextel customer for years for both business and personal use. I've used almost all lines of phones. The i95cl was my favorite until i830 came along. The i95 is good for casual and especially heavy business users. The color LCD screen is huge compared to i730 and i830. Apparently Nextel had to reduce screen size in order to reduce phone size. That is one thing I miss in i830. I never had a problem with i95 size since it weighs about 5 oz. Great phone and I could not believe Nextel would discontinue it. *Note: I have an extra i95 for sale. It was my personal phone and in very good condition with some scratches. It is fully operational, travel charger and holster, shipping in USA included for flat $120.00. I will accept paypal only. Please email me if interested at leel1@netscape.com.
...IS THE I95CL...I BOUGHT MINE FROM A NEXTEL STORE...THE PHONE IS AWESOME...THE CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOWEVER...IS HORRENDOUS...I ACTUALLY WAS ONLY ABLE TO SPEAK WITH ONE REPRESENTATIVE IN AMERICA FOR A DISCREPANCY IN MY BILL...OUT OF 4 CALLS...AND THE AMERICAN CUSSED AT ME AND TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD THE ABILITY TO SHUT OFF MY SERVICE...THATS FINE...NOW THAT I BOUGHT THE DATA CABLE IM ABLE TO TRANSFER MY NEXTEL SOFTWARE TO BOOST...VIVA LA REVOLUCIONE!!!
I have this phone for about 10 months.  The calls are clear in many places where I can't get my other service to work. I have dropped it numerous times on our concrete driveway and never had a problem other than a few scratches from the impact.  A few weeks ago I even dropped it in our pool.  As it stopped working, I called a local authorized repair shop and they told me it could not be repaired.  To save the $200 they wanted to charge me for a new phone and sign up to a new contract, I open it up and dried it well and a couple of days later it was working as before. This is the best phone I ever had!
phone is very nice, just had few problems with speaker not working.had repaired twice in 6 mouths. phone is very nice comfortable to use.....
I've only had this phone a few weeks but so far i love it. The internet connection is so much faster than any other phone i've had. Nextel's customer service has been fantastic so far with set up and number porting. This phone is durable and surpisingly comfortable. The speaker phone is wonderful, ive used it twice and works great. The only thing that this phone could use, is a quick alarm. You have to use the calendar feature to set an appt and reminder in order to use your phone as an alarm. Other than that...it's the best phone and service i've ever had.
I have owned several phones with many wireless service providers.  Nextel is a million miles ahead of the rest.  The Direct Connect feature is easy to use and instant, there are NO ROAMING charges at all, prices are very reasonable, phones are rugged, wireless web and email functions are easy to use and fast, battery holds charge for 2 or more days on this COLOR phone (that is some kind of miracle as other color phone I have had have to be charged at least once a day), and it is comfortable to hold and use.  The blue lighted buttons are cool and easy to use in the dark and the full color display is just excellent with many downloadable wallpapers, ring tones, and java applications. The speaker phone is crystal clear as is the push to talk fuctionality.  The customer service department is fast, polite and effective.  I have never had a phone or service that is so pleasing and easy to use overall.  I also looked at bringing several of my family member's cell numbers to Nextel, and found out they had the lowest by far of any cell phone companies complaints about transferring phone numbers!  Definitely a keeper and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE!

This phone is not only feature-loaded, have the latest Wireless-Web features, a full color-display and a push-to-talk button, but it looks like a 'sports car' the finish on this phone is very smooth, and the colors on the front-flip look incredible. Its not as rugged as some of the other phones, but its added-bulky-size will help it sustain damage from drops and shocks. This is probably the best Nextel phone to date, Look for it on Ebay if you cant find it anywhere else, its worth the money. On the other hand, it can be a bit bulky, however the extra size makes it so you can easily use it in one hand, which is nice, and there is no Camera on it. (Which is a shame, because it already has the beautiful LCD Screen) However, these are no biggies, and if your looking for a Nextel phone, im confident this is 'the phone' to have.
The i95 is a great phone, it is fully equipped and has speakerphone with a color screen! It takes no longer than 5 sec. to get on the net!And it has a feature called Java Apps which is very cool!  I mainly got it because all of my friends have nextels, and because of the walkie-talkie feature which is great!Nextel has exellent service, and there are no roaming charges. It works everywhere I go. And there is great customer service.I used to have AT&T which had horrible service,bad phones,and terrible customer service.I'm so glad that I got the i95 from nextel and so would you.
Great phone alot better then sprint! Setting it up with the 800 # Well let's say pack a LUNCH! It took me 4 hours on the phone, and six different people to get connected! They need alot of work on that! After all said and done great phone, great coverage, walkie talkie feature breaks up now and then, but is really quick talking back and forth.No alarm clock? would be nice! if had to activate again would take it to a nextel dealer to do it instead of calling it in! nice pic on colored screen, games look nice.thinking of an upgrade to the i730, GPS but no alarm clock? a full feature phone with GPS to take you anywhere but NO alarm clock to wake you up  when your there? I go camping and 4 wheeling where the GPS would come in handy and so would the ALARM CLOCK! think they might get the message and make it a downloadable  feature! HOPE THIS HELPS!
first, this phone feels huge.  I carry it in my pocket every day, but I wish it was half as thick.  That said, I've had the phone for a little more than a year and it works perfectly.  I've dropped it several times, left it in a hot car, etc and never had a problem.  I did buy a second battery when I purchased the phone, and one of the two batteries died after about a year.  I just charge it every 36 hours or so and I've usually got plenty of power.  I use the Java apps, I use their browser, mostly to check movies, and I use it with a short cable to connect to my iPaq.  Everything works great.  But it still feels like a brick -- I heard a comedian say that cell phones are the only thing men will brag about theirs being smaller...
I got this phone by signing up with Working Assets (Sprint network) last August.  The phone does well for basic features like address book, calling, and calendar.  It has a nice monochrome display and the caller ID line can be read with the phone closed.  Additionally, you can turn off the ringer with the exterior volume button, allowing you to easily cut off a call you don't want to take.  It doesn't have any fancy screen or internet stuff, but that wasn't an issue for me.My original phone did break because the D-pad got jammed.  It was replaced for free and I've had no problems since.  The reception hasn't been great, particularly indoors, but when I'm inside I usually have a land line around anyway.  There does seem to be this weird 1-second delay in speaking, a problem I've had with both phones, so I'm not sure if it's a Sprint issue or the phone itself.  You kind of adjust after a while.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the phone.
1. not many features-no texting, you can only recieve texts from the internet. Also no internet.2. Horrible reception. When your talking you miss words that people are saying when in bulidings.3. calls dont always make it to you. people have called me and i dont know it until i get a voicemail which is very fustrating. It rings once and goes to voicemail.-dont buy this phone, you get what you pay for!
I brought a LG1200 last summer and hadno problem with it.I like because it smalland  I  can put it in my pants pocketno belt clip needed  for this phone.I use it everyday at work and  the  callsare crystal clear.
I have had no problems with this phone.  I use it quite frequently and have had no problems with it.  I think if you take care of the phone and use it in a normal fashion, the phone will last as long as any other phone, and I have tried a lot of phones!  The flip phone is great as it allows you to save the life of the key pad.  I would reccomend this product, and feel very comfortable in doing so.  I think most of the problems arise from the carrier and how helpful they are in correcting problems.  Choose the right company and you will be happy! I chose a wireless carrier with a Month-to-Month option and can cancel service anytime without any cancellation fees.  Maybe that's the way to go.
Nice compact size, but..........display faded within weeks of initial use. the AC adapter also died suddenly.  I think the manufacturers and Sprint have noticed, so they replace it with the Samsung A460 instead. Can't stand the A460 either - features too cumbersome to use. Anyway, avoid, avoid, avoid, no matter how cute it looks.
I've had this phone since last August when I moved to Annandale-on-Hudson, NY as I was told Sprint's service went there. Verizon is really better if you're in this area, thoughl. Sprint is okay, but it's hard to get service indoors.The phone itself is ok. I got it for free when I bought it here at amazon and signed a year contract. I haven't had the battery issues some of these other reviewers have, but my outside display is missing several lines making it impossible to read. I've heard this is a common problem. I also use my phone for long conversations with parents and friends at home and the phone gets quite hot if you talk on it for more than 30 minutes. It's nice that it's flip though so that the buttons and screen don't get messed up and it's pretty hardy - I've dropped mine a few times.If you can get this phone for free, it's good - it has the basic functions and a nice alarm (with snooze) in the calendar function and has a big address book with multiple listing, so you can have two mobile, two office, and two home numbers for one person.
I just bought this phone to replace a broken one and much to my dismay it doesn't have wireless web or text messaging capability!
I've had this phone for just a little over a year. The display screen has totally faded, which means that I no longer have an exterior caller ID, which really sucks. I took the phone to Sprint to see what they could do and they told me I was just slightly out my warranty  and I could 1. get a new phone or 2. get the insurance, wait a few weeks and then send in a $35 deductible for a replacement. Well I don't think so. I'm switching to VERIZON. SPRINT REALLY REALLY SUCKS. They don't do anything to keep their customers happy.
-poor reception-misses calls even when it is "in range"Generally cheap.  My display has accumulated debris inside the phone so I can't clean it out and it is difficult to read.  When talking to someone it cuts in and out.Paying anything for this phone is throwing money away.  A cell phone company should offer 50% off since the phone only works some of the time.
I have only had this phone for six months.  I am not a "heavy" cell phone user and only charge the battery when I'm down to 1 or 2 bars. I am having a problem that is sporadic;  the battery indicates full charge however when I turn it off and on again the battery will suddenly drop from full charge to "empty" (no charge at all).  In my opinion there seems to be a problem in the "on/off"  button.  I have phoned Sprint to ask if they are aware of any design problems;  their employees say, "yes, but not exactly like that, but you can bring it in if you want to."  I will make the trip to the nearest Sprint store (about 40 miles away) as I do not feel secure that this phone is reliable.  I have spoken with two other people who have stated they were not satisfied with "LG" models in general and upgraded to a better phone.  I wonder if this is a case of "premature" planned product obsolescence?
I have up front experience with this phone I is no good
AT&T uses two frequencies for GSM service.  Originally they only used GSM1900 but as the old analog and TDA 850 MHz networks are made obsolete they are being converted to GSM850.  The SX56 supports GSM1900 (and GSM900 for roaming in Europe) but not the newer GSM850 service.  As time goes on AT&T will enhance their GSM850 coverage but there are reports that they've done all they're going to do to improve GSM1900 coverage.  So if you're lucky your service will be OK but if you have any signal issues with this phone it won't get any betterI have the TMobile version of this phone and it works well on the TMobile network since TMobile only uses GSM1900 across North America.  But this SX56 version of the phone is sold "locked" to only operate on AT&T's network.This is a problem with many AT&T GSM phones but it's particularly an issue with the SX56 because there aren't any suitable replacements (yet) with comparable functionality that support GSM850.
I love my sx56, I have taken it everywhere, snowboarding, skydiving, beach, everywhere.  Mine has never broken, in fact it is the sturdiest cell phone I've ever owned.  Once I upgraded it to the Windows Mobile 2003 OS it was even better.  All the cool standard software was great.  Plus I added the Microsoft Voice Command software and can make calls to all my outlook contacts by pushing one button and saying "Call so and so home", you don't even have to train or record the voice commands, it does it all by voice recognition!
This is an excellent choice if you need to do lots of email and sometimes check attachments while on the road. Also good for sms and messenger, as it is easier to input text in the screen with the stylus than with the tiny keys of regular phones. But if your needs are more about reading email (not answering it) and having calendar and contacts synchcronized with your server or PC, a smartphone or any other new generation phone is a bettter choice because of the form factor. The big size is a price you have to be willing to pay for the luxury of working confortable in a bigger screen.Agree with all the other reviews, the AT&T service is bad, but I have found that this phone has much better reception than the Orange smartphone and Motorola smartphones in the AT&T network.If you are a frequent Intl traveler, be aware this is not a tri band phone... check the networks of the places you travel more frequently before buying this.
This phone bills itself as "international" with two GSM bands, but on a recent trip to London and Dubai I could not get it to work at all and had to revert to my tri-band Sony Ericsson Ti68, so if you travel out of the USA think twice!  Also, on weekends, I found the added size of the SX-56 needless and reverted to my smaller phone.  Windows CE is less intuitive than the Palm OS - CE does not prompt for confirmation of entries, leaving you wondering if they were accepted.  One great feature of the SX-56 is the speakerphone ability, not common in a handheld - but overall I would say stick with a Palm plus a small mobile phone.
I bought this phone directly from AT&T for 99.00 USD. And I love it, recently Siemens posted free upgrade to WM 2003. The best feature which I like during my limited use (less than week) is to take notes while talking to someone. I dont think this is possible in any other phone (unless you have PDA phone). Reception of AT&T in my area is pretty good so no issue with coverage. The only reason for giving 4 star is less memory and little bit big size than normal phone (but yes this is not a normal phone).
Terrific phone for business folks on the go.  All the connectivity and apps you need in one hand.  let me take that back.  you actually do need 2 hands for perfect performance.  That is the only thing I do miss.  But am willing to sacrifice due to the great display.  Was lost in Jersey last week, connected to internet, found directions and phone to the location, made the call and then was able to jot down notes.  Hopefully with Cingular trying to acquire ATT it will speed up the improvement of the GSM service coverage.  As you all know ATT is spotty, when the coverage is good it is good when it ain't it is horrible.  Would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to eliminate their PDA, synch with outlook, and access email/internet while on the go.Would have been 5 stars if ATT service was better.  But let's admit it, they all stink.
This phone is amazing, it is God's gift to us. It does everything I want in a phone and much much more. Sure it a little bit big but what can you say it performs a million functions. Listen I have had my share of phone, is by far the best. All I have to say is what more can you ask for....
I've owned this phone for about 18 months and if I hadn't paid so much for it I would have taken a hammer to it long ago.  Even in the center of a large town I get lousy signal strength; people can't hear me and I can't hear them.  The PDA works well and I bought it so I could carry my calendar and contacts with me and dial them directly with one tap...nice features, well worth the $700+ I paid...IF I could get a signal.  Now I have learned this is because this phone doesn't work on the "third" GSM band.
Don't bother buying this phone unless you get it cheap! battery replacement is $216 thru Siemens repair depot only. This phone is a real orphan. Talk about a short life cycle!!!I bought mine 2+ years ago and gave up on the phone portion (GSM coverage was lousy). With all the hype about good coverage I switched from TDMA phone back to GSM. Coverage is still bad. What is worse the battery doesn't hold much of a charge now and can't handle PDA and celular functions. As per the above, Siemens wants $216 to replace it plus a nominal 10 day turn around. AT&T; / Cingular wants to know nothing!
I bought two of these, one for my wife and one for me.  It was so large, heavy, and difficult to use the numbers to dial the phone, my wife didn't like hers.  Therefore, when the VERY FRAGILE glass on the screen broke on mine after 5 months, I took hers.  The glass broke on the seconed one after 3 months.  I was just using it for normal calendar checking and phone calls - nothing rough.  Stay away from this phone.  BTW, it cost me $100 to purchase and they quoted $300 to repair.  ATT doesn't sell them anymore.
Used to have a PDA in one pocket, a cell phone in the other with a pager on my belt and my mp3 playet in my top pocket. In a word it sucked big time.This got it all into one device, and my monthly bill went to $60.00.40 for the phone and 20 for data on Tmobile.Best thing I ever bought!!
The sanyo 8100 is the flagship phone for Sprint's PCS network, with a plethora of features and lots of style points. As far as I know this phone will ONLY work with SPRINT - so keep that in mind. This is probably the reason many reviewers have chosen to factor the sprint service into thier ratings and into their reviews, which makes some sense, however keep in mind that the quality of service given by a particular provider varies greatly by region.When first looking at the phone you'll notice it's very compact, and also very stylish. the design is top notch, it not only looks good but is very functional. The flip (clam shell) design is put to good use, with a smaller LCD on the outside and a main LCD on the inside. Both of these displays are color and fairly crisp. The outter LCD is used for caller ID as well as displaying wristwatch-like info (time, signal strength etc) while not being used. Buttons are a bit cumbersome for people with big fingers... but that's the case with most cell phones anyway. Navigating the menus is fairly intuitive, although entering letters and characters in the dark is a problem.This phone is PACKED with features. You can browse the web in full color. However to anyone who hasnt used the web on a cell phone yet, dont expect an experience ANYWHERE near what you get on your computer. The small screen and akward charachetr input methods make surfing the www less of a hobby and more of a chore. That said this feature can be immensley useful. The phone has a built in camera, which takes decent, albeit small, photos. You can then email these pictures to friends straight form the phone, or you can opt to use them as "photo caller id" (the picture will display on the LCD when a certain person in your phone book calls. You can also customize your phone with full color wallpaper, animated characters, nice sounding polyphonic ringers, and a variety of games - all downloadable on the net, some for a cost however. There's also some built in aps such as a calendar with limited PIM functionality, a phone book that can store upto 300 entries, each with upto 7 numbers, an email addy and a web addy, there's a calculator, a world clock, and you can download aditional aps to provide a whole number of other uses and features (such as aps that use the phone's location features to give "onstar" like functionality). Of course there is text messaging, voice memos, and a bunch more.You can use the web through sprint's PCS vision service to send/recieve email, or log onto AIM, MSN messenger, or yahoo messenger. This is a great convenience, but seeing as how none of these interfaces are very user friendly, and character typing is a pain - you'll quickly realise that this is more for use when you need to tell someone something really quick rather than recreational chatting. With AIM, the messages take a long time to load and it's a bit tedious to use because of the web based interface - too bad there isnt a downloadable ap for it, or built in capabillities, either or which would have improved performance vastly.The phone's battery life is good, but not great, happily thanks to the travel charger you can talk while the phone is plugged in and/or charging. The antena extends to help you get a better signal, and the phone works on both digital and analog networks for roaming. The ringer and reciever are loud, which is good. A number of settings will probably overwhelm you at first, but offers a lot of power and flexabillity.The only draw back is that the phone is directly tied to sprint, so if you dont like sprint, you wont have a good experience here (remember cell phone provider service quality completely depends on where you live). Sprint offers good plans and decent (though not great) coverage, though they like to nickel and dime you any chance they get, (PCS vision package is requiered for picture sending, email and or web access). The quality of the sprint network varies, call quality is ussually very good, but dropped calls can be a bit of a problem, particularly while on the go. Also if you want to synch ur phone with your computer you'll need to buy a kit to do so, however this kit also supposedly will allow you to use your phone as a mobile modem for a laptop - very cool.All in all, I love this phone, and only have a handful of minor complaints or reservations about it. I havent seen a more complete, feature rich phone yet.
I bought this phone two months ago. It is very nice as a phone - compact, light, with enough volume in the headset so I can hear it with the car top down (but not at 80 mph!). The keyboard is logical and lightly backlit. All the set up and control functions can be accessed at the press of a button.It has lots of really nice features. The 1.8" screen is bright and colorful, with good resolution. It has a built in camera which takes fairly good pictures which you can use as your screen's background. You can also e-mail and upload the pictures if you pay for the service. The battery lasts forever. The phone has PCS web access. You can also download games and programs to make the phone more functional. It has a built in calculator. You can use it as a modem if you purchase a USB cable and software (which Sprint no longer provides). You can upload the pictures to Sprint's web cite and then e-mail them. The pictures you take or d/l can be displayed as four to a screen thumbnails.So, what's the catch? "Sprint" charges for everything. And the contract is for two years. You can upload pictures, backgrounds, ringers and software from your computer -- if you buy for the cable and software, which Sprint no longer supplies, but I can't find software to d/l my pictures directly to the computer. (The cable and software can be purchased separately, but not together! There are three sets of software -- again each sold separately!) If you want access to your pictures, you have to upload them to Sprint's web cite, and then download. Sprint charges for this service. I bought a USB cable to try to use the phone as a modem. I used it for a very short period, and had my phone turned off the next day because I ran up a bill of $80.00. In some ways, it is kind of offensive. At least they reversed the charge because I had two months free trial!  And trying to get through to customer service to get them to correct the problem is an impossibility.
I've been on Sprint for about 5 yr. now. I was using the Samsung 3500 and had issues with reception. A friend told me to go with the Sanyo 8100. I have had the phone for a week now and it has some great features, but in my opion the audio sounds pretty bad.The earpiece is very muffled and the calls I make, sound like they are under water or phase shifting. My old Samsung sounded much better.The problem with Samsung is reception. Why can't these guys get together? The pics from the 8100 are pretty fuzzy, but I don'tcare about that, I won't be using that feature very much. I want good sounding audio and really good reception. I guess you can't get both in one phone. I was going to try the Samsung VGA1000 but many of the reviews I have seen talk about how "hot" the phone gets. Nothing kills electronics faster than heat. I have also heard it doesn't have that good of reception. I guess there are always going to be trade offs. BTW, the leather case for the 8100 will box your ears! It's stitched with very hard thread. Ouch! On the plus side the 8100 is a nice, easy to use phone. Voice recognition is great and reception seems good. Pysically, it's nice and small, but chubby. I guess they all have their +/-. If you find the perfect phone, let us all know! Good luck.
I have used pretty much all Samsung phones while being on the Sprint PCS service. When I switched to the Sanyo 8100, I was amazed by the quality of it. The outside feels very smooth, not rough like the Nokia-Series phones. Secondly, almost every single aspect of this phone is customizable, right down to the phones 'Power On\Off Sound' The cameras reaction time can be a bit slower than some of the other phones in its class, and you have to hold the camera still about 3 seconds before you snap the picture, but other than that, the pictures look great! You can easisly upload them to your own personal Sprint PCS Website, e-mail them, or instantly send them to other PCS Vision users.Then theres PCS Vision, which in one word is, Awesome. I signed on, and almost flipped when I was watching movie trailers on the thing, with full-sound comming out the rear-speaker, and decent, full color video appering on the screen. They even have news, sports, entertainment and other movie-clips you can view on the phone. And, for an extra 9.99 a month you can get a service called MobiTV, you can get TLC, Discovery, MSNBC, CNBC, ABC News Live, College Sports TV, CMC, IMN, cNet TV, the list doesnt end. Try getting that on Verizon! Check it out at [...]Sprint PCS Service can be shakey in some areas, but I tend to get good to great call quality wherever I go (Most people cant tell im calling them from a cell phone) The phone is a little bulky in the pocket, but nothing crazy. I'd have to say, this is qutie the phone. Hope this helps!
i love this phone. a few years ago i knew a guy who had a phone with internet service. it was a big and bulky thing, like a shoebox, almost. the internet connection sometimes took 5 minutes. i thought it was so cool.i didn't know what cool was. the bright color screen of this phone is very vibrant and contains good-sized text. all kinds of different ring tones can be downloaded. from tones to actual songs, it's an awesome feature, but you cannot prelisten to the tones before you download them. that is a real letdown. i downloaded "diff'rent strokes" blindly and was very accepting of it's replicated melody. but when i downloaded "goodtimes" it sounded like a mixture of "cheers" and "taxi."photo quality is a notch less than average. about what you could expect from a celphone in this day and time, with no zoom. the feature of choosing different frames for your photos is cute and it's even better that you can email them to any address you have loaded.this is a phone review, so i won't talk about the sprint service as it is immaterial. let's just say that it could be better, but i won't count that against the phone.it's got a huge phone address databank and you can apply photos and rings to certain numbers. when my fiance' calls, her picture lights up on the screen with her "american pie" ringtone blaring. supercool.included is a calculator, calender with daily schedule alerts, a strong gaming system and lots of different applications that you can download, such as mapquest or the weather channel. if you're lost, the ability to pull up mapquest on your freakin' celphone is a godsend. the phone is compact and comes with pc connection inlets.with all these features, it manages to actually allow you to dial phone numbers and talk to people who also own phones. that helps too.AMENDMENT NOV. 18 2005.THIS PHONE'S BATTERY LIFE SUCKS! AND THE SCREEN GOES BAD AFTER A WHILE TOO.
The Phone is great, Sprint service is another issue. I, along with most people i know have had problems where sprint over bills them. Sprint really doesn't seem to care that they have a cronic overbilling problem. If u call and complain (after about 10-20 minutes on the phone with a rep) they do fix it, but u will have to watch your bill like a hawk and call monthly to get it adjusted. They really need to work on their customer service. They dont really seem to care about GOOD customer service.
The 8100 is still a great little phone but it's been out for over a year here in the States.  Sprint just rolled out the newer VM4500 (aka, Sanyo 5500) super-phone, with video recording, VGA-resolution (640x480) digital camera, nation-wide walkie-talkie (!!!), and speakerphone, plus all the other bells and whistles.  Check it out.  If you want a free Sprint PCS phone, get the SCP-8100.  If you are willing to spend money, get the VM4500.BTW, to address the customer service complaint, I've been a Verizon Wireless customer for 6 years, a Sprint PCS customer for almost 4 years, and have also used T-Mobile/Voicestream and AT&T; and Cingular, and let me tell you Sprint has the best service by far.  Only one slight billing error in 4 years, and they corrected it right away after I called.  Verizon over-bills me almost every six months and takes forever to credit me back.  T-Mobile's coverage and service are complete jokes; their only "virtue" is payback-after-rebate dirt-cheap phones.  Sprint PCS also has the best voice clarity by far; Verizon is the worst even though they do have the widest CDMA coverage.
I've had my phone for over 6 months.  Reception is generally good, with few dropped calls.  Coverage is mediocre at best (doesnt matter which provider).Disadvantages are: 1) handset gets really hot after phone conversations longer than 2 minutes2) Ringing volume (meaning from incoming calls) extremely LOW even at highest volume setting.  I mean you can hear the person you're speaking with loud and clear, but that's only IF you can hear the phone ring in order to answer it.  I have missed so many calls because I can't hear the phone ringing!!!3) Downloaded games don't work: I don't know if this is the service providers fault, or the phones, but I downloaded 2 games, and was able to play them only once!4) Backlighting of keys extremely poor, so that you have difficulty in dialling numbers in poorly lit conditions.
Being the type who said he would never have a cellular phone, my wife and I went ahead and took the plunge about a year ago and bought matching 8100s--and let me say we're now the converted.  This picture phone has paid for itself in so many different ways, including, but not limited to; international calling plan (SPRINT PCS) which has great quality of reception, been used in several emergency situations, the camera-function has allowed us to send fun and important photos back and forth.  The only complaint we have is that the battery tends to die quickly with a lot of use - and it does not give much warning before just shutting down.
Have used this phone for nearly a year.  Excellent battery life, lots of features, I find the menus very easy to use and the overall quality to be very good.  Have dropped it a few times, but it still works fine.Can't understand all the negative reviews. Voice quality is good, Cmaera is so-so, but it's a phone, not a camera.  I agree the the web service is slow, but again, it's a phone...And it does work. No, there are no fancy ringers for free, but I can tell when I get a call.  I'd buy another!
forget all those other camera phones.one of the best phonessprint ever carried. trust me get the 8100 you won't be disappointed!!
I have enjoyed using my Sanyo a lot. I switched from T-mobile just for this phone, even though I was happy w/ their service and had complaints about Sprint in the past. I realy wanted  small camera phone so that I would have a camera w/ me at any time. However, the resolution SUCKS! It is fine for attaching a picture of someone to a phone book entry, but other than that, the pictures are not worth it. It has some other cool features, though. I can plan events into my calendar and decide how far in advance to send a reminder as well as the ringtone for that reminder. The quality of the ringtones I can download is awesome! I had "Baby Boy" by Beyonce on there for awhile and people thought it was the radio.Most of my complaints have to do with Sprint. They charge $15 per month extra to be able to send the pictures to anybody or send text messages. They do give a $5 credit per month for downloading games and ringtones, though. However, the internet service is insanely slow and doesn't work half the time. You have to log on to the internet to send text messages and then it takes forever to type them in b/c there autotext is crap. Sprint also put a spending limit on my phone and if it gets even near that, they shut it off until I make a payment, even though my payments are always on time and I have never exceeded the limit. The other day my phone was going to voicemail automatically and telling people I was busy for no reason. The customer service rep was supposed to send me to technical support and sent me to collections where the lady was rude to me and told me I had to pay the bill for last month even though it was not due until the end of the current month and I hadn't even received the bill for it. If I could get out of the contract, I would, but it's $150. Bottom line: UNLESS YOU ARE DYING TO HAVE THIS PHONE, USE ANOTHER CARRIER!!!
Easy to use, easy to open one handed, more features than I had hoped for, very durable, and most importantly, great reception.  This phone kills the lg1010 I used previously.  The pictures are great for a phone, keeping in mind that it is a phone.
I have had many cellular phones and PDAs including the Samsung a500 w/detachable camera, Samsung phone with MP3 player,  T-Mobile Side-Kick, IPAC, and Palms V, VII and this by far dollar for feature is the best device.  It is very user-friendly and easily accessible to wireless web (semi-fast connection)- very easy to send msgs to internal and external addresses w/ the address storage feature in address-book.  For those who travel to remote areas,  the signal is a lot stronger than any of the Samsung/Panasonic/Nokia phones, so there are fewer dropped calls.  Also, the camera takes pretty good pictures, although auto-focus and flash would be helpful.  The voice attachment and frame options to picture-mail are nice features as well. I find myself using this device more than any of the above devices listed... It's just a really fun device with many cool features standardly installed.The only limitations include:1. the size - its alot more bulky than most phones/PDAcombos and the design is not as sleek as I would like2. the calendar - takes a long time to enter in data, as compared to the IPAC or Side-kick3. text msgs/emails- takes a lot longer to key in letters with the # keys.
On a whole, this is a good cell phone.  I've had this phone since 8/2003 and haven't had too many problems.  The camera is a nice toy, but the resolution is bad - the novelty of having a camera phone has worn off a long time ago for me.  Reception and call clarity are for the most part good.  The phone is a bit bulky - can't really put it in your jeans' pockets or in a small clutch/purse.  I usually don't have problems with calls until last night when my calls kept getting dropped - even though I had 4-5 signal bars.  According to Sprint, it might because they're doing software updates.  If this continues, I'm just changing carriers because my contract just ended about 3 days ago and they won't entice me into staying by giving me more minutes for the same price.
I should have paid better attention to the negative reviews for this phone. This phone has two major flaws. (1) Unless you place the phone over your ear in the exact spot, you can't hear the other person speaking..(2) Voices come over garbled and smashed. I am 'constantly' saying, "what? pardon me? I can't make out what you're saying!" What a waste of [money] (...) Don't waste another moment of your life looking at this phone. It will be discontinued like all the rest very soon! GUARANTEED!
I recently purchased the Sanyo SCP-8100 3G phone, and I am extremely pleased with it's performance and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a 3G phone that overperforms. The only things I would improve are it's lack of faxing ability(Sprint has it hardwired into the unit, so you can only dial #777 for it's data service) & I wish Sprint gave you more in the line of technical information ! I've had a Qualcomm QCP-2700 before,(also a very  good phone)and the throughput was limited to 19.2k, but now I am averaging at least 50-60k average with my SCP-8100, built in web browsing too. Not too bad, V.92+ speeds on a reliable CDMA 3G phone, and before I forget I have never gotten one dropped call either. Sanyo keep up the good work !!
i got this phone when it first came out; and at the time this was the lowest priced flip camera phone. i love the feel, and how easy it is to use. besides the fact that sprint's service is getting worse by the day, the only problems i am having with the phone is it gets hot when i'm on it for more than fifteen minutes, the battery life is a little below average, and it tends to shut off and turn back on by itself when i'm in the middle of using my vision service. the phone is decent, but i am pretty ticked about sprint service.
I bought it like 3 weeks ago, and I have no complains, it has a lot of great features, and you get what you've paid for!!
Purchased two of these in Jan 2004.  One, with very little use has one broken hinge and the other is going.  The other one is just a matter of time.  Must now return to Sprint store to see if they will replace it.  I have seen two other reviews on this phone on c-net with the same problem. (besides the post here)
Sure this phone is attractive, packed with great features, easy to use, has great battery life, is compact, and is basically everything you would want in a cell phone.  So what is the problem?  Quite simply, who cares what the phone can do for you if it is unusable as a phone?  The speaker volume is so loud that the speaker vibrates inside the case making carrying on a conversation with another person next to impossible.  All you can hear when someone is trying to talk with you, is the buzzing sound of the speaker rattling against the case.  This is with the speaker volume turned all the way down mind you.  I bought this phone, found it unusable, returned it for a replacement, and found the replacement just as bad.  Very soon I am going to throw this phone away and get a new one.  Will I get another Sanyo?  I doubt it.
This is the second phone that I have owned.  I don't like my phone.  Here's why:-When I answer the phone, I have to wait about 1-2 seconds before I can talk or else the other person does not hear me.-The sound is too loud.  I tried to turn down the volume to the lowest, but it is still too loud.-The whole hinge broke after about 8 months.  I have trouble opening and closing the phone.
After purchasing this phone with extended warrenty from Radio Shack and owning it for less than 9 months, the hinge on the antena side broke.  When it was sent in to be fixed UNDER WARRENTY I received a call back stating that the part was NOT covered and that even though the phone showed no signs of abuse that it was my fault that the hinge broke.  It looks to be a factory defect on that side after speaking with the Sprint store in town, however it has not been recalled... I would NOT recommend getting this phone unless you can afford to be with out a phone for 2 weeks while the company gives a poor reason as to why they can't repair it under warrenty. For the company to repair the phone it will cost $76.00. I am in the process of reading back through the warrenty and sales slip. Ultimately, I will be shopping for a different phone in the near future.
I received this phone from Sprint as a replacement for an LG 5350 which the Sprint store "killed" while doing a firmware upgrade.  The only good thing I can say about this phone is the reception is generally excellent.  The Sanyo software is really awfull compared to Samsung & LG - you can have only 8 speed dials!  They told me it came with an "extended" battery.  I thought the battery life looked good until I actually made a couple of 20-minute calls, then bam - the battery is dead.  The battery gets quite warm after about 5 minutes of talking.  The camera is not something I really care about.  It is kind of cool though to have a person's picture pop up when they call you.  The ringers are lousy (they're all that way now as they want you to pay to download ringers).
The phone itself is a 5-star. The user interface is easy to use. The screen is bright. Battery prolongs several days on one charge. It receives better signal.The customer service is pretty bad, though. In fact, my wife is talking to their customer service when I write this review and it's been 2.5 hours on the phone and 1.5 hours in the SprintPCS store, let alone the time to get to the store. It was the technical support department that shed light on the issue which was customer service department's responsibility. Probably you want to call technical support department instead of customer service department when you have issues.Overall, a great phone with poor customer service.
I have own the Sanyo cellphone for a month now, and it has been a horrible month for me to use this cellphone.  Voice transmitted is distorted and therefore whenever somebody calls me, I have to put the cellphone very close to my ear, listen to the mumbling voice and make a guess on each word, and it hurts my ear after I make a five minutes short conversation.  I have adjusted the receiver level to the highest level, but it does not help.I will not buy a Sanyo cellphone anymore and I will try to sell this cellphone as soon as possible.
ok, i bought this phone in may and i already hate it. The reception is good but thats about it. The menus on this phone are very confusing and it only comes with one wallpaper:flowers. Now i am a boy and i dont want flowers on my phone.I dont like how it is so hard to open either, and its really ugly. The Keys are poorly backlit and pre-loaeded ringtones sound like they were made for old people. And the music ringtones sound awful and they are distorted. I am going with t-mobile and thier motorola v300 as soon as i get my money back for this peice.
I just bought this phone about a week ago and it works great.  Very easy to use.  Camera works much better than my previous phone.  The only thing that bothered me was the reception is not that good.  You also have to connect online to write a text message.  Overall, a good phone.
I HATE THIS PHONE! I had this phone for two days then i got rid of it and i got the Samsung VGA1000. this phone just plan old sucks. the cameras pictures dont look good at all, the back ground on the main screen wouldnt change, infact the phone is just ugly to. I'l say it again I HATE THIS PHONE! it doesnt even deserve one star!
I'm surprised how many other reviewers liked this phone. I can't imagine that they've actually used it much. This phone suffers from poor usability all over: It's a little too slick to hold, it's hard to open with one hand, it's hard to hear unless you hold it just the right way to your ear, the reception is awful (this is compared to a cheaper phone at the same place and time on the same Sprint network), the menuing system is clunky, and it uses it's sloooowww web interface to compose email (including SMS texting... it takes 10 to 20 seconds just to get into the message editor).This is just one of those products that you know the makers don't actually use themselves. It would take a lot of convincing to get me to try another Sanyo product after this experience. I may just go back to Nokia.
The best phone ever dont waste your money .nokia,motorola or exetera thi is the phone you want to by folow my advice.
I've been using Nokia and Samsung phones over 2 years. One day my buddy who works for Sprint told me to dump my phone. I thought Sprint and its phone were bad, but now I realize that I was totally wrong. This phone kicks Samsung's ass! Great reception, good camera, unlimited internet access, and lots of cool apps. Most excellent thing is that you can watch TV(w/extra fees) Overall this is one of the greatest wireless phone out there.
The phone may have been good, I would have found out if Sprint ever activated my service. After more than five weeks of waiting for them to transfer my cell phone number from another carrier and literally spending hours on the phone (mostly on hold) with them I gave up and cancelled. I routinely spent over an hour on hold to speak to a customer service agent, who could never actually resolve anything, although some did share that it is common with them to take more than 30 days to transfer phone numbers. I had heard Sprint had poor customer service, and now wish I had taken it seriously.
....I would have to agree with most of them.In the interest of saving you some time (if you choose not to read all of the reviews), the phone itself is of excellent quality, well-designed with aluminum and high-quality plastic construction.The T616 has almost all the features you might want, probably more than you are going to use. Lacking is speakerphone capability and the ability to see the screen in bright sunlight.One reviewer suggested getting a quality Krusell case for the phone and I agree. What nobody mentioned is that you can get free (no charge at the time this review is being written) incoming daily alerts for news, weather, sports, etc from mobile.msn.com. (Go to the web site and input your cellphone number and specify when and which alerts you want.)Of course, no phone is any better than the network it is on, and your mileage may vary. For me, living in NYC, I get excellent reception from my 27-floor apartment building. I've also used the phone upstate and had perfect reception there in what would be called "the country".So what's not to like?Customer service. As you will find in some of the reviews, mostly going back a few months, ATT had embarked on a project to "upgrade" their customer service capabilities. For _months_ nothing worked right. The customer service reps couldn't find the information you needed to know and, worse, you couldn't even access the ATT web site to find something as basic as minutes used. (Yes, you can also find minutes used through the M-mode feature...and be billed for data charges.)Now a suggestion, and I am being deadly serious, before you consider the phone and the network, I want you to make a phone call to ATT Wireless Customer Service. If you are pleased with the time that it takes to get through to a human who can answer your questions, fine. Otherwise, consider another service.I hope this review helps in you making your decision and I thank you for reading it.
Pros:- Very stylish design- Excellent connectivity options, including fantastic Bluetooth implementation- Very good battery life- Automatic timer-based keypad lock- Highly portableCons:- So-so signal reception- Poor LCD quality -- virtually impossible to read outdoor- No EDGE, no speakerphone- Slipperly chassis, prone to finger prints- Calendar lacks all-day events- Comparatively dated UI is slow at times- Keys can be small for larger hands- Somewhat high radiationT616 is AT&T's version of highly popular T610. Generally speaking, T616 is better suited for US residents than T610, which had generally worse RF reception on 1900 MHz GSM than T68i that it replaces. T616's reception should be comparable to T68i now. It is worth noting, however, T616 drops the 900 MHz GSM band popular in Europe while adding 800 MHz GSM.While T68i wasn't exactly lauded for RF reception quality, it was adequate. In areas with good to excellent signals (3 to 5 bars), T616 should be equally capable of high quality phone conversations. But deep inside the building where 1900 MHz signals have trouble penetrating or in areas where signal is low, T616 will generally perform poorly. For instance, Nokia 3650 sounded fine in areas where T616 stuttered or dropped out entirely.Signal quality aside, T616 is a good phone. If anything, it is arguably one of the best looking phones. While slightly larger than T68i, it is still strikingly thin and tiny. Turn the phone on, however, you may be disappointed by dim LCD output. It is virtually unusable outdoor. You must vary the angle of the phone to see anything even with backlight turned on.The UI sports pretty icons rendered with rich color. However, it remains largely unchanged from T68i, which could be positive to former Sony Ericsson users, but disappointing for those wanting latest and greatest. Worse, rapid key strokes will cause T616 to lag quite a bit.It would be unfair to ignore T616's greatest asset: Bluetooth. Whereas Nokia and other manufacturers add Bluetooth as a mere marketing feature (poor Bluetooth signal quality, incomplete support for many Bluetooth devices), Sony Ericsson took the time to do it right. It will sync and communicate with pretty much all applicable Bluetooth devices out there with virtually all the functionalities intact. It also syncs beautifully with Apple's iSync software.Although built-in camera results in decent enough pictures for MMS or quick email, it will not replace standalone digital camera. Considering 99.9% of the camera phones are also poor, I will not single out T616 for this weakness.It is worth noting that upcoming T630 will fix much of T616's ongoing issues: much brighter LCD, larger keys, less slipper body, and improved RF reception. The chassis is resigned a bit, which sort of resembles Apple's iPod look and feel.
I bought this phone after having an SE T68i, and before that a Motorola StarTAC clamshell. They were both great phones for their time, and the T616 is pretty much in the same class.As soon as I bought my PowerBook two years ago, I thought it would be neat to be able to use Address Book for my cell phone. When Apple released Bluetooth support, I bought a dongle and got the T68i. I loved it. It was small, it was sleek, it had a color screen, and there was never anything I couldn't do with it. It had one fatal flaw: A volume slider on the left hand side. Which broke off. And which was going to cost $100 to repair.So I bought the T616, and was awestruck as soon as I got it. I'm kind of a gadget fanatic, and this phone is great for me. The screen is amazing, beautifully crisp and colorful. The body is only a tiny bit bigger than the T68i, but actually feels a little smaller. The Java games support probably strikes most people as slow and mundane, but I love the idea, and the games available for the T616 are better than I ever saw for the T68i. And of course, it can still synchronize with iCal and Address Book, something I love. The camera is kind of fun, even if the lens is awful. I have no idea what use a camera which can only take (approx.) 300x200 photos is, but hey, why not?I can't speak to mMode because AT&T;'s pricing is beyond ludicrous. Although if they'd ever just get Mapquest service I might just pay for their insane $8 plan (the $3-plus-per-kilobyte plan is a major rip-off). I'm told the phone does not have the greatest WAP browsing, although having used the T68i's once or twice I can't imagine anything feeling sluggish in comparison.The OS is actually much easier than most people think, once you get the hang of it. The trick is to remember where the icons go and to always check the contextual menus. Once you do that, you can do almost anything without thinking very hard on the T616.There is only one thing I dislike about the phone and its design. The fact that there are two buttons which can SOMETIMES have overlapping functions ('Back' and either the left or right side top button, depending) and that the left and right side buttons don't have predefined functions drives me insane. I'm always clicking on the wrong one, with, yes, predictable hilarity resulting.I'll give the T616 a two-thumbs-up review any day of the week. If you want to sync wirelessly with iCal and Address Book and want something that fits in your pocket, this phone is your best bet.
The most important features for me were long battery life and customization. I really didnt place an emphasis on a camera-phone when purchasing.Pros:1. Customization - Can have distinctive ring tone and image for each person that calls you.2. Tranfer Files - I transfer images and midi files via the infrared port on my laptop all of the time. Just change the setting of the phone to "infrared" and place near the laptop, and the laptop identifies the phone immediately. No need for cables or to pay for Internet browsing capabilities on the phone. Just browse the Internet, download files to your laptop, and then transfer them over to the phone.3. Battery Life - The battery life on this phone is outstanding! When you aren't using the phone, it goes into standby mode that puts a minimal drain on the battery.4. Volume - Flexibility with volume control. You can make it relatively loud or quiet.Cons:1. Pictures - Resolution of the pictures is not that great. The Samsungs and LG phones have better built-in cameras.2. Exterior - The exterior of the phone is susceptible to scratches and nicks. It is difficult to keep the phone looking like new.3. Screen Visibility - When out in daylight, it is very difficult to see the contents on the screen.4. Keys are a bit on the small side.5. Midi files - my only wish for this phone is that it played mp3's instead of midi files.Please note: If you do get this phone, do not forget to enable the "key lock" feature. This is because when you place the phone in your pocket, it can make calls to other people on your phone list without you knowing of it.Also, I deleted most of the standard ring tones and pictures so that I can make space for the tones and pictures that I like.
i'm quite pleased with the t616 i got with my ATT GSM wireless plan. the plan itself works well, we have the usual disdain for ATT wireless' customer service, but the phone itself works well. i'm finding the ATT network to be superb stateside, and it also works globally. i've tested mine in england, switzerland, the netherlands, malaysia, and taiwan (as well as canada). works like a champ in all. it will not work in japan, however, which is known to be the case with a tri-band GSM phone.the phone's buttons work well for people with small fingers (i'm one of them), so keep that in mind. it fits snugly in my pocket, has stood up to many miles of travel and use, and the battery keeps a decent charge.picture quality is pretty weak, grainy pictures and someodd colors. but that's what you get when you use a phone as a camera ...the ringtones are annoying, luckily you can find them online for free (ie myt610.net). all i want is my old nokia basic ring!i've been using bluetooth to move pictures and sounds around, not mMode or anything fancy. it works flawlessly with Mac OS X and random PC bluetooth adapters. i haven't used the GPRS service, so i can't comment on it. i do like the integrated task minder, i'm making heavy use of it.for a small, clear, feature rich phone, this is a strong contender for anyone's needs.
I purchased this phone with Cingular service two months ago and I have really liked the Bluetooth and Calendar features.The form factor is great and easily slips in a pocket. It is smaller than my old flip phone and does not have any antenna to poke out.  I'm a bit concerned that the screen will get scratched over the years.I use Microsoft Outlook on my work ThinkPad which has built in Bluetooth.  Once I figured out that you configure the bluetooth as a serial device, I can now sync my contacts, calendar and task list with my phone.  This has allowed me to ditch my Palm and still have reminders for all my meetings.  The phone has a distinct ring as a meeting reminder.  It is a bit of a pain to add a meeting or task to the system, I'm not very fast entering text using the key pad, so I mostly use it as a read-only device.I have configured and used the wireless internet, it was a pain to setup and Cingular was no help.  I eventually found instructions on someone's personal web site.  I do not see myself using the web directly through the phone more that once in a great while.  The WAP browser is so limiting, every password you type takes a minute to enter via the key pad and the amount of info on the screen is tiny.  But if you need to check a flight status or movie schedule, you can if you are patient.I have a bluetooth IPAQ on order which may pair with the phone to make an acceptable browser, email platform.  The main capability I want is to be able to pull up an occasional email, the phone allows this in theory but sifting through my huge volume of email (50-60 per day) to find the ones of interest on that little screen is not practical.The reception works seems about as good as any other phone.I don't have any problem hearing but I understand the complaints that others have, the phone is so small that when the phone is up to your ear the microphone is against your cheek.The camera is very limited but it entertains my kids (I did not really want a camera phone so I don't care much about the quality).I have played with voice dialing and it works but is tedious to set up and I always feel stupid talking to the machine in public but in the car it is handy to call home without searching through the menus.One complaint is that whenever I drop the phone, it has fallen out of my shirt pocket a few times, the SIM gets dislodged and a message appears telling me that the SIM has dislodged "turn the phone off and on" but it won't let me power down the phone so I need to remove the battery to reset it.  The good news is the fall does not seem to damage the phone and once I reset it, everything works as normal (no data is lost).Some day I hope to have time wo write some JAVA utilities for the phone.  I'm a software engineer by trade.  Ericsson apears to be very open in allowing others to write tools for the phone.  You can download all of the developers kits from their site.  I beleive most other phones lock the average user out by charging for the info or by "locking" the phone to "uncertified utilities".  Even if you never plan to write your own software, I would not be supprised to see a large number of free applets come out for this phone over the next year based on the open-ness of the system.Pros:Good form factorBlue tooth is very handy for connecting to a computerSyncs well with outlookOpen programmes interfaceCons:A pain to set up for wireless data and bluetooth syncing.Open screen may scratchLimited web browsing support (more a function of all WAP phones)Needs the battery removed each time you drop it.
I went from a Samsung N200 with Sprint service to this T616 with AT&T and am soooo much happier!My Samsung was dropping calls, showing no signal strength, and cutting out so bad I could only hear every couple words of the conversation.So I got this phone and what a difference! The sound is crisp and CLEAR. It sounds like a land-line phone, unlike my Samsung which made conversations sound as if the phone was buried in a snowdrift or something.The phone aesthetically is much cuter than the picture makes it look.  It is small and thin and the color display is excellent!  It has more options than I need and the camera is quite decent considering it is built into a cell phone.  I love that I can take a picture of someone and add it to their profile so when the call me their picture comes up on the screen.It came with alot of ring tones, none of which I particularly enjoyed (save for the "antique telephone" ringing sound), so I downloaded one.  The sound quality itself is very good.If I had this to do all over again I would still buy this great little phone!
What ever you do - do not order ATT online.  I did and even ATT customer service has been unable to help me.  The first phone I got did not work - after many calls and twice as many hours I got a replacement phone, I also got a bill for the replacement phone but I am still waiting on a credit for the one that I sent back - it has been four months now.  Their problems resolution department acknowledged that they owed me a credit but said that they were getting the same run around from the online division and were powerless to do anything about it!  So I am out an extra $142 with no recourse.  They are scum - don't waste your money.
I never wrote a feedback about products I bought but my purchase from AT&T; was the worst since I was born:10/03/2003 I bought this phone online from AT&T;10/2003 An excellent phone but a terrible service, no coverage, they charge for SMS that was not delivered 30minutes waiting before you speak with customer service and above all they lie on you!10/29/2003 Decided to return it called customer service.11/20/2003-02/05/2004 Called several times as I never got a return label.02/13/2004 I got the return label and sent it back immediately asked customer service to process my refund.03/01/2004 Confirmed that I need a refund sent an email also they said 4-6 weeks needed for processing.04/02/2004 Spoke with Customer serv. They said 3 weeks needed. Faxed confirmation of all my info and my request for refund.04/28/2004 Spoke with Customer service they said 4-6 weeks needed, I reminded them that I spoke with them on 04/02/2004 they said ok then 2 more weeks need.05/10/2004 Customer service said 4-6 weeks for processing06/01/2004 Called again they said request was put in to cut a check on 05/24/2004 and it will take 2-4weeksMore than half a year since I am trying to close my account. I spent more than 14 hours on the phone trying to return this phone and get back my money. I have a thick pile of paper regarding my emails, faxes, calls.I switched to T-mobile: they are wonderful never had a problem better coverage....NEVER BACK TO AT&T.; Cingular should think twice before keeping this "brand name".
what interests me about all these reviews written is that people complain about the camera on the phone. keep in mind you bought a PHONE, not a CAMERA. what did you expect? sure, the pictures are crummy, but sheesh, did you think you were getting a 3MP camera? what people fail to remember is these are PHONES and ultimately, should be graded on reception, clarity of calls and customer service first. the rest of the junk they throw in (ringtones, wallpapers, etc.) are just things to distract from the fact that maybe your phone doesn't perform well, or reception is lousy in your area. it just seems like too many people have the attitude, "i get dropped calls all the time, but hey, i can hear "in da' club" by 50 cent when my boyfriend calls, so i guess i'm keeping it." but hey, it's your money. however, i am also a big fan of "if it's crap, take it back".here's my specs: i live in the quad cities, which borders iowa and illinois and have at&t; with GSM. i previously had their TDMA network (which was flawless, in my area) but knew they were phasing it out, so opted for the GSM network, which actually IS getting better in our area. i live in a kind of "dead area" for cell phone providers, so sprint, us cellular and verizon all lose reception in my apartment. the GSM network is fairly strong where i live (now) so no complaints there. here's my breakdown of the T616 on at&ts; GSM network in bettendorf, iowa:PROS:* good clarity of calls, good reception. people can hear me fine and i can hear them fine. isn't this what cell phone service is supposed to be all about?* lightweight phone, feels nice in hand.* cool design* seems to have enough space for pics and ringtones, should you need to store them.CONS:* the phone SMUDGES like crazy. always looks like some snot-nosed kid got ahold of it and wiped his nose with it. sony gives you a cleaning cloth for a reason. use it.* battery life is nowhere near what anyone said it would be. i think sony ericsson's site said something like "up to 11 hours talk time" and at&t;'s site said up to 6 hours or so. hardly. i have to charge this phone every 2 days or so with moderate use. i would say the talk time, at best, is 3-4 hours if all you did was fully charge it and then get on the phone for a marathon with your mother or something.* camera is crap. kinda neat that you can assign a picture to a caller, but yeah, grainy photo not good for much else.* ring tones are too soft and you can't turn off the "increasing ring" option, so you tend to miss a lot of calls 'cause the first few seconds of the ring are too soft to hear.* i've had some strange behaviour with this phone like it making calls when i wasn't even touching it. still can't seem to figure that one out. i have also had people go straight into voice mail instead of ringing first. believe me, i read the manual - all my settings are correct.* menus are confusiing. i know, we're all used to nokia or LG menus, but the ericsson menus just don't seem to make sense. things aren't where they should be and it takes forever to figure out/remember where certain features are.* side buttons SUCK. use your key lock! i have picked up my phone numerous time to find it surfing the net or waiting to take a picture (camera was on). be careful.hope this helps!
I have had three phones in my life and this was, by far the most sophisticated and, by far, the worst.  The camera is worthless, even in the daylight.  It kept saying that I had no memory so I deleted the bad pictures that came with it.  That did not help.  So basically I can't receive text messages. My roommate and I both have the same service but always has a much better signal.  The worst feature is the loud cracking sound that happens about once every minute.  It is much louder than the voice on the other end and acturally hurts when it happens.  The internet takes forever to load...when it works.  The sim card dislodges in the middle of a conversation.  I'm buying a new phone tomarrow after having this one for much too long.
Camera takes pictures in one of 2 modes(low-res or hi-res) and quickly becomes an addictive little feature. Bluetooth compatibility is a BIG plus I love using the jabra headset with this little number. As a technophile, I'm looking forward to the virtual infrared keyboard the "chatboard" just doesn't cut it. The 2meg memory really isnt a big deal when you can email the pictures to your primary email address.. The organizer features are spartan but easy to use (even my mother can figure this out). The best feature is text messaging of course. Did I mention you can transfer your own notes, pictures, and songs onto this phone? =)My only complaint is that downloading games and apps for this phone is a SERIOUS pain in the arse. I've tried 3 times from different indie websites (ie: handango.com) and all to no avail except via the phone itself through cingular's wap site. Are they trying to monopolize? probably. All in all, this phone is a good alternative to expensive smart phones and makes a successful effort at bundling worthwhile features. Battery life is more than ample as well!
Excellent phone!  Very sleek, stylish and easy to use once you fiddle around for a couple of hours.  Has a plethora of options and is extremely customizable.  Digital camera is a great feature, and works very easily with special effects such as sephia, black & white, negative, and night mode.  Large display is vivid and clear.  Last but not least, the battery life is POWERFUL for such a little phone.  Only negatives I can conjure up is the fact that the keys sometimes get stuck, and also the phone does smudge easily, although very scratch-resistant.  I would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone with AT&T carrier.
For the most part, I like the phone.  The first problem I had with the phone was when I went to make my first call. The entire phone locked up on me - the screen froze up, and none of the keys worked - I couldn't even turn it off - it finally somehow reset itself after a few minutes, but still kept freezing up when I would go to make a call, until I turned the phone off and back on again, and then it stopped freezing up when calling someone. It did freeze up on me again when I tried selecting a WAP option from one of the menus.  I also get a message periodically saying that the SIM card has been dislodged, and in order to fix that, I have to turn the phone off and back on again. Other than that, the phone has worked fairly well.  The back cover is very difficult to get off, though, in order to access the battery and SIM card.So far, I get good reception. I haven't had a call dropped yet. I've called AT&T; 3 times so far. The first time was when the phone first froze up.  (Yes, each time I called AT&T;, I was on hold for a very very long time). The lady almost immediately said it was the phone and not AT&T;'s fault. She was very snotty and short with me.  The 2nd time I talked w/ someone at ATT was to port my number. Surprisingly, this took only 2 days to port my old number - that was a pleasant ATT experience.  The third time I called, it was about my first ATT bill, and the lady was very friendly and helpful and answered my questions with a pleasant attitude.The phone is nice and small and almost plane, but I like that a lot. I don't like all the other goofy phone designs - they look too wierd - clam shell, crop circles, TV remote, - ick - too Star Trecky-looking for me.  The graphics are very nice, the buttons aren't too small.  Like everyone else said, the screen is hard to see outside when the sun is out. The battery life is much better than in my old Nokia. It takes good pictures, only if there is enough light.I bought the cable from Sony Ericsson to download pictures to the phone - the only problem is that you can't use the cable to upload pictures from the phone to your PC using the cable (I want to send the pictures, taken using the phone camera, in email using my ISP on my PC - I could send it directly from the phone in a wireless email or MMS, but the data charges are way too expensive for me). I'll need to by a bluetoogh USB adaptor to upload pictures to my PC.Yes, you need to get the 2-year deal with ATT instead of the one year deal in order to get the bigger rebate.  I did read the small print first for both the ATT rebate and the T-mobile rebate: I wanted to get a monthly plan of $30 or less, but you couldn't get the rebate at all from T-mobile unless you bought at least a $40 monthly plan, so I went with ATT.
I bought t616 sonye-ericsson two months back and I love it.1) Bluetooth: it's great, I bought one usb bluetooth adapter "Trendnet" $27 from amazon, installed it on my laptop and I can sink my Calender+Task+Contact information from and to my laptop.that's great! now I do not have to enter all phone number into the new phone evertime I buy a new cell phone.IR port is okay but I still find it very boring to send one contact information at a time.2) Sound quality: is very good. easy to access volume key on the side.3) picture: really easy to take picture with two click on the same key. Picture quality is okay but better than some of the camera phone I have seen ..like m515.4) I got AT&T wireless service and right now after Cingular acquisition, it  has been working great, I get signal even in the buildings. it gave me some weak signal problems in the begining.5) Really lightwieght and sleek model. you can even keep it in your upper pocket.6) Sound Recording: you can record the phone conversation while you are talking (You have to tell the person that you are going to record  the conversation, it's US law)7) mMode: I do not use it so no information.Have fun
On 9 December, I ordered a T616 phone from amazon.com, including an AT&T; service agreement. On 12 December, this phone arrived. Upon plugging it in and turning it on, I immediately called AT&T; customer service, by dialing 611 from the phone, to attempt to port my old T-Mobile phone number to this new phone.I ended up calling AT&T; about 10 times, and never getting through. Twice I waited on hold for over 60 minutes, and was not connected to a representative.  Both times I hung up after over an hour.Three times, I was given a recorded message saying that "due to circumstances beyond our control," ATT was unable to answer my call.Once I was asked for my phone number, then played a message saying that AT&T;'s system is down, followed by a click (hangup).I ended up returning the phone to Amazon, and sending a letter to AT&T; asking that service be canceled.  I never was able to speak to a representative.I think I will stay with my t-mobile service, thank you.  I thought t-mobile's 10 minute hold times were bad, but they're nothing compared to AT&T.;I would recommend the Sony Ericsson T610 Phone (T-Mobile) instead. - Jason Parsons
I got this phone because it has Bluetooth and is compatible with iSync (the Mac OSX synchronizing software.) I wanted to have my calendar on my phone - the rest was gravy. So I plugged in my Bluetooth adapter, clicked on one control panel, it saw my phone and added it. I opened iSync, it saw my phone, I clicked on "Sync" and in less than 5 minutes TOTAL, with NO software to download/install, my calendar and contacts were on my phone. Done. No hassle. I love it! That's how technology should work!And, for the rest - I find it intuitive to use, nice and small, and it's fun to have the camera. That was all gravy but it's good gravy!
I've had this phone for 4 months now... actually, not really.1) I had it for a month until it just stopped working out of nowhere. So I took it to ATT and then2) They gave me the wrong number and did not properly tell me how to get it replaced. So i sent it to SONY Ericsson to get repaired and3) It took 2 months to get it back, meanwhile, i was paying my att bill and i did not get the money back4) on that note, att also charged me the activation fee twice, it took me an hour on the phone to convince them of what they did.... Anyways, so i get the phone back, and the phone seemed to work until i made a call...5) the seemingly incompetent people at sony ericsson inverted the speaker and microphone on the phone, so it's pretty much unusable. If i want to get this problem fixed...6) Sony is making me send back the phone at my expense, and it would take another month or so, or I pay ATT $30 or so for them to fix it.SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. THIS SEEMS LIKE A GREAT DEAL, AND ATT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT COMPANY, BUT THE PRICE IS NOT WORTH IT. I went through two samsungs when i was with sprint pcs, and they make the best phones and sprint is the best service, hands down. Good luck, and buy wisely.
PROs: It is small, and it is useful for making and receiving 'phone calls.  You can customize the background picture and the ring tones (but can't use tones in mp3 or AAC formats).  The Bluetooth is great.CONs: Camera function is pitifully low in quality, really a joke, so you may wish to load good quality pictures from your Mac.  The Sync for addresses works, but unfortunately the formatting of the files means that businesses are listed separately from individuals, and many entries do not end up in proper alphabetical order.  Advanced features like email and Internet access are essentially worthless, and cost extra; in no way can they compare with a laptop computer.  Needs much more memory and reliable address-formatting.  Code for making custom ring-tones is cumbersome and impractical to do on the 'phone: needs mp3 and AAC compatibility to be any real fun.
With its sleek european styling and the Sony pedigree, this phone doesn't have the performance to match it's looks. I get a clear reception when I switch from the ATT Wireless network to Cingular. As a simple mobile phone, the T616 does it's job admirably. This is where the fun stops. I use the email function for the phone as much as I do making calls, and Mmode is kind of a joke. You can't save attachments, it can't decipher email from some character sets (and they are written in English!), and there is not enough low memory to even view attachments. The phone book is limited in functionality, too.The internal bluetooth was not a problem to use, though I decided to synch with my Outlook Express at home via the web page rather than using my Outlook at work (a problem I'll have to take up with my IT person).The camera is on par with other CAMERA PHONES. I don't see why people review the camera function on these phones as if they should have the quality of a Nikon SLR.It's a good phone which I got for a good price when I switched from Sprint to ATT. I expected a bit more high tech from Sony to go along with the Ericsson styling, however. I'm giving it 3 stars only because I can't give it 3 1/2 which is what it really deserves.
Good reception, good sound quality, and nice features. Crashes rarely, but the screen is bright, and bluetooth is an excellent feature to have. Works perfectly with an iBook (and iSync for contacts) and even can be a remote control via bluetooth.I've not used any other next-gen phones, but this is attractive, performs well, and has a nice rounded feature set. Recommended.
my 3rd phone and i find it to be the best of them all...it has a large screen, the key pad isnt as bad as its being protrayed on here...im a large guy, and i can work the keys fine, the camera is a little scratchy but hey, it takes pictures, what do u want? it has some awesome ring tones, you can hear very clearly on it, it looks awesome, but it scratches way too easily.  It has some great games and this is ajust a really cool phone.  Anyone can use it and everyone should own it...
The T616 is a pretty good phone...sleek design, good phone functions, fun to have a camera included. But it has some limitations and questionable function choices. I would buy it again.Likes:Call quality fine.Outlook sync works well.Caller ID brings up picture of caller (once you assign a pic to the Contact's record in the phone book).Nice design.Can store lots of info about each contact.Voice command dialing (in concept, haven't played with it enough to know if it works).Dislikes:Poor documentation for setting up bluetooth sync: I know computers pretty well, and although this was my first bluetooth device, it should have gone more smoothly. Too many gaps in documentation. Worse, AT&Ts; website provides no help, the OEM for the sync software (Extended Systems) refers you to Sony Ericsson for help, and the Sony Ericsson help desk in Toronto was counterproductive. Their suggestion was to sync one record at a time! And they were rude when I suggested there was probably a way to sync all records at once.Screen is very hard to read outdoors. This is probably the biggest flaw, and one which may be beyond the tolerance of many people...2mb of memory is not enough. You can store a fair number of contacts (500-ish) but not enough pictures, even after deleting all the nonsense pics/sounds/themes they include with the phone.The web browser function is ok on the sites formatted for the cell phone's screen.The "Find Top Ten Best Near Me" function is hysterical. This will find the Top Ten, say, mexican restaurants near you, based on the position of the nearest cell tower, which is probably within a half mile or less. I was in Plano, TX and had it find the Top 10 mexican restaurants nearest me...there are probably 30 within 10 miles, but the closest it came up with was 15 miles away in downtown Dallas...even funnier, it was The Mansion at Turle Creek! The Mansion is easily the costliest restaurant in Dallas; it is famous for having invented "Southwest Cuisine" but it is as far from being a mexican restaurant as, say, Spago's is from being a NJ pizzaria.Voice command - To be fair, I first programmed my voice commands in a noisy hospital waiting room. Since then, it hasn't recognized any voice command I've entered...so I need to reprogram it and try again.Overall: [Excellent] phone with good features...and a bad screen for outdoors use.
To start, the phone is a very nice phone.  It comes with many features, feels solid and high quality in your hands, and it is small and stylish with a large color screen.  The drawlback of the phone are that the display is hard to see in bright light.  Also, it can be hard to use until you get used to all the menus and such.  Overall, this phone is an excellent phone and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.But ATT tested my anger managment skills.  They charged more than the starting price and added on all the extra cost features that I didn't ask for!  They also charged 88 dollars for roaming when I went to New York!  The service also isnt very good.  sometimes it switches to the cingular tower or the verizon tower.  It's your money, and I would go with T-mobile personally.  Better yet, Verizon.
Sony has a knack for making the easy things hard. My address book (synced with Outlook) has 470 entries. Sony forces me to search this list BY FIRST NAME. Note to Sony: There is a reason phone books are ordered by last name. Many other features on this phone are harder to access than they should be. I vastly prefer my Siemens M56, which, in spite of its acknowledged flaws, is just easier to use. That said, this phone has a nice display and keyboard, a marginally adequate camera, and works well with Bluetooth.
I've had a good experience with this phone. I switched to AT&T earlier this year. Unlike other folks I've not had bad service. I had Sprint before and they were terrible in my area -- tons of dropped calls, didn't get my messages for hours.  Sometimes a call will go straight to my voicemail and I'll get a message even though  I'm sitting right there -- didn't ring! but at least I get the message right away, not like 4 hours later.Oh yeah, the phone. Things I like:1) small and lightweight. can put in my pocket.2) long battery life. I only charge it every other day3) taking pictures. i like linking photos to folks in my address book4) blue tooth. good for sharing ring tones with friends who also have bluetooth on their phones.5) reception is decent. not wow, but decent.Things that bother me:1) Can't see the screen outside in sunlight.2) The on/off button is tiny and hard to use. I struggled for 5 minutes after my plane landed trying to get the thing to turn on. You have to use the tips of your fingernail -- the button is so small.3) picture quality is not so great. pretty grainy, but if i really want to take a photo, I'll use my digital camera.4) I wish it didn't always say "AT&T." Would like to customize the banner. Apparently it shows you what network you're using.  Sometimes it changes to say Cingular.5) Only records time of the call on the day of the call. After a day has passed,  it only gives the day of the call.The joystick took a while to get used to, but I can navigate pretty well now. Overall, I'm happy with this phone.
Had an old Nokia Digital phone with ATTWS for about the last 3 years and it wasn't working to well anymore.  After being a customer wiht ATT for about 6 years I figured it should be no problem to get a new phone.  Not so.Apparently if you buy an ATT cell phone and you don't buy directly from ATT, ATT doesn't stand behind it.If you are a new customer, ATT will give you a great price on a new phone.  If you are an exisiting customer they charge you up to 3x as much for the same phone.  In addition it did not appear to be possible to buy this phone from the ATT website as an existing customer.Ended up paying over $200.00 for this phone from ATT.  We'll it is a great phone but not as intuitive as past Nokias.  Color screen is nice, tons of features, but as noted the screen is tough to see in the sunlight.Don't hesitate to buy this phone, just don't buy it from ATT.
I own this Sony Ericsson T616 Phone from last 2 months.Its very cute phone with nice features,not to forget its inbuilt camera.I have zero- dropped calls until now and the voice reception in and around Arizona State University in Phoenix, Arizona is excellent(Its true to say, AT&T is the wireless carrier that America Trusts on).The another feature that dragged me towards this phone is its blue-tooth anabled feature which is very helpful and sleek.The customer service of AT&T wireless is slow as to say at peek times,mostly in evening and morning business hours.Try to contact the customer service at early mornings or late nights,which I usually do.Altogether its a nice phone and a better bet against the other models in market till now.
4 star for the phone and no star for AT&T.;  The phone itself is pretty good but buyers (purchasing the plan), beware of the "fruadulent" billing by AT&T.;  I was billed and paid (didn't realize this until sometime later) for a bill that was for the period before I received the phone.  Even more upsetting was the fact that AT&T; rep. is not willing to resolve this matter stating that I called too late.  He first said, he can't do anything on something that is 90 days past.  When I pointed out to him that it's been around 60 days, he changed his statement and said, he can't help me because it's been over 60 days.In addition, I used to frequently get calls looking for the person who previously owned this number.  Which obviously, used up my miuntes (for answering and checking messages that are not for me).I am upset!
DO NOT BUY FROM ATT, Ive been with them for 4 months and they have yet to send me a correct bill. Their customer service Lie to you about what they can and can't do to fix your issues. I have spent 12 hours on the phone with their customer service to fix their billing issues and they will give no compinsation for my pain. Furthermore i told them they were in breach of contact and i wanted out since they have yet to give an accurrate bill. They said that would cost me 400 dollars. No Arbitaition, no customer service what so ever. They cant even be sure that they have fixed the issue. I WILL BE SWITCHING as soon as my contact is up. Look for a nice set of these phones on Ebay in about 8 months.Craig - Sacramento CA
This is a terrible phone in NYC (Manhattan) with AT&T service.  I'm very sorry I didn't return it in the 30-day period, as my signal strength is awful nearly everywhere, and I'm unable to use it in some rooms of my apartment.  I never had that problem with Sprint or T-Mobile.
This has to be the nicest cellphone I've yet seen. I don't understand the attraction of flip phones, so this tiny little gem from a consumer electronics giant is a welcome addition to a marketplace that offers the likes of Nokia 3595 (ugly!). However, I might choose another phone if given the choice.The color screen is fairly large and very readable. The sound "system" is wholly satisfying; you can hear the sweeping grandeur of a waltz. By simply posting a midi file to an ftp server, I was able to set it as my ringtone. It was quite necessary as the factory defaults are sad, incomparable to Nokia's. The menu system is clean and easy to learn. You may be surprised at first at the tiny buttons, but you'll easily get used to them and won't have trouble with wrong keypresses except for the joystick button.Games included on the phone are alright and you may decide to keep a few. The quality of the camera is good for the phone, but don't epect more. Samsung probably has a better alternative there.So far, so good.A few serious defects mar an otherwise excellent product, however. Most importantly, the maximum sound level is teeny in your average environment. Unless you spend your day at home, you'll prolly miss calls. The vibration is inadequate prolly due to the tiny size of the phone, and even in an empty pocket will only slightly alert you to an incoming call or alarm -- and I mean slightly  The phone won't even vibrate when you receive a message, for which you can't set your own ringtone. The alarm sound level is audible only when you hold the phone up, a strange decision by the phone designers. These notification problems make it almost useless to find a good ringtone (cuz others can't hear it), and will most likely make you miss calls. On this alone you should prolly avoid the phone.Also, I conditioned the battery but it runs for only one or two days with minimal usage. I've to see if I can convince Sony or AT&T; Wireless (tough luck as it took them 18 days to send me my phone). The signal is great and has much improved since August 2003 and my brother has had great experience with AWE in Philly while I've greatly surprised by the service in NYC. Customer service lags, tho.I don't know if this is a real problem, but the phone rarely shows even one out of five bars in signal strength. A Nokia 6800 (frustrating user interface) shows great signals in the same locations at the same time. If you hold your hand across the top of the phone, it'll usually show two bars...I haven't had real trouble with any noise during calls or making calls, however.Another thing the phone misses is a real alarm system. You can only set one one-time  and one recurrent alarm. You can set one-time event notifications in the calendar, but this is wholly insufficient with a phone that can run Java games.  Voice control is hard to configure, while it's all too easy to move the joystick in the wrong direction while at standby mode and get connected to the internet. Over time this will cost money.All in all, this is a great looking phone with great musical abilities that are undermined by poor sound levels, few alarm possibilities and possibly low battery life, which I'm not yet sure about.
The feature packed t616 cell phone from sony ericsson packs so many features into such a small place that you wonder how the makers did it. With bluetooth, camera, gprs, and other key features, the t616 makes your phone fully capable of doing everything you would want it to do besides making toast. My t616 works very well however sometimes I find it hard to view the screen when I am outside because the sunlight makes it difficult. THe bluetooth is sometimes hard to use but the phone overall works fantastic.-plsailboy
I like this phone. I can throw it in my pocket. I can syncronize it with outlook on my computer via bluetooth. It is perfect for my needs.I am worried that the screen can scratch easily.
The phone has a lot of nice features that work well and it is kind of fun.  The camera's picture quality leaves a lot to be desired, but is OK for everyday stuff. the problem is AT&T.  They are selling a network that is not ready.  I have spent as long as three hours on hold waiting for customer service to pick up.  At last I managed to break my contract and am happily in the process of switching to another carrier where I can still use my T616 phone.
AT&T; (and everyone elses) signal out here is marginal as I am out in the country but I get a signal just fine and have had no complaints about call quality and have not had any dropped calls.  The phone has bluetooth, & a good calendar and sync program (its got a camera but I just do not care about having a camera with my phone).  C-net gave it (t616/t610) very high reviews, about best in class.  The one thing about the phone that has been commented on on is the smudge factor, fingerprints do show up and a decent case is recomended.  I bought a cheap one from CompUSA that was ok but kind of awkward, purchased a Krussell case tonight which should be a about perfect.  I think there have been some firmware improvements made to improve RF/reception relative to earlier phones.  I originally wanted a Nokia because they seem to have better RF/reception than Sony-Ericsson but none of their (Nokia) currently available phones matched this one on a functional basis for me at this price.  Its a winner, I'm glad I selected this phone.
This phone is loaded with bells and whistles. This is one of the best phones that i have ever owned. The battery life is excellent, I charge the phone about every 3 days(usually waits until the bar is empty befor recharging) the talk time is great. Very small lightweight. I have MMode with att and i also use my phone with my laptop to access the internet at times when i am not in a hotspot. The IR on this phone works great and barely needs line of sight to make it work w/pc. Software was provided w/phone and it is very easy to sync outlook and contacts. voice support is really great also. I purchased this phone for $49 from ATT store, price was originally $199, but i printed out ad from Att website and took to the Att store and they matched the price...What a steal!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lots of people here are complaining about the lack of MP3 ringtone.  What they don't realize is that the T616 can also play midi files, or more specifically General Midi music files.  You know all those midi songs that people used to put on their websites? Well you can use them all on you T616, and if you have a midi editor you can pick out the chunks of the songs you like.  This is great as GM .mid files are free and occupy a legal grey area as to copyright if a person creates one from scratch and then gives it away. So you can legally download just about any song or fragment of a song into the phone for free.  This is better than mp3 or aac in many ways.However the camera is the worst ever!!!!!!!!
I've had this phone since November, and been very happy with it overall. For me, the main advantages of the phone are its very small size and the very hefty battery life. I feel like I really do get several hours of actual talk time before needing to charge. I've been happy with the quality, although that has a lot to do with the carrier, as well. The rings are generally loud enough to be heard under most circumstances, and the vibrate is strong enough that I can feel it even when I'm carrying the phone in a waist pouch.That said, I'll reiterate things such as you can't read the screen AT ALL in sunlight. And the UI design is a bit odd. It takes a lot of effort to do simple things like turn off the alarm clock before its gone off. You can't program any quick dial buttons which is annoying since I only call about three different people on a regular basis. And it does not go into lock mode if you leave one of the menus up (in fact, it leaves the screen fully powered indefinitely), or you get into M-mode (another feature you aren't allowed to de-program. I've NEVER used MMode, but I get charged a dollar or so a month from the times I've accidentally gone into it because the joystick moves that direction when the phone is in my pocket before it auto-locked.)The camera is not a good reason to get this phone. It's not useful for anything other than the fun factor, although I do enjoy being able to assign pictures to people when they call.If you can get this phone on a cheap we'll reimburse you for the cost of the phone if you sign up plan, go for it. For me battery life was one of the most important things, and I feel this phone shines in that department.
okay, I've had this phone for 6 months now though T-mobile.  Thank god I bought the warranty because I've gone throught 2 replacement phones and spent probably about 5 hours at the Tmobile store trying to get the bluetooth hooked up to my G4 ibook. Bluetooth was about 1/2 the speed of a dial-up phone connection.  A cool toy, but not really practical for surfing the web.  Granted, I do live in a basement apartment, but the only way I get reception inside is to stand right next to the window.  Also, I need to keep the phone locked at all times, because otherwise it starts calling random numbers in my phone book.  I'm counting down the months until I can get a new phone.
Like the others here, I've found AT&T to be somewhat bothersome.  True, they have gotten better after the Cingular thing in terms of customer service, but I'm wary still.  Despite their add campaign saying that the service is better, I still don't get any signal in my office.As for the phone, it's pretty cool.  The display is pretty hard to see during the daylight, that can't be denied.  I'm ok with that though.  What I don't like is how, especially with the special ring tones, the phone will receive a call, light up, and then wait 5 seconds before it makes any noise or vibration.  It's not a big deal if you're looking at your phone, but if it's in your pocket, it's already been ringing for 1 or 2 rings on the other person's side before you even know you've got a call.  Also, it has flat out crashed on me a handful of times in the last 6 months of ownership.  When I say crash, think of when computers crash - it won't do anything until I take the battery out to turn it off, but it back and then turn it back on.  I've also had intermittent problems with buttons not working unless I press them at just the right angle and things like that.Last week though, the thing went completely dead.  I couldn't turn it on, it didn't light up when it was on its charger, nothing worked.  After a few days, it started working again.  Maybe I have a loose connection somewhere, I don't know.  AT&T sent a replacement overnight to me for a twenty five dollar processing fee - although they overnighted it to the wrong address (due to a really bad customer service person on the phone) and I got it 6 days later.Anyway, the Bluetooth is cool, it talks to my computer and transfers contacts and calendar items and pictures and all sorts of stuff.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd probably get this phone again, but I'd think really long and hard about AT&T.
Bought this phone with AT&T service. Its an amazing phone with all conceivable features like calendar, multi-line address book, sync'ing with other devices. So tiny in size, mighty in features, you got to love this phone. Two drawbacks - one is that the buttons are too small (can't be bigger due to the size of the phone itself), and another - very hard to see the display in day light/ sun light.  Battery runs out completely in 2 days with very less i.e. 30 min talk time. They did'nt say it in the manual, but that's how it is.Now coming back to the AT&T service, I mean disservice it is. First and foremost is that I do not get signal at some places where I used to get good reception with Sprint PCS service.And multitude of problems with their service,1. Billing started 3 days before the Service got activated.2. Their customer service has so many 800 numbers, email service, etc... But had to hold on to the phone for hours to get to a person.3. And finally the person refuse to hear the problem.I am at least better off by taking only 1 year service. But be aware of those problems !
So far, I'm very happy with the phone.  But I'm writing this review to warn everyone of AT&T Wireless' horrible number porting service.  I've had my phone since December 6th and am still waiting to get my number ported!  Even though they haven't done the port in over the month, AT&T Wireless actually had the audacity to already send me a bill!  So, not only can I not receive phone calls on my new phone yet (I have to carry around the old one with my still-active T-Mobile service), but I'm also being billed by both vendors!  I cannot believe that AT&T is already billing me fully on half a service!To give you an idea of my AT&T wireless nightmare: I've tried to call their PAG (Portability Administration Group) at least 20 times in the past month.  Most of the time, I can't even get through and give up after 2 hours on hold.  But on the 5-6 occasions that I have gotten through and explained my situation, I've always been assured that the problem would be rectified soon.  Well, that has yet to be the case.  As I speak, I'm on hold yet again - this time, I'm going to insist on talking to a supervisor (but I don't have much hope that this will make any difference :-(  So, I'm stuck in this hell hole.When I called customer service to find out whether I could cancel my service - they told me that I would probably be charged an early cancellation fee since the service WAS activated (despite the fact that I can't receive phone calls on AT&T WS) and that I would have to write a dispute letter when I do get charged.In summary: AT&T Wireless may be ok for totally new activations without number porting, but they've got to have the most inept number portability group among all the major carriers (for comparison, a friend had his number ported from Cingular to T-Mobile within a couple days!)
Upgrading from the simplistic Nokia phone to the more complex Sony Erricson was the best thing that I ever experienced...phone wise. This phone has many features, some take a bit getting used to, but once mastered this phone can be a powerful tool that nobody will know what they did without it. Bluetooth, one of my favorite features connect right up to my Apple iBook through a Bluetooth USB adapter. Surfing the net from anywhere while my phone is in my pocket is great. Poly-phonic rings tones are sweet! Pictures do need significant lighting, but can be great fun. Actually talking on this phone let my ears expierence clear calls from friends and family, even better quality with the included headset. The two not so major con's are a small lack of processor speed, and picture memory which again is again fixable by sending pictures to my laptop via bluetooth. But overall this dense, however not heavy phone is a great companion to one's day to day activities.
Just one thing to clarify.  Unlike what the previous reviewer said.  There is 1 button voice mail retrieval with AT&T; wireless.  If took me quite a while to figure out... and for the life of me i don't think i could find it again.  Just ask a cs rep.Positives.-Nice Design, compact easy to carry.-Pleasing looks.-Attractive Display.-Nice standby time.-Sturdy design.  Feels solid.Negatives.-Slow button response and sometimes no response.-The end call button and back button are different buttons.  So when ending a call and then starting a new one or using a different function, you have to press 2 different buttons to get to the main menu.  With the slight delay in button response and sometimes the buttons don't click when you think they do, it means you have to be looking at the screen otherwise you'll end up in a completely wrong menu.  No easy navigation simply by getting used to the feel or buttons.-This leads into the next and most frustrating problem.  Glare.  The phone is impossible to see in any sort of overcast or bright situation.  And in Seattle, overcast is every day of the year.  I've put away my phone in disgust many times because i simply can not read who's calling or can't see who to call or what menu i'm on.  Even if you're covering the phone with one hand it's very hard to read.-This would be less stressful if it had a true speed dial.  But the only 1 button speed dial is to voicemail.  All other speed dials are 2 buttons.  And speed is definately not the key word.  Apon starting a speed dial... it takes almost 5 seconds to even start dialing.-A typical calling situation would be something like this.  Grab the phone press 2 buttons to unlock, 2 buttons to speed dial, wait 5 seconds for it to start dialing... wait a little more... look at my phone, cover my phone with other hand and look harder at my phone... realize I still haven't even dialed because one of the buttons didn't respond or it stored a random number before it locked, then get locked out again and start over.-Photo quality is weak.  Photos will look good on screen then look awful when sent.-Not enough memory and slow storage.  If you use the camera, you will constantly be deleting text messages, photos and sounds to make room.  And when you do take a picture... it will take 10-15 seconds to take the next picture.-Poor to average reception quality.  It's nice to carry an internal antenna phone, but not to talk on one.  Will commonly have 1 bar less than some other phones on same service.
I am in the same boat with other owners. Excellent phone for the money but the software that comes with it is VERY old. You hear that ATT!! Why you ship with an old software??? Because they want you to pay $$$ to upgrade through their service center.Anyway, After reading some of the reviewers here and they recommend me to get the tool to unlock and upgrade the software easily and cheap. check it out for your self (unlockcellular.com) if you dont believe me or do like me, read the past reviews.
i left verizon and went to att, huge mistake, the att service is horrible, my phone usually has at the most 2 bars and often says no network,i live in in a very large city and would expect good serivce. the t616 has many good features but i know other customers who have different phones and get better service than i do. my advice look for another phone and another service provider
The Sony Ericsson T616 Cell Phone is pretty good.  Not great.However, some aspects of it are great.  The display is one of the best on the market today.  And as a cell phone, it's the best I've ever owned.  I've never had any troubles with reception with it in Orlando, Fl; Buffalo, NY; Charlotte, NC; or the area's in Northern NJ near New York City, and lots of other places up and down the East Coast of the United States.  (Save, obviously, for hill and mountain areas where no cell phones will work.)Using it for e-mail and photo's... a little weak. But then, it's a cell phone and not a camera, and it isn't large enough to be a PDA replacement.  I've gotten all the major features to work.The other draw back is the small keypad for the phone.  It takes a little getting used too and hitting buttons by accident is a regular occurrence.But all in all, I've liked this cell phone. I've recommended it to friends and family.
Compared to my bulky Nokia 3650, this phone is a godsend.  It has all of the great features you could want in a phone: calender, contacts, camera, bluetooth enabled, polyphonic tones, etc.  Sure the Nokia has these things too, but it also has about 8-10 oz on the Sony as well.I get great reception 5 bars all the time where I'm at and high res screen looks fantastic indoors (see below).The Bluetooth worked perfectly on this little device.  No messing around with what type of "profile" does the phone support (handsfree vs. headset).  I had the Motorola BT handsfree working with the phone in under 5 minutes.Now for the not so good.As mentioned before, the battery in this thing is not good at all.  I also conditioned the battery and did an optimized charge.  I am lucky to get 2 days out of it which is kind of disappointing.  Another little picky thing I don't like is the battery icon.  When the battery is fully charged, you see a battery icon that is green, but only half green up and down (I've let it charge for 2 days and can only achieve the half full green icon).  When the power starts to deplete, you see an icon where the meter changes from left to right and then the color changes to yellow etc.  What kind of goofy icon shows a full battery with a half full green icon?  Just plain stupid if you ask me.Also, don't plan on looking at the screen in sunlight.  You can't read a thing on it.  I was having to use my hand to provide shade just to see what the heck I was doing.Overall, I would give this phone a 5 star rating based on what I had been using.  However, the faults I've listed above bring into the 4 star category for now.
Sony's products are known for being very stylish, and this phone is no exception.  Everything about it is organized, compact,and very very sleek.  The menus are logical, however they take a little getting used to, but overall is very good.  One thing that I like in particular is that you dont have to worry about random little things- for example if you're trying to store a number and get a call, it will handle the call, and once you hang up everything you were doing i the contact book will still be there and ready to go.  Anyway, overall it is a great phone.  The only problem I've experienced i the 5 months I've had it is that the joystick became slightly stuck in the past.  It's not much of an issue, but somewhat annoying (although I've read that you can purchase a cheap replacement part if it's really an issue.)  Overall, an excellent little piece of technology.
This is a good phone, not the greatest I've ever had but the service is good in Oklahoma and Texas. I've only had problems becasue I dropped the phone one too many times beyond that its a great phone. The camera on the phone does exactly what it needs to its a camera phone not a digital camera. The bluetooth in it is great with Macs and Pocket PC's enabled with bluetooth. The phones features can not be beat.
This may be a decent phone, but with its upgraded sibling SonyEricson T637 on the market, which has a much better camera at more than 65,000 colors, a slick appearance and much beefed-up features, this phone at $200 with a plan seemed a **RIP OFF**!Last week I've just upgraded to the T637 for $100 with an on-going promotion w/ a 2-year contract with Cingular. Right now I thoroughly enjoyed my T637. BTW, T610 is being given away for free with a contract at Cingular.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a great fan of amazon, but this is got to be the most ridiculous deal I've seen in a long time. AT&T might as well just rob me!I rate it one star for poor value, which really is an understatement.
As far as i now this is one of the best phone from sony ericsson. Its compact and very easy to use.Pros: It has a good battery life, I charge my Phone once in two days. You could talk for 10 hours max. The Menu is the best i have used so far and has a lot of cool feautures . The joystick navigator heps you navigate without seeing the screen. It has almost all the feautures you would want in a phone. The voice control is amazing as it could recognize all my commands but beware it sucks the battery to death in a few hours. It has got some cool themes. It also charges pretty quickly. The reception is clear on plain open grounds but looses power in buildings.Cons; The camera is a big joke. As it is with all high resolution colour display ,its very difficult to view in sunlight. The internet Mmode button is placed in a wrong postion that triggers the net now and then, unless you lock the keyboard. The ring tones are pathetic, I could find only one that i could hear.It has an old phone ring tone which is kinda cool. You could download new tones and wallpapers in a jiffy. The reception is not that powerful. The browser is kinda diificult to get started with.The bottomline : Buy it , its a good deal , but choose a good carrier. If i have to buy another phone , i would buy T616 againbut not with AT&T.
I bought this phone for my wife (she wanted something small and cute) - she loves the phone and size.  I decided to get a Nokia 6820 for PC syncing (with Outlook) capabilities.Pros:+ size+ bright, crisp screen+ bluetooth+ camera is not badCons:+ Contact manager does NOT have addresses+ phone ringer too low+ syncing with PC using Sony Ericsson's software is a tough process - its a mess trying to make the phone be recognized by the software (at least for me it was and I a software engineer working in the IT field for over 7 years)
when I got the phone, it would not let me save pictures so I had to return it for a replacement. The replacement works. Everything is fine but the camera takes lousy pictures, due to relatively low resolution. The Samsung 715 takes much better pictures but is more expensive and works only with TMobile.
The phone looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about it is the ease of use. I do not have the time to tinker with a gadget for an hour to find out how a particular thing works. With this phone, it is really easy to browse through the menu and find out what I am looking for. The PDA feature is also great. If you use your PDA strictly for business purposes, now you can easily do without it as the phone keeps track of all your appointments and phonebook just fine. The bluetooth headset I installed also works fine and if the device is on any call is transferred to the headset automatically. Overall, the phone is a good purchase but I am a little skeptical about AT&T service. From what I have seen, the coverage seems pretty limited (and if you call the customer service for any reason, expect to be on hold for a long time - about 10-20 minutes).
I ordered the phone on 12.17.03 and was promised receipt in 3 business days.  After unsuccessfully attempting to reach a customer service rep for over a week(waiting on hold for over an hour on 12.23) I was told on 12.29 that my order was indeed submitted, there is/was no way of knowing when the phone would arrive and that my order could not be nullified.I called again today, 01.13.14, and was given the same story.AT&T is the absolute WORST and deserve noone's business...end of story!
AT&T; wireless GSM coverage is a joke.  They will blame anything on it too:  hurricane, sunspots, "It's new technology," "somebody didn't renew antenna tower contracts" (that is on Interstate 95, if you can believe it).  Don't do it!!!  You will eventually be very unhappy!!!  If you have a brief weakness and try it out, and you get their service, and have slight problems in the first 30 days, then send the phone back IMMEDIATELY.  You are, otherwise, consigning yourself to whatever they want to do to you.  DO NOT sign a contract with them.  That is the only thing that has saved me is that I couldn't bring myself to sign the contract.  That means that I have two phones that cost me [a lot]--because the rebate requires the contract--but at least I don't have to give them money for service that reminds me of spotty cell phone service ten years ago.  'Love the phone?  Find another carrier!!!Good luck...
After HOURS on the phone trying to get assistance with ATT and getting no where but transferred and put on hold, I have cancelled my service.  They could not port my number like I was told.  They gave me the run around all the time, I ended up with 7 different numbers to try all the time.  And many times their computers were down or the department that I needed was closed.But the phone works great!
the muwap.com site they mentioned here a while ago?
I see some rabid reviews of AT&T.  I signed up in December, and have had no problem - quick response to billing issue (yes, they did try one on, but backed down immediately and reimbursed), and fast concerned help when my far-away daughter's phone didn't answer for three days and I was worried.BUT - much as I like the little phone, I find the keys sometimes stick, and then I have to reboot.  This is maddening when you've input a text message, and it is lost.Other than that, and it may just be my phone, I have no beef.
you might think that you get the phone and you got a great deal, but the fact is that you don't, what will you do with a phone and a service that basically SUCKS...!!! REALLY, att wireless is the worst service you can ever get, you might think that I am just another reviewer but as someone who has reviewed att and trying to give it a benefit of doubt, NEVER EVER EVER TAKE ATT WIRELESS, ITS THE WORST SERVICE EVER, CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE TO HELP, BUT TO FRUSTRATE YOU TILL YOU HANG UP..THEY ARE THE WORST IN BUSINESS..Don't take a cellphone if ATT is your only choice
I got this phone free with Cingular when I got a 2 year contract.
for those of u who are complaining about the server...ever think of switching to Cingular? its what i have and i find that i get reception EVERYWHERE and its really clear (keep in mind i live in the deepest part of the south in Indiana) So cingular is probably the best server u can go for...
For the price this phone has all of the features.  Sony Ericcson have never made a good phone so it does not work very well.  It needs a flash on the camera.  I alo think it sholud be a flip phone.
Where do I start?AT&T sucks.  From next to zero coverage to TERRIBLE customer service, you will hate this phone.  I have had to wait on hold longer than an hour every time I have called "customer care".  Half the time I call I am told that AT&T is unable to answer my call at this time.  When I am finally connected the staff on the other end is neither helpfull or curteous.  In fact, they are rude and useless.  They read their script very well, but it does nothing towards solving my problems.More than that.  The fine print will be sure to more than double your plan costs.My recomendation:Anyone but AT&T
This phone operates only in limited areas throughout the U.S.  Plus, prices will come down.
This is an ok phone, but I would not reccomend it
The phone sometimes shuts off itself. Plus, network setting is hobbile too. However the worst of all, it is definately not the user friendly phone at all. I definately want to go back to my old Samsung so~~~ bad. Finally, AT&T Customer service was my worst nightmare. I usually had to wait for 45 minutes and they charge roaming even when you are right in the middle of downtown!! If you are extremely lonly and got lots of time to get used to the phone, plus want to talk to the free live chat, AT&T is the one you want to stick with!
this phone looks the same the only thing that change is its features man the best is the T630
Today in class, my crotch wanted to make a phone call. I told it, "Not yet, wait till after class, you're going to be too loud! You're going to disrupt everyone." But then, the crotch told me, "Look, this phone has silent mode! I can just turn that on." Then, my teacher called on me. He was like, "Hey, Joshua. Why are you talking to your fly." I could muster no response. I hope I passed today's pop quiz.Oh, yeah. If you guys have any questions about my phone, ask my crotch. It knows everything about it! Talk about handsfree telecommunications! (My crotch even knew what Bluetooth was! I just thought my phone was referred to that stinky guy by Wendy's!)
I have read the Editorial Reviews, so I wan't to buy that phones
I swapped out a Motorola MPx200 (which I fried) for a Nokia 3300 initially because of the low price compared to other phones with similar features.  You do get a lot of "bang for the buck" with this phone.The selling point on the 3300 is the music player.  It plays MP3 files and "raw" (not MPEG-4 encoded) AAC files.  Because it does not support the MPEG-4 compression, you're better of with using MP3, as the raw AAC files at the same bitrate are acutally larger in size with no noticeable difference in quality.  The music player is among the best I've listened to (it actually has some BASS output) with the provided stereo headset; you can also listen to it with the single-ear (mono) earpiece and the player knows the difference and switches from stereo to mono accordingly.  You can also listen to either the music player or FM radio using the loudspeaker on the phone, but to listen to the FM radio you still have to keep the headset connected, as it utilizes the headset wire as an FM antenna.  I have encountered an issue where the music player will arbitrarily change tracks, or the FM radio will spontaneously kick over to another station preset, but it could be from accidental keypresses on the case that I have the phone in.This phone also includes a recorder and a special audio cable (3.5mm standard plug on both ends) for connecting an external CD player or other equipment to record from to the MMC card (64MB) supplied with the phone.  The phone records 64Kbps, 32KHz "raw" AAC format (64MB = about 2 hours of audio), which is fine if you are recording from the radio or voice but not the greatest if flawless quality is your preference from your CDs.  The Nokia Audio Manager 3.1 software supplied with the phone is clunky and stalls frequently; I highly recommend using RealPlayer 10 with the Nokia Mobile Device plug-in (which also handles conversion to MP3 for you); RealOne Player with the plug-in is also included on the CD that comes with the phone. If you have a separate MMC reader, you can read the cards in that rather than in the phone to speed up transfers.The phone itself is a decent quality phone, as with most Nokia handsets. However, if you don't want to look like a space alien talking on it, you'll find yourself using the earpiece almost always (otherwise, you hold the narrow back side of the phone to your face to talk; which looks tacky and feels awkward). The full keyboard on the US "B" model is excellent for text messaging and e-mail--*IF* you have light to see it with (only the call, hang-up, and directional buttons light up, which means you can't see the numbers or keyboard in the dark--major issue if you have to communicate in less-than-ideal lighting; keep a little mini flashlight with you).The 3300 supports Java MIDP 1.0, which is wonderful. Most of the apps I used most frequently on my MPx200 I have found suitable Java alternatives for (MyCast Weather, Virca IRC client, EmailViewer e-mail client, and MapQuest Mobile for real-time directions are among some of the apps I use often). The built-in e-mail client is adequate, but forces you to download entire messages instead of just headers to see what you *really* want to read (downloading full messages can consume your GPRS bandwidth in a hurry if your e-mail box is big), so I use ReqWireless E-Mail viewer, which doesn't have that disadvantage.Like all Series 40 Nokias, the Calendar is very basic with limited capability, but the Contacts database is robust.  Which brings up another major issue with this phone: lack of PC Suite support.  The data cable supplied with the phone only interfaces with the MMC card in the phone and not with the phone's interface itself, so if you need to synchronize via cable or use your cell phone as a modem, you'll be SOL on this device.  It only supports synchronization over-the-air using SyncML with a SyncML-compliant server (again, a bandwidth hog if your contacts/calendar db is huge); Nexthaus does make a SyncML server to sync with Outlook, but any calendar items not supported by the 3300 get skipped so your calendar is always incomplete (Contacts come through great though).Lastly, you would think that with this phone supporting the MMC card format that it would also support SecureDigital (SD).  It does not, and MMC cards are becoming increasingly difficult to find as more vendors make the move to SD cards.  The phone comes with a 64MB card, which is sufficient for most people, but if you like more than an hour's worth of MP3s, you'll want to look for a 128MB or 256MB MMC card.  I will give it this much: there is a feature to backup and restore your phone's settings to/from the MMC card, which is a smart feature to use in case your phone should be accidentally reset.Overall, I do enjoy this phone, especially the awesome music player and the java support.
Got mine in October '03. Loved the features. Great price with rebate.Pros:1) Full keyboard - aids text input and beats a regular number pad hands down.2) MP3 player - Can use MP3 files as ring tones, and just store songs on the memory card. Way cool.3) Speaker - good for speaker phone and listening to music if headphones aren't handy.4) Games - when you need to kill some time, the games are nice to have.5) Internet access - decent net access, didn't use it much, though.6) Menu - fairly intuitive and easy to use.7) FM radio - another way to pass the time enjoyably.8) Voice capture - good for making quick verbal notes.Cons:1) Non-backlit keypad - impossible to use when dialing at night, especially combined with...2) Small buttons - the dialing buttons should be larger. Easy to misdial, especially at night.3) Center 4-way menu button - had to press it more than once to scroll down the menus. Must be a bad contact under the button. Extremely aggravating.4) Poor speaker volume - even the shrillest ring tones don't penetrate a normal winter coat when I'm wearing it. Lost many calls that I never did with old phone. Hard to hear music with speaker through the normal din of all but the quietest areas.5) Lost audio on calls - Often, a call would ring in, I would see who it was on caller-id, but when I picked it up, I couldn't hear the other person. Called back the other person, who said I could be heard fine. Only happened on incoming calls.6) Poor earpiece design - the angle of the earpiece in the case makes it hard to position it flush against the ear opening. Poor volume means you have to cover the entire ear opening to get a clean sound.7) Proprietary SD memory - If you take out the battery, you can pop out the 64mb memory card, but the unit won't take inexpensive standard SD cards, like a 256mb or 512mb card. Why? Nokia requires a special thin SD card only they are selling. Bah!Conclusion: It's a nice toy and can waste away your idle hours with blissful fun. You could run a mini cable from the headphone jack to a set of powered computer speakers and have a nice MP3 system. But doesn't cut it as a phone. I need a superior phone, and the rest is icing on the cake. Thought I could have both with the 3300. Nope.I'm getting a Motorola V300. It's an outstanding phone. Tiny. Features-a-plenty, and the rebates cover the entire phone and even pay me $51 when bought through Amazon and T-Mobile.Avoid AT&T; Wireless! One month of calling on the 3300, no live customer service or email responses whatsoever. Shame on AT&T.;
Reading the other reviews, I agree that the Nokia Audio Manager is not the best software in the world. I can't get it to reorganize tracks, and unless you keep pressing buttons to keep the screen on the phone lit up, it does freeze up the computer while trying to load songs on it.That said, why am I giving the phone 4 stars?Cause I like the sound quality, the features, and the customization ability, which to me are the basics of a phone. Once you have do the songs uploaded, the music player is easy enough to use, and you can use normal bud earphones to listen if you think, like I do, that the enclosed headset appears rather fragile.The stereo quality is nice on the music, and I've not had problems being heard even on a busy city street with the enclosed microphone headset, which fit me just fine. It also has all the bells and whistles including ring tones from mp3 files, and I think the speakerphone is quite loud. You just have to not cover the speaker holes located on the lower back of the phone.And it also depends if your cellphone is your life. I'm a casual user, so I like it just fine.
o my gosh this is the BEST PHONE EVER!!!!!!!! The mp3 player is great so is the radio (great signal). its soo easy to text message with the full keypad. for calls its very clear and easy to handle. also this phone is a tank, ive dropped it i dont know how many times and it still works great with very little scratches. i would definately recommend buying this phone ive had it for almost a year now and i absolutely looovve it
When I decided to buy my very first phone I wanted to get the best one I could buy.  Looks and capabilities were a key factor in deciding which one.  I was about to get a samsung but at cingular they try to sell you nokias because they have better reception.  I picked the 3300 because it was an mp3 player, radio, cool design, and because I saw that alicia keys used one in one of her music videos.  I have had it since January and ir hasn't failed me yet.  One thing I would change is that they would sell holsters for it at cingular and interchangable plates.  Other than that I highly recommend it.  Put if you want something really small don't get it.
I tried for 3 weeks to get service for my Nokia 3300 phone.  AT&T and Amazon kept pointing fingers at each other, and finally Amazon told me to send the phone back, then order a new one. I sent the phone back w/out ordering a new one (one time shame on you, two times shame on me), and I'M PRAYING THAT I ACTUALLY GET MY MONEY BACK.  The phone seems pretty nice especially for the price, but alas it was too good to be true. I may just go to the AT&T store where I can get face to face service and instant activation.
This phone fell short my expectations.Cons:Speakerphone is not very loudRadio gets horrible receptionButtons are too complicated (esp for text message)NOT RECOMMENDED for text while driving (what i do all the time.lol)Buttons dont light upNo AIMNo CameraEarpiece is too big and too much hassle to carryRadio will not work w/out earpiece64MB is not enuf for mp3's.Earpiece keeps coming off.PROS:its a nokiareception pretty goodI recommend the nokia 6610. same menu set up with radio and LOUDER speakerphone and smaller. Depends on the user. I am a picky customer but this phone sucks. My friend warned me and fell in the trap.
When I first purchased the phone, it was great! AT&T provided good service in my house (which is practically a dead zone) and it was perfect. Then I wanted to add M-Mode (an AT&T internet feature) and HELLO, tell me why I was on the phone for 45 minutes waiting for a live operator (thank goodness 611 is free, otherwise it'd eat up my minutes!). My phone calls now keep getting dropped if someone tries to call me; it takes 3 phone calls to actually establish a secure phone call w/out being dropped. For shame to AT&T. If the rumours are true & AT&T does merge with Cingular, they'd better kick some a** or my a** is switching over to Verizon where they provide real service or Nextel (where you actually get a customer service rep. in less than 3 minutes -- sometimes less than 2 mins).  If it's for show & tell, yea then get the phone, but if it's for serious use, stick with what you have, it's probably better anyways. As for the speakerphone feature, the music plays great, but sometimes it's not loud enough even in your own car for you to hear (don't drive & keep cellphone to ear, you get tickets in NY state that way). The mp3 & FM radio features rock when you're taking the bus to school or something to pass time, keeps you from getting bored.  Conclusion: If this phone were offered by a real provider like Verizon, then it'd be worth having cos you'd get great service & a great phone to show off and use. The phone is very handy with its other features. Look for the NOKIA 6225 w/VGA Camera installed coming soon, probably the best phone that'll be out there for quite a while. Good luck...
Save your money and look into a phone that's easier to use than this one. I initially liked this phone for its odd shape and exciting features, but now I regret my purchase altogether. I have Cingular, and the service has been pretty good. That's not the problem, but I realized that Nokia is second to Motorola when it comes to quality. I like the FM radio & MP3 features, but they come with massive flaws. You can't play the radio without the headsets in the phone which is bulky and annoying. I love listening the radio on my cell, and if you do too, then look into a phone that has radio hands-free headsets. If Nokia were to improve this phone and re-release it like they do with weak music cd's, then it would do better on the market. THE WORST PROBLEM I HAVE is with the keypad. I love the keypad, but I hate it! Full QWERTY keypad but it does not light up nor does it even glow in the dark. Don't even think you'll memorize the keys because you won't trust me! False advertising with the Express on Cases. Nokia said they would void my warranty if I were to change cases.So, ladies and gentlemen, don't end up like me!!! I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone. I do get a lot of looks with it... but only if they knew how much I wished I had the ...  Motorola V600...
The phone is great but AT&T has to be the worst cell phone provider ever. There network has so many dead spots its not funny and not small ones either. I got better signal when i was roaming so what ever you do do not get at&t is a big disapointment!
Hello, thank you guys for sharing very useful information about this phone. Here are some new tricks that i found recently:1. In address book, a contact person is not restricted to 4 fields(home, office, cell and email address) only. You can put as much as you want about contact information of one person, say, some person might have more than 1 email address or more than 1 office phone number. Here is how to do: go to the contact person, select Option/Add Entry then you can add any information you want such as new email or work phone. Off course, it will eat up one spot in the memory.2. Customize your email address: your cell-email that your friend send sms to, have the form ten_digit_phone@tmomail.net, for instance 850339XXXX@tmomail.net, you can change to easy-to-remember-email such as yourname@tmomail.net. Here is how to do it: Go to t-mobile.com, log in then select "Communication" tab, select "Text Messaging", on the left window, at "Power Messaging feature", select "Change my phone's email address".On this, you can creat spam/keyword filter or forwarding email or set up alert to your cellphone.3. To know how many anytime minutes you used so far: just send sms to #646# number (#MIN#), the system will instantly reply you. The nice thing is you do not pay for this message (both sending and receiving) and you can check as often as you wish. It updates pretty fast.4. Send one sms to more than one person:One sms can be sent to a group of people buy putting "," between people email addresses or tel numbers.Although this phone has some minor drawbacks but with t-mobile carrier, it provides great quality and services more than I expected (compare with some poor services provided by my old carrier CINGULAR)
I upgraded phones (and carriers) from the venerable Nokia 6100, which I've had for three years.  My first impression was amazement at how light and tiny the phone was.  Folded up, it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket.My next impression was one of despair: I had over 150 numbers and there was no way download what I already had in Outlook and my Sony Clie running PalmOS into my phone.  (To be fair, this was the same with my Nokia 6100.)  Manually entering them is incredibly tedious.  The T9 mode would initially seem like the best way to go, but it goes on tangents for some of the stranger names.  The alpha method of entering has an annoying delay before you can toggle case.  There's a function for Camel Case, but it doesn't work at the beginning of a new entry.  The phone "crashed" itself once, but soon recovered.I do like the ability to organize multiple contacts under the same name.  Unfortunately, if you make a mistake in which bucket (cell, home, work, email), you can't edit it.Another strange feature is storing the phone numbers in the phone versus SIM.  There's no way to transfer them, and I'm unsure why you'd store any in the "phone" if the SIM still has slots left.Ring tones can be made quite loud.  The standard array of tones include the T-mobile jingle, some strange polyphonic tones, and a bunch of songs like the Chinese Tea Dance tune from the Nutcracker.  You can download additional songs for a buck each.  While it was initially funny to have my phone play "Stairway to Heaven" with each ring, the joke gets old quick.  One problem is it's easy to blend into the background, another is the song is longer than th eperiod before the incoming call rolls over into voice mail.  I'd prefer some more subtle tones and/or lighting that is less likely to bother the people I work with.The screen is 128x128, with 65k colors.  This is a vast improvement over my ancient Nokia.  However, it's really only useful for small bits of information.  Beyond that, it's cumbersome.  For example, all four java games are difficult to see, and chess is the only one that's close to playable, despite the board being set up incorrectly.  There are more games available for download for a fee.The WAP browser is very slow to connect and almost as slow navigating between links.  There's a shortcut for saving links, which is great because finding the "." in amazon.com required more keystrokes than it should.  Given the lack of screen space and the delay between pages, I'm not sure how useful I will find this feature.I haven't done that much with the organizer yet. As a standalone personal information manager, the screen's too small and the input is too tedious to be the primary tool.  On the other hand, assuming the synchronization works with the calendar.  The T-Zones service purports to give access to calendaring, though it has a lot of other stuff that I don't have a particular interest in.  (Horoscopes, anyone?)The phone's voice quality is good, though the profile is slightly small for my head.  Battery life is fine, too.Overall, the phone's okay, but bells and whistles need work.
Amazon does not offer family plans, and the number porting process is relatively new, so I want to share my experience with these processes (based on the instructions from this website), in addition to the phone itself.Got my phone a week ago from Amazon, with the intent to upgrade to a T-Mobile family plan and port my old number (both these have to be done directly with T-Mobile, not Amazon).  The new phone arrived  earlier than Amazon predicted, activated with a new number.I went to a local TMo store to do my intened changes, as outlined by Amazon.  I already have another T-Mo phone, and the family plan upgrade was a breeze:  the rep called it in and when I checked online my plan was indeed changed.The porting part was more tricky; they told me up to 7 days to change my number from AT&T.;  Two days later my account with ATT was terminated, but still not active on TMo.  After being on hold 30 minutes with TMo, I was told "if you're porting a number to replace an existing number (which I was), it's not done automatically -- you have to call it in a we manually do it."  Good thing I persevered on hold; within minutes I got a text msg saying it's done.The fun part now is waiting for the rebates to be processed.  With the changes I made, my plan and phone number now don't match  up with my purchase, even though it's all legit.  You know how they're sticklers for detail for these rebates.With the phone itself, I'm happy with it and its features.  Call clarity on my AT&T; TDMA Nokia 8265 was better, however.  I do hear the voice hum and amplified ambient noise as others have indicated.  Reception is too sensitive: I move the phone a few inches and the bars go from full down to 1.  But I guess I'm not as picky as other reviewers; I'll live with the minor phone drawbacks to save money on the monthly plan fees.After a year on this contract, I'll be on the prowl for better service as the competition heats up.
I got this phone from T-Mobile about 10 days ago.  I have beenvery happy with the features, but I have had some problems withthe outgoing voice quality.  I swapped the phone once already.The new one is better, but still rather poor on some calls.  Itisn't the T-Mobile service since I have tried the same call froma Samsung R225 and that one is much clearer (and that was the*free* phone!).  I will probably try swapping this for aMotorola V300 which was just released.Now, regarding a few of the user interface issues that otherreviewers have mentioned:- When using the browser, sometimes the left soft key is "Select"  and one click will go to the current link.  Other times, it is  "Options" which brings up a menu, the first item of which is  "Select", so it takes two clicks.  It turns out that you can  use the "T-zones" button in the center of the four navigation  arrows to do the "Select" function.  A single click on that  always works.- When browsing, you can press and hold the "*" key to bring up  a menu with the following functions: Reload, Home, Goto URL,  Show URL, Edit Home, Clear Cache, and Inbox.  So you can use  this to go to a new URL without having to exit the browser!- When browsing, you can press and hold the "#" key to bring up  your "Favorite URL" menu.  So that is another way to to go to  another URL without exiting the browser!- I haven't found a way to associate a ring tone directly with  a phone directory entry.  But you do have ten "groups", each  of which has a ring tone (and you can use the same tone for  two or more groups).  And you can set the group for each phone  number.  Note that I said phone number and not directory  entry.  You can put Bob's work number in one group and his  home number in another.  I found this to be annoying since I  never wanted to do this and it means that I have to set the  group for every phone number in an entry and not just once for  the whole entry.  But maybe someone might want to.- And speaking of phone number types and group membership...  That information seems to be stored in the phone and NOT in  the SIM.  When I swapped out my phone and moved the SIM card  to a new one (both Samsung E105's), the numbers that I had  stored in the SIM moved over, but they all became "cell"  numbers and lost their group association.  And all the email  addresses were lost too since there wasn't a way to store  them in the SIM.  What was really annoying was that there  doesn't seem to be any way to change the "type" of a phone  number.  So the only way to change those 40 or so home and  work numbers from "cell" to "home" or "work" was to delete  them and reenter them.  I suspect that this is a general  limitation of the SIM cards (only able to store certain  standard common attributes), but it sure limits the utility  of that technology.  Too bad.- Sending a text message to an email address is truely bizzare!  As reported, you put the destination email address at the  beginning of the message text, and then send to the number  "500".  This smells like a user interface designed by an  engineer!  However, you *can* get the email address from the  phone directory.  As soon as you get to the "Write New" screen,  press the "Options" soft key and pick "Add Phonebook", and  then pick the desired name and email entry.I'm sorry to report voice problems with this phone since it isotherwise quite nice.  Perhaps it is just a few bad ones.  TheT-Mobile customer service rep I spoke with hadn't heard of anyproblems.Anyway, enjoy the shortcuts.--Bill
I have tried quite a few cell phones out and I must admit this has been my best to date (muchhhhhh better than nokia, motorola, and sony ericson).  The reception is excellent, external caller id is nice, display looks sharp, and the sound quality is superb.  I have been very pleased with t mobile overall. yes, verizon has better coverage but costs about 25% more. not worth it.  plus, their phones are much more expensive and uglier.  anyway, here are my caveats about this phone:the ring tones leave much to be desired (whatever happened to normal phone rings---not everyone likes to hear a stupid song when the phone rings).the antennae is not flexible..kinda annoying when it is in your pocket. i am always worried it will break.display is impossible to see in sunlight.the wap browser is super slow.  t mobile needs to invest in the data transfer department.  also, they charge you for incoming text messages. only 5 cents but still, should be free. i dont recommend the t zones, for the amount of time it takes to connect you could boot up a computer with internet access.i wish it had speaker phone capabilites, this is a big drawback for me.anyway, overall like i said, this phone is one of the top ranking phones out there.  their customer service has been awesome so far.  if you live out in the boonies, you may not get that great of coverage (try verizon) but if you live in the city you should be golden.  for the price, you will not be dissapointed.
Overall: Great phone, Good Quality. HiFi Ringers (Voice) and Megatones capable.Let's break this phone down.Pros:-[extremely durable] I have dropped, slept on, thrown (accidently.) this phone countless times and it is still in sturdy contact.-[user friendly] I did not need to use the manual to know how to use this phone. Unless you never owned a cell phone (or any electronics) in your life, this phone is easy to use.-[impressively lightweight] 2.86 oz!-[sleek and stylish] one thing that amazed me about this phone is the attractive look, especially when its flipped open. the blue key lighting is gorgeous, a change from old fashioned yellow lighting.-[small] Size: 3.3 x 1.8 x 0.8 inches, depends if you find this a pro or not. but it could fit in a tight pocket and would hardly be noticeable. could fit in a small purse. etc.-[many shortcuts] if you're like me, you wouldnt like tapping so many buttons just to get to the function you want. I am not going to get into any specific shortcuts but if you really want to learn them, the manual shows you all different kinds. or you can look at the generous review below me entitled "a few helpful shortcuts"-[light keys] the keys are very easy to press.-[GAMES!] one of the things that impressed me about this phone are the games (includes four: MobileChess, Ultimate Golf Challenge, Bubblesmile, Fun2Link). plus you can download more for a cheap price on the net.-[battery saver] I use my phone (which I have owned for almost a year) throughout the whole day (and might I add, for hours at a time) without it dying on me. All it needs is a good recharge throughout the whole night and it's good to go the whole day. The reason why its so energy efficient is mostly due to the fact that while you're on the phone, it turns off the entire screen after being idle for a while and comes back on with the simple press of a button.-[strong signal] this small phone has a strong signal, even in my basement. I never had a problem with it unless t-mobile itself was at fault.-[etc.] for more details just refer to the technical specifications.Cons:-[scratches galore] although it's extremely durable, it scratches very easy.-[mediocre ringtones] the phone comes with a generous list of ringtones, however, I have found myself only mildly interested in about 5 of the preset tones and ended up downloading more tones instead. also, if you download HiFi ringers (voice ring tones) they only sound for about 6 seconds until it reloops, plus the sound quality is not so great. I recommend motorola for better quality ring tones.-[no camera] if you havent already figured it out, this model has no camera.-[bad quality photos] If you are sent a picture on this phone, the picture's quality is lessened.-[etc.] for more details just refer to the technical specifications.These are only general pros and cons, I have not listed all details. However, as you have read, the cons of this phone are merely minor ones and are outnumbered by the pros. I highly recommend this phone for people who want a classy flip phone at a low price.Personally, I love this phone and I do not mind that it does not come with a camera, as most phones have bad camera quality anyway. I would rather purchase a separate high quality camera.
I switched from ATTWS Nokia to T-Mobile E105.I like the overall sound quality, the color display, good battery life and the fact that it is a flip phoneI don't like that:The software is not as easy to use as a NokiaThere is no way of switching profiles to meeting or silentThe vibrate+ring feature is very inconsistentEven if I select a ringtone, it will switch back to the T-Mobile jingle for no reasonTakes a long time to initialize the address bookTakes 2 keystrokes to dial a #Not sure whether it adjusts the time automatically if I travel to the east coast
I have used lot of phone before this and switched to this from Sony Ericsson t68i (and t68m).I definitely like the following features: * Full color screen looks great and a huge improvement from t68i. All the images are more real and lively. Sending images as an attachement also works like a charm. All the menus are also very colorful and work like a demo of the color quality. * Great sound quality * Nice 'ergonomic' keyboard. not sure what ergonomic means in cell phone context but the keys are far apart enought that you can type it clearly and not mess up. * Polyphonic ringtones * Helpful second display on the top with easy to silent from the side keys * Small size and very lightSomethings which could have been better: * Weird behavior with address book. Not so intuitive to manage it. * No sync capabilities with computer, atleast I havent' found it. t68i came with a free software to sync with Outlook Address book and I really miss this feature in this phone. Once I organize my address book in the SIM card, and load it in the phone, I get multiple entries as "/M" and "/H" for mobile and home number entries. REALLY ANNOYING. * Some weird and inconsistant behavior while browsing. Sometimes you have to click twice (Option and then Select) instead of just SELECTing once. * Battery doesn't last quite as long as t68i ot t610. * No speaker phone (not that my t68i had it, but Panasonic GU87a is good for that) * No voice dialingOverall, a good compact phone if you dont need all the bells and whistles of syncing, speaker phone etc... and are happy with a good stylish small phone.
I've had this phone for a couple of weeks now and these are the problems that i've noticed:CONS- The page numbers in the index of the manuel don't correspond to the actual page numbers.- The index isn't detailed enough and everything is categorized with the definitions that Samsung use.- Text messaging is a pain as you constantly have to switch back and forth from T9 mode to normal mode.  When T9 brings up the wrong word they don't offer you any replacements like SonyEricsson.  The phone also has a couple of other minor writing problems - first letters aren't capitalized automatically, and you can't use non-letter characters when adding contacts in your phone book.- It doesn't look like it but it is actually a little flimsy - After about a week i noticed that my flip case was misaligned.  Now i always carry it using a belt clip.- No speaker phonePROS- It's small and comes with a handy belt clip for free- The colours and graphics are excellentOVERALLIt's a pretty good phone.  I still like it despite it's drawbacks.  However i would have preferred something that was more text message friendly.  Overall, not bad for -$100!
I have purchases a few flip phones in my life and have alway had issues with cracking at the joint.  Well this was no exception.  I am not a power user, nor do I drop my phone, but it cracked, in the same place as my business partners, who also owns the same phone.  We took it back to T-mobile within 4 months of service and because it wasn't a software glitch, they said they would replace it for $75.00.  Not my idea of a warranty at all.  Too bad, because it does have some nice features.
The ring + vibrate works fine, despite what was said in another review. It vibrates for a while, then rings... as it should. I usually leave it on this setting as I work with headphones on, and when I see my phone sliding across the table, I know to look at the callerID on the front of the phone to see if I should answer... or not.T-Moble (Voice Stream) has been MUCH better than Verizon (No... I can't hear you... stop ASKING!).Battery life is great with this phone. Can keep it off the charger for a couple days before worrying about it.Only drawbacks for me include voice dialing and no loud ring.But the voice dial is not a drawback, as with my previous phone (a great Samsung n105), I found the only time I really needed to voice dialing was in situations where it was too loud for it to work, anyway.The absence of a loud, piercing ring is probably good. The world would be so much better if EVERYone in the airports could figure out how to get their phones to vibrate... and QUIT standing in the middle of the aisle with your hands behind your back talking "business" through your hands-free. Come on. Everyone has a phone these days; you're not impressing anyone there, Mr. Business Guy.
Almost every review is right except the individual ringer part. You CAN assign a distinctive ringer to a specified "group." It's no longer individual based, though you can make a group one person. Only disadvantage is there are 10 groups, but just assign multiple people to a group.Everything is perfect, except there is no voice dialing. Otherwise, awesome buy.
I upgraded from the Samsung S105 to the E105 about five months ago. I had the S105 for over a year and loved it. The E105 is a close replica of the older model but has a few extra features plus a more compact structure. Navigation of the menus and operation are effortless with the phone's clear menus and simplicity. I use text messaging a lot, and I am pleased with the way the E105 performs with text, minus a few annoyances with the T9 feature. The phone's standard ringtones are less than impressive, but T-Mobile.com offers lots of various Mega Tones and Hifi ringers that are great for $1-2 each. I don't use the internet option often; I find it inconvenient. I also don't use the organizer. One of my favorite features is the outside display caller ID which allows me to see who's calling without flipping it open or answering the call. The lighting is good, and the sound is good. I do have trouble sometimes getting a signal in certain areas. I don't know if the problem is with T-Mobile or the phone itself. Overall though, I am satisfied with the E105's performance, and I plan on keeping it until Samsung makes a newer version.
Previous to purchasing the e105 I was an s105 owner.  I loved that phone but I had my pet peeves about it, the keys being connected on the keypad made it difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving this wasn't really an issue.  Yes it was hard to see the screen in daylight but I don't expect to see a crystal clear picture on a cell phone, they aren't mini laptops folks.  Although it was hard to read, it wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately I went to a concert and lost that phone and replaced it with the e105.  I have no complaints, I live in a basement apartment and the s105 wouldn't get service, but the e105 gets one bar and picks up all my calls crystal clear.  I can hear the caller on the other line perfectly, my boyfriend has one as well and I can hear the whole conversation if I am sitting next to him in a room with mild background noise.  I haven't had any problems with the screen going black, only when the phone goes idle but you can change that option from the menu.  Overall I am pleased with this phone up to date, we'll see if it holds up.
I really like this phone, but it does have its problems. First the positives, this is a small, lightweight, solidly-built phone. It gets good reception (meaning that it does a good job of locking inot a weak signal) and has decent battery life for a phone with a color screen. But, there are a couple of issues I have with the phone. One is the display is pretty much unreadable in the daylight. I don't have a problem with the ringtones because I never use ringtones. I am a vibrate only guy. The problem is I probably miss 60% of the calls I get because I don't notice the vibrate. Unless I am just sitting quietly, it is hard to notice the vibrate. Lastly (and to be fair there may be a way to rectify this, but I couldn't figure it out), the VM indicator is sent to the phone as a text message which doesn't get automatically erased after listening to your VM. So, you can either permanently deal with the little envelope icon on your phone or you have to go into the text messages and seperately erase the text message voicemail indicator each time you listen to your messages. Annoying.
I first fell in love with this phone because it was compact and lightweight.  That's about all I love about the phone right now.  It has really bad reception, not to mention weird background noises on both incoming/outgoing calls.  T-Mobile sent a replacement after I told them of the problem, but it's still the same.  I would buy another phone right now if I had the money.  The wallpapers provided are not the best, and neither are the ringtones.  Sometimes there is a delay for the screen to show up when you flip open the phone.The phone is a nice organizer though.  Alarms are loud as well as the ringtones.  Screen is pretty bright.  Buttons are nice and crisp.  That's about all the good features of the phone.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone.
Ok, first of all i'm 18, so if you're not around my age this review may not apply to you. i bought this phone the day after christmas. i wanted to upgrade my phone, i had the worst phone ever, the motorola c332. after a couple of months with that free phone i couldn't take it anymore. i could never hear the ringer, the battery died, it was a waste. so anyway i went to the tmobile store. i got there and i saw the motorola v300 (my dream phone). the sales rep told me that they were out of stock and they wouldn't have anymore until january. i didnt wanna wait that long (even though now it's january). so instead i opted for the samsung e105. its a GREAT phone compared to my old c332. i like the flashing corner light. when someone calls or you receive an IM or a text message it's pink instead of green. i think that'd neat. anyway, the ringtones are decent. some are a little annoying, i only like 2 or 3 of them that are preset. i downloaded some wallpapers and some ringtones and everything is fine. the ringer is GREAT! i love it! i can hear it in the car or wherever. however there are a few cons to this phone. i've had this phone for a couple of weeks and the flipping part is a lil flimsy. maybe it's just me, but it's a lil off.. you can't really tell until you look. also, the text messaging SUCKS. the iTap (predictive text) doesn't compare to my old phone. in my old motorola you could type in the word and on the bottom it would list possible words, not like in the samsung. it's either the word or you have to delete the word and enter it in by letter. also theres no side button to ignore calls. theres only a volume adjuster. when someone calls you either have to pick it up and hang up on them or press the down volume button to silent the ringer. OH and theres no easy access to silence the ringer, like in a movie. they have a quick access button for it, but it puts it on vibrate. i can still hear it in the movie theater and in class.All in all it's a good phone, i'd recommend it. However i would rather have the v300, it has a camera and a speaker phone for around the same price. well i hope this helped you out.
First of all, the Samsung phones are nice, but they ALL have a problem with the display not working after about one year.  Just after the warrenty stops.  I would suggest that if you are extra careful when you close your phone, it will probably prolong the life of the display.  But I digress.  I had the previous S105 model and the display went bad about 16 months after I purchased it.  I had the 1000 minute T-Mobile plan for 9 months, and then I dropped down to the $10 cheaper plan for one month, and then went back to the 1000 minute plan for the past 6 months.  When the phone went bad, I asked T-Mobile what they could do, and since the phone was out of warrenty, they offered a new phone which I did not like for $50 out of my pocket.  I had the bright idea that I could order a new phone from Amazon for basically free, and have a replacement Samsung and still come out ahead.  When I went to cancel the current contract, T-Mobile told me that I was still under contract for six months. When I switched back to the 1000 minute plan, it started my contract time all over again.  They wanted to charge me $200 to terminate the contract. I spent 20 minutes complaining to the supervisor, and she offered to reduce the termination fee to $100, which I had to accept since I would be paying for two phones.  Apparently, they consider the 1000 minutes to be a promotional plan, and they had the right in the small print to not give me credit for being a T-Mobile customer for the past 16 months on a 12 month contract.  I have never had this problem with Sprint before and I was very upset that T-Mobile would treat their customers in this way.  I have written a letter to their customer service asking for a refund, but I have had no response to my letter, which is also a major disappointment to me that they could not even acknowledge the they even received my letter.  So if you purchase a T-Mobile phone, DON'T CHANGE YOUR SERVICE or else you will be responsible for a new 12 month contract the second you make the change.  The phone is a great deal, and if you handle your phone carefully, and don't change your service, you will come out ahead.  I fault T-Mobile for NEVER telling me when I made the change in service that a new contract would be starting, and they should be like other carriers that don't care if you change plans as long as you  stay a customer.  Shame on you T-Mobile!
This phone is absolutely superb, I bought it this christmas because I needed a way to communicate with my friends and family because I am on the go a lot, and this phone is perfect for it! It's size is amazing, much smaller than it seems in the pictures, and extremely lightweight, fits in my pocket and is not a bother. It features a full color main screen, and a black and white screen on the front that displays the time, signal strength, battery life, caller ID etc...The features on it are also amazing, and t-zones is great, a service from t-mobile which allows unlimited wireless WAP access for only 5$ a month. AOL instant Messenger is also very handy for talking with friends, but it does cost 5 cents for every message sent or received so you have to be careful because the messages add up.  There are some oddities with the WAP browser, and the games are somewhat low-level but otherwise a great phone!
I love my e105 Samsung to pieces!  The reception is excellent, it's easy to use, no dropped calls and it weighs practically nothing.  As far as the kiosk, I was looking for a phone to replace the Sony Ericson phone that I had bought when I activated my T-Mobile service.  Unfortunately, I bought the Samsung e105 at a kiosk that sells T-Mobile service and phones but are not associated with T-Mobile.  I then had to call T-Mobile to straighten out their lies.  I asked to transfer my existing phone number to the new phone, the salesperson gave me a new phone number, instead and told me that the old phone number would automatically transfer to the phone after two weeks and the new phone number would be removed.  Instead of this happening, I was charged for two phone numbers on my next bill and had to call T-Mobile.  I explained this to the representative who told me that I was lied to and she straightened out the problem for me.  On top of that, the salesperson at the kiosk gave me a car charger that was not compatable with the e105.  When I used the charger it locked up all functions on my phone so had to visit a T-Mobile store and they replaced it for me for free.A salesperson at a kiosk, I was told, is only trying to make a sale.  Honesty is not one of their virtues.
I agree with above reviews' reports of good reception and battery life.  I've had no problem with the vibrate alert feature - it works fine for me.  The screen IS tough to see in bright daylight, but I counter that by angling the screen away from the sun and can function just fine.  My biggest complaint? The supplied ringtones are nothing short of bizarre.  It's easy enough to download new ones (my present one is the Star Trek red alert siren), but one would hope that Samsung could at least supply some decent ones.  Perhaps it's a Korean/US cultural difference.Anyhow, it's a great phone that's serving me very well.
Bought it in January. Very nice phone, good voice quality, nice screen. All rebates worked ($100 from T-Mobile + $150 from Amazon). I have mixed experience with previous Samsung phone - N105 - I have it since over 2 years and it works great but it looks ugly (all paint is gone), but compared to phones(and problems) my friends have, Samsung is the best.
I too have put off buying a cell phone but let me tell you that I absolutely love the Samsung e105!  I get a strong signal (T-Mobile) everywhere I go without it dropping a line.  Regarding the slow response when you open the phone does not exist on my phone.  It's on before the screen opens all the way, no delay what so ever.  It's very small and light which is what I was looking for in a phone since I carry an iPAQ also.  The only bad thing that I can say about this phone is that I can't transfer backgrounds or rings tones from my Windows XP box via IR.  My computer will recognize the phone but the phone won't accept any files.  But I can also download them from my service provider for a fee.One thing I love about my service plan (T-Mobile) is that it's free to talk to my girlfriend when ever and where ever unlimited!  I think of the people that use the Nextel one-way walky talky feature and I glad that I can call my other T-Mobile friends and family for free.
I brought this after using several Nokia's. The software and the ease of use is not as great as the Nokia's but boy this phone is just great. I switched from AT&T and the service in the Silicon Valley is just great. The best way to enter the telephone #'s is to use the pc and the web and xfer it to your phone. It beats the hell out of me as to why T-Mobile sends everything as a mobile #'s but there is a way you can change it by using the "Copy" command. I have tried it and it works.The biggest problem that I have is that the ring+vibrate don't work together. Other than a few minor issues, I love this phone, it is quite compact the sound is great (a little bit of static could be heard) and the T-Mobile service is great. People complain about this phone before actually getting used to the various ways of doing things. I wish Samsung makes it a little bit more logical and intutive. This phone not a bad idea at all.
The good stuff: Tiny profile, very durable (dropped mine a few times), the color screen is swank, rings are LOUD enough to hear when your stereo is on, battery will keep you talking for a few hours, and the keys are lit for night-time dialing.  I also particularly like the ability to see who's calling before flipping open the phone, though it is configurable to be able to open without answering the call, which was the main reason why I selected this over similar folding phones.The bad news: T-Mobile charges for text messages, and there is no way to block any that are unwanted.  The phone is locked to a SIM card, so be aware of that.  The screen is hard to see in the sunlight, but then aren't they all?  Sometimes people call you and your phone won't pick it up (even if you are staring at 2 bars while they call you).  The call quality is tinny like someone else said, but I think that has more to do with T-Mobile than the phone.  Aside from that, it has AIM on it, which is silly to me (particularly since my plan charges for each message), but maybe somebody likes that stuff...I have to say that I especially like its durability (Samsung makes some tough-as-nails phones, my dog bit a hole in my old samsung and it still worked afterwards).  Having dropped it a few times and sent it skidding across concrete, the finish is all scratched up, but the screens are in tact and it still serves its function.
this is a good bare-bones phone.  it doesn't have a camera but it does just about everything else.  the external screen isn't color but how often do you look at that anyway besides checking the time?  its major plus is that it's tiny and weighs nearly nothing.
My E105 worked fine until about two months after purchase when it developed this set of peculiar problems -1. Once turned off, the phone could not be turned back on.2. Problem 1 could be bypassed by either having the phone plugged in to the AC charger or by popping out and popping in the battery.3. Once turned off, the phone would sporadically turn itself on. Thumbs-up to T-Mobile customer service on this one. When I called in initially, they said it was likely the battery that was causing the problem - a few days later I received a fresh battery which did not fix my problem. A second call resulted in a replacement phone which now seems to be working fine.Pros: Unit's small handprint, its relative ease of use and the great offer from T-Mobile.Cons: Slow keystroke response, hard to read the display in sunlight, no auto time update and poor selection of ringtones.Four stars for the phone/service package.
I agree with just about all the other comments, and want to add two more.  First is the painful way to send email - not text messaging - to others.  You can't set up an email address in your phone book and simply send a message there; nooooo... you have to type in the other person's email address as the first line of your message, then guess how many characters will be used as a subject, then type your message; you actually send it to "500."Here's the rub - the email address has to be part of the message, not where you send the note to!  The T-mobile techie said the only way to "automate" that is to set up your templates as email addresses.  So you can only include 9 email addresses (if you blow up all your existing templates).  That's so ridiculous.  Just about everyone has an email address now, why do we have to monkey around with this klunky way to send to emails?The second thing about this phone is its small size.  It's almost too small.  It keeps slipping around in my hand.  I was tossing up between this one and the Motorola V300, which has slightly rubberized trim; I'm almost wishing I had gotten that one (except I've heard horrid things about Moto's phones).I'm not overwhelmed with the T-mobile network's sound quality, but I had such a bad experience at ATT that I made the switch.  I'm still deciding if I keep T-mobile and the phone or head back to ATT.
I have had this phone for about 8 months now. I purchased it through amazon which was great and I've got all of my phones through amazon.The pros:Very nice screenRingtones sound nice and clearexternal screensmall sizeeasy to usecan store 1250 numbers including sim cardNow the cons:The battery dies very quickly after about 2 hours of talking its completely dead and it doesnt give you a wanring it just shuts offIt sometimes cuts offThe screen is sometimes slow to move from screen to screen (mainly with games)no speakerphoneno voice dialingThis is a good phone, if I were to buy a new phone I would only say to try and find one with a long lasting battery because thats what Im tryin to do now.
Overall, I'm thrilled with this phone, because it excels at the 2 criteria that are by far the most important to me: pocketability, and reception/voice quality. I've been very happy with T-Mobile, too,Worst drawbacks to me:- Clock isn't automatically synched to cell towers, and loses ~3 minutes/month.- Lack of easy porting of Outlook contact info- Inability to store notes on the phone. Only way to do this is to text message yourself, but can't put a subject on the text message, just an automatically assigned 3-digit number.I like the vibrate before ring mode, but would prefer vibrate, then vibrate & ring. WAP's too slow, small and cumbersome for me to bother with. Voice activated dialling would be nice, but speed dial does the job. A non-fancy (ring-ring) ring tone would have been nice, too.YMMV depending on your needs, but for me, I'd buy it again in a flash.
This phone is great for those who don't want much from their phone. If all you want to do is talk and text, this phone is for you. Very compact and has great reception- much better than the motorolas. I will not go into detail about all the pros and cons about this phone since there are plenty of other reviews that will tell you that. I would like to note two things, however:1.) If you dislike the ringtones that came with your phone, you can download a standard ring from t-zones- it will cost $1.49. If you call 611 and tell customer care that you are disappointed that there are no regular ringers that came with the phone, you might be able to download the standard ringer for free.2) If you don't want to put out a lot of money right now for this phone and wait several months for the rebates (it took me over 2 months to get mine), you can buy the phone directly from T-Mobile [...]
It appears after about a year to a year and a half these Samsung phones lose their screens. Replacing my Samsung S105 phone because of this issue as well, Seen someone else on here have the same problem as me with the E105. Going with a different phone this time. If it wasnt for this problem I would rate these phones highly, but without the screens it makes it into just a regular run of the mill phone with no options. And a pain to have to power it on and off after about every other use.
I have been nothing but pleased with this phone.  In the past, I always got the cheapo freebie phones whenever I renewed my plan, but this time decided it was time to upgrade.I haven't had any of the problems some people have mentioned -- The color screen is nice, I can actually hear the phone ring in my purse, and its tiny so I can even slip it in my pocket without it stabbing me in the gut.And, yeah, it doesn't have a camera, but thats not a feature that I need as I already have a digital camera.I think its a good buy overall.  I have been pleased with it.And, T-Mobile's phone service is outstanding and you get more for your money.  600 minutes a month a free nights and weekends and truly no roaming for $39.99.  You can't beat that with a stick!
This phone works great, sure there are some minor flaws.  It can't ring and vibrate at the same time which I liked from my Nokia.  The ring tones are much liuder though, and polyphonic which makes downloading tones fun.  Sometimes the screen will stay black for a few seconds when opened.  It might be because Iv'e dropped it though.  Small Compact and Useful!  Buy this phone if your looking for a new one!
I just got this phone on Monday. Despite the fact it was $200, its a great phone. It did come with a $100 rebate so its really $100 after tax, anyway, its a great phone. It has excellent picture quality, well at least way better than my previous Motorola T720i (with Camera). I would tell anyone to buy this phone. Really I would mostly suggest this phone to the young folks, like myself. Its great features, such as AIM, Polyphonic Ringtones, Audio Cips, etc. will keep any teenager occupied..lol All in all, great phone, I give it 5 stars. (...)
I am new to the cell phone era, but I am glad I waited until now. I have been able to see people all around me get them and see what problems they encountered.I am very pleased with the phone and service I get from T-Mobile. I have not had any problems making or reciving calls from where ever I have been. I have even been able to get service when other could not. I generally have at least 4 lines on reception and others around me have all they can do to get 1.The phone was very easy to setup and learn. I like the online feature of adding people to the address book. Makes it so much easy to load that.I was also very pleased with the service I got from Amazon. Phone was shipped very fast. I had an issue with the first one I got (has discoloration on outside) and they resolved the problem immediately. Couldn't ask for more from a company.All in all I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who would ask.
I was attracted to this Samsung flip phone mainly because of its size and external caller ID, and because of Amazon's unbeatable "make money after purchase" rebate deal.  After having it for about 6 months, I'm ready to trade it in.  Here's what I dislike about it:1. Its reception is fair at best.  I often have to stand by windows/go outside to get a clearer signal even when I have plenty of signal bars.2. The preloaded ringtones are all obnoxious.  There's not a "normal" ring in the bunch (I eventually had to download one).3. Menu access response times are laggy (often 1- to 2-second pause after a button is pushed before a menu will come up, sometimes longer).4. The time and date must be manually changed; the phone isn't linked to a time server (can be a hassle if you change time zones frequently).5. When it's flipped shut, sometimes the phone will turn off without warning.6. The phone's screen is hard to read in direct sunlight.7. The up/down key on the side of the phone does not control anything useful, such as changing ring volume, etc, when the phone is not in use.  Instead it controls the keypad volume (yeah, that's REALLY useful...)What I do like about the E105:1. It's very small and light2. It's very durable.3. The battery life is decent.4. The external display is nice.In conclusion, the cons outweigh the pros by far... when my contract is up I'll probably stick with T-Mobile but definitely switch phones.
I upgraded from the Sony Ericsson T300 to this phone and I think this one is fab!! I use it practically all day. It is a small and sleek flip, the outer caller ID is great. The menus were a bit confusing to navigate at first, but after having it two days it became second nature. The sound quality on calls is excellent, and having AIM is awesome! I have friends on T-mobile and the text messaging is a hot ticket!! The whole organizer section (calendar, alarm, to-do list, calculator and phone book) makes this phone practically indispensible to me. Add cool Java games and a huge selection of ring tones (and the ability to download more) and I don't know how I ever lived without it.I have two minor complaints - one is the number of steps it takes to delete things (numbers from the phone book, text messages, etc.), I have to go into the message, click options, select delete and then confirm (my old phone was half as many steps). The other feature missing is personalized ringtones (different rings for different callers).
This is my first cell phone and while it has it's share of negatives (the same negatives that many phones have), I am very pleased I ended up with it. It is small, but flips out to a rather "full sized" profile to fit your face pretty nicely and clips to your belt unobtrusively. Here are the major features I bought it for and what I now think of them:0. Size - it had to be small, and it is. It is fairly tiny. I ended up purchasing a CellStar leather case/beltclip for it (which I would highly recommend, available at BestBuy, where I got mine...it's a pretty well thought-out and well-made piece), which makes it a fair amount wider and more "conventionally-sized," but at least it is conventionally-sized when *protected* from drop damage, etc.Thumbs up for size.1. Voice notes - I was hoping I'd be able to get rid of my current digital voice recorder, but no such luck: you only get five voice notes at a maximum of thirty seconds each. What's more, you have to go through all sorts of steps just to record a blasted note (Menu > Organizer > Voice Memo > Record > Record (again, to actually start it) > Stop)...what a pain! Well, I guess I'm keeping my Digital Voice Recorder for now.2. Easy entry of a phone number - I would say this is *pretty* easy, except for one thing: the LOUSY text entry. All you do is enter the number, then hit "Save," then go through the process of selecting where you want it saved (SIM or phone memory...you SHOULD be able to just set this to a default to skip this step, but you can't), and naming it. The memory location selection thing adds an unnecessary step, in my opinion, making this process *just* step over the point of being annoying, Ultimately, it gets faster as you learn it.As an aside, I'd like to say that while I didn't give other phones as much attention as I gave this one, the text entry on this unit is really awful, and not terribly intuitive: I've played with other units that are automatically in "Ab" mode (first letter capitalized, remaining letters lower-case), but here you generally have to switch to that mode with far-flung keys in different corners of the pad. What's more, the "T9" mode (where you press a key once and it matches the keys with known words to try to guess what you are trying to say) is pretty much a joke: out of every three words I attempt, it maybe gets one right. Well, it generally does select an actual word, just not the one you want! This means you have to back-track and redo it, but first you must switch to "uppercase/lowercase" mode, blah, blah, blah.To sum the aside up, TEXT ENTRY is a PAIN. It should just default to Uppercase/lowercase mode right away, and let you select the not-always-awesome T9 mode if you wish.Other than those two main features, anything else would be icing on the cake. This unit, as mentioned previously, has no voice-activated dialing. This is not ideal, as I'd like to be able to shout a name into the phone in my car and have it do it's thing, but at least it does have speed dials. Plus, in public, I wouldn't want to be using voice-actived dialing, anyways, so it's not a total wash.The front display is nice and is nicely backlit. It has all the expected icons (voicemail, sms, signal strength, battery power, and then the time printed large with the date as well).The color screen on the inside of the unit is very nice looking, certainly brighter and prettier than others I saw in the T-Mobile store. Setting the settings is relatively easy, as is navigating through the menus and stuff.Changing the volume is easy and intuitive, right to the side of the unit. It has an IrDA transceiver on it's other side, as well, and has some IrDA functions, which I  don't use!The reception outside is always five bars, but inside it can dip as low as one bar pretty easily. This is in our thick-walled house; I was warned about T-Mobile service in our area (Verizon was recommended), but T-Mobile had better minute deals and such.Browsing WAP sites is pretty OK. The phone certainly can't just take any old site and give it to you; it seems a little erratic in what it can and cannot do. Some sites have surprised me and have displayed, while others just wouldn't display. Any WAP site is fine, generally speaking. Yahoo, Google, MSN, Dictionary.com, etc. is great.The video games you get are super-boring. The only good one is chess, but the lack of a mouse and having to use small-ish keypad buttons make it slightly more tedious than it's worth. There is a silly pipe-connecting game, a bubble-popping/pattern game and some other one so uninspiring I can't even remember what it is. I'd like to download more, but they are $3.99 each, so FORGET that. (I checked on the mystery game and it's some golf game...not at all as EXCITING as it might sound).I'm not able to comment on the battery life with any certainty at this point. I charged it fully the first time yesterday and it lasted until this morning, after a day of heavy usage. This could be good, I guess, since keeping a charge days on end would result from only occasional usage, I presume.All in all, I am pleased. The unit is my first, but there are no glaring deficiencies, so I am generally pleased, if not without a real frame of reference. Plus, this thing actually made me some money after rebate, so I have no complaints all around.
-  Could not sinc with anything using the IR port (Even if it could, it would only come in not out)  I tried pocket PC's, Palms, and a Nokia phone (My old one with all my numbers in it)-  I took it back to the store due to a Huge Huge huge feed back problem with 2 different high end Headsets (Jabra and Plantronix)  I also found that even the second one would cause feedback on my PC Speakers from 3 feet away as well.  I plan to take it back again.-  Online, T-Mobile had a great idea to allow you to input names and numbers but forgot to add a check for Mobile, work, home etc.  Theres no way on the phone to change the type of number once it's in the phone.  They all come in as Mobile.-  No way to move a number from the Sim to the phone or vice versa.- Ring tones are very juvinile- Vibrate then ring not both at the same time.  Seems like a must to me.- Entering phonebook entries was a pain using the phone.  I wanted to use the sentence case and it kept switching back to caps only each time I created a new entry.-  The phone was free after rebates and I'm going to take it back before I get stuck with it for a year.
I had a Motorola v60 and upgraded to the Samsung E105.I love the phone and it has a ton of great features.One of the main reasons I purchased this phone was so I could download new ringtones.The phones accesses T-Zones with no problem but when you try to download ringtones it tells you that the handset is not recognized and the phone is not currently supported.I called T-Mobile and they said that they know about the problem and it should be fixed shortly.That was over a month ago and still it is not recognized.
This Samsung is a great quality phone that you often see from samsung.  I am an Industrial Designer and the design and engineering of this phone is amazing.  You can't beat the price either.  If you want a good solid, long lasting phone, that looks good and is not so hard on the cash flow then I definitely recommend this one.
I have da this phone for 2 months now and it works fine.  Compared to the Nokia (Cingular) and Motorola i60 (Nextel) I had previously, this phone is a winner.  Voice clearity is great unless you are in a bad spot.  T-Mobile's network is not is broad as competitor's but in major cities and along Interstates the phone and service are great.  The functionality of the phone is also good.  People with bigger hands will have trouble operating with one hand due to its size.  You can download polyphonic as well as HiFi ringtones that sound very good and are loud.  One can assign ringtones to 10 different caller groups which is neat.  T-Zones requires some practice and adaptation time to set up alerts and personal settings but it is very helpful.(...)Enjoy!
This phone is a really great buy, it is so easy to use and so lightweight--a great improvement from my old phone.  my only problem with it is that the buttons are a bit hard to dial because they are so smooth and small, it is a little tricky to hold the phone and dial with one hand, other than that, I highly reccomend it.
I got this phone in the end of December.  My previous phone was the similarly-sized Motorola v66.  All in all, this phone is about the same as that one.  Reception seems to be good and the ring and voice volumes are superb.  the color screen is a very welcome change.  The only gripe that I have is that it doesn't have all the nice features of some of the other phones (voice dialing, camera, bluetooth).  I was seriously considering the SE T610, but decided against it becuase it was not a flip phone.  Also, I can't seem to get the infrared port working.  I got my computer to detect it, but I was not able to send any images or files to it.  I agree with earlier reviews that the ring tones are a bit annoying.
I had a S105 before this which was more substantial and also a tri-band (this is a dual band).  This seems to have cheaper construction overall.  Tinier buttons than the S105 AND A MUCH POORER Color screen.  Impossible to read in daylight.Has "hidden" feature not in the book.  If you bump the volume while it is ringing, it will send the call to voicemail.  There is no way to shut this feature off.Sound quality is decent but give me back my S105!!!!(I had to trade it in for this thing).
I have had this phone for about six months now and overall i have been pleased with its functionality. However, I must agree with many of the other reviewers concerning the ring tone issue and the lagging menus. Out of all the ringers they could not put one basic ringer that could be assigned thus I keep my phone on silent mode which is sometimes an annoyance when I am unable to notice the vibration. Another downside is that the ringers itself are not that loud this could be related to the phones size since it is does not hold a large speaker. The menus are another problem for when you turn on the phone sometimes it takes up to two mintues for the phonebook or the SMS service to initiate. My biggest issue is with the t-mobile service itself. In my house my service does not work at all but once i step outside i get service. t-mobile may have great service plans in terms of minutes, extras, and prices but their service is not as good as its cracked up to be. Also they fail to send me my bill in the mail and continue to send my text messages on my phone reminding me to pay my bill. I would liek to see what i am being billed for infine print because i dont want to pay any extra charges without knowing about them.I have addressed this issue but it continues to go on. Again this phone is good but it has is flaws, so if your looking for style but something simple you should have a look but if your looking for more features other than a color screen you may want to look at the motorola V300 on t-mobile. Also ask around about t-mobile in your area. Friends and families opinions may help with your overall decision of this carrier. Look at nextel or verizon if your looking for consistent service and customer help as I have heard. I would recomend t-mobile to people who talk a great deal or for teens looking for stylish and less expensive phones and service.
I was an AT&T; customer with a Siemens model phone. I do think Siemens is a great company but when I saw this E105 I just loved it. I am now a T-Mobile customer and was able to bargain for this phone for free (with rebate). The color screen is great and easy to read. While there is no voicedial, the speed dial function makes up for that in my opinion. It's compact, and as someone said, the buttons are not too small so it is hard to misdial. One reason I decided on this phone was because it has the option to be connected to the Worldclass service. As someone who travels outside the country 3 or 4 times a year it's a great add-on (and with T-Mobile, you only pay for what you use). I've never had problems with reception and in fact one friend even commented on the fact that it was not fuzzy at all and was surprised that I was driving to work and could not hear any background noise, (ie radio, the funny sounds my car makes. lol). I even walked into work, which is a call center and he could not tell the difference. I highly recommend this useful phone. Well it's usefull for those of us who can live without the bells and whistles of sync technology/bluetooth/blackberry stuff. Definitely worth the investment
A T-mobile station in Milpitas California charged me $200 for this phone,(...) Shame on me.I used a Treo 270 before (more on that elsewhere) and this phone as a PIM is a joke.  The Samsung software just does not work consistantly.  It has crashed my XP system twice (blue screen of death)It is a cute phone, and is flexible in tune download for ring tones, and I like the AIM interface.
The title says it all. If you are looking for a small phone to use as a phone, then this Samsung will do you good. If you're looking for a smartphone/pda, you might want to look elsewhere.I've had my E105 for about a month and it has worked like a charm. My reception has been great (T-mobile) and battery life good. The flip phone design is sleek and saves on space. It's a pretty slim phone and will fit into any pocket.BUT the handset volume is low overall, so it should be avoided by those with hearing impairments. People seem to complain that you can't see the screen in direct sunlight, but for the most part all color screens have this same behavior. The outside display though is black and white and can be seen fine in the sunlight.As far as being a good PDA with PIM features, this phone lacks. But it does have a calendar with useful alarm features. It has infrared but no easy way to sync your phonebook with a PC without purchasing software.
It works, gave no problems as of now. I've been using the phone since 4 months. I liked the sleek built. I didn't like the  default ringtones. You can hardly read from the screen in the sunlight.
Pros:  Lightweight and slimCons:  Can't see the screen in daylight.  Don't buy this phone if you plan on using it outdoors(and who doesn't?).  You can adjust the brightness but it doesn't help.  As other users have mentioned, the ring tones are juvenile and useless.  I also agree that the menus are slow and the phone sometimes takes a while to catch up.  External caller ID is very small and hard to read.  Not very good sound quality on phone - sounds "tinny."
The phone is great. I would like to have some normal rings with it but I keep mine on "cool" and it works for me. Very durable and easy to use for me. Not all the bells other phones have but I was looking for a phone to talk on only, not take pictures. Worth the money.
This phone is OK, just OK.  These are my gripes: 1. the alarm has no snooze option, 2. you can't see the screen in the sun at all, and 3. the ring tones are as lame as they come.  There is no simple ring tone, like a phone, they all have people singing or counting or cats meowing or someting stupid that would only be cool if you are in high school.If these 3 issues did not exsist, I would give this phone a 5.
A great small phone. Very small and easy to use. And I have assigned ring tones to differnt friends and family. Matt said he couldn't(?)  Drawbacks are  screen could be brighter--and battery must be charged daily.
I was very pleased in this phone that I bought through amazon. It barely weighs a thing and is very durable with so many wonderful extras such as AOL and Text Messaging! Also the rings that are available for this phone are awesome. Also even after 2 days without turning it off and much usage, it only had gone down 1 power bar with plenty more to spare. Also my cell phone came super quick in the mail, even through free shipping which was a definite surprise. This is a phone that everyone should own!
This phone is great.  I got it a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it.  It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.  I highly reccomend this phone and rate it 5 stars!
This phone has all the needed features for a stylish and yet very useful flip cell phone. It does not have some wanted features such as assigning ring tones to individual callers, but all in all this phone does more than i thought it would and i love it. One word of advice, make sure u get a good plan. Trust me!!
Hi i just recieved this phone a few days ago. I am 13 years old and thought that the color and the size was cool so i got the phone. I ordered the sony ericsson t610 but heard it was no good so i rejected the delivery. Even though the e 105 lacks the now very common camera you have to ask yourself how much would you really use it? Sure there are some moments where you wish you had a picture but come on. this phone is very reliable yet has a few minor flaws. First of all, this isnt a big thing but, sometimes the screen stays black when you open it. other times when  you dial the numbers wont come up for a while. however the phone has many other features that are cool. I would recommend it over anything but the samsung e715 and the motorola v300. BUt overall it is a exellent phone and i would recommend it for the 80 dollars they give you to take it
this a great phone, i works very good and it has easy ( and I mean Easy) Menu. Also that it very lightwight sometimes i have to check my pockets to see if i have it. I got mine for my b-day and it is was free with a 100.00 off cupon from samsung and 50.00 becasue it was a one-year agreement. This is the best phone ever and also it is a great small, lightwieght phone that is under 200.00. T-Moblie also has great serive you can get 0.99 cent ringtones (so many to chose from) from T-Moblie's websire  coverage area i have never called T-Moblie about anything. But this phone has some drawbacks the buttons are to small for big people hands. That is the only bad thing about this phone. If you are interested about getting you should get this phone !!!!!!! trust me !!!!!!
I got this phone for Christmas and I absloutely adore it!  It has so many nice features and tons of ringtones.  If you're like me and you like to check your email and go on the internet on your phone, this cell phone is perfect!  I go on the internet all the time for only $2.99 a month!  You can download some really fun games and ringtones and you can play games on the internet also.  I love this phone, I've had no problem with it yet and I can't think of any bad things about it!
I received this cell phone in Febuary, and I loved it.  The colors, the sounds, everything.  And then, four months later, it doesn't work very well.  The screen doesn't turn on right away when I flip the phone open.  It shuts off in the middle of conversations.  The reception is awful.  AWFUL.  It seems like it is just put together poorly.  Good luck if you buy this phone.
I got my E-105 phone in December 2003 and within 6 months, i have to get my phone replaced twice because of the following problem.The Phone Shutsdown after i talk and close the flip. This occurs randomly. I guess its because of a short. The same thing happened in the replacement phone also. The only good part about it is the T-Mobile Service. They were patient to hear my concerns and send a replacement phone.
It's really an average phone, and there's nothing to be excited about. It has its own pros and cons, but I doubt that I could put it in the top ten. Somebody mentioned that it can play chess, but, come on, it can only move the pieces!Pros:1. Small2. Light3. Has one international bandCons:1. Buggy: ring+vibration does not work2. No voice dialing3. Annoying pre-set ring tones4. Infrared is not compatible with anything5. Phonebook needs a lot of improvement
This is a good phone overall.  The only problem is it is almost impossible to see the screen outside in the sunlight.  Other than that, this phone is a good one.
Cons: (Coz i am all about cons!)1) Bad reception, compared to Nokia 6010 (same service same place, E105 fails whereas Nokia goes on)2) Only one alarm (one daily and one one time)am used to 3 alarms or atleast a snooze option3) it takes too long (at least 3 key strokes) to change the ringer volume, plus it rings as you change it, (irritating)3) Bad ring tones to start with4) is not as easy to flip open with one hand as the other models5) well ... it does look a lil girlishpros: well .. just to be fair and defend myself here ..1) nice n light2) hides in your pocket3) overall great reception when outdoors or in the city
This phone ir really good.its light and small so it wont be a bother to carry.it as polyphonic ringtones that sound REALLY good.it has AIM so whenever im away from home i can go on aol.it is a color phone with beautiful picturesA+++ highly recommended!
My family & I purchased this phone (6 phones) more than a yr ago. I was very excited at first b/c the phone works very well and much nicer than my previous Motorola phone. I liked many functions, ring tones & graphic that it offers. But unfortunately we've experienced a lot of problems w/ this phone after a good 6 months! Like some other customers in here have already said, the phone shuts off during conversation. Sometimes the phone is on but the screen is out! You can't see anything..  and this happens to all our phones! I don't know how long should a cell phone last but I dont think a year is very long... well we got our phones for free (after rebates) so can't really complain... just want to share w/ everyone my exp.. My family members are getting the new Samsung E715 soon.. they have a great promo on it until 8/25 too..
I bought this phone, seeing pretty good reviews for it. The part of the screen not turning on for a while is true, but it does not happen that often. The screen on the outside broke quickly also.  I have to live with it, becuase Samsung will repair it for more than i paid for the phone, and T-mobile will give me a refurbished one for 70. The phone is pretty good, but the last thing, is that the plastic part in the outside of the phone, that the screen on (on the oustide of the phone) , is coming off. (the part of the phone that says samsung on the top of the phone)Over all, I would never of choosed another phone
No speed-dial preview on screen... No icons on phonebook list view... Long phone book initialization wait... No voice dial... Caller ID on front but no reject button outside (open to reject...so much for open to answer)... way too many keystrokes required to be considered user friendly as a phone. Samsung makes great phones for Sprint so it must be that the fools at T-Mobile need to stop marketing to the video game playing market and get serious about making a phone! My suggestion would be to look elsewhere if you want a serious phone. I am sorry I switched phones and carriers.
This cell phone has wonderful features, but the battery does not last. I charged it fully, let it stay on standby without using it, and the phone was dead in 36 hours. I am very disappointed.
me like. but must be recharged almost daily.
Save your money. Even if these rebates are true. Whoever you have as a cell carrier, even if your using an 80s style brink phone - your getting better service. Yes this phone is filled with fun colored crap. But even that becomes a problem. This phone likes to stop and think. Often it will take up to 4 seconds after you open the flip for it to 'wake up'. On top of this you'll start pressing buttons, and nothing will happen for 4-5 seconds and it'll finally start doing soemthing. Its not just my phone. Other people I know have the same problem with this model. I live on the northside of Chicago, and have to go outside to use my phone to get an acceptable quality to understand anyone. I can't tell if this is t-mobile or the phone, all I know is that t-mobile bought voicestream, which was known as the worst carrier in the nation. It seems they haven't improved muched.
13 months old, now doesn't work.  Shutting the flip lid will cause the lcd on the cover to shut off and causes the color screen to shut off, requiring restart of the phone.  probably my last samsung mobile phone.
I bought this phone from Cingular about 3 months ago.  I still have not been able to use all of its features, because I do not understand what they are talking about, and Cingular is too busy to help (but they were not too busy to sell it to me).  My son's contract with Cingular is up in February, and he will take this phone.  I am going to find a simpler phone with a different company.  Some of the problems I have had are the volume and the phone's features.  It waivers among too loud, scratchy, and non-existent.  Also, the instruction book is NOT specific enough for me, and this limits my usage of the phone.  And this is a very tiny phone--in the beginning I lost it frequently, and I had to dial the number to find it.  The battery life is OK.  And I LOVE that I can call people all over the United States for FREE.
I ordered two phones to use in a family plan.  I recieved the first phone within a week, the second phone is not even delivered yet after 4 weeks.. I know it is not the phones fault, it is amazon..But, the phone is missing some feature that are neccesary, my old samsung phone allowed me to adjust the volume of the phone using the up/down button on the side. This phone i have to go through the sound menu, way to cumbersome and difficult to adjust the volume of the ringer. That is my biggest complaint thus far.
WELL, THE PHONE IS NICE, BUT T-MOBILE IS HORRIBLE. I HAD A BUZZING NOISE IN THE BACK OF THE PHONE AND I HAD TO TALK TO 3 REPS BEFORE THEY WOULD SEND ME A NEW ONE. I KNOW OTHERS WITH THE SAME PHONE AND THEY JUST COME WITH MOSQUITOES INSTALLED IN THEM. PHONES A LITTLE SLOW. NOT VERY DURABLE. BUT OTHERWISE OK. I WOULD NEVER GET IT AGAIN THOUGH.
PRO: strong signal, clear-cut reception, lightweight, user friendly, sturdy built, best of all is "made in Korea" not China.CONS: just adequate features compared to other higher end models, but if you just are casual type, you won't need those extra bells and whitsle, screen is not as vivid as E315.
I got this phone back in November and of course I was very excited. It was working great for about 2 weeks, and that's when the trouble started. I began noticing that when I flipped the phone open, the screen didn't come up right away. I've waited anywhere from 5-20 seconds for the screen to light up, which may sound short, but when you are needing to use the phone, it's a real problem. However, I wanted to give it a fair chance so I kept using it, even though the screen still was not working day after day and it was getting worse. I began noticing that the more you do on the phone, the slower it gets - and I mean sssllloooo[...] But it wasn't until the phone turned itself off that I stopped using it. That's right - I just closed the phone and it turned itself off for no reason, even though I didn't touch anything. It was then that I bought my new Nokia 6010, the best phone. It is way better and more durable and I love it. Don't mess with this Samsung E105 though, believe me, you will regret it. Along with the annoying problems I listed, it also has crappy ringtones. Get the Nokia 6010 for T-Mobile and toss this thing.
This phone is nice and small and has some neat features but the sound quality in general is poor and the sound fades in and out.The phone is not exactly Irish tough either.
My husband and I purchased a Sony Ericsson T610 and a Samsung E 105 in July 2004.  We had cell phone service from Sprint PCS on a family plan and wanted to keep our existing phone numbers. We checked all the instructions on amazon.com and with T-Mobile on how to purchase individual phones, switch to a family plan, and port our numbers over.  When we got the phones we were successful in porting our numbers over and were very happy with both phones.  Then we got two bills - one for our phone numbers from Sprint PCS, and one from phone numbers we didn't recognize and never heard of.  Apparently the phone numbers assigned to the phones from amazon.com were never cancelled when we ported the Sprint PCS phone numbers over.  Repeated calls to T-Mobile customer service were not helpful - they told us stock answers like disregarding the bill, or that the billing cycle hadn't caught up with the customer service computers, etc. etc. etc. At about the 6th phone call to the company, a customer service rep was able to cancel the account and credit it so we didn't owe them any money for these phantom phone numbers.  We were very excited that this was finally resolved and gave this rep's supervisor a glowing report.  Case closed... or so we thought. We received a final bill for this account that had all sorts of adjustments but still said we owed $41.06.  Two more phone calls to the company came up with nothing but assurances that this would be taken care of.  One rep even scheduled a follow-up call to tell me that it went through, but never actually called.  Today on the answering machine was the standard recording for code 100 (which means I didn't pay the bill).  One more call this evening (October 15, 2004, 3 months after we purchased the phones initially) with me masquerading as SuperBitch got me assurances that this would be rectified in 2 hours. Well, I'm not holding my breath.  We like the phones and have no problem with the account that we're supposed to be paying on. It's the account that never should have existed that's the issue.  If you're in a situation like we were, make absolutely sure that whatever phantom phone numbers that existed are cancelled as soon as you port your phone numbers over. Better yet, use a different phone service.
I left Verizon which I now painfully regret.  I can not use my cell for any business out of fear of dropping and broken conversations that happen 90% of the time.  I had a business trip to New York in which it'd drop every call after a minute.  Do not sign up with T-Mobile.  I later found out that it's a "mutt service" that only borrows time on other towers.
I'm not sure if it is just the fact that this phone is on a T-Mobile GSM network, but you have to set the time by hand.  If you  travel, your time will be incorrect.  Give me two cans and a string.  Very, very ghetto...I wish I hadn't canceled my verizon phone.  SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT LISTING THIS PROBLEM AMAZON!
My boyfriend has this phone and it is so neat I've never owned a phone like this but as soon as I can I will have one just like it. Everyone that sees it goes crazy over it and wants one but none of them has went to get one yet! My boyfriend's boss asks him to use it all the time because the one he has he can't use it because it just won't get out anywhere. So like I said this is an excellent phone to have you don't need a house phone when you have this one. My boyfriend's boss has Verizon and doesn't like it at all. Thank You Sincerly Robin L. Rudy A very loyal customer to T-Mobile for four years.
this phone is just wonderful...it has pretty pics and is super light...i love it!
I really want this phone! and it suits my schools rules for no picture phones!
If you're going to get the best service provider, you might as well get their best phone (the blackberry 7510 is in a category all by itself).  This phone boasts some of my favorite necessities: 600 phone number storage capacity, GPS, and a color display, voice activation, and speaker phone.  I also enjoy the name specific ring tones and color flashes it comes standard with.I read through some of the feedback on this phone and was wanting to clarify some of the ignorance that is being stated.1)  The battery life is typical that of the other Nextel phones.  Not better and not worse.  Charge it every night and you'll be fine (and I talk 4000 minutes a month).  A Nextel phone uses more juice because the phones are setup to "actively seek out a signal."  Other carrier's phones are programmed to sit in a dormant state until the signal "comes to them."  I'm sure you can figure out these advantages on your own...2)  The games are decent at best that come with the phone.  What's important is that you can buy or "obtain" hundreds of games because the phone is java enabled.  A key thing to note is that Nextel's are buisness tools in nature.  Hence, you can note the focus of buisness tools on the phone.  If you're looking for some cheap play toy, you're looking at the wrong carrier.  If you're looking for a status symbol, read on...3)The "No Alarm Clock" feature that I've seen posted is not true.  Think outside the box.  The useful organizer/date book that is included in the phone is there for a reason.  Set an appointment in it for when you want to wake up...4)An account setup fee is typical.  A first month proration fee is also typical among cell companies.  Also, taxes are taxes--you pay the same high percentage no matter who you have.5)Coverage, it depends where you are located.  I'm guessing in the deserts of Arizona you'd have bad coverage.  However, of the 20 or so states I've visited, Nextel has had SUPER coverage.  Just recently I can vouch for about ever Vegas Casino ;D.  Oh, did I mention there is never roaming charges with any plan?6)If you have a tendancy to hit the Walkie Talkie button while it's on your side/in your purse, hit 'menu' then 'star' and lock lock the keypad.  Don't worry, it unlocks auto when someone calls.  Nuff said.7)There is a Vibe/Ring Feature.  Vibe 3 times then ring 3 times.8)The Sprint/Verizon Walkie Talkie's suck.  If you don't believe me try them.  Nextel uses 2 systems in their towers (a duplex and a simplex-one for voice one for 2way).  On a user end, a person 2waying from Florida to Hawaii will note instant connection.  Verizon/Sprint only have 1 system in their towers.  The way they 2way is using 'packets' from the cellular.  What is unavoidable is the packets having to go through the landline telephone network.  Put it this way, make a call and see how long it connects.  Umm, average 5.7 seconds (according to the studies I've read).  Now picture hitting a walkie talkie button and waiting 5.7 seconds for each response.  Again, nuff said.9)Telenav TRACK is incredible and DOES work.  Ask to get a demo and use it like I did.  It talks to you telling you where to turn and even recalcules directions on the fly if you miss an exit.  A+++Well, there was my 2 cents.  If you're curious as to how I know all this stuff, I'm an electrical engineer and like to know everything about the toys I buy...
I have previously owned a Nextel i550, i90 and an i95cl. I just upgraded to the new i730 mainly because of the size factor. Second, Nextel is phasing out the i90 and i95 so I like to make sure I am staying up with the technology as it expands. I use this phone a LOT, mostly for work, but also for personal use.  My only main issues with this phone are the battery life and the size of the screen. I was used to the huge screen of the i95, but I have to admit the color is MUCH better with the 64k color screen of the i730. Battery life seems to be an ongoing issue with Nextel phones, but with all this phone does, I guess it is to be expected. It is odd that Nextel finally switched the "make call" and "end call" button positions on this phone. My guess is that it was in an attempt to make their positions on the keypad standard with the other cell phones on the market. Before this phone, they were always backwards compared with other cell phones. I do miss the "service indicator" light, but it isn't a major issue. The buttons are set up a bit different than my previous Nextel phones, but like with anything else, you get used to it pretty quick. One thing Nextel got away from was the ability to use a home charger and car changer from the old phone, with the new one. They changed the ends so you cannot use the I90 or I95 powercords with the new i730. They do include a home charger with the phone, but be prepared to buy a new car charger when getting this phone.  I like the sleek feel of the case, the thinner profile, the color screen, the ability to (finally) assign ringtones to each caller and the GPS service. A nice touch is the cover that flips over the bottom of the phone where you insert the charger. It may seem a silly touch to most people, but I work outside for my job and I was always concerned with water or dirt getting into the phone and causing damage to the circuit board.  All in all, if you can afford to get this phone, BUY IT! Nextel service, like everyone elses, has their good and bad points but I will stay with them for the long haul. I have had Sprint, Verizon, Blackberry and still currently carry T-Mobile in addition to this Nextel. (only because my company is cheap with their anytime minute allocation! *lol*) If they turned Nextel service off tomorrow, I would immediately go back to a Nextel office to set it right back up! The direct connect feature is addicting and doesn't take away from your cellular minutes. Don't waste time with Verizon's pseudo direct connect. Go with the people that invented the technology...Nextel!  Hopes this review helps. *S*
In Chicago, the GPS NEVER works (and yes I went by the window dozens of times). In the surrounding suburbs, it worked once about 30 miles north of Chicago, so I know it's not broken, unfortunately. TeleNav, the company that sells the GPS mapping service for Nextel phones, will charge you by the kilobyte, which is very mysterious, but comes out to about twenty-bucks a month, in addition to a "total connect" service that Nextel will need to add (for GPS to function), for another ten-bucks monthly. The kicker is when you figure out that your GPS hardly works at all, and you have already signed up for a year's Telenav service, TELENAV WON'T REFUND YOU A SINGLE DIME. "Too bad for you" it didn't work in YOUR area. The Nextel tech that I spoke to (in cancelling "total connect") said TeleNav told them that they should not gaurantee TeleNav to ever function. "There are not enough satelllites at this time". What a bunch of fargin iceholes.Otherwise, it must be stated that I do like Nextel service and the web browser is the best of it's kind. You'll never call info with a "People-Finder", equivalent to White Pages and also a "Business-Finder". Movie times and all that other stuff as well, and "SNOCOUNTRY" tells you the amount of snow at any hill in America. That's nice.
I received the new i730 as a gift for Christmas, one of my many impulse wants :). LOL I have to say the phone is GREAT, I LOVE IT!!! It has many cool features, like GPS, assigned ringtones, light up front and much more. Another thing I noticed is that the speakers are a lot louder compared to the other phones. I also feel like I get better reception with this phone opposed to my i90. There's nothing really bad to say about this phone. If you are a nextel user I'm sure you can agree it is much better than the i90 and the i95. The only thing that I dislike is the way nextel runs business. I think it is ridiculous that they will not cut an existing user the same deal as they would a new user when purchasing the phone. Any other company you go to will honor the same price for an upgrade as they would for a new contract. Instead they think that they are giving you a deal by making you sign another 2 or 1 year contract, and you'll receieve the phone for $250-300 instead of $400 with no contract. It's just something you have to deal with if you want to upgrade the phone and stay with the service. Just something to prepare those who are thinking about signing up with Nextel.As for the service itself, it's pretty good, I never really had a problem with it except when in wooded areas. A plus to this service is also the nationwide direct connect. You can get chirped(walkie talkie) from someone a different state. I say if you have the money get the nextel service and the i730, it's fun to have, but a little pricey :)I LOVE TO LOVE MY I730!! :)
This is the best phone that Nextel offers due to its thinner profile and awesome color screen.  It has a ton of great features for those who are like me and love to fool around with all the extras on any electronic gizmo that I get my hands on.  I do have some getting used to as I was a 2nd generation Nokia user, but the fact that I can actually make a phone call on the i730 makes up for everything else it may lack.  Yeah, there are many other cell phones out there that have cameras, PDA's, MP3 players, portable game consoles and whatever else they want to throw in but what it all boils down to is whether you want a Digital camera with PDA functionality or a phone.  Me, I chose to have a phone because I don't want to pay $50+ a month so I can make calls in the corner of my house standing on one leg carrying a re-shaped wire clothes hanger just to get enough reception to make a phone call on a nifty game-console/mp3-player/pda/digicam/mediocre-phone.Bottom line, when you're done fooling around with all the latest "toys" that Nokia and everyone else is putting out there and are ready to actually make wireless phone calls again, the i730 is what you're looking for.
I have had 5 cell phones in the past 10 years, starting with the original MOTOROLA FLIP-PHONE.  Then I moved over to a NOKIA phone, which was okay, but I was not satisfied.  I moved over to the NEXTEL phone service for my next phone, which was the MOTOROLA i1000 and a couple of years later I bought the i90, which was the phone I have been using until I recently upgraded to the i730.  I have been with NEXTEL for the last 5 years and I am completely satisfied with their professionalism and outstanding service.  The trade-in/buy-back program is wonderful and it definitely the best way to upgrade your phone.  NOW........on to the i730.......WOW..........what an awesome phone!!!!!!!!!  I can't begin to tell you that NEXTEL offers the best MOTOROLA phones then any other carrier.  I have looked at other phones from other carriers and none compare to the i730.  If this is your 1st MOTOROLA phone purchase, you are in for a real treat.  The instructions are well-documented and it doesn't take rocket-science to navigate through the i730 software.  The biggest treat for me is the COLOR screen, the sleek-ness of the phone and it's overall aesthetic beauty.  So if want to be the envy of all your friends, please do yourself a favor and pick up this phone.  Also, once you experience the NEXTEL service, it will definitely be your last and only phone carrier.  PROOF:  I have successfully moved over many friends and family members to NEXTEL and I haven't heard any compliants.  ENJOY!
The perfect phone.  Telenav works great (at least out in the burbs), hacked into it and changed my wallpaper to a family photo, great phone all alround, powers my laptop's net connection too...
I recently upgraded my nextel from an i90c (I dropped it in the water) to the i730 back in early August 2004. So far I love it almost as much as my old i90.The design itself is excellent, very sleek looking. It's alot easier to "personalize" this phone because you can replace the little front cover thing for fairly cheap (I changed mine to a NY Yankees symbol for only $5) instead of changing the whole case, which you can also do. You can change the background, get real songs as ringtones, etc. I also love the mucical light around the front speaker (wish it played with actual song ringtones instead of just normal musical ringtones). The only complaint I have is that it can be exetremely loud when it rings, even on a lower setting.My reception is fairly good with this phone, not as good as my i90 but much better than my old Nokia. I have heard that you can get a patch for the i730 that helps with the reception. The only times I don't have good reception is in some of the classrooms at my school and in the back rooms of my dorm (all of which are 2/3 concrete). I also don't get much signal out in the boonies but that's to be expected.The software on it is great. You have more than enough space for all your contacts, 600 or so. All the programs are great, the calculator is as quick anymore, you actually have to select what you want to do (+,-,*,/) instead of using the scroll buttons, but that's superficial. You also don't get any full games, only demos but I don't think your going to buy a phone based on the games you get.The battery life is the only real problem I have with the phone. I can only go for about 2 days without charging and that's if I don't make any calls or use it at all. The charging is really fast though, usually under 2 hours for me. The only other complaint is that the call buttons are reversed from the i90's so that took a little getting used too.Sorry if this is long but I think its a good phone in general. The only reason it got 4 out of 5 from me is the reception and the battery issues. Hope this helps.
After years of loyalty to the Motorola Startac, I decided I needed a phone with more functionality.  At the same time I was tired of Sprint's horrible service and bad plans.  I got the I730 with the Nextel Nation 1000 Connect plan.  It's great; perfect coverage and the phone is worth whatever you pay for it.  It's less than my first Startac ($399 vs $499) and I am very happy with my Nextel Service (much more clear than Sprint).  A definate recommend for those who require a quality phone rather than something made by Samsung, LG, or Sanyo.  If I could change one thing it would be the battery life, if I forget to charge it at night and I am talking quite a bit I may get a low battery the next day.  I don't complain about that too much though because I am usually connected to AIM all day long and often use my GPS TeleNav on my phone.
I have been a Nextel customer for 2 years, just starting my third, with this phone.  I bought the phone from Amazon and it works great.  The My-Cast service is great, although a little bit more expensive, but provides GREAT weather including full motion color radar for people on the go.  The GPS works great.  Tele-nav has a free compass feature, and if you want maps and full spoken driving directions they offer that for a little bit more cash.  To the person who said no text messaging? That is a service issue and not a phone issue.  I guarantee this (and every other nextel phone I've used) is THE BEST for text messaging.  It just depends on the type of online service you get.  If you get the messaging package, it's $10 a month which gives you unlimited AIM, and unlimited text messages (to and from).  I use the text messages mainly for forwarding important emails to my phone, in addition nextel also offers Mobile Email which allows you to connect to other mailboxes.  As a third option there are java applets that let you browse any page, including SSL pages, and let you connect to any email server, IMAP, POP, etc... but those require a "total connect" (which allows java applets to use the internet) plan.If you like games, the best I've found for this phone are Tetris Deluxe and Pitfall (yes, the same one I played on my atari 2600, full sounds and all).In short this phone does everything you need and probably a whole bunch you don't.  Direct Connect (Walkie), Phone, Mobile email, Mobile weather, Mobile GPS, Mobile browsing.
people, this phone is the best phone ever created. i simply love it. i didnt really plan to get this phone but one night i lost my i95 (which was a great phone) and decided to buy the i730 since it was the newest. The features i love about this phone is the slim size, the 65k color screen, the disco lights that light up when you recieve a call, the gps feature, the arrangement of the buttons, the 600 number phonebook, assignable ringtones, the arrangement of the menus, the style of the phone and also the talk time. the phone is the best phone on the market and its on the best network in the country which is of course nextel. with the nationwide walkie talkie you cant go wrong. i also have one of the best plans that they have ever offered which includes 1000 mins, unlimited night and weekends,and unlimitied walkie talkie for $54.99. so basically im nextel for life, holla!!!!!!!
Well this is my first time having a nextel.here's what i thought about the whole process:1. Amazon- i got a good deal on amazon. it was $170 with $150 back in mail in rebate. so it ends up costing me about 20 dollars instead of the 300 dollar retail price! they are also a really good company and quick to send the phone(i got the free shipping and it came 6 days instead of 8-10 days). no cmplaints.2. the i730-positives) nice phone. disco thing is cool. eally loud speaker phone, i can keep the phone on my belt clip and talk regularly and people can hear me fine! huge phone book. ok battery life it lasts about 3 days with adverage (30min-1hr.) talk time. there is ring tones that actually sing the song, so it isn't just the music it is the person singing the song, like a sound clip of the song.negatives) no real games. there are a few trial games but they cost 5-6 dollars for the full versions of the games. no text messaging!!! the bad thing is you can get text messages but you can't find out who sent it, and you can't respond (unless you pay an extra 10 dollars a month) so basically text messaging is useless!! the numbers that you dial show up too small with no spaces. for example most phones make the number you dial look like this:555-555-5555. but this phone just puts them like this:55555555555. which is really confusing! also there is no way to have vibrate and ring at the same time. you can set it to vibrate for 2 rings then ring for 2 rings. to download ringtones you need a connector cable to the computer with costs 30 dollars and according to a local nextel store they have been sold out for over 2 months. :(3. nextel company- there coverage is ok! nothing more nothing less. in buildings it is really hard to get a signal. especially new building because they have all this electrical interference. also nextel bills you for the month in advance which is fine but it was suprizing to open my bill and find out it was 113 dollars. 35 for the activation and 70 for the service 1 moth prorated bill and 1 month of full service. the 8 dollars or so in taxes. the direct connect thing is really cool. the other companies are starting to come out with it but it isn't as advanced as nextel's. thier customer service is quick and efficient. my plan is good too it is: 500 day minutes, free nights and weekends, and unlimited direct connect. overall this is a nice phone but could use some improvement. and so could nextel. i am satisfied with the phone for now but when my contract expires who knows...
I switched over to Nextel from Sprint and purchased this phone.  After the first month, I began having problems with having "no service" and with the phone redialing when trying to place calls.  In addition, I was unable to hear through the earpiece when talking on Direct Connect using private. Those i95, i90, i88, and i60 owners, do not upgrade to this model. It is a waste of money.
The advanced electronic features are awesome!  I have hundreds of contacts in the address book with several numbers each (office,home,cell, etc.) plus direct connect lines.  The speaker phone feature works great.  The batteries hold a full day's charge for me.  I sell real estate and receive and make about 40 to 50 calls a day.  Rarely have had to go to a 2nd battery in the same day.Physically it has tremendous appeal.  I think it is really sharp. Operationally, it has a lot of terrific features and is easy to use.  (Although it does frustrate electronically challenged person like me.)There are several things, like email & voice activation for numbers, that I haven't had time to learn how to use but overall, the features are practical and work well.However, the phone is less reliable at keeping it's signal.  I used an i1000 for 5 years and had to trade in a damaged phone or two but had superior service as far as connections go.  This phone drops call, fades in and out, more dead spots and rough direct connect spots.Also, structurually, this phone is more fragile.  The battery compartment cover takes a beating from the constant flipping I do of the phone.  And the flip part is getting a little "loose" on its hinges.  I will probably have to trade it in soon.In April, my 3rd or 4th i1000 cratered again and the Nextel rep I use felt that I would have to upgrade that phone because I had been traded a re-built i1000 just a few months earlier. Since the i1000 was out of production, even the re-builts would not survive much longer.So, after 5 months' use, while I love the genius of this phone, the look and feel, etc. I would have to rate it a 3 star for reliability and durability.Our Nextel rep is good technically with the phones, but the floor people are not real familiar with what to recommend to people so I hope you can pass this along and maybe find out if Motorola has a Nextel phone that might address the problems I am experiencing with it.Thank you for your time.Bonnie Black (Virginia B.)Multimillion Dollar Producer with Re/max at the Beach in Calabash, NC
I've had this phone for a little over a week, and while it performs good enough, there is room for improvement. First is the poor battery life that other reviewers have mentioned. Even when I haven't made any calls, it still drains about fifty percent daily. Secondly, it doesn't seem to be as well made and as sturdy as my old Samsung 850 phone. For the price, Motorola should have a product that is not so flimsy.But that being said, I still like the phone. The display is bright and clear; and it performs better than my previous phone. So if you're considering buying one, make sure you buy a spare battery and extra battery charger. You'll need it. And if you need a phone that can take abuse, I would look at the i530 with the rubberized exterior. It's not as slick as the i730, but it looks like it is designed more rugged use.
Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.
The Good.1. Good reception in the greater L.A area (actually Nextel is overall pretty good service provider anywhere from what i hear).  But what you do get is signal everywhere. The great thing is I'll be talking2. Sturdy construction. It simply feels like a solid phone. This phone is however not tiny like many of the phones offered by Sprint or T-Mobile.3. Speakerphone option is great. Also digital 2-way with Nextel.Bad (not so bad)1. Battery Life. I had the Sony-Ericsson T68i before this phone and that thing would go days before dying. This phone is about 1.5 days of standby with moderate use. You just have to charge it more often I suppose2. Small screen size. But then again, I don't use a phone for games or taking pictures. For me, those are for PS/2 and digital cams repectively.3. No vibrate and ringer at the same time.
If you are in the market for a nextel, this is the one to get - it has just about everything. The call quality is excellent both with cellular and direct connect, the screen is incredibly clear and rich with color. Motorlola also incorporated an accessory cover to protect the charging/data port from damage. I would recommend a usb cable for downloading any java apps, wallpapers, and ringtones via web or other sources. GPS works very well, speakerphone and voice-activating dialing features are excellent, and the phone is not as bulky as other nextel models.
I've had this phone for 3 months, and Nextel for 3 years. I like the service, but inability to roam can be bothersome when traveling. For emergencies, I remedied this with a tracfone(.com) and just buy a 1 year card each year.Now, for the phone....It's got close to as sensitive reception as my old i1000 plus, which had AWESOME reception. The speakerphone on this model is EXCELLENT, definitely an improvement over the other Nextel models. Battery life is STILL on the "fairly horrible" end of things...charge it every night or you'll run out in the middle of your workday on the 2nd day, especially if you use data features a lot like I do. Luckily, recharge time is VERY quick (under 2 hours with mine) with included rapid charger.As a delivery driver in Michigan, I'm out in all types of weather, no problems yet with this phone, but I wouldn't suggest using in a downpour! (Nextel does have models specifically for those types of conditions...)The screen tends to be too dim to read in bright, direct sunlight, and the light "sensor" seems to add to the problem. A non-reflective coating would have been nice on the display. Very useful 600 entry contact list, which can store ALL of a contact's info (home#, work#, cell#, fax#, email, etc.) Phone has a handy notepad and will take vocal notes, also. Calculator, games, etc are included on phone. Wish it had an alarm clock (if it does, I haven't found it yet..I'll keep looking) for those long drives. The little disco light is kind of funny, too (almost a disco party in your pocket!).Interface is maddening to get used to, if only because it's similar enough to the i1000+ (which I had for three years) that it can get confusing, as it's not the same. Color display is sharp. All volume levels can be set from whisper quiet to LOUD LOUD!Minor gripe: waaay too easy to hit the direct connect button in its holster...make sure you've switched "one touch direct connect" OFF if you're moving around a lot, and once you've finished using DC, hit the STOP button (on top in the middle) to get it back to phone-mode, or you'll have to be apologizing all the time for accidentally two-waying somebody!EXTREMELY handy is the "profiles", which allow individual volume, behavior and wallpaper settings for different situations, i.e., "Truck" "Work" "Meeting" "Movie" or what have you.All in all, a very good phone, especially with all the customization you're able to do with the feature settings.ADDENDUM: another minor gripe: the "stop" button in the center top position of the phone is too easy to bump when removing the phone from its holster-I've accidentally ended several incoming calls this way.**********NOTE: instead of always buying a new car charger for your latest, greatest cell phone and adapters for your newest laptop, simply buy a power inverter which plugs straight into your vehicle's cigarette lighter. Make sure it has a built-in surge protector. Voila! Vehicular power utilizing your "home" charger (cell) or plug (laptop). The best plug directly into the cigarette lighter socket without a cord (the units can get hot, a cord can allow the unit to move all over in the car.) Can power many other things, too...can't find one labeled "surge protector" on amazon, but BB sells them.
I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone.  A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  "It's the closest we have."  "There are no 602 area code phone numbers left."  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments "we can't change" for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.  It was a pretty color screen though . . .
Great phone by Motorola - leaps and bounds over the previous user interfaces.  I use the speakerphone all the time, along with the two-way text messaging.  I also like the different profiles, which enable you to quickly switch profiles for meetings (i.e. vibe only).  Believe it or not, I don't even use the direct connect features, as no one I know really uses that feature for personal use.  We just use text messages most of the time.  More than anything, I recommend buying the body glove cover/clip ... search for "Body Glove Scuba, i730".  It's like a tuxedo for your i730.
nice phone, but the 3way feature is definately a hassle.  you have to keep going into the menu options for each step of the 3way call rather then just typing in the number, hitting send to call, and then send again to connect all parties.when you go to a menu option, and you select one, then press back, it takes you all the way back to the wallpaper, rather than back to the main menu, or previous menu.reception is pretty good in areas that i used to have terrible reception in.  however, it tends to drop calls.  dont know if its my side, or other caller's phone, but happens from time to time.  battery life isnt so great.  guess with the color screen and all, it drains the battery pretty quick.also, with the phonebook, if you enter a telephone number into the phonebook without the area code, and that person calls, their name doesn't show up on your display, because technically it isn't the same number calling that is in your address book.  its that number plus an area code on your caller id.  with every other phone i've had, as long as its the same area code as yours, it doesnt matter what you have it saved as, and then name you have it saved under, will show up when that person calls.the phone is pretty much for looks.  my first nextel phone, and it was satasfied with the look, but the features that i mentioned, i wasnt satasfied with.
I have only had the i730 since September 2004 and I am ready to through it in the nearest river. I will try and be fair in my review so the next reader will be more informed than I was. My expereince with this phone has been horrible!! First of all the phone rings when it wants to. I have been told people have been trying to call me all day but my phone hasnt rang.(mind u I have full signal strength during this time)I then would take my Verizon phone, and with my nextel sitting right by me, call my nextel and the darn phone didnt even ring.And then I would get many, many dropped calls becuase I didnt have the signal strength. I am constantly getting a call failed error message that says 341 or something, (whatever that means) And when I tried to use my call switch, to go from one call to another the phone wouldnt let me switch in between calls or go back to the first line call. Again, there goes that error message again.  Very frustrating!!! And I like to see how long I have been on a call sometimes, and with the i730, you cannot do that (at least I have been told by technical support that u cant) i know thats a pretty small complaint, but hey sometimes its the little stuff that counts. Now mind u I have switched this particular model phone out 3 times and I still am experiencing the same problems.**Note, I have found that if u power your phone off and wait about 5 minutes or so and then turn it back on, you may start to be able to get calls again or make calls if u were having those problems.As far as battery life, not really a problem for me since I charge my phone every night anyway. I mean I talk, when the phone works, very much and as long as i cahrge it at night, I dont even have a need for the car charger.The only reason i gave this phone 1 star is because the design is fine and as far as the options, those are ok to. I wish u could download better ringtones, the ones i downloaded suck. They dont even sound like the real music from the songs. But thats more Nextel and not the actual phone. Also, with Nextel, i also was given a long distance phone # that they didnt tell me was long distance until after the fact. That sucks.But overall, as far as the actual phone goes, if it gave me better signal coverage, rang when it was supposed to and didnt drop so many calls it would probaly be an ok phone. But as far as phone features, it does have pretty good feautures.Ps. I was told by the people at Nextel, that they have had ALOT of complaints about the i730 and the problems are actully with the phone and not the service.We'll see, I have upgraded to the 860 today so we'll see.Sorry so long but I want people to know all that they are getting into with this phone.
This is a great phone.  I had AT&T; and switched to Nextel.  I was not sure about the phones since Nextel does not have as many phones to chose from as AT&T.;  Well I love the i730 phone.  I have had this phone for over a month.  You can upload midi and wav files for ringtones. Customize the wallpaper.  The price is high but if you do the rebate it is well worth it.
This is a great cell phone.  Quality of the calls are great.  Screen is easy to read.  The phone features are easy to learn and remember.  Only downfall is that the phone is hard on batteries.  The screen chews up the batteries pretty quick making it a phone that has to be charged nightly.
I am a new Nextel customer, and I recently purchased a Nextel i730.  The i730 is my fourth cell phone, but also my first Nextel.  So far the i730 is the best phone I've ever bought.Before I bought a new cell phone I had an idea of what features I wanted on my phone.  The i730 has all of the features I wanted plus many more.  Features include:  AOL instant messenger (AIM), unlimited direct connect (walkie-talkie), text messaging, and web access.You can download a real song or a polyphonic song for your ringtone.  Something else I love about this phone is that you can download games.  There are hundreds of games to choose from on the website, or even from your phone.  Games are $5.99 for unlimited use.  The phone comes with four demo games, and an awesome calculator.  Also for an extra $10.00/month you receive unlimited text messaging, website access, and AIM.  Web access is great for situations when you need to know the weather, movie times, news, or even if you just like to chat through messaging.The design of the i730 is very unique.  I think the i730 is Nextel's best looking phone.  There is a very modern look to this phone.  When you receive an incoming call the circle around the speaker will flash different colors such as red and blue.  The i730 has a full clear color screen with different wall papers you can chose from, or if there isn't any you like you can download one off of Nextel's website or from your phone.I get excellent reception with my Nextel.  I travel all over the Michigan area and haven't had any problems with reception, I always have a connection.  My battery life is also very good.  I always have my phone on and I can go about three days without charging my battery.  Although, when I do have to charge I can get a full battery in less than two hours.I strongly recommend this phone whether you're using the i730 for business or personal use.  Nextel also offers really great rate plans.  With the plan I have I get 1000 whenever minutes, unlimited direct connect, and free nights (after 9 p.m.) and weekends for $55.99 which I think is a really good deal.  Again, if you're looking for a durable nice phone with all of the features you need chose Nextel's i730.
I live around Jacksonville, FL.  I get about the same coverage i got when i had at&t.;  I've had my i730 since April of this year.  I used to have a lot of problems with the phone dropping calls, but over the past couple of months, it has improved substantially.I would recommend to everyone to go to nextel.com, type in gps in the search area on the homepage, and see if your phone meets the criteria for a software upgrade.  Through this, you can also get motorola to send you a free data cable.  I took my phone to the nextel service center and not only did they put the new software on it, they also placed a grounding disc inside the phone.  Although, i get a little more feedback, the speaker is louder, and my reception has improved.  GOing to work out in the boondocks at Raiford, I used to have three or so dead spots, but now i only have one.  also, with the new software, the i730 is now capable of ringing and vibrating at the same time.  i found that out on accident playing with the ring tones.for the people out there that complain about having to sign a one or two year service contract, keep in mind that the companies are in business to make a profit.  if you don't like signing a contract, get a pay per use cell phone.also, you can use telenav for free, w/o it giving you directions.  just unzip it (it should already be on your phone) and just use the basic compass.  It will tell you how fast you are driving, where you are, and what direction you are going.  it was also tell you how many satellites you are using too.I also enjoy paying only $3.50 to access about 80+ sites on the wireless internet on this phone.  that is unlimited access.  My friend has Mmode, and he has to pay per kb used.  Also, i pay $59.99 for unlimited incoming calls, and 400 anytime minutes.  that is a lot cheaper than when i had at & t and they charged me a lot for going over my minutes.  So, to sum it up, it's easier to pay ten dollars, for the free incoming than it is to pay one hundred dollars going over your minutes paying for incoming and outgoing calls.
I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.
The features on this phone are awesome, but the design of the phone is terrible.  The direct connect speaker is located on the back of the phone, so when you're using it, the sound goes directly into the palm of your hand.  This wouldn't be bad, but he direct connect microphone is located on the opposite side of the phone.  It just isn't near as loud as my I90C.  If you're buying it to look good and put a trophy on your belt, this is your phone.  If you're buying it for functionality and to actually use it in a real world environment, consider another nextel.
You know it's funny, I almost didn't buy this phone because there were so many negative comments, but all in all I've been very happy with it. Usually the signal is great, service is helpful (I've been with Nextel for 2+ years and never had a problem), sound quality is good... The buttons are a bit recessed, but I haven't found that to be a problem. I've seen complaints about getting the battery cover on/off, and plugging it in to the charger - I've had no problems.As for the GPS, even professional units (I do this as part of my job) do not always get a good signal, cannot work from inside, and sometimes take a half an hour for the satellites to be high enough in the horizon to be of use. It changes day to day - there's a website you can go to that will tell you when the best PDOP (good satellite coverage) will be. The more satellites there are, the more accurate your locations will be.My only complaint was that the day after I bought my phone, a tower was down, which meant I wasn't able to make any calls for a couple of days. Very frustrating, but it was over a holiday weekend (I called on the Saturday before Labor Day), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.All in all, I've been happy with the purchase so far - it's NOT that heavy, the battery lasts 2-3 times longer than my old phone... All told, I would buy it again.
I Recently purchased this phone and service.  Overall i am very impressed. great features.  I have no problems with coverage, It is at least 5 times better than my AT&T (TDMA/Digital) Coverage was. My only gripe is that the GPS is abit finiky (dosent always get a good fix, takes time) and there is no outright alarm clock, although the datbook 'workaround' makes up for it.The iDEN network is awesome, it is extremely fast; for example, an IM sent from my phone reaches the computer within 2 seconds, no lie!If you like a feature filled phone, and great service, I would make this the phone to get.
This is my second Nextel phone.  I upgraded for a smaller phone and this one seemed to have all the features I needed.  This phone has a terrrible signal reception and drops calls / and or service 12 -15 times a day.  I have already had the phone looked at by Nextel and Motorola and they say nothing is wrong with the phone.
I recently received the i730 for boost as a present and I love it. The push to talk connects you in under a second. This phone is just incredible! I highly reccomend it!
This phone is too good to be true. It has a lot of good features. But every phone has some kind of flaw. This phone has a mega flaw in reception. I can't get a good singal. Even in metro Tucson it's kinda hard. It's an awesome phone, with bad service. Don't get me wrong. Nextel is good, just not their reception.
when i first recieved this phone i had no problems with it.  however after having it now for 4 months its nothing but crap.  calls get dropped just sitting at my desk.  loss signal in area's that i normally have great recpetion, and the cover constantly flips open when its attached to my hip.  the biggest agravation is when i am in the middle of a call the call gets dropped and theres an error message on the screen. In addition the back cover is a cheep piece of metal, instead of plastic which it should me. i have sence invested in the i530 and love it.
i was iffy about going from an ATT GSM phone with supposedly nationwide coverage to a Nextel phone which mainly followed interstates.  This phones coverage truely amazed me.  Ive never had a dropped call, the features are awesome, the size of the phone is good (just big enough to fit commfortably in your hand).  Customer service has been great too.  Nextel even gave me a 10.00 credit for answering a ten second survey.
This phone has many options available to personalize it. You can go on e-bay to find just about every knid of phone cover that you can htink of and you can also go to e-bay to find computer hookups to download full songs and new games. The screen on the phone is very clear and easy to understand and this phone also offers a direct conect walkie talkie feature. I think that this phone is great for any age. It can be used stock for and adult or a teenager who had it has the option to make it more like them with covers, ringtones, and games.
this is the only nextel phone that looks nice for it's price, less price for nice, it's like rice for it's price.
Before the I730 the knock on Nextel's was they were too big. This phone takes care of that and still delivers the great Nextel service. One feature I simply cannot do without is speakerphone, and the 730 delivers it well. 600 number storage, assigning multiple numbers to each entry, voice dial, color screen and some pretty neat games to boot. OK, It doesn't take pictures, but honestly, do you want to with your phone?I'm going to upgrade all my phones to the I730 when my Verizon contract is up this fall.
I LIKE THIS PHONE AND I REALLY WISH THAT IT IS MINE BECAUSE IT IS A NICE PHONE THAT MAKES ALL THE SELLS.
Missing status light was a huge drawback until now<...This app lets you cusomize your external display and the colors of your disco light as the signal strength changes.The color screen is very bright, but you might have a little trouble reading it in direct sunlight.  The clip doesn't show it off too much - I prefer the bodyglove cellsuit swivel - that works really well.  Most swivel clips jab me in the side when my shirt is not tucked in but the bodyglove cellsuit has smooth edges.
The phone is much slimmer and sleaker than the other phones that Nextel offers.  The speaker quality of this phone is outstanding.  Also, the disco light is a neat little add on that makes this phone fun.  The quality of the reception is good and the features of the phone are very cool.  The price is high, but I think it was worth it.
really like the phone and nextel's d/c.  yesterday the speakerphone and ringer's stopped working.  it cost me $35.00 at the service center to have a new phone cleaned.  tech said there was some manufacturing corrosion.  alternative was to mail it to motorola and be without a phone for who knows how long.  if this is the only problem my rating will remain high for amazon, nextel and motorola.
This phone has to be the worse out all of the Nextel phones. Because I work in a quiet atmosphere, I usually use "Private" (turning the speakerphone off) when I am on Direct Connect calls.  The earpiece got so bad on the phone, that I could never hear what the person was saying when using the feature.  Then the earpiece went completely out on the phone. I was livid because this phone wasn't even 3 months old when this problem started.  The phone is horrible. Just overlook all of those 5-star reviews because you would just set yourself up!!! The only thing that is good about this phone is it is pretty!!!!
One of the best phones i ever owned! I have owned a Nokia 3390 which was a piece of crap I had to get it fixed 9 times untill i said this is crazy just buy another phone. So then I purchased a Samsung r-225-m and honestly that was a pretty good phone thinking how bad the Nokia was. All of the Nokias are crap except for the Nokia 5165 that was one of the phones that were the best of Nokia. All the new nokias suck. After i purchased the Samsung a year later i have bought a Motorola v60g and that was by far the best phone I had yet. A year after that I purchased a Motorola T720 which was a nice feature phone but my Motorola v60g was a better phone. Then a couple of my friends had Nextel and they have great service so then i switched from T-Mobile to Nextel and that was the right move. the best thing i did. I got rid of T-Mobile because they are the worst cell phone company ever right up their with AT&T wireless. I never got good service with T-Mobile. I would highly suggest everyone to stay away from T-Mobile. Nextel has the best servioce in my area that i know of. Verizon has good service also but not as good as Nextel. So when i switched to Nextel I purchased the Motorola i730 and that phone is even better then the v60g! I would highly recommend this phone to anyone! Its a great phone.
This phone has TERRIBLE reception. I have had it for about 8 months now, and I can't get through to ANYONE! Nextel was supposed to recall this phone, but never did because not enough people complained about the problems they were having! Alot of People in my area (West Palm Beach, Florida) have the same problems with the i730. I'm upgrading to the 830 or 860! DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!
The i730 is okay, but it's not what i thought it would be.  I was disappointed.  It can't download real tones off of the phone like most phones, it can only download polyphonic.  That is whack!  Polyphonic tones are last year, people want tones that sound like real  songs.  This phone is whack compared to the sprint phone.  It has the walkie-talkie like the i730, but it has a camera on top of that!  If you guys haven't seen the i860 yet, look it up.  This phone gives the sprint phone competition.  It has a camera, video recorder, everything.  It makes the i730 look like a big chunk of metal.
Please take my advice and stay away from Nextel and the Motorola i730 phone. It drops calls constantly (error 841), and direct connect is always marginal on transmission. Nextel says "it's motorola's fault". I had to send a brand new phone to motorola with no loaner. Get it back and it's still won't transmit right. Now my bill is jacked up from all the dropped call re-calls and they won't credit it. STAY AWAY FROM NEXTEL AND TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS MESSAGE. It's time consumers take a stand on the BS "contracts" of carriers. They are the number one contributer to bad credit hits.
I used to be with SprintPCS.  I started out using the Motorola StarTac and owned many different Samsungs, LGs and Sanyo's.  Well Nextel rolled around with a good plan so I switched to them after being a customer with SprintPCS since 1997.  I went and bought a I730 and I95c.  The I730 is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned.  I have had it for 3 months and the darn thing is falling apart.  My so called Smart button has fallen off one day and I don't even know where it is.  The phone's reception is horrible.  Everyone around me with other phones get great reception and I get "NO SERVICE" all the time.  This phone is over priced and not user friendly at all.  Don't waste your money!  I would have given it 0 stars, but 0 stars does not exist.
This identical phone is available through Nextel for $149 dollars. Why would you pay 50 dollars more this quality phone here.
This phone is the choice for you if you want to spend a little more to be cool! Love it. Nextel's Total Connect plan enables you to take adantage of the gps chip inside and track the phone with online map. TelNav's Tracking works most of the time for me,  with a small amount of monthly fee. There are also other free tracking services you can try such as accutracking.com. The fine screen is comfortable for eyes if you are a game fan, plus there are tons of free and demo games availale for download.
The i730 is the best phone on the market with the features it has. Nextel is the best carrier i have ever had. I have never gone anywhere and not had service. In fact i have had service where verizon does not. As for the idiots who say nextel is not competitive in prices. i just bought two new contracts for christmas got the i730's for 175.00 each and got 1000 anytime minutes unlimited night and weekend, direct connect, long distance and roaming for 39.99 per month. There is no phone carrier that even comes close to this deal. All anyone has to do is figure out that you buy a new contract in december when the prices are the best. if you have existing service sign up for a new contrat on your existing account and then drop the old line of service. come on people this is not rocket science
Just like any other phone there are problems. The area I live in causes me to lose signal when bad weather roles in. I lose it just like my home phone. It has annoying ring tones which I download new ones weekly just so I can find the thing. The disco lights are blinking reminders of how much my service plan is a month. Too much.. Though I never go over the minutes it is all the taxes that get to me. I radio works wonders. I never thought it could be so useful especially when I see so many rednecks on four-wheelers using them. I can actually think of at least 10+ people locally that I call when my service is down. We have our own network and the same phones. Nextel does not reconize a outage unless 6 people have report it. Our small town becomes total choas when our radios do not work. Overall..  This is just another cell phone and it does not float per Buddy who went fishing with it. It is something to be handle with care. The buttons are small and the graphics are great. The ring tones and beeps are just getting worse. I suggest you go and look at one before purchasing it.
God am I sick of this phone.  I've never experienced such poor coverage.  I was previously with both Sprint and T-Mobile, and though they had their flaws, I was able to live with them.  I cannot make a phone call on the road because of the constant drops.  It's amazing how awful this phone is.
Do not buy this phone if you are thinking about it. I have had this phone for less than a year and the antenna has broken 3 times, calls are dropped at random, now the phone will not call out or let calls come in, and this is the worse phone I have ever owned.
The Nextel i730 is the best phone that I have had in a long time.  I recently had some T-Mobile phone which really wasn't that great.  The service was very limited and wasn't that strong.  With the i730 I have been getting better service and I'm even getting service where I have never had it before.The battery life with this phone is great.  My battery can last about 2-3 days without even charging.  Another great thing about this phone is how you can personalize it in many ways.  I like the way that you can have so many ring tones put on these phones and they sound great.  I recently put a few songs on my phone with the words and the quality of sound is phenomenal.The casing for this phone may be a little plain with it just being a solid silver.  But don't worry because the cases for this phone are sweet.  With the certain case your phone can be just like you.  You are able to put so much into this phone and for a low cost.  If you don't want to pay so much money for each ring tone or wallpaper then go buy a cable to hook up to the computer from your phone to get everything you want.Along with everything else for this phone just the overall quality is good.  Everything you need in a phone is in this one.  As long as you don't want to take pictures this is the phone for you.Finally the i730 has been a great phone for me and even most of my friends.  If your looking for a good quality made phone with great service and battery life then I think this is the phone for you.
The i730 by Nextel is one of the first phones Nextel made to be convenient for consumers. The phones new look attracts the younger generation of cell phone users. The phone is not as bulky as the other Nextel phones, which makes this phone easy to fit in your purse or pocket.This phone contains many attractive features once the phone is flipped open. The color display I think is the best part. For people who like to customize their wallpaper this is the phone to do it. Direct connect is the most common feature among all Nextel phones, and with this phone it is easy to find your friends to two- way. The i730 comes with a phonebook that can store up to six hundred names and numbers.Some of the programs on this phone include a calculator which comes in handy when you want to calculate a tip at the restaurant. Another program on this would fit those people who love games on their phone, mostly because of the sharp graphics, which are present.Like every phone there are some glitches. From my own experience the speaker that allows you to hear people talk just stops working. This came to my knowledge just recently when I read the reviews on it that other people were having this same problem. The only other problem with the i730 that I have noticed is the battery life is not as strong as the other Nextel phones, which can be a problem when you are traveling.Overall this phone is very durable, and will last a long time if taken care of. The features and the looks of the phone definitely make it a must have.
This is the only cell phone I've ever owned that I didn't have a major gripe.  Excellent signal strength.  Good looks.  Nice display. Speaker phone.  What else do you want?  Some people want a cell phone to walk their dog and park their car, I just want the phone to ring and be able to hear the person at the other end, the i730 does that and more.  Keep the charger handy though, the battery life is shorter than most. Of course with a car charger who cares...
GOOD:-Attractive-Durable-Battery Life-Great inovative 'Profiles'BAD:-Scratches Easily-GPS Supported - However, does not work well at all-Most Useful Java Apps require additional Nextel Net Access Plan (expect to pay 10+/mo at the LEAST) ontop of your monthly rate planok so you have nextel service, your new sex looking motorola i730 (specific to nextel only), & an affordable plan (well somewhat).... and like every person out there, you want your shiny new nextel phone to be customized with ringtones for each contact and wallpaper for each profile (standard, car, sleep, morning, office, etc) - "CHA-CHING!", shouts nextel. At 1.99 per ringtone or wallpaper, this phone is hardly worth the idea of customizing.For the price of monthly WAP Access, you'd think they would throw in unlimited ringtone and wallpaper downloads. I mean, come on, $10/mo ONTOP of your monthly plan of $49.99 of 500/minutes a month, is pretty steep already. Not only that, but just to afford the phone - you'll most likely be signing in for a year contract or two.
Good feature(1) Beautiful phoneBad features(1)Does not ring and vibrate at the same time(2)Alarm clock function should not be in date book(3)Service plans are between 20-50 percent higher then other wireless providers.(4)Other carriers are more competitive on price and have a wider variety with good phones and cheaper accessories.(5) Service does not have best coverage area
My sister and father both had the i730 before me and i thought it would be cool to get one since we could direct connect each other back and forth. But the phone isn't that great. Heres's the details.What I Like:* Voice recorder- cool for diff. stuff* Speaker Option- Great for not wanting to always have the phone on your ear* DC or Direct ConnectWhat i don't like:* Whack Options for wallpaper* Whack RingtonesI can't even download a free ringtone like most phones. If you don't buy internet your screwed. The phone is boring.
I've had this phone for awhile now and it has become one of my favorite phones.  I know it doesn't have a camera but I don't need a "camera phone".  I needed a good, durable phone for business and personal use.  Besides it being a great phone with PTT (walkie-talkie), web access, AOL IM, Two Way Text Messaging, and more - Nextel has a great network.  My experience with Nextel's customer service has been outstanding!  I highly recommend this phone and also Nextel service.  NOTE: If you're looking for a Nextel phone to fit in your little pocket, go look at the ...I think its the i830. They also make a camera phone.
Just read Nick Cherney's review. I've had little dropped calls. But you need to know the area you are in for the signal. I took a trip from Battle Creek, MI to Cedar Point, OH, great signal too and back. Now at Cedar Point when their is more than one costers together I had no signal or near their superstructures walking up to them my signal would come an go. But away from the costers my signal was 3-4 bars. But overall the phone its self is great. When Nextel has a newer phone I'll think about upgrading.
No holster as stated in the bottom of the "phone data" link(...)Components:Battery, Battery Door, Phone, Holster, Welcome Guide, User Documentation )To activate the phone, Nextel first transfered me about 6 to 8 times.  They could not provide a phone number that was local in my city (pop. of 40,000).  I knew of 2 cell phone number prefixes that were local in my area with Nextel, but they said that no more numbers were available in them.  After dealing with nextel on the phone (many, many phone calls) and trying over 6 phone numbers prefixes that all ended up being long distance, I went to the local Nextel dealer and they set it up right away with a phone number prefix that the 800 number people said was unavailable.Overall a major pain (...)to activate over the phone.  It is nice that the phone will be free after rebate minus the cost for another holster ~ $15.
Games, Talking Directions, Customize and download you own ringtones for free if you know how. This phone is amazing!
I love nextel. I know they dont have the best overall coverage area but in the area I am in (and throughout the state) I have found to have had 2-4 bars (service bars) 90% of the time. I have the i730 and love it. The main thing I do not like (that my last nextel phone had) was that it no longer (that I have found) has the loud ring and vibrate capability (as in ringing and vibrating at the same time) The only service draw back is that is that all the plans are between 20-50 percent higher then other wireless providers.
the phone seems to die every night if i dont plug it in.
I think its a good phone. I am happy I have it. Before I had the i95 and I thought it was too bulky and this phone has better java apps. The assigned ring-tone feature is good. The only thing thats confusing is the buttons. The buttons can get confusing because I was soo use to the i95 and the send and end buttons are reversed on the i730. I would reccommend this phone.Also, get a Usb cord so you can download games, ringtones and wallpaper free from certain sites.
I intended to replace both mine and my wife's aging i90c phones with i730.Purchasing and delivery was OK directly from Nextel but then the fun began.First impression: Cheezy, cheap looking flimsy construction. Battery cover thin sheet of Al, difficult to open and close, data/charger socket covered with a rubber piece which is difficult to open and gets on the way of the plug. Very annoying...Initial Setup: This is where it started getting awkward. I charged both phones overnight and unplugged both of them next morning. They were both fully charged. During the charge, they display "Device Attached" sign. When it was first turned on, searched for the service but since they were not activated, couldn't find the service but dismissing the tab shaped logo covering entire display took some effort to figure out to be able to change settings etc.One of the phones completely drained in less than six hours with no use what so ever. I plugged in to recharge but phone starting it's funky light dance and finally after several plug/unplugs recognized the charger. Called the tech support, they said it was faulty. In order to get the replacement, I had to be charged for the replacement, call the finance office of Nextel to dispute the charge once I send in the non-working one. Otherwise it takes two months credit to be given back to my account. That's more than annoying!!!Then next day, when I was ready to activate my wife's phone (once she came back from out of town), I discovered that that phone went crazy as well. Dancing lights and turnig on/off by itself and finally "Incompatible device" sign for the charger.That was it for me. I decided to return both and be over with it. It is going to be a painfull experience to sort out billing problems I fear.Overall, i730 fells like, looks like and acts like a cheap version of i90c with color screen and shinny skin! I pass....
This phones is perfect for any kids who want to look cool with  a phone but not really flashy. One that won't say, look i want to be the coolest kid here because that just causes more of being un cool. There is only a couple down sides. It scratches kind of easily and the games are not the best unless you want to pay more money to download them. Another thing is that you have to pay more money a month to text message!!! I would say now that i have a sprint you have easier text messaging and better games. Overall, in my top five for best phone (it is the third best on the list, I LOVE PICTURE PHONES MORE.
Iam with Nextel on the third yrs now, and i have just buy another nextel phone for my BF who live in Ohio, and i am in Chicago, so i active the phone with nextel with 2 different area code but the phone still under my name only, but nextel never  told me if i do the direct connect with my bf is cost by each min if i dont paid $10 each month more for coast to coast,(then they told me the unlimte service is only local to local area) never never offer me the service until i see my first month bill over $450, so, please becareful with nextel service plan. (who ever work for nextel customer service, if u see your custom have 2 different area code under the same account, can u be more smarter to offer your custom with any other option plan?????? )
I busted mine up while biking and ordered a new one from Amazon, well it's been 5 days and it still hasn't even been shipped.  I'm discovering the hard way that Amazon doesn't really care about customer service as they have not answered any of my email inquiries as to where my phone is.  I receive items like cd's via USPS, so in other words they get left at my doorstep and stolen by the first dishonest person to walk by.  I wish there was an alternative to Amazon with the same selection but used more secure means of shipping.  Oh yeah, the i730 is the greatest phone for you Nextel users!
I got this phone a year ago, so I know the phone preety well, and one thing that comes out when i look at it, is how much trouble it brought to me. The phone after all is preety good, it has some nice features and most of the time they all work well.  It is easy to get some neat wallpapers and ringtones from internet for free if you have the cable, and they are good quality.  When i first acquired this phone the secound week the screen  and the speakerphone started going bad, so i sendet it to motorola and they fixed it in a week or so.  Motorola has good quality service and i was happy that my phone was finally fixed.  What i was dissapointed with, was the quality of service from NEXTEL which was atrocious, they could not fix my phone (didnt wanted to) even thou i had the replacementplan.  I am still unsatisfied with NEXTEL, there are tons of drop calls and my associates can not reach me because the service is so poor. I will NEVER GO WITH NEXTEL again, even Cingular was better than this.  In conclusion NEXTEL SERVICE BAD MOTOROLA OK
My Employer made us go to Nextel for some stupid reason, and I hate the service. The i730 is a good enough phone not great, very heavy, and the battery life is VERY SHORT!!! One or two business calls and you better find a charger quick. Direct connect is worthless. Want a walkie talkie buy a walkie talkie. All other carriers have free mobile to mobile calls. I think this is much better then a walkie talkie. Call someone, talk normal (No push to talk and both people can talk normal) or leave message. The Nextel coverage and quality is horrible here in south Louisiana. I have had more dropped calls, busy systems, and crappy quality then I ever had with cingular. Don't even think Nextel will care or do any thing about it. I can not recommend Nextel service to any body.
I am constantly charging, switching between 4 batteries. Too much work.
Folks this phone is nothing like the new range of samsung flip phones in the market. It is very chunky and looks lot like a old discountinued model. Only good thing about the phone is loud speaker phone. I bought it but after playing with it for a day I am returning the phone and I think I would settle for a samsung. The LCD screen is not as sharp and bright as the samsung as well. Make sure you see it physically before buying so that it saves your time shipping it back.
My employer made everyone purchase a Nextel phone.  After 5 months, the ear speaker quit and Nextel wants $55 to fix.  Per the service rep, this is a common problem with the 730.  Service is non-existant at the house and very spotty around the US.  I'm going to eat the contract fines and go with another wireless provider.
This phone is pretty nice to look at, and has a bunch of cool features...except one of the most useful to me - an alarm clock.  This feature isn't available for this phone - even from iDen.
I purchased a used Nextel i730 under the assumption that if I owned my own phone, I wouldn't be locked into any sort of contract with Nextel.  I WAS WRONG!!! Whether they give a free phone for signing the contract, or you pay cash for a used phone, YOU MUST SIGN NEXTEL'S CONTRACT!!!  NEXTEL WOULD NOT LET ME ACTIVATE A PHONE I OWNED OUTRIGHT WITHOUT A ONE YEAR CONTRACT!!!  Looking back, I would have never paid cash for the phone.  There are hundreds of internet cell companies that will give this and almost all phones available for free if you sign for the alotted contract term.  NEXTEL TOLD ME THEY WILL NEVER ACTIVATE ANY PHONE WITHOUT A MINIMUM ONE YEAR CONTRACT!!!
is anyone having problems with battery life?the most standby time i ever get from this phone is about 12 hours. im not a happy camper. except for that, the phone is perfect.
If zaphod beeblebrox owned a phone. chitty chitty bang bang, this would be the one. the 40,000 mile/5 year warranty is the best in its class.
I have one question I love my phone but I like to used europe. I can do that or which phone I can used over there.thank you jessica Gordon
May I have your phone number to ask some questions.
I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now. I bought it new and unlocked online  through Amazon's Marketplace for about $235 (excl. s&h;) but saw it on Ebay for $155 and I just thought, "Ugh. I could've had such a better deal". But anyway, before I bought the phone, as a "gadget freak", I've done a lot of reviews on it. Let's start with the phone's PROs and CONs.PROs:1) I love the front design and colors of the phone.2) The 176x220 display is absolutely beautiful! (unlike the Samsung E-105 phone that I had before).3) The speakerphone is very clear, but I wish it could be somewhat louder.4) The voice dialing option is quite useful, even though it tends not to work around noisy areas.5) The camera's pretty good since you can't really expect a "high-tech 2mp+ digicam" out of a cell phone (maybe in a couple of years, but not now).6) The mp3/polyphonic ringtones come out very true and not so "muffled" if you know what I mean.CONS:1) The loudspeaker and speaker overall could be louder.2) It would be so much nicer if the speaker isn't located in the back of the phone because once you put it down, the volume isn't as loud (that's why you should place it down on the front instead of on the back).3) It would be nice to use the speakerphone whenever like for a example, when playing a voice recording.There are a lot of "would'ves" and "could'ves" and "what ifs" but you can't and shouldn't expect a phone to be perfect.If you were to compare the v400 with the v600, then there really isn't much of a difference besides the "external blinking lights" to tell you which group the person calling you is in. Big deal. It's just a flashy addition to the caller ID option - mainly to "show off". Also, the v600 and the v400 are about the same size - same for its memory capacity. If you're thinking about buying a V600 retail, then you're better off buying the v400 and saving the extra $100 for something else.Lastly, I'd recommend signing up with 3GUPLOAD.COM for ringtones and downloads. It's only $10 for unlimited downloads a year and you can always share the account with friends that have the same phone (or display resolution) as you! As for free downloads, you can try MY-JUJU.COM even though there isn't as much to choose from compared to 3GUPLOAD.COM.
This is a wonderful phone.  Great color screen, great external display, great reception, great camera, great look overall.  It's full of memory to store pictures, wallpapers, screensavers, etc.  It also has all the fun caller ID features and settings everyone wants.  It comes with two addictive games (they drain the battery...don't play too long).  The ringer is a little quiet and the vibrating is short and unnoticeable.  My only real complaint is that the battery life is much, much, much shorter than advertised.  However, I would strongly advise everyone to buy the phone from another company, not amazon.com.  There are much better deals on the Internet, and I already regret buying from Amazon.  You can find this phone for free on many other websites that are very reliable with FREE 2-day shipping (Amazon charged me a good $12 on top of the sales tax I had to pay).  Though Amazon SAYS it includes a hands-free headset, it actually does NOT come with a headset.  Cingular includes one Motorola travel charger; Amazon includes NO accessories.  This phone deserves accessories (hands-free headset/case) and NEEDS a car charger.  Order elsewhere and get them for free!  One final tip.  A lot of people complain about the battery meter.  I agree that the battery reader displayed on the external screen is not very accurate.  However, there is a more reliable measure inside the phone.  (Settings-Phone level-battery meter)...click that to see where your battery REALLY is).  Anyways, overall, this is the best phone for the money I've ever found.  It's amazing that such a nice phone is free--buy it while you can!
I've had this phone for a month or two, and I like it a lot. The screen is fantastic; I was surprised by how sharp and bright the image was. The external display is very nice as well. My friend has a different make of phone with an color external display, but the words on it are so small that they can barely be seen. The keypad is easy to use, except that the blue button in the middle of the directional buttons is a bit too small. I like that you are able to change the ring mode with the side buttons, without having to open the phone.The ringtones that come with the phone are not very impressive, but that was also the case with my previous phone (Nokia 3560). I think they really, REALLY want you to purchase lots of new ringtones.I have not used the camera a great deal, but what pictures I have taken look fine. I have yet to view any pictures I have taken with this phone in full 640 x 480 resolution. The camera automatically adjusts fairly well to low-light conditions.This phone comes with a hands-free speaker phone, but I have not used it much because the sound output is somewhat tinny. I have tried using it in my car, but could not make out anything that was said to me (this could be the fault of my car, though!). I will soon purchase a headset for in-car use.The instruction manual is pretty much useless. It tells you how to get to different functions, but not how to use them (such as the iMelody ringtone creator).The reception on this phone is decent, but not exceptional. The battery life on this phone is not as long as I expected... but I must admit that when I first got this phone, I was playing with it A LOT. Also, I work in an area that does not have good cellular coverage, and I would leave the phone on while at work. These two factors surely affect the longevity of the battery.Now for the main reason I did not give this phone 5 stars: the earpiece volume. With my previous phones, I never had a problem hearing through the earpiece. With the v400, I am frequently straining to hear, even with the volume all the way up. I don't know if it is how I am holding the phone or what...Otherwise, this is a great phone.
This phone is cool! After shopping phones, service plans, and prices, I choose the Motorola V400 with Cingular service. I upgraded from a Motorola V120, and was also looking at the V600, but Cingular discontinued this one due to technical problems. I also considered the Nokia 6820 with AT&T; Wireless (Cingular now owns them).Plusses: crystal clear reception (I do a lot of traveling), quad band (works anywhere in the world), easy to use, large keys, bright and clear screen, relatively long battery life between rechargings (big improvement over my V120), clear speakerphone, useful secondary screen when folded, external ringer adjustment, multimedia capabilities, excellent zoom camera for a cell phone, attractive design, excellent personal organizer, and compatibility with many inexpensive accessories. Also, Cingular's multimedia messaging service (MMS) works very well with this phone.Minuses: no bluetooth (like the Nokia 6820), no foldout querty keyboard (again, like the Nokia 6820), no hands-free headset (purchased separately), phonebook only holds one number per person, and slightly too thick in size.There is not much that Motorola could do to improve this phone. It does most things flawlessly, but I would like to see the next generation phone include those minuses (very minor) I mentioned above.The bottom line is that this is a cool phone that I would highly recommend. The phone offers a multitude of features at a moderate price, and, with Cingular service, works very well. The Nokia 6820 with AT&T; Wireless was my second choice, but it was much more expensive overall, and the phone was lacking some of the features and performance in this phone.
I have my V400 hooked up through my T-mobile SIM card and I am glad becuase it allows me to compare this phone with my old phone(nokia 3360)with the exact same service provider. This phone blows the nokia away with its reception. I have one of those houses that cells always loose signals in...not any more.  The speaker phone is not that loud and as the reception bars go down it gets lower in volume as does the earpiece, but it is not a big deal.  The camera is great and I just ordered the data cable to transfer the pictures and mp3s to my phone and to my computer.The rings that the phone comes with are not too great (there are only 4). But like I said, upload mp3s or download some rings. Game capapibility is awsome, Prince of Persia (1) is addictive. The phone has 5mb of disk space that it shares between games, pictures, ringtones etc. which is a nice feature. The calender is great and you can even download applications just like a computer. Battery life is good, I get about 2.5 days while playing with phone costantly.  I highly recommend it because of its programmable menus, completely customizable features and becuase it can expand any way you desire it too via games, apps, rings, screen savers.
I love, love, love this phone. I've only been with Cingular for a week but its service in Alabama is above par in m opinion. I just left T-mobile after a year and a crappy phone (SE T300). To me, Cingular and T-Mobile are pretty close as far as service goes, but Cingular goes a step above with free mobile to mobile and rollover minutes.Now on to the phone:Pros:Comfortable to hold (Not to big, but not to small)Beautiful large display (65000+ colors)Loud MP3/Midi RingtonesFast Web AccessDownloadable GamesDecent Camera w/ easy access!Clear External DisplaySPEAKERPHONE!!Reasonable price (Free!) for such featuresSubdued (though beautiful) lookLike all phones, there are a couple of things that stand for improvment:--comes with few ringtones (4 MP3, and a handful of basic polyphonic tones)--the battery doesnt last too long (after extensive use, lasted for 1 day)--polyphonic rings a little on the soft side--speakerphone can only be activated after a call is connected.Overall I'm very happy with this phone, and with the ability to take pictures that are actually viewable on the screen, download new MP3 tones, games, and wallpaper, its the almost perfect phone for me. If you don't need bluetooth (MOTO V600) then GET THIS PHONE! :) It's awesome!Actual Rating: 4.45 stars
I recommended this phone to my price-sensitive friends and family members, but chose to buy the V600 for myself because I wanted 4x zoom and web access.  Both phones have this functionality.  The V400 has a larger phonebook than the V600.  The only benefit that the V600 provides is that it has Bluetooth functionality... if you need that feature.  It is also a slightly more attractive phone.  The V600 looks a bit too oblong.  They are essentially the same shape, but the lines on the V600 create an illusion of clunkiness, whereas the the textured finish of the V400 is more refined... sort of like a Cadillac versus a BMW.Both have great reception and take great pictures.  Both are easy to navigate.  However, both are somewhat sluggish to respond when quickly scrolling through the phonebook.  This effect is somewhat mitigated if you switch from "icons" to "list", but the sluggishness is a problem with the phone's memory/processor/software/whatever.  Another complaint I have is that it doesn't have the full set of TAP Extended characters in the alphabet.  For example, it doesn't contain Scandinavian letters such as "A" with a circle over it ("AA"), "A" with an umlaut ("AE"), or "O" with an umlaut (OE).  It seems to have all the other TAP extended characters (eg: "I" with umlaut, "U" with umlaut, "AE", "OE", "C" with squiggly thing underneath, "N" with tilda, vowels with accents in both directions, "Euro" & "Yen" symbols, etc.).My only other complaint has to do with Cingular Wireless.  Their voicemail system sucks!  You are forced to enter your password EVERYTIME you call, even from your mobile handset.  T-Mobile didn't require this.  The transition from T-Mobile to Cingular was a snap by calling Cingular's Number Porting specialists (888-898-7685).  However, until they get the voicemail thing figured out, I recommend you stay with your other carrier.  T-Mobile and Cingular (at least until recently) share(d) mobile towers and coverage is identical.  When AT&T's network comes onboard in October, the coverage area should increase.
as with all phones, it's got issues.- needs better ringtones, to buy some, go to [...] (of course, if you're paying a fortune for a phone, you should get some good ringtones, but not with this one)- the games... well, one is ok, and common in new phones, the other, I can't stand.  To get new ones, (if you're using Cingular), go to Cingular's website, they offer better games than Motorola's site.- also, I wish the phone was entirely constructed of metal, instead of just the part on the front cover that is.  With a 4 month old in the apartment that has recently learned to grab at everything, I would've liked a more durable phone for my money.Otherwise, the phone is great!  Great resolution, looks nice, 4x zoom on the camera, picture caller ID, and other great features.
This phone has been nothing but great to me. It provides good connection, up-to-date internet access, and cool downloads and features. The camera isnt bad and the quality of sound when it rings is clear. The phone is easy to understand and easy to use.
When I got our phones I did not like that they were not set up for internet or multimedia use, a technician talked me through setting up my husband's phone and it worked perfectly. Mine was another story. I never got the same technician to set up my phone and it would never go to the internet. Just connect forever but showed up as a connection on the bill. After talking to Cingular till I was purple in the face I took it to a technician 100 miles away who replaced it for another phone (not a new one)This phone worked for three months then would not send or receive multimedia messages. It would just freeze and have to be turned off or the battery removed to do anything.  I had to go 100 miles again for another phone.  I did not really mind that I was not getting a new phone each time,however, Cingular customer service was AWFUL!!!!When my phone is working it works really well.My husband's phone had not had one bad day for six months.  I give his phone a perfect rating. The pictures are great, the batterly life long, connects to the internet easily, has a calculator, battery meter, date book can receive reminders from e-mail and the features are beyond what was expected.  Be sure to save information to the sim card and the phone because if the phone has to be replaced the sim card can be changed from one phone to the other, no problem. Do not allow this phone to get wet, to be played with by a child or dropped.If there is a way to transfer pictures from the phone to the computer without sending each one in a separate multimedia message ($0.25 each without a plan) this would be great.Buy or get the phone and use it wisely.  I would rather not have another phone and when I finally figure out how to use even more of the features, I will be more excited.
The motorola is Cingular's best offering (right now). the phone has a very high resolution screen (176 by 220) . I love the sound quality and even speakerphone has good sound and the other party can hear me. The mp3 ringtones are fun, but often expensive. The camera resolution is normal ( VGA or 640 by 480 ) In general this is a solid phone that I would strongly recomend, please e-mail me with any questions, ( DrSmile2@aol.com)
First and utmost, let me tell you that the manual is total crap!It is the worst manual ever written in a product's history. Now some good features SpeakerPhone:works OK.  Camera:so so. Features:OK Setup:fairly EZ. Is this phone worth what I paid for it....NO! Why?Too many quirks I don't like...Usleless buttons on the side make picking it up a hassle. Camera resolution is poor. Usless pictures the phone came with take up space, and you cant delete without special software. Look for a better phone is my advice. I'm stuck with it you're not......yet
This phone is excellent, especially for the price! The camera is very good, the best I have seen on a phone. The reception is great too, while other Cingular phones have no service, my phone is still working. The screen is gorgeous! The only complaint is that the battery life is merely average.
I too have had my V400 from Cingular for about 6 months.  I absolutely love the features - the variety of menu options, the phone book, and especially the high resolution screen (it definitely has a "WOW" effect with an American flag as the background.  It's also extremely rugged, given that it's dropped to the sidewalk in the park multiple times.What I don't like is the software that runs the phone.  Either it is extremely buggy or the phone's processor needs to be faster.  More often than not, disconnecting from a phone call will be delayed 2-3 seconds after hitting the "End" key.  The scroll rate through the phone book is extremely slow as well.  Even though it is seldom, the phone "freezes" and nothing but taking out the battery solves the problem.
This is an ok phone, but needs to have more ringtones available, with a louder setting for use in noisy areas. I signed up for the Family Talk plan through Cingular, and so far it's been ok. I do have some issues with Cingular's customer service though. In short, it stinks!(unless you're lucky enough to talk to someone who actually knows what they're doing). Overall, the phone itself serves its purpose pretty well.  One more thing...I tried to speak to the manufacturer (Motorola) about some of the features--bad idea. I was connected to someone in ARGENTINA!! Of course he was unable to help me. SO, it was back to Cingular. No real issues with the phone except the ringtones and the volume.
This is a very attractice phone....you know...friends and family all wanting to check it out saying its cool and stuff....you wouldnt find that in a nokia.....you know people would say oh well...just another nokia (my opinion...)  No disrespect to nokia. Some are Cool.  Back to the phone.  I dont know why people are complaining.  For me, battery life is great, i messed around with the camera taking pictures and deleting them for about 4 1/2 hours and not one link on the battery went down.  Amazon shipped this phone to me in 2 days with the free shipping. Totally Awesome phone.  Nice color display.  My only regret is to download ringtones (some you actually enjoy) cost $2.50 to download one mp3 ringtone! thats crazy.  I would recommend this phone to anyone who has any doubts about buying it.
This is a good phone, no joke. I've been with Cingular for ages and completely love their service. I must say thought that while the Nokia is much more unattractive, I did recieve better reception on it. I love this phone though! The reception is ok. But all the other features are completely incredible. Battery life is great. I charged my phone on Sunday and it lasted me until Wendnesday. The phone looks classy and professional. And the blue display screen is nice as well. I like the internal display screen as well (very colorful and crisp).This is the best camera phone on the market for this price. The resolution ROCKS!! And the phone has a bunch of storage.My favorite features are the MP3 ringtones and the picture caller ID!! Over all I love the phone! If I gotjust a little better reception it would be perfect.
This was my first flip phone, so I can not really compare with other flip phones, but after having this phone for a pretty long time I can not say I am unhappy with it. Has one of the best screen resolutions and most vivid color (especially compared to some top selling non motorolla bluetooth phones). Very sturdy body (I have dropped it numerous times, including once from the second floor. Have some scratches, but works perfectly). Great reception (even when you remove the external antenna). I have used the phone in multiple countries. Since this phone comes unlocked, one just needs to change the SIM.Now about the drawbacks. One is of course the constant beeps when the battery runs down - even on vibration mode. Second is the position and functionality of the side buttons. And it is not very easy to open/close the phone with one hand, although after some practice, it can be done :)Bottomline: good phone, but could be improved. Definitely recommended.
The Motorola V400 is a phone that combines both elegance and business into a simple easy to use device. The v400 comines with a spacious color display and VGA camera. It takes high quality photographs that you can send to friends or family or assign to a picture to a person so that when they call, their picture appears. With mp3 ringtones, a built in song mixer, and Multimedia Messaging the v400 is the perfect phone for any person.
I love this phone... you can hack the heck out of it by reading up at howardforums.com and change the volume settings and remove any restrictions put on by your wireless carrier. Cables are available on ebay for less than a dollar in most cases.It's got great reception, great features. I even like the weight and size, as its not the type of phone you see in the movie Zoolander.Good stuff all around
I have owned this phone for about 6 months now and am ditching it. Before this phone I was a strong believer in Samsung phones, and now, I am even more. By far, the worst part about this phone is not the physical quality of it, which is fairly good, but rather the digital part, which is total crap. The software is buggy and unreliable. It is slow and clunky. I can't tell you how many times I've had to remove the battery just to end a call. Sometimes it refuses to dial out, and other times it just won't do anything at all. It is not reliable and truthfully, it is not trust worthy. There are several nice things about it though. The screen is very nice, big, bright, and sharp. It also has a speakerphone that works well and a built in e-mail client (which I will miss). In the end, after 6 months, today I ordered the Samsung SGH-E317 and though it lacks the high resolution screen, email client, and speakerphone, it should be a phone I can trust. What's the point of having a phone if you can't trust that it will be there when you really need it?
Have had this phone for about 1 month.  The reception is very good.  The built in camera works great.  Overall it's a very well made product that is easy to use.  Have had 3 other Motorola phones in the past and all have been well made and have never failed even with a lot of abuse.  Made the mistake of buying a Samsung last time and was not happy with its performance or quality.  Glad to return to this great phone!
I was looking for a quad-band GSM phone that I could use anywhere in the world (OK, most places).  Though I was not particularly interested in the camera functionality, I chose this phone as it was the one which seemed to have the specs I needed.But within a short time, my perception of this phone degenerated into the realization that the actual usability and performance of this phone leaves a lot to be desired (and gives you repeated opportunities to improve your inner self by curbing your irritation at things that don't deliver as promised :-)  I have had this phone for about 6 months now and I will change it at the next opportunity.Ok, kidding aside, some of the many things  about this phone that don't work properly (design flaws) are -* Traversing the menu for even simple things is a pain.  Slow response.  Many levels - for even frequently used items.* Lack of basic call history information (if the same caller calls twice, their earlier call info. is overwritten!)* NO TOTALLY SILENT MODE - Cannot silence the low battery alarm (though it can function fine for another 24 hours without charging)* Cannot use the phone if the battery is discharged even when it is hooked to the charger.  Must wait several minutes before you can even switch it on and ~15 minutes to make a short call.* Side buttons constantly get pressed while inside trouser pcckets (and your hands - or anyone else's are no where near).* Side button functionality (such as changing Ring tone level) do not work as you would expect.* Speakerphone function seems great but you cannot switch on the Speakerphone until AFTER the call is connected - resulting in an awkward pause.I could go on.  Bottom line, this is a poorly designed phone (unreliable/bad personality) that is hoping to impress you by it's good looks and it's camera "feature".  I think you get the picture - at least the smart ones reading this!  Even the 4 and 5 star reviewers have mentioned numerous problems - they should really be at most 3 star reviews.AVOID - there are many other better options from other manufacturers.P.S.  Also, be WARNED about Cingular resellers - they will LIE outright to get your business.  And Cingular seems to not care very much.  The trend you support today becomes the norm tomorrow. Hope you choose wisely.
1- The worst manual(documentation) i have ever seen for a cell phone2- Side-mounted buttons that make it difficult to so much as pick up the phone without inadvertently activating something3- Gave it to my kids as a toy since this is absolutley garbage. No wonder you make money by choosing this phone(Rebate)!4- I can not believe Motorola makes junk these days!
I just got this phone..Here is what impresses me the most about this phone1) excellent voice quality2) awesome speakerphone3) outstanding display and camera (bright at night too!!)4) quad band global phoneThe bad that i really wonder how motorola missed is IRDA connection - a musct for any phones in this age..
Although the V600 is a great piece of technology, it has not been working real well on the Cingular GSM network because of excessive static.  I've heard Cingular is not selling the 600 right now because of software defects--supposedly a newer version is coming out that actually works.  Anyway, the V400 has basically the same features, a much lower cost, and far less static interference than the 600.  Definitely the way to go
The picture quality is excellent for a camera phone. You can upload your own pictures and ringtones to it if you want to. The ringtones sound great and it can play MP3s.It is a very easy-to-use phone for people who might not be technically inclined.Cingular has MMS, which means you can send pictures, ringtones, voice recordings, etc... to other cell phones and/or email addresses.You can browse the internet, check your email, do voice recordings. The Screen is the best I've seen yet on any phone.It has everything except bluetooth.
i like this phone a lot. very easy to use. camera feature works solidly. lots of personalization/customization. speakerphone too! also comes with prince of persia, one of the best looking mobile games ive ever seen. the outside screen lights up with a super spiffy neon blue color. the only wacky thing about this phone is about once every few weeks the screen starts acting up. but i just simply turn it off and turn it back on, and its good to go.
I have had this phone for about 5 months now and i have never had any problem with it. I great reception all the time. I also have wireless internet, text, multimedia, and instant messaging. Not to metion the great games i get and the great sounding ringers from cingular.
I've had this phone for 4 months now. It looks cute and feels good, but there are major shorfalls: the battery life is really short (one or two days even when not making calls), the camera is nice but my service (Cingular) has no way of getting the photos out of the camera, and the 2 out of three calls gives me "Call failed. Retry?". I have had another Cingular phone (the V60, which I really liked until it went through the washing machine) which gave me much better success at making calls.
This is my first flip phone (with Cingular) and overall, it's pretty good. It's light and fits well in any pocket. However, the buttons (or software) don't respond quickly when pressed. My friend has an older Motorola flip phone and any time you pressed a button, it responded quickly. Not so with the V400. Sometimes it takes almost 2 full seconds before your button press gets a response. For example, to pull up the list of previously-called numbers, you press the SEND button once. That always takes over 1 second before the list is displayed. It gets annoying after a while. I'm still used to my old Nokia 3600 (?) model that responded the instant I hit any button.Also, it's annoying that you can't just turn on speakerphone prior to making a call. You have to wait for the call to be completed.Overall a good phone with tons of great features. I think they just packed far too many features into the software.
I bought this phone for full price and it works great. The camera takes good pictures and the ringtone quality is awesome, even mp3. I love the speakerphone but you can only get to speakerphone once a call has been connected. Also The phone is a bit on the large side, but the keys are great size and spaced out perfect. this has been rated one of the best phones for Cingulars GSM 850/1900 band network for its reception and call quality. The screen is also great but id like to see it have an external color LCD for photo caller id and as a photo viewfinder.
THIS WAS THE BEST PHONE THAT I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY LAST WEEK.MY PARENTS PAY HALF THE BILL AND I CAN CALL ANYONE I WANT. I CAN CALL IN PA OR FL OR ANYWHERE THIS IS THE BEST PHONE TO GET IF YOU ARE 11-DEAD. ITS SO EASY TO USE
This phone is great. I would reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a phone. I have Cingular and the coverage is great. I have never had a problem with Cingular. I have only lost coverage a few times in the middle of nowhere. If you are looking for a phone this or the Motorola V220 with Cingular are the best ways to go in my opinion.
I have had this phone for about 5 months now and I'm getting rid of it as soon as possible.It drops calls when I have full service.It randomly just won't ring when I have service, just beeps when someone leaves me a voicemail.On a clear day, if I stand in the exact same spot the service will go from 5 bars to 0 bars and then back up to 5.I have the media text messaging and that randomly won't work.After I've fully charged the battery I'll receive a 10 min. phone call and all of the sudden the battery will go dead.My husband is on the same plan as I am and has a Nokia phone.  He has never had any problems, so we know that it's not the service.My advice to you is not the buy this phone...my husband has had 2 different Nokia phones in the past few years and has never had a problem with any of them.  I have had 2 Motorola phones and have had continuous problems with them.
Yeah the phone itself is ok, but the real problem with this whole offer is ordering through Amazon.com, as noted by another review already. I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application....so when you try to "Revise the order" the operation times out when attempting to contact Amazon servers. In short, you can't update the order with whatever credit info that they claim is needed. I contacted Cingular directly and was approved in about 2 minutes, and after placing another order with Amazon I actually got the phone. But the other funny thing is, you can't cancel the original order because the operation keeps timing out when contacting Amazon's servers again. So I emailed them and have gotten no response as of yet. We'll see what happens on that, so caveat emptor for all ya'll.
I have had this phone for about a month and I really like it for all of its fun features but I find the screen hard to read.  Maybe I need glasses but I can hardly see the battery strength in the right corner and I REALLY have a hard time reading the signal strength in the top left corner.  I do regret getting this phone but not because of the phone itself but for the coverage in my area.  The signal stinks in my area and probably 85% of the time when I go to use my phone I have no signal or I get the call failed message.
The phone is great, but order the service through Amazon is terrible. I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application...., just like the other two reviewers, although the email from Amazon indicated that they had automatically canceled the order due to insufficient information. They DID NOT refund my money to my credit card. I have contacted Amazon but gotten no response yet....Be aware to order the service through Amazon, you might end up giving ALL your information through internet for a credit check but get hassle in return.
I have now had my V-400 for a year. I still don't know how to use most features because they use a icon system that is not intuitive.I have dropped calls all the time and most calls are garbled.I would not buy this phone again.
I wanted to switch my provider from ATT and still keep my number so here's what i did:1. I called up cingular and asked them if my number can be ported. the customer service rep was very eager to get my order and said he could have the phone(he also said he could match any price online) shipped with the number within 3 days, however, my plan wouldn't expire for a week, so i said i'll call them back.2. the day after my service was to expire i called Cingular again and asked for a new plan but this time the representative said that they do not match online prices, so i'd have to pay couple of hundred for the phone i could get for $25 here. So I asked her how i could get a phone online and still keep my number and she redirected me to another phone number.3.I called up the Tech service number that handles number portability and the guy adviced me to go ahead and order the phone on amazon and change the number when i receive the phone.he also asked me not to cancel my old provider till the porting process was done.4. I received the phone 5 days later and i activated it. I called the customer service number rightaway and asked them to have my number ported. the person warned me that there is a $35 service charge for changing numbers (which i was never informed about) and directed me to a different number.5. I made up my mind to pay the $35 and get the number changed but when the tech support guy answered the phone, he had a whole different story. He said that i can not change the number cause my phone has already been assigned a phone number. When i informed him about my conversation with a person from the same department he asked me for the number i called from and said that  the computer doesn't show any information regarding the conversation.After couple of arguments, he started implying that i was lying which pissed me off and i told him to cancel the phone.He said that I would be charged $170 for cancelling the contract 2 hours after i activated it under the false impression that i can have my old phone number.After an arguing for 30 more minutes, he finally agreed to cancel my contract without any charges.I moved to T-mobile since and i have a better phone and the same coverage as cingular.
great cellular. photos are pretty good and signal easy to manages
My review is on Cingular.  I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used.  THEY LIE.  THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY.  THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area.  If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular.  Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse.
I LOVE THE PHONE. BUT EVERY GOOD PHONE HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS. ( I JUST HAVENT FOUND THE DOWNS YET )
this provides a perfect excuse for not talking to someone. simply pretend to talk into the phone when peron A walks near. when person A walks up to you, show him cell phone B, person A should walk away.if not, the phone's 4 ounces could easily show him who's boss. you can also get games for it, providing the ultimate in office cubical entertainment. oh yeah, you can also talk to people with it. very nice thing for anyone to have
I tried to order the phone as well and getting declines from Amazon, even though I have excellent credit history and I'm an existing customer with Cingular.Does anybody know the number at Cingular where I can call and get an approval for Amazon's order?Thanks!
I would like to preface my remarks with two points.First, about a year ago, I finally got a cellular telephone because of the kids and their schedules. One of us is having to take them places or pick them up a few times each week, and the traffic around here is arguably the worst on the planet, creating some interesting delays nearly every day. And I admit that sometimes I have to call home from the grocery store because there will be 23 different verities of BBQ sauce and my list just says "BBQ sauce."Second, my blood pressure soars when rude louts think they have the right to interrupt my lunch or dinner or infringe on my reading time in the doctor's waiting room to talk on their cell phones. I once saw a table of four people, each talking to an absent entity on his or her cell phone during an entire meal but not once talking with the real people beside or in front of themNow, that said, the Nokia 3595 is apparently the high-end of the low-end entry level phone. That suits me fine. This silver-gray mass of wires and circuits has enough features to me going for some time. I didn't know that cell phones had all these whistles and bells such as games, voice tags for contacts, alarm clocks, caller ID, and such.I like the fact that the contact list lets you have something like five numbers for up to 500 people. Five numbers per person---that's pretty crazy to me, the fact we have more phone numbers than we have people to use them! Why not run it up to eight numbers per contacts and bestow a full complement of eight phones to some octopi!The battery lasts for more than five hours of solid talking, but there is not a soul on earth I want to talk with for five hours straight. The sound is decent though I have a certain amount of trouble talking into space while trying to hold this plastic rectangle close to my ear. I feel like my jaw is floating up and away from my face. (I guess that is why folks like those flip phones but they cost more than an infrequent talker like me is willing to spend.)I was able to figure out most of the operating options, at least the ones I paid to get, without resulting to the manual, but I'm not sure if that is because the phone is intuitively designed or not. It may actually be because we are all moving toward some sort of collective consciousness that enables our species to share knowledge like those island monkeys that all started washing sweet potatoes once a certain percentage of their populations started washing the potatoes(In Transcendental Meditation, this phenomenon is termed the Maharishi Effect.)The various stock wallpapers with the phone are pretty boring and tend to make it hard to read the small display window. (I cannot fathom why folks would want to send photos back and forth to devices with such poor video resolution.)The manual that comes with this phone is OK, but the text designer could have done a much better job creating distinct, clear headings. I'm still sorting through some of the more humorous sections such as "Your WAP browser," "PUK codes," and "Potentially explosive atmospheres." (I cannot believe how many people are jawing away on a cell phone while pumping gas.)This little sucker is nearly as tough as a hockey puck, too. I've dropped my on the pavement at least half a dozen times and once had to snap it back together after what looked to be a fatal plummet. Well, it's scratched and scarred a bit, but it still works just fine.Well, I'm one of the masses now, no longer a cellular Luddite. If you see me walking down the street with a wire in my ear, gesturing wildly, and arguing with invisible beings, please help me!
this is the best phone! i am 14 and have been wanting a cell phone forevr since my older sister got hers 4 years ago (she's 17 now) and so my dad left me with these words: Honey, if u can find a cell phone that works with cingular and is under 80 dollars, i will get it for you. So i found the Nokia 3595 and it is so cool. i can change the color of it whenever i want (right now its pink!), i can change the ringtone whenever i want, and i can IM my friends whenever i want... i think this is the best phone for a teenager that doesnt want to carry a big bulky phone around. All u parents out there, heres the best phone to get!!
Can I find a mobile phone type Nokia 2300. The latter has got a domestic radio feature. Please answer back.
I've had this phone for about 3 weeks now, and have been pretty happy with it.  My previous phone was a Motorola Timeport (Startac-style) flip-phone, which I was very happy with.As for the Nokia 6225...Pros:-good size...not too small-good reception-speakerphone works acceptably (for hands free operation when needed; people on the other end report a bit of static/echo, which is to be expected from a speakerphone on a device this small)-camera is a gratuitous but neat feature (be aware that Picture Mail will cost you extra if you intend to use the camera)-lots of features (calendar, voice recorder, speakerphone, camera, web, contacts, voice dial, FM radio [only with the special headphones which double as an antenna, though],etc) which might come in handy-no attenna jutting out from a cornerCons:-weak battery life...Two hours of talk time is Nokia optimism.  Whereas I could go a few days with my old phone with normal use (a few calls per day), this one needs to be recharged every day or after a longish phone call (an hour) and it doesn't give much warning before shutting itself off.  Consider getting an extra battery or the car charger or an extra charger for work, etc.-stupid ring tones.  Why can't they provide simple ringers?  You've got to go online to find them and then buy them if you want some normal ringers.  (This is a minor gripe.)-While inactive (when not in use or after a little bit of inactivity [such as a long pause when loading a picture or typing a message]), the backlight on the screen turns off and the screen is virtually invisible.  I'm not sure if this "sleep" time might be adjustable.-small keys with no space between them.  I find that I press the keys with my fingernails because a fingertip might press multiple keys.
I got the Nokia PM-6225 phone about a month ago and I have generally been very pleased with it. This phone is PCS Vision Enabled, which means it can take advantage of all the online features that Sprint offers for a 15 dollar fee per month. This includes downloading games, ringtones, applications, and screensavers which all cost extra money. It also includes web access, email, and text messaging. This phone also comes with a digital camera, though the resolution is poor as camera phones go. You can take pictures using the phone and send them in an email to anyone with a computer or a camera phone. The games look great on the 128x128 pixel display, though the keypad can feel a bit cramped. You can only access the web about 60 percent of the times you try, but this can be blamed on the Sprint service, not the phone and may be different in places other than New York. When you do gain access it runs pretty well and takes about 5 seconds to load each page which is good for a mobile phone. The reception is clear most of the time, and voices usually sound good though they can get staticky occassionally. The phone comes with a speakerphone feature that works pretty well although people on the other line have told me that my voice appears distant at times. The phone also gives you the ability to listen to FM radio, though this requires an extra 30 dollars to buy the antennae/headset. The reasons this phone did not receive five stars were:-Fairly low quality on digital pictures.-The power button is on the top of the phone and does not stick out so it is hard to turn the phone on/off.-You cannot gain access to the web a good portion of the time.-The keypad can feel cramped while playing games.-The screen can be hard to read in bright sunlight.Overall the Nokia PM-6225 is a great option for the Sprint customer who wants a cheap, PCS enabled camera phone, and I would recommend it. (The Nokia 6200 for ATandT is essentially the same phone without the camera feature.)
Sprint is great, but this phone is not.  I bought it for my wife since it matched the UI on her old ATT nokia.  She HATES this phone for three reasons:1. My wife needs to charge it every night, whether she has used it or not.  Sprint says this is normal because it has a small battery.2. The buttons are impossible to use when you are driving since they flow together.3. When you go to unlock the phone the screen doesn't light upIf Nokia came out with a battery that lasted twice as long - even if the phone ended up bigger - we could deal with it.  As it is I have been directed by "she who must be obeyed" to get her the new Treo when it ships, or any other sprint phone except this piece of junk.
I agree with the gentleman who had the comment on the poor battery performance. I had this phone about 10 days ago and I noticed this problem already. The camera has a poor quality as well. You can see strange shining from the high lighted part of the picture. The most serious problem would be the poor battery performance. I took a test on this cell phone since I got this cell phone new. It can only last about 3 days w/t any call or camera use, and the call time could only last less than a hour. After the a call, the phone will die very soon. which means you'll have to get the travel charger wherever you go. Its battery life is even worse than my old NOkia cellphone. I'm returning it.
I just bought this phone about 3 weeks ago. My previous phone was an LG flip phone that I was really unhappy with. The only flaw I've noticed is the camera doesn't seem to be as good as those on the flip phones and the pictures seem to be blury. Also I haven't been able to find any cute faceplates yet...I get clear reception, good service, and an awesome $10/mo plan which includes unlimited Text messages and unlimited PCS Vision usage. So, i would highly recommend this phone. It's small, light-weight, and a fun phone to play with.
Had Samsung phone for several years, and recently replaced with Sanyo PM-8200, which has superb speaker phone ability, easy to use web navigation, pretty darn good camera capability.  The weak point is that it's got the poor signal reception (slightly better than Samsung).  Only area where I have a problem with reception is in my house.  ^^Just added this Nokia to my plan, and this thing has an exellent reception.  As far as other web, camera and speaker capability are concerned, this phone doesn't seem to be made for that.  And I agree that turning on the phone has been the biggest flaw, as I don't have a long nail.  :-(
I have had Sprint PCS service for just under 3 years, and in that time have switched phones 3 times.  My previous two were Samsung phones -- the first was good, the second so bad that I had to consider getting another one just to get reception in my home.  With the performance of that phone, I decided this time to try a Sanyo product.  I had heard good things about the 8100, which this phone replaces, and was hoping the 8200 built on that reputation.After using this phone for almost 2 months, I have to say that I am very pleased.  This phone has all of the features you can ask for, and yet with rebates and other offers is very affordable.  Both color screens are very clear, and they display easy to use menus and a camera that takes pretty good pictures, considering the phone is not a stand-alone digital camera.  The phone has a solid feel, and talk time is more than adequate, too (compared to my last phone, which may not be saying much).  The nicest addition is the speakerphone, although the speaker could use a little clarity.  Oftentimes, at low volume you cannot hear it, and when you put it higher, the sound is distored and reverberates.Since you can read about the remaining features above, I will point out a couple of disappointments, other than speakerphone quality.  The first is the lack of screensavers, ring tones, and games.  I know that since this phone is advanced, most people will end up downloading these things, but for someone that has little interest in PCS Vision or such services, this is a setback.  Next, I am not sure why Sanyo only included 9 speed dial numbers -- my Samsungs allowed over 100, and it is limiting to have just those that are dialed by one touch of the keypad.  My third complaint is not necessarily with this phone, but with the fact that even as good as it is, it does not mask the sometimes poor service Sprint PCS provides.  It is either crystal clear or not there at all, and despite being told that this phone would give me much better reception (and it does compared to my last phone) it is still not near where some of the other carriers are.In summary, for the cost, you won't find a better Sprint PCS phone out there which includes all of the features you would expect from an advanced phone.  And, when Sprint gets the service to where it should be, this will be a great phone to complement it.
The Sanyo PM-8200 is an awesome piece of equipment.  Don't believe the hype!  If you live in a major metropolitan area, Sprint service is often BETTER than that of other cariers.  I live in the New York / New Jersey area and the service is great here, especially with a high quality phone like this one.  I'm sure in some areas of the country Sprint may not be as good.  I've never had a problem with my connection, although their customer support is another issue.That being said, this phone utilizes all the good things that Sprint offers.  The wireless web through PCS Vision is great.  The new link feature is nice too.  It basically allows you to use this phone as a walkie talkie.  Watch out Nextel!Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I actually like the speaker phone.  I think the quality is good.  How many cell phones actually have a speakerphone by the way!The camera is a nice feature.  The PIM is cool too.  It is true that there's not enough speed dial numbers for those who use that.  I never used it too much with my Samsung phone anyway.  What's worse is that my Samsung just was not durable.  My experience with Sanyo phones is that they stand up to a lot of abuse!True, there are also not enough games and ring tones on this phone. Downloading that stuff sucks, not to mention that they want you to pay extra.  It's a $300 phone, include some decent ring tones will you!!!!!Adding another criticism, why does Sprint go out of its way to sell phones that come with no accessories?  This is an annoying problem, considering most of those cheapo plastic accessories cost them pennies to make overseas.  Check out some of my reviews of the accessories for these phones.  This is one problem that is not just about this phone, it's about the cell carriers trying to sqeeze their customers till they go broke.All in all, the positive far outweighs the minor issues with this phone.  Every generation gets better, and the features on this particular phone make it more than worth the cash.  This phone rocks, which is what I expect from Sanyo!  Enjoy!
I don't have this audio problem that people are complaining about. The only time I have a problem is when the person I'm talking to has a bad phone or poor service. Perhaps there were some bad shipments?This is my second review for this phone because I've had it for about a month now, I just want to point out a bunch of observations.Pros:-Again, the pictures of this phone do not do it justice. The color is more of a shiny cobalt, dark red, and silver instead of that flat color/white that these pictures show. I'm sure the same goes for the other colors.-LOUD! The speaker on the outside is the ringer instead of the earpiece. I've had a lot of trouble with past phones and other people complain about how they never hear their phone ring. If you turn the volume up on this you will always hear it.-External color LCD is a nice touch, especially when someone with a photo assigned calls.-Camera takes good quality pictures, even though camera phones are mostly pointless.-Side buttons are set in nicely so they don't get pressed very easily.-Normal button layout. Nokia thinks they are innovative by making the numbers in different layouts, but really it is just annoying and always will mess you up, no matter how long you have your phone.-Buttons inside are smooth and the screen doesn't get imprints from them. I've heard of this happening on other phones, but never this one.-Settings, after settings, after settings. There are a lot of options that you are able to set on this phone.-Phonebook will remember which number to default calling to (home, mobile, work) by pressing left right when you are hovering over the name.-I find myself turning the volume down when having conversations with people because it is often loud enough in normal mode to use it as a speakerphone.-Lightweight-1 Beep volume setting is nice. It is not disruptive and you will still know that you are getting a call.-Click-locks open/closed. This is not one of those phones that just randomly falls open all the time. Only problem is, I like the clicking and I open and close it constantly. It is okay though, because there is no sign of wearing out!-Voice services are great. Voice ring-tones can let you know who is calling audibly.-White LED by camera is great when you are in the dark. Just hold down a volume button while the phone is closed for the light to come on. I use it plenty.Cons:-Probably not bad, but annoying, that the lid, only when closed, is a tiny bit jiggly.-Can't turn down the ringer volume without opening the phone up.-Soft keys (bottom of screen buttons) are always Memo and Web, can't change them. I actually wish that they could be hidden.-Number keys are hard to locate when you aren't looking or going through recorded caller systems. I always have to look to make sure I press the right buttons.-Casing is smooth and shiny and constantly full of fingerprints and smudges.-I don't like the menu system style and graphics, but that's all personal preference (from a designer perspective).-The volume buttons are hard to press during a call. It takes some getting used to with your ring-finger.-Unable to sync to my Mac.-Talk time is pretty low. 80 minutes.-No pre-installed games.Overall though, I recommend this phone to everyone. It has durability, style, and features that will please everyone. I wouldn't believe the people who say the audio quality is bad, mine is great. The external speaker and color LCD give this phone a bit more functionality and class than other phones. Be cool, stay in school... and buy this phone!
I purchased this phone in July 2004. I previously had a Sanyo 5150 and other Samsung phones. This phone is simple to operate has great reception and has many other nice features, especially the speakerphone.There are three annoying things that I have found with the  PM-8200.1. Earpiece sound is poor, especially at higher volumes it really sounds like an AM radio from the 60's. (my Sanyo SCP-5150 sounded like a landline phone)2. The speakerphone is nice, however it is really just okay to be on hold or for dialing and not to have a conversation.  I always hear "are you there?" and am told that the sound comes in broken words.3. The camera is average at best and if you use the highest quality setting which is a little better you get very few pictures.  Overall, I am pleased with the phone and would recommend it. You can't have everything.
I have had 9 different Sprint phones in a little over two years and 8 of those phones were between January 2004 and October 2004.  The first was a LG, the next 7 were Samsungs and the 9th and final is the Sanyo 8200.  This is the best phone I've ever had.  Sometimes, Sprint's service is crappy, but this phone is great.  It's the only Sprint phone that I would recommend.  Get either color, silver, red or blue and you won't be disappointed.  Just stay away from a Samsung phone, especially the VGA 620 and VGA 1000.  Just go with this phone.  It has great sound, takes great pictures and the speaker phone and ready link make talking so much easier.
the Sanyo PM-8200 is a powerful business tool.  You can surf the web for map quest directions, collect your email, view your IP cameras and basically just about anything else you would do with your laptop.The camera on this phone is excellent, it has three resolution settings and even a digital zoom feature. I am an electrical contractor in Atlanta, Georgia.  All of our electricains in the field have these phones, should one of them have a question they simply take a photo and either email it to me at our office or send it to my phone.  We also use the camera feature for estimating.The "Ready Link"(Radio)feature, much like that of Nextel's "Direct Connect", is outstanding, however, unlike Nextel, you will be hard pressed to find yourself without signal.  Sprint's coverage in Atlanta is excellent. I rarely drop a call.The Sanyo PM-8200 is by far the best cell phone/tool our company has ever provided for its employees and Sprint is a very customer service minded company.  I would reccomend this phone and Sprint to anyone considering changing cell providers and/or upgrading equipment.
The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo.  It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna.  Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.  The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.  To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red!In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.  If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone.  If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.
This represents a mid-end phone.  But it has everything I was looking for in a cell phone:* Great reception and voice clarity.  I had Verizon Wireless before and wasn't happy with voice clarity as people always sounded robotic.  The Sanyo phone gives good, crisp clarity on the Sprint network.* Camera with flash.  OK the flash is a bit of a joke, but it does help a bit when you are in a bar.* Speakerphone.  Finally I have a cell phone with speakerphone!  It's just so cool.* Color LCD inside and out.  I love having a "sub LCD" on the flip cover so I can see who's calling, esp. when I have a picture ID for the caller.* Can play streaming videos from Sprint.  I tried the free Vision service for two months.  It was fun, but for me, not really worth the extra cost.  Streaming video was a lot of fun, though.* For those who care, you get walkie talkie service called Ready Link.  Expensive monthly fee, though.Here you have it, a high quality, high fun factor phone for a great price.  I love it.  I'm getting another one for my family.
I used the Sanyo-8100 for a time, then I got a virus and my Sanyo 8100 died. So under my phone insurance policy through Sprint I got the PM-8200 as a replacemt, all in all it's been a really good performer. The only difference between the 8100 and 8200 are, the 8200 has a speaker phone, better java engine, a slim form factor design, and the antenna is slender, compared the reception of the 8100 unit, it's a little weaker. But still a great phone nonetheless. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any friend or family member of mine.
I recently upgraded to this phone after having a Samsung A500 (which was a great phone) for 2 years.Obviously, the main reason I wanted this phone was the camera.However, the reception is better than my A500, the external color display is awesome.I like the speakerphone feature because now I don't have to pay $20 for a hands-free device.Some of the ringers really need to be replaced. That was the only thing that was disappointing to me. The A500 had some great ringtones. If you like to give your friends distinct ringtones, you're going to want to either buy some from Sprint or download some from the Internet.I also have a little polar bear animation on mine that I think is just adorable.And when I called Sprint to change over from my old phone to my new phone, the customer service rep even helped me change plans to save me about $15 a month in overcharges!
I was not out looking for a Sanyo but when I saw and read about the features promised I had to find it. Sprint was great at the store, and the phone sold itself. You can tell by simply feeling the hinges and seeing the screws they used this was no Motorola that would fall apart after a month. After 5 months I am still finding services that this phone offers to the user.I love it, I just bought another for my wife last week.
I owned this phone for 4 months. It was a great phone. It does not look durable but I put this phone through a lot and it held up great. I have dropped the phone, it has been thrown, split apart...and it just keeps on working. It's a little expensive, but let's face almost all the phones are. This is a great phone. I will say however, the reason why I only owned this phone for 4 months was because it accidentally got put through the washing machine. This phone is so durable that even after that, it still shows all its color and takes pictures, it unfortunately is irrepairable, but I'm still hoping it comes back to me because I really liked the features and I thought the contact list was very accessable. I would definately reccommend this phone, especially to someone who is tough on their phones like I am because this one will definately hold up. I would reccomend getting a case for it though, only to preserve it superficially and keep it looking good but it will definately last a long time. The camera on the phone is good quality. It comes with lots of different ringers so you are not forced to pay to download others. The phone just has really good features, a lot of them unnecessary, but gratuitous. I have owned many cell phones and this is by far my favorite. Its a great size too. Light and takes up small space so it fits great in a purse or a pocket. My favorite feature, one of the more gratuitous ones I was talking about, is that it comes with a "buddy". Its a little cartoon bear that does dancing ans stuff across the screen of your phone.All-in-all, most durable and reliable and accessible for the money, unless you plan on running it through the spin cycle-it is not waterproof.
I purchased the Sanyo 8200 today, through an upgrade option with sprint. First, let me say that I have been with Sprint for approx. 5 years, and I can't tell you why, as Sprint does not have the best customer service, but they do have fairly decent coverage. (They did give me 750 any time minutes and 50 roaming minutes for free to stay with them.) I had switched briefly to T-Mobile and had purchased the Motorola V600, which has one bar better signal strength than the Sanyo 8200, and the V600 is a kick a-- phone. I switched back to Sprint due to the fact that T-Mobile does NOT have the coverage area that Sprint does. OK, so you want to know what I think of the 8200.........................it's ok. Had I never laid my hand on the Motorola V600, I wouldn't know any better. The signal strength is ok, the pic quality is ok, the menu is ok.........I am considering going back to the Sprint store and looking for soemthing that looks a bit nicer and has a better signal. I also am having trouble accessing the web from this phone................not sure why as of yet, but something to consider if you are seriously into downloading, surfing...etc..Good luck!
I was pretty happy with it at first, light, good looking. The problem is that the sound is really not good and it lacks a lot of the features that I loved on my previous Samsungs. For example you can't scroll down to the previous numbers you called after you hit "talk", it only keeps the last one, so you have to go into the menu the look for the outgoing calls... not convenient. On my 3 previous Samsungs, I also liked the fact that I could stop the ring when I received a call. So for example I would hit any side button and the ring would stop, then I could take it out of my purse and answer without eveybody noticing me. I find the menu also a little messy.In other words, I am going to return this one and buy a new Samsung!
lot of nice features in this compact phone. Only draw back is the speaker phone quality(average).
This phone has everything, the features, the excellent reception, the camera quality, the speakerphone, I mean what more can I say?
This phone will automatically turn off during talking or ringing. And the picture has problem also.
Let's just say that after working at Verizon for a while, that I have come to realize that their phones are pretty shoddy compared to Sprint's.While Sprint's total coverage area of america isn't as good as Verizon's, we're here to talk about phones rather than service (although i could argue for Sprint's superiority)...So after going Sprint, I saw this phone and saw the price. At first I thought I was seeing things, because a feature-equivalent Verizon Wireless phone would sell for easily one hundred more dollars. Well, after the initial shock, I did some research on this little phone, and after purchasing it, verified some things...Incredible battery life (advertised as 3.5 hours talk time, 12 DAYS standby); although I haven't tested these numbers, I've had this puppy on for a long time and have yet to go under two out of three bars of battery life!Compact and lightweight...It's a LITTLE smaller than most phones I've encountered, yet the buttons are not too close together at all for someone with big fingers, nor is the screen too small for people who cannot see well.Nice looking to boot! Definitely the nicest looking phone I've seen in a while (only one that maybe compares is the LG VX6000). It's sleek, and the blue looks really sharp both up close and far away.Now onto the best parts...The features!Ready link...Not that I use it, but it's great to have such a thing included if I ever decide to go ready link.Speakerphone! One of the nicest features about the phone, the speakerphone is VERY loud compared to other phones I have used, and as far as I've been told, I sound pretty decent from my end.Camera...Has a flash, zoom capabilities, the ability to send picture mail, link a photo to a caller ID (so you see the photo when a particular person calls), etc etc. It's got all the camera features you'll ever need!Quality of sound...I don't know what other reviewers are talking about, because whether I'm using my plantronics headset, using the speakerphone, or just talking normally, everyone sounds crystal clear! Very rarely will you get some distortion in the way the person sounds, but that may just be a result of the service and not the phone itself. In fact, I would say that is likely.Key layout...I couldn't rate this high enough! The speakerphone has a dedicated key, as does the camera. The buttons are all spaced out nicely and are big enough for those with big fingers. In terms of layout, this baby trumps all of the verizon phones I've ever used.Menu layout...Superb! Everything is easy to get to, and the most commonly used menu items (settings, downloads, messaging, and contacts) have one button shortcuts built into the phone! The menu itself is really nicely put together, with every setting put in the logical place (unlike many phones i've used, unfortunately).What complaints do I have about the phone?Sometimes the button on the side that's used to answer the phone is a little annoying. Why? Because if you just press it quickly, it'll mute the ring (which is a nice feature). But if you press it quickly, because you're not used to it yet, you'll be sitting there struggling to answer the phone. It's just something that needs some getting used to.I guess the only other thing I could possibly be disappointed about is that you can't have the date and your personalized 10ish-character greeting display on top of your custom background. You'll still see the time, battery life, service, etc, but not those two things. Why????? It should at least be an option to turn on/off.So..to summarize...It's the nicest/most reliable/most fun phone i've owned, scoring high in every category. Battery life A+, features A+, layout A+, aesthetics A+, sound quality A (would be a + if I could verify the distortion I SOMETIMES experience is a result of sprint, not the phone).Oh and one last thing: Unlike most phones you'll buy today, this one doesn't actually seem fragile; it has a very durable feel to it.To be cliched, go get this phone now!
I don't have the kind of money where I can buy a new phone whenever I get tired of my old one. I'm a college student and need a phone that is reliable and can be on all day. I actually paid less than expected for this phone after all of the rebates!The main reason that I got this phone was because everyone else had a Sanyo 8200. It was really the word of mouth and seeing the features demonstrated that made me get the phone.I'm very happy with my phone. I can have it on all day and use it when I need to. I'm home before the battery even tells me that it needs to be charged.The external color display is nice to have. I like having it over the LCD that my old cell had.I have more trouble with silencing this phone, though. When the display says that the sound for the ringer was off, the sound for the messages was still on. This can be annoying when you're in class. I found out that I needed to take the volume down one more notch to "Silence All" and the problem was solved.The signal for this phone is a lot stronger than previous cell phones that I've had. I still go into roaming on occasion, but I don't have the trouble with dropped called or the phone mysteriously shutting off.Another thing that I really liked about this phone, was that I am able to use the accessories that I had for my Samsung A500. I didn't have to go buy a new car charger or hands-free device. (Though this phone does have a speaker phone option, there are sometimes that the hands-free device is just better.)The camera is decent quality. I was able to take some pictures of a friend's wedding that I was able to share with her family and friends the next day. I also can take lots of pictures, upload them, then take more pictures. On high resolution, my phone holds about 20-25 pictures.Perhaps the best feature in terms of the construction of this cell phone is that the plastic is blue all the way through. If the outside of the phone gets scratched, you won't have a cream colors line. (This was a problem with a Samsung phone that I had. It had been scratched after 2 years of use, and the silver paint was coming off. I had flat gray plastic on the edges of my phone.)I went to an electronics store, and the wanted about thirty bucks more for the red or blue phones. However, if you get the phone from Amazon, there isn't a different in what you pay based on color!One improvement that I wish Sanyo would make is to have colorful hard plastic cases (kind of like the ones Nokie offered for the Nokia 5100 series phones). Other accessories would be nice, but I would just like to have something neat to protect my phone and to change it's personality a bit.
First off, the color isn't blue, it's more of a cobalt, and I love the cobalt. The speaker on the outside is loud. I can actually hear this phone ringing as opposed to many other flip phones. The color LCD on the outside is just one of those extra things that you don't need, but is really awesome to see who is calling. The screen quality (for both screens) is amazing. Very sharp colors. The phone doesn't flip open and closed easily, it clicks... and that's good because it's not always falling open all the time and I'm not worried about it breaking the hinge.My only quarrels with the phone are that it is sort of confusing at first to navigate around and figure out all the settings (since there are so many) and you are not able to change the default soft keys for the main screen.
I got a hold of this phone about a month ago and have to say that I am pleased overall.  It is my 4th Sprint phone, and is my second favorite- a big boost over the old Sanyo 4500, but not quite the great reception of the Samsung 8500 (1st generaion Sprint phone).  I have found that the reception is the problem of Sprint's network, and not the phone itself, so I cannot throw any fault at Sanyo.Beyond the reception, the phone is stacked with features.  The camera is a nice one, and I like to take pictures of places I am at and share them with people not with me before I erase them.  The quality is not of a digital camera, but for someone just using them for kicks like I do, its alright.  The zoom on the camera is a little tricky, but another nice touch, as is the flash and the frames you can put around the pics.Another great feature is the speaker phone- it is way clearer than landline speakerphones that I have used, and is a great alternative to a clumsy headset.Also, the screens are tight, with brilliant color and clear resolution.  Still, what happened to some free screen savers and games.  Even the games on here are trials - you get interrupted in the middle with a clever reminder that the game must be purchased using Sprint online.  I am surprised sometimes that you dont have to pay a fee to just open the phone sometimes.Another problem with the phone is the lack of accessories, partly due to its newness- I blew 30 beans on a Sprint leather case, but it can't hold a torch to the Bodyglove Ion or Cellsuit cases.  Still with time this I am sure will be fixed.I got the phone with a lot of rebates and think the cost/benefit is phenomenal.  Still, I dont know about the 280 price tag.  Overall, though, this is a great phone, as far as Sprint phones go, that is.
The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo.  It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna.  Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.  The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.  To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red!In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.  If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone.  If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.
I was looking for phone w/ good functionality. I could careless about the bells and whistles. Custom ringtones, screensavers, games? Who cares! I remember when phones were just phones. But I must confess this time around I wanted a camera in my phone. I'm always using my digital camera but because it's so big and bulky (plus who wants to drag around a digicam when you're in a poolhall or bar?) I rarely have it with me. After doing my homework I settled on the 8200 and wow was I ever impressed! The camera works great but obviously it can't compare to my 4MP digicam. But whenever I need a camera I can always count on my phone being there w/ me. The rest of the phone is great. The menu is intuitive and very easy to use. The speakerphone is clear and web browsing just as good. Although navigation can be kind of tricky at times. Overall a very well balanced phone. I highly recommend this!
After having several cell phones, the Sanyo 8200 is definitely the best cellular phone.  My last phone was indeed the Sanyo 8100 and Sprint has done a great job upgrading.  By adding the speaking phone to the two-way radio, I have enjoyed this phone more than ever.  Can you believe the phone even comes in three different colors to match your own style?  The blue was a great choice for someone like me that drops his or her phone frequently.  The phone has an awesome picture quality due to the built in flash.  This allows the pictures to come out nice and clear.  The menu is really neat with the large letters that makes it easy to see and cool pictures to make it fun.  The text message has been a great improvement from the 8100 because now you do not have to log onto the net, you can just send.  When listening with the flip open or close, the sound is great. You have a variety or sound levels that come out nice and clear.  All of these things are hard to find in such a small phone, only 3.64 ounces.  Your service as well gets better with the better phone.  Believe me, you will love it.
Nice little phone.  I find the sound quality to be very clear.  To the reviewer who said all their calls sounded like the person to whom they are talking had swallowed a bag of marbles I would have to suggest they take it back to Sprint for a replacement. The only thing I would avoid purchasing is the "Voice Command" service at $5 a month.  It actually takes you longer to call using the Voice Command service than it does using the voice dialling already built into the Phone.  I love this phone.  And the camera actually takes decent pictures.
This phone is great to look at, and works like a charm.  The talk time allows for long conversations before recharging, the internet and messaging capabilities are very user-friendly, and setting up the phone book, calendar and alarms were a breeze.  I hear callers clearly, and love the speakerphone option for hands-free conversations.  The standard ringers, games and backgrounds are cute, but there is also a wide variety available for download inexpensively.  The phone accepts ReadyLink calls (walkie-talkie capability) which I have yet to try.  And the phone can be linked to  one's PC for downloading the pics taken with its camera.  Did I mention the phone has a ton of memory, too?I LOVE my new phone.  I'm sure if you buy it, you'll feel the same.
I got this phone only a few hours ago and I love it. I was looking for a phone with a camera and a speakerphone, it exceeded by expectations.  I love the look of the phone; it's light and slim.The service is great and everything is so easy to hear. The camera works great as does the speaker. I downloaded  a ring earlier thinking i was going to hear different beeps and was super suprised when I heard a bit of the actual song. This phone is great, I couldn't ask for much more.
WOW this is the greatest phone i have ever seen in my entire life! IF only it came with verizon as a service provider then i could actually afford to get it. I've searched far and wide for the best cell phone on the market and here it is. A cool, unique design sets Sanyo PM-8200 Blue apart form any cell phone i've ever seen. Not only is this phone stylish but it is a callers dream. Easy access buttons allow the owner to navigate the phone. Wheather it's just answering a call, accessing your phone book, talking using AIM, or taking a picture, it's easy and fast to do so.  If you are able to get this phone DO IT!
Well, with sprint there are 2 phones to go with, sanyo and the others.  Sanyo gets better reception, works better, and has better features hands down and that is true to their new kick butt upgrade from the 9100.I just got my 9200 and it is flawless.  Actually much better than the 9100 in the fact that they moved some of the buttons from annoying spots and made the antena a little less anoying.For those who give the phone a low rating because they are having reception problems in there area, get a clue.  This is to review the phone not the provider.If you are in the market you cant go wrong with this choice.  It is a great phone and I would not own any other brand from sprint.
Having just sent a Samsung A-500 swimming off of Catalina Island, I decided to try a change of pace with the Sanyo 8200. As others have noted, the Functions and Menus on this phone are outstanding. The Camera is a lot of fun and really preforms pretty well.That being said, I'm really dissappointed with this phones sound quality. When listening to callers with the phone flipped open, you'd swear that each and every one of your callers has swallowed a bag full of cotton or marbles. The calls sound downright horrible. It only gets worse once you plug in the earbud. Turning up the volume only distorts the call even worse.I'd love to keep this gadget friendly phone but will be switching back to the Samsung. Its sound quality is 10 times better than the 8200 even though I will have to live with its limited features.Really surprised Sanyo skimped on a key feature for this otherwise excellent phone.
The features on this phone are awesome and certainly this phone is easy to use. The speakerphone is also by far the best I have encountered. However, the clarity of calls is a slight issue. The volume control does not seem to do a whole lot for the clarity as people sound too loud or not loud enough, and even when not on speaker sometimes it feels like they are because of the way the phone sounds. Even when I have perfect reception and am in an area where I know others Sprint phones are working just fine. Have not decided yet whether or not to switch phones or just stick it out, but two years is a long time. I also do not know what other phone I would go with as there is not a consensus on one excellent phone all around.Hope this helps.
I ordered the Sanyo 8200 for a replacement of an LG phone that pretty much had worn out with use. The 8200 has some great features like integrated SMS and tri-mode. I also liked the color blue which was the reason I ordered it from Amazon as the Sprint stores only stock the silver. Without the phone activated, I played with the menus and made a few "free" calls to *711 to see how it worked. The menus have some cutesy bears as animation which I didn't care for although it would not surprise me if they could be turned off. Otherwise the two more serious issues were: 1) The lack of LED charge status indication. Every other cell phone I've ever had has some type of "phone charged" led so you know when it's ready to take out of the charger. 2) The voice quality compared to my old LG phone was clearly inferior on calls to Sprint customer service and vastly inferior to calls on my wife's new Samsung 1000. I did the comparisons on each ear hitting TALK at the same time. I like the LG phone and wish SprintPCS supported the new camera versions as Verizon does. Otherwise I'll get the Samsung and hope I don't pick up my wife's phone by accident.
Well I rescently switched from Nextle to Sprint. I switched because of the price and the hardware. The price, you get what you pay for. I live an area that is very affulient and about an hour from Boston, Ma. I never had many issues with connectivity to Nextel. And I did not assume I would have any issues with Sprint either boy was I wrong. There is a stop on my way to work where I have full signal strength and my call gets dropped every time. Sprint is bad in my area.The phone however ROCKS, Nextel has crappy phones for gadget freaks like me. This phone you can download songs to the ringer not just midi's. The screen is big and bright, unlike the new i730's tiny screen. The camera is easy and fun to use, and with the color display on the outside of the phone you can even take pictures of yourself if you are that vain. The battery last well.If Nextel could get some cool phones I would switch back... Oh wait I have a 2 year contract. I guess I will have to wait.I hope this helps
this phone comes in handy all the time the menus are user friendly it looks nice and it holds 100 pictures the ting i use most often me being a outdoor person is the flash light its not really bright but you can see in the dark with it
hey every one this phone is great it has every thing u would want but it doesn't have video camera the vm4500 has video camera but it isn't that good because the battery meter keeps dropping every time u use it i like this phone i have used and it is far the best and for a good price too it is worth it.Oh yeah it also has walkie takie and it lets communicate with every one using this cell phone and plus u can comunicate with the vm-4500 and that why it is neat.
I just bought this phone at Radio Shack on Friday.  I returned it on Sunday.  Nice features, but the audio quality is awful.
Buyer beware... do not buy Sprint. I give them zero stars! I purchased a Treo 600 for metro Atlanta. Basically the service was very bad. I called to cancelled and charged me $112 and change. As a business customer or any customer why am I being changed for poor service. I am not going to speak bad about their customer service because they tried. But they do not understand about business relationships and how to assist the customer. If you intend to buy a phone from them get the least expensive plan first. Then will not loose as much monsy as I did for just 7 days of service.
I love this phone i had just lost my phone and is looking for a new one and this will be a good 1
Well, as an early adapter, I guess I should be used to taking it hard. I bought Verizon's PalmOne Treo 600 the first day it came out - over a year after AT&T;, Sprint, and other comapnies released it. My plan is 400 anytime minutes, unlimited in-network calling, unlimited nights and weekend, and $5 for Internet access a month. Unless I go over, it should cost me $49.95 a month. I just got my first bill.$1,641.66.It turns out that the connection to the Internet doesn't shut off - even if you chose "Disconnect" from the web browser's menu. Even if you turn off the unit. It continues to ping the Internet looking for data every six minutes. Hence my bill show some 1023-minute calls.Steve in Verizon's data division said they've received a lot of calls on this issue and isn't sure why they even offer the $5 web-only feature, when customers need to get the $49.95/month unlimited data transfer or deal with $1,000-plus monthly bills. When I asked if there was a way to stop the pinging every six minutes, I was told no, "it's a data phone first and a cell phone second."Interesting, as my friends who have the phone with other carriers have never had this problem. Interesting, as I was never told this when I bought it. All I wanted was a freakin' cell/PDA combo, so I don't have to carry both with me, making me look like I'm sporting a chubby in two pockets at once. With Verizon, the cost for doing so is $44.95 plus your calling plan a month, which for me will come to about $100.After 58 minutes, I was told my bill should be adjusted within 24 to 48 hours.Also, on Verizon Wireless's PalmOne Treo 600 Smartphone web page it lists a 5 MB transfer for only $24.95. When I asked the technical rep about that option, he said getting it would still cause a Treo 600 owner's bill to be over $1,000 a month. He said it was up there for use with other phones. He had no answer when I said there are no other phones on that page.Now, I probably could return the Treo 600 - except I already sold my old phone and Palm on eBay.Of course, if I could just get a free minute for every time I heard "Oh, that's the new phone. I'm not familiar with it" none of this would be an issue.Buy the phone from AT&T;, Sprint, Cingular, or another carrier and don't deal with the problems I had with Verizon Wireless. The phone is great!
Just like anything else...I guess a lot depends on our expectations before purchasing the device. With the Treo600 I expected some compramises in the pda functioning and cell phone features. This device does an excellent job in combining both in a neat package. Everything I have used it for works well and is reliable. Good signal strength, clear calls (with Verizon NYC) My PDA software works seamlessly (epocrates, pediasuite, worldmate etc. I don't have much negative to say about this device. It is everything I expected; a functional reliable pda and cell phone. Good expandability with S/D-I/O slot.However, some negatives...it is pricey, no bluetooth or wi-fi, no voicedial, screen is not highest of resolutions...but then again, I rather have the good battery life and smaller package.All in all exceleent useful device.  I am very happy with my t600
This phone is just what I was looking for: a way to combine my PDA with a good cell phone.  It has all of the functionality of my palm device, plus the wireless phone and internet access.  I really got tired of managing over 200 contacts on a cell phone - entering information using a phone dialing pad. Now I can enter contacts from my Outlook Contacts folder and hot-sync my phone with my laptop.  Buying the phone unlocked enabled me to just pop in my existing SIM and use the phone with my provider (Cingular).Here are the reasons I didn't give this phone 5 Stars (you can judge how important they are to you):1) Lack of bluetooth2) Camera is ok at best - don't use it for graduation photos :-)3) Low screen resolution (still good and usable, but res could be better)4) Not graffiti enabled (although I purchased third party software [Jot] that works great).If items 1, 2, and 3 are a problem to you, then you might want to try the Treo 650, which costs a little more, but addresses those shortcomings.  I am happy with the 600.  It has been worth the money so far.  ONE WARNING:  If you purchase the unlocked phone, be careful downloading firmware updates from the PalmOne website.  After performing an update, my phone locked and I couldn't use the phone with my Cingular SIM.  Fortunately, I was able to get help from the seller and my phone is back to full functionality.
The treo 600 has been nothing but problems for me.  First after I bought the phone it took verizon a while to figure out how to turn it on...the store said they couldn't do it.  Then the phone stopped working and would reset itself when I tried to use anything at all.  After getting a new phone I got a 1000 dollar bill from verizon because they had signed me up for the wrong plan and the internet would stay on for 24 hours straight.  After a few months the new phone is no longer working...it is now constantly reseting itself.  I'm very frustated.  Great idea combining phone and pda but get a different model and don't use verizon.  By the way the camera is crap...0.3 megapixel...doesnt take any good pics that you can actually see.
This is a simple to use, small, light and generally elegant flip phone, with good reception.Some useful comments for those interested in getting it:-It looks nice and has a fast and responsive user interface (I found the LG interface much better than the Samsung x426). It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only "ring and vibrate" at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.) This is annoying.
Alas, my trusty Nokia cell phone died horribly and slowly, the folks at the cell phone store had to put it out of its misery. Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript: On November 15, 2006, I made the offhand remark that I was going to replace this phone soon. That night, it stopped working. I won't miss it.
I only owned the phone for about two weeks and it was already acting up. First, the hinges became kind of squeaky and just felt horrible to hold the phone. Then, the battery wouldn't even charge. I plugged it into the charger and it looked like it was charging but when I pulled it out, it was still at one bar. And it went down to one bar overnight.. after I had charged it until it was supposedly full. It appears that other people had this problem as I saw people returning the same phone because of these issues.So I highly don't recommend it.
I have owned this phone about a month and I've had to take it back to the store 2 times already.  The first time the phone "pretended" like it was charging but remained only @ 1 bar after charging for 12+ hrs. The second time the phone would drop my calls after about 3sec. of talking.  The phone is very small and cute and the ringtones sound really good, but that's about the only thing redeemable about the phone.
This is a great Phone! ITs my 3rd phone and i have had problems with 2 of the three. the first one was ugly, and the second one, the battery life was no good. But when i got this LG C1300, it rocked my world! The Battery Life is awesome and the features are real good. You can download ringtones without going online which is really cool and easy. It has a well lit screen and the volume of the ringtones are really loud. The hearing part is awesome, i put it on a volume 3, because when it was on a 5 its like a speaker phone. It only includes one game which is very similar to snake. The picture does not look the same, the big thing in the middle is really a mirror like thing and it flashes green, it does not stay solid. Overall it is a really good phone and i reccommend everyone to go and buy it!
This is my 5th phone and compared to the other phone that i had to keep replacing, this phone is great. the one i had before this phone was a sony ericcson t62u and it kept on stopping working so after i had 4 of them in 6 months i got fed up and decided i would go buy a new phone. so i liked this one. and everything works great on it, the battery life is great, the way the menu and the ease of use is great. and i love how the ringtones are real songs not just beeps. the only thing i don't like is like one guy said up there, my screen is a little squeky when i open it, but i dont really care. i recommend this phone to anyone
This phone is one of the best I've ever had! The design is great as are the controls. You can silence/vibrate it w/o opening it (and vice-versa). I have dropped it onto concrete before and there were no scratches and it still worked fine. I never found any bugs or errors. Service is excellent and I have yet to have any problems with it.However, as others have stated you can't choose shortcuts- they are chosen for you. IM & text messaging are 2 of the chosen ones. Never the less, its still my favorite phone
The LG C1300 phone from cingular is my first phone and i don't think that I could ever find a better deal for a great phone.  The C1300 has internet acess, tons of ringtones, and great color display, along with many other features such as a calender, and note pad. This phone will replace a handheld.  This phone is also a very ruged phone.  i droped this phone in the pool on accident for 10 minutes and it still works.  I give this phone a 9.8/10.
I renewed my 2 year wireless contract for the 2nd time last week and had decided to upgrade my phone.  I've had 2 previous Nokia phones free with my plan.  I really liked Nokia's performance, but my phone provider does not offer any with a flip phone style.  Because I'm on the road a lot, being able to put a smaller phone into my pocket, briefcase, of handbag without dealing with locking and unlocking the keypad each time I used it is a real convience.  I also wanted to get a stroner signal than I was able to get with he Nokia.  I use a company provided Moterola Flip Phone that is newer than my Nokia and get a really great signal with it. I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone.  I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well.  This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly.  Now unless I pay full price won't be able to upgrade again for 2 years and am stuck with junk.  BUYER BE WARE!  DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!
The external light doesn't serve any purpose, exept maybe to dupe people into thinking that this phone has external caller ID or an external clock.  The antenna sucks too.  Get a Motorola or a Samsung.
It's cute and light-weight.  However, I've only had about 3 phone conversations that were not very choppy or down-right incoherent and dropped.  We bought 3 of these for our family and they are almost always unusable.  There is an echo in one of them.  We have had 4 other phones, mostly Nokias, and they all served us very well.  These are going back. Hope you don't wind up with one. In shopping for a replacement, ALL the sales people say that they are getting a lot of these phones back.  They have a horrible reputation.  I'm glad to read that some people are not having problems with theirs, though.
this phone is horrible, Ive had mine about two weeks it fell once and did not turn back on, and I never got a good signal.
My review is on Cingular.  I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used.  THEY LIE.  THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY.  THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area.  If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular.  Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse.
I am returning my phone without even using it for this reason: the manual advises against using it like a conventional phone.In their 300 page User's Guide (p.27) it says, "unlike conventional cell phones, the PPC4100 is not designed to be held against the ear when the phone function is used. Holding the unit against your ear during phone use is contrary to the design of this product and is not recommended."It goes on to explain the proper way to use their product, "Attach the single ear bud headset or enable the speakerphone during phone use."It seems that the authors of the documentation went out of there way to avoid revealing just why.I don't know about you but this re-definition of what a "cell phone" is seems like a grand imposition. Not only on the user but quite possibly the public too. Some users may choose to use the speaker phone in restaurants and other public places because their ear buds are tangled at the bottom of their pocket or purs.I believe that not designing the "cell phone" to be used like a conventional cell phone is a basic flaw-in-concept.Here is my take on all this:Did the designers consciously choose to ignore real-world scenarios?Maybe users have discovered they can indeed use it like a conventional cell phone, but how am I to know that.The following unanswered questions lead me to return my purchase.1.) Why did they choose not to design the phone to be used like a conventional cell phone?* Was it really a flaw in their design, such as forgetting to make a button to disable the input screen when talking on the phone so one's cheek doesn't unknowingly erase or edit files? - If that's all they are protecting us from we all know how to work around that.2.) What will happen if you try to use it like a conventional cell phone? Why don't they tell us so we can make the judgment? And why not tell us up-front so we can make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase the phone.* Is the speaker unable to turn down low enough not to harm your ear?* Is the antenna going to fry your brain?* Will the side of your face brushing the touch-sensitive screen cause the phone to hang up on your friend or customer - or cause the phone to delete files on the phone?* Will you drop the "phone" because it is not the usual phone shape?* Will your skin oils or make-up rub off on the screen - and is that all the designers are concerned about?All of the possibilities were suggested in discussion with the wirless provider and with an Audiovox representative. To be fair neither he nor the wireless provider was aware of the advisory until I directed them to the documentation.
Its been a great phone.  I'm a professional pilot, crossing the US regularly.  Its coverage using ATT&T; has been far better then Sprint about equal or better then Verison.  Its main flaw is it's messaging/voice messages.  The phone rings once if you miss that one message prompt then the only clue you have a voice message waiting is visual.  This means having to occassionally make a consious effort to look at the phone.  I've missed several important timely messages!
Have been a regular pocket pc user for last few years. Carrying a pocket pc with a cell phone always made it troublesome for me and thus was looking for a phone which has both the capabilities. And I must say that I have found one !Audiovox PPC 4100 is the phone of choice. After reading through the reviews, I thought that this phone is not worth buying and has its own hardware problems..but still went to buy this phone and I must say that this was my best decision.Firstly, I liked the phone size. It is a very sleek phone (of course with Pocket PC capability) and thus fits into the shirt pocket very easily without popping out of the pocket. Screen size is big enough for reading emails, contacts, calander and notes. It is not bulky as my Pocket PC 3600.Some of the features that I liked about this phone are:1. Silent mode and ringtone mode2. Pocket Internet Explorer3. SD Card4. Wireless connectivity (Infrared)5. Stereo headsetsProduct manual on the websites said that phone comes with only one stylus..but it came with 2 (which was kind of cool).Adding a 1GB SD card makes this phone even a substitute for an IPOD (Though this phone may not hold 10,000 songs as IPOD but this is a PHONE...).This phone is so convenient for use that one can check all emails (I can even connect to my office email server) and thus one can be connected even while travelling.Amazon.com has $200 rebate on original price of $349.00 which makes this cool tool cost only $149 which is far less for a Pocket PC phone compared to i700 or HP phones. The phone is a tri band GSM phone and thus can be used anywhere in the world.Phone comes with wonderful Microsoft Mobile OS 2003 which has very nice features. And if you are already a Pocket PC user, you will love this phone.Business or personal..PPC 4100 suits all needs !
Two and a half months of use and I've been pretty happy.Works fine when used as a regular phone (i.e. up to your ear) and the PDA features are very quick to operate, due to the very fast processor.  I also really like it's small size, smaller than other PocketPC Phones I've seen out there.  It's easily pocketable in a shirt or pants pocket.Phone reception has been better than average, even internationally.  Jotting down a note or opening a file while on the phone is a seamless operation.  The PPC4100 comes with a lot of storage capacity and great screen.  I've used it to watch videos and listen to music.On the minus side, I wish it had a louder ring and louder volume in speakerphone mode.  Also, I wish it had built in bluetooth and WiFi.  But, for the price, it's an excellent value.I'm very happy to not have to carry my phone AND separate PDA, anymore!
I've been using this puppy for a couple weeks. It simply is much better than what I expected. It's smaller than any other pocket pc phone in the market, yet same or larger screen size.The pocket pc works fucntion great, the screen is quite large and bright, and I already found a truck load of freeware on the web for pocket PCs.The phone is working great too. I can simply hold it against my ear, I don't understand why some of the others couldn't. They probably should have turned offthe volume a bit, because this thing is really loud when you turn up the volume. The phone also has speakerphone function.The visual clues for voice mail or sms is very nice and functional. Typing SMS is very easy and fast with the transcriber or the on-screen keyboard. I am glad that Audivox didn't waste precious space by putting an actual keyboard onto this device.Battery life is not bad. I charge at night, and it lasts about a day or so without any recharge. But it stays on the cradle (syncrhonizing with my laptop) all day so it gets charged anyways.And finally AT&T; coverage works fine. I didn't have coverage in my office with T-mobile w/ sony ericsson phone, this one has covearge in my office (chicago area). By the way, though at&t; customer service is still very slow..I'd strongly recommend this particular pda phone.
WARNING, AT&T; Wireless now ships the PPC4100 locked to their network.  Audiovox can't unlock it and says their contract with AT&T; Wireless requires them to ship only locked PPC4100's!When this phone first came out it was shipped unlocked meaning that it could be used with any GSM carrier.  I bought mine through AT&T; Wireless, the carrier from Hell.  I bought mine with service I wanted at my companies corporate rate .  When it arrived I had to take it to a local AT&T; office to get the SIM activated.  They set up my account completely wrong.  I didn't  worry about it at the time because I had service and I assumed that customer service would easily straighten that out.  NOT!!!!!  I couldn't even get different customer service reps to agree on what my account was set up for much less get it changed to the service and rate I signed up for.  I tried for over two months to work with AT&T; Wireless but when I got a bill with roaming and long distance charges, which were included free under the plan I had agreed to, I had had it.  I canceled the service and revoked their authorization to charge to my credit card.  There's much more to all this but it's just more of the same crap.I got T-Mobile service, inserted their SIM, and was good to go.  The PPC4100 wasn't locked to AT&T; Wireless.  Unfortunately a month later the phone developed a screen problem so I sent it to Audiovox for repair under the warranty.  No problem, Audiovox shipped me a new one immediately.Guess what! The new PPC4100 is locked to AT&T; Wireless and I can't get them to unlock it for love or money.  Their customer service reps just pretend that that they don't understand my problem and keep running me around in circles.  I took the phone to a local AT&T; Wireless store and received no help which escalated to my standing outside the store to ask customers not to do business with AT&T; Wireless.  During all of this I did not significantly raise my voice, use profanity, make any threats of any kind, or any other inappropriate behavior.The Mall security guards didn't see it that way.  They arrived in time to hear me ask the first customer about to enter the store "please don't do business with AT&T; Wireless".  That is all I said but the mall rent-a-cops said that I was breaking the law and would arrest me if I didn't leave.Wonderful service AT&T; Wireless gave me isn't it!  American Express is being very slow in disputing the AT&T; Wireless charges against my card but as soon as that is settled I'm returning the phone and all the accessories I bought for it and buying a better PPC phone for about the same price.  With service from T-Mobile of course.
As the review title says, PPC4100 is a nice and compact PDA with quite an attractive look, but its a very poor wireless device, to say the least.Because it comes with ATT Wireless thats notorius for bad GSM service (as I know), it made the matters worse and I didnt know whether to blame the carrier or the phone for such poor reception and signal, and terrible voice quality. Given that people DO use ATT Wireless in NY/ NJ without going nuts about it, I can only blame the phone for it.Comes with Windows Pocket PC 2003 installed, fluid graphics and other good PDA features. Had to send mine back to Amazon.
You might want to think twice about buying an Audiovox phone. I've had one for 2 1/2 months now. Well, I've actually had it only 2 months. It took a little over two weeks for the company to repair it when it stopped getting any signals.But, less than 24 hours after I got it back the phone another problem! This time with the keypad. Audiovox won't let the dealer replace it. It's gotta be sent back again.So, bad quality, bad repair, and bad customer service. Buy at your own risk.
I can't order this phone because the service plans or no good and if you call for help all you get is a run around. The plan for $39 is $85 and you can't change it. This is a trap and make you paid more. I wanted this phone but i can't get it because of the service plan.
I think it is really cool,rad,etc! I must have one as soon as possible!  Thank-you  M Price
Because my wife absolutely loves flipphones (I hate them), I got this phone for her on a Cingular Family Share plan.  To me the phone seems cheap, but it does have a nice color and the buttons are very easy to press.  The screen is also very bright and easy to read.  The ringtone quality is OK, but a lot better than my cheap Nokia 3586.  The phone does feel a bit fragile and it seems like it can't take one drop with out breaking.  But for the most part the phone gets the job done, no extra features, but what do you expect for one of Cingular's cheapest phones?  You can download ringtones for it if you desire.  I am not into downloading ringtones, but my wife loves it.  One thing I do suggest though is going into the internet settings and move the settings from express profile, to a profile that doenst have the login and passwords already stored.  By doing this you prevent any accidental connection to the internet.  The middle button is so easy to fat finger and press and that button's sole purpose is to connect you to the internet which can cost some serious $$$ if you unknowingly leave it on.  By moving from the express profile to another one, whenever you accidently press the internet button, you will just get an error saying, "Service Not available", in other words, you can't connect to the internet and you won't be charged for accidental connections.  I think that it was purposely made like this so they can get money from accidental connections, but good thing you can prevent that from happening.My last service was with MetroPCS and depsite it having unlimited talk time anytime, $52.08 was entirely too much to pay for crappy service that only works in Atlanta.  I was lucky to get one bar while sitting at my second floor cube at work.  In the elevator, the phone would just say "Serching for service.."  Did I mention the dropped calls?  I stopped using the phone because in the rare instances where the call wasn't dropped, I couldn't hear the other person on the other side half the time anyway.  My Metro phone's battery was dead at least 2 weeks before I decided to go to Cingular, and I never even bothered charging it up.  Cingular's service is miles ahead of Metro, full bar strength most everywhere I go, and even 3 bars in an elevator!  I can actually hear the other person on the phone and don't have to worry about important calls being dropped because of poor signal strength.  Plus Cingular has rollover and unlimted mobile to mobile and free nights and weekends.  I don't use the cell that much, so my 850 minute plan Family share plan may be overkill, but with my wife's phone on my plan its the same price (59.99 + 9.99 additonal line) as the family share 600 minute plan (49.99 + 19.99 additional line), so why not get the extra 150 minutes?  Cingular Customer service occasionaly does have you on hold for a long time, but for the most part their reps are very friendly and helpful, unlike MetroPCS.I highly recommend Cingular, the phone is your own personal taste though.  It gets the job done, but thats about it.
Cingular is great. They are the company that you get the most bang for your buck. Have great recption with this and all of the other Cingular phones my family has had. From the old TDMA the GSM is great. But remember you get what you pay for on phones. I mean the X427m. It is a great phone without a camera may I add. So if you gotta have the best technology get a better phone. Camera phones from [...] are very reasonable.
I personally have the Samsung X247M. It's a great phone for those who don't need a Camera Phone. It has lot of features like text messaging from providers like AIM and Yahoo. It has Lots of great Ringtones. Great Color Screen! Simple, Small and Fun! It lets Me - Be Me! You can also find the phone on [...]Josh R. JenningsMedia Solutions Consultant
I own and use this phone, and overall, it's excellent.  Samsung got the important features right: Size/weight, battery life, reception and call quality, etc.All the "must-have" features are perfect.  I only wish they hadn't overlooked some "nice-to-haves."My wish list:* [major] Give us a speakerphone, man!* [minor] The display breaks phone numbers up at the 5th digit, so dialed numbers look like this:  718-55  5-1212* [medium] The call logs only indicate the names of friends--not their numbers.  I.e., it will tell me that my friend "Joe" called, but not whether it was from his home, his office or his mobile (if I have all three in my phone book).  This is especially inconvenient when it comes to using the "recently dialed calls" list.The same problem applies to the caller ID screen that appears when a friend calls.  Even with called ID, I find myself asking friends who call me, "Are you calling from home or from work?" because all my caller ID reports is that "Joe" from my phonebook is calling.* [minor] It's currently difficult to find accessories for this phone--in part because of Samsung's questionable decision to use a completely non-standard jack for the headset connection.I'll leave it at that.  All in all, an excellent performer and a great, fun phone.  But a phone at this level should have its user interface thought through a little better.
I Just Bought This Phone A little while ago and when i bought it they made sure this is the one i wanted because of complaints that the sound quality was bad. Well that is if you are in certain areas that dont get the best reception because it sounds just as good as my nokia and sony ericsson and my sidekick 2,but it has alot more features that are well worth the money( dual color screens for the photo viewfinder and as a photo caller id, lights up bright on the front with a multi color,changable service light,has a great quality vga camera with effects such as frames, black and white,sepia tone,negative and it can even make a picture look like a sketch,and it does this all sharply so it doesnt look cheap. also it gets great reception and has a vibrant color screen with animated backrounds. it has great battery life and loud crisp clear ringtones including mp3 and polyphonic.You can change your message tones, powering on and off tones, folder tone, and set personal ringtones so it is highly customizable. The phone itself is also very attractive and small. It is also light so it has alot of pocket appeal. The Bad good call quality but still not the best if you are looking for the best i would go for the motorola v400/v551. Also you have to keep the same shutter tone on all the time you cant change it or make it silent, the keys are a bit small but not to where youll be hitting 2 keys at once. It also runs on GPRS not edge so downloads are a bit slow. other than that no problems, and even better it runs on AT&T;/cingular's gsm 850/1900 service so youve got great reliable coverage.
I have been a Sprint customer for 2 years with a Samsung A500, was a very reliable phone except for sprints coverage area. Now to the E317 and Cingular. I read the E316 reviews prior to my purchase and thought that there is now way that this phone (since it's a samsung) is that bad. Well I was wrong, it definitely has its share of problems. I have no gripes with cingular, this is on the phone only.1. The E317 has very, and I mean very, poor sound quality. Unless the person is speaking very loud or has a deep voice it is very difficult to hear them, even with the volume turned all the way up. This is why I am looking into returning it. Heck, this is the most important thing.2.It does not have the standard 2.5mm Hands Free jack but instead one that is proprietary to samsung.3.The volume control on the side controls the keypad volume when not in use, it DOES NOT control the ring volume or send the phone to vibrate mode like my A500 did (I am not sure if samsung has changed all their phones to act like this). Vibrate must be set by the keypad and the ring volume requires you to navigate in the control menus. The side button will control the speaker volume when you are talking on the phone.4. Has a fair amount of background static that is always constant at some level. Much more than I ever had with the A500.5. The speaker produces more of a computer generated voice than most people will be use to or will like. My A500 sounded more like the phone would in your home, where the E317 sounds like you are talking to someone through the computer.6. The Good - Small and light weight with good color displays. Easy to use camera, even though low picture quality. Easy to navigate phonebook and phonebook is easy to setup.Well I hope this helps you make an informed decision and even though you like the looks of the phone, just stick with something like the Motorola V400. I really look for Cingular to pull this phone off the market within 6 months due to complaints (This is not unheard off).
I scoured the internet and did my homework researching this phone, and found only one person complaining about reception and poor sound quality; other then the review above mine here (maybe no one has bothered to review this phone and post their comments).  Well, I am number three now.I was very disappointed this phone sounded the way it did, and had such horrible reception.  I own a v400 as well on the cingular network, and I know what and where I should have good reception, and the e317 is not even in the same ball park, it is horrible.  I am returning it, and going to give it a second try.  If something changes, I will either retract my statements here, or qualify them with more bad news with the replacement e317.Stay tuned...
I downgraded my initial review to two stars due to the terrible sound quality on the phone.  I exchanged it for an LG L1400 and all my problems with sound went away.The good:- really small and light- nice displays- Camera & photo caller id featureThe bad:- Terrible sound quality -- the speaker is loud, but it is buzzy and distorted- poor reception -- I find I miss calls frequently because the phone does not ring.- the phone makes a 'snapshot' sound when it takes a picture.  I understand that this is required in some countries, but it would have been nice to be able to turn it off.- T9 is not the default for text input (why??!) and I don't think I can change that.
It seems strange that Samsung would try so hard to make such a nice phone that includes great features (picture caller ID, dual LCD screens, intuitive menu,etc), and then forget the most important part - the phone.  The reception is great (at least that's what the phone indicates), but the sound quality is horrible.  I find myself saying "What?" every 10-15 seconds.  I saw mixed reviews about the e316, so I'm not sure if the poor sound quality is a standard feature, or if I just got a bad apple.  I'm definitely returning this one, but not sure what to replace it with.
Overall no major problems with the phone.  Some difficulties with sound quality, but I don't know if it's phone vs. Cinguular.One major glitch is inability to switch into "hide number" in caller ID.  When you do that, the phone stops dialing out after an hour or so.  I thought it was a problem with a particular hand set, got a new one and same thing happens.Will have to exchange it, since I like to keep my number private
I wish I could keep this phone, but the sound quality is so bad that I have to return it.It has some great features- it's very small, great display, the numbers are very BIG when you type them in on the screen...but the sound quality is awful. I really have to press the phone up to my ear to hear and even then, the other person sounds like they are in a tunnel. At first I thought that my earpiece had blown out or something - the way that your car speakers can blow out- but now I think the volume is just lower on this phone than with others.Otherwise though, it's a nice phone.
This phone is better than the other camera phones out there because it's easy to use, while being very capable. The features it provides are useful. The design is very modern and not too complicated as well. I would recommend it to anyone out there.
My review is on Cingular.  I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used.  THEY LIE.  THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY.  THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area.  If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular.  Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse.
I finally got tired of always having both my pockets filled with my h1945 and Sony-Ericsson T610. I've been using the two of these together for a few months, and when I read a little about the h6315 it intriged me. I researched it more and finally decided to buy one. I'm already a T-Mobile customer, so it was just an extra 20$ a month to add the unlimited GPRS (Internet over the cell network). I've had it for about a week, and here are my thoughts.When researching the device, I found it impossible to find the speed of the processor. Here's why: it's 168mhz. You're thinking "Good Lord, that's slow!" -- but what it really means is AMAZING battery life (I am talking unbelievable). So your first choice is between a fast PDA, or the ability to use it unrestrained for a couple days without having to charge it. The only place I've noticed slow performance is with video (which is nigh-unwatchable) -- other than that, it's performed fine. It was no sweat, I don't really ever use my iPAQ for video. MP3s played fine when you keep your other activities undemanding. The biggest problem with the slow processor is lock-ups. From normal use (I'm not a super power-user, I'd bet) I had to reset the device with my stylus about 3 times a day when it would lock up.I focus on the speed so much as it was the biggest on-the-fence deciding factor for me when I was looking into buying the 6315. Everything else works flawlessly; The reception is good (better than my T610, that's for sure), sound quality is good (yes, the speaker is quiet because its located on the back of the unit), the screen quality is great (Looks great using the thing at noon on a sunny day in the middle of a field), bluetooth works fine, the wi-fi is very good (with no delay for picking up networks) -- So, the lockups being the only thing that bother me (and like I said -- decide between speed and battery life now), I think this PDA is perfect for me. Resetting it is no problem if it locks up.Here goes:Pros:BATTERY LIFEGood ReceptionGood Speaker/Mic quality for callsCamera alot better than my T610Screen QualityConnectivity options are amazingCons:Locking UpPoor video playback
I'll confess, I am a gadget freak.  So much so that I get teased a lot about it.  When I left my Pocket PC Phone Edition (the original) on a train back in March, I practically needed rehab to function with just a Blackberry.  I have been waiting for this iPAQ h6315 to come out since they first announced it, and now that I finally have mine, I am thrilled.I prefer this type of combination device for several reasons, not the least of which is the block recognition writing style which is easy for an old Palm user like me to adapt to.  For those who prefer the QWERTY style, there's a keyboard included in the package, how's that for a deal?  I also like just having one device clipped to my belt.  I was carrying several.  Now I just have this and my company issued Blackberry, which I use only for corporate email (hate it for everything else!).  The camera is good for a built in--it is not designed to replace my Fuji S5000 in quality, but for fun photos on the go, it is fine! Through GPRS, I am able to web browse at dial-up speeds, which, though slow compared to WiFi, is better than nothing and lets me do what I need to do where I need to do it.The WiFi on this is SWEET.  I run an 802.11b network at home and am a T-Mobile HotSpot user, and the instant connection I get both at home and at Starbuck's is amazing.  And the convenience of Bluetooth??  I never used my old Pocket PC as a phone, though it was built in, because I hated that darn ear bud cord dangling in my way, and hated putting the PDA to my face to talk on it.  I got the Motorola Bluetooth headset, set it up in less than 5 minutes, and it is so light and comfortable I hardly notice I am wearing it!  Plus the quality is so good that I can drive in my convertible with the top down and still have a conversation.Is this a replacement for my laptop?  No, that's not why I bought it.  Does it keep me connected in every way possible using Bluetooth, GPRS, WiFi and GSM?  You bet.  It keeps me organized, keeps all my information in one place and keeps me amused as well.  With a memory slot built in and a million software titles available to download, this is one cool tool for gadget freaks like me, who always have to have something to play with.
I've waited for quite some time to buy either a smart phone or PC phone.  For the longest time I have carried a lap top (with built in Wi-Fi), a cell phone (tri-band GSM), and until recently, a Palm V.  What a hassle.  When the iPaq h6315 came out two weeks ago, I decided to give it a try.  I've been using the device for two solid weeks and I am thoroughly impressed.Pluses:- The synchronization with Outlook is seamless.  I finally have all my Outlook contacts, shared calendar (organized by categories), tasks, and notes synchronized with my phone.- The audio quality for voice calls is excellent, call volume is always loud enough.- The wireless (GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) options are easy to configure and work together seamlessly.- The battery life is very good, but I would recommend purchasing the extended life battery pack.- The integration with the T-Mobile network is also very good.  Both in the phone itself, and the ability to connect to T-Mobile HotSpots as a preferred Wi-Fi network.- The design is rugged and sturdy enough for heavy every day use.I really could go on and on about all the features I love about this device.Negatives:- The screen is active while the phone is active.  Not a problem if you are using a Bluetooth earpiece or ear bud.  But, just about ever time I let someone else use the phone, the physical contact made by the cheek or ear lobe touching the screens opens various menus or applications.- The VGA camera is not optional.  I would have preferred to be able to order the device without the camera.- Roaming through Wi-Fi networks, e.g. in a neighborhood or mall, creates a large number of persistent entires in the Wi-Fi configuration menu.  It ends up getting cluttered and needs to be cleaned up periodically.All in all I give this device a strong recommendation.  It is the ultimate connectivity tool for business use.  I'm leaving my lap top at home or in the office, and I've put my Palm V in a box.
I bought the h6315 the day it came out on the market for the many benefits that the other reviewers mention. After 3 months of using the 6315, I want to share some of my experiences. First of all, the overall device gives you complete freedom for being out of the office. Here is how I'm using it:- If I'm close to, or know of, wifi networks, then I enable my wifi, otherwise I shut it as its annoying. Now, if the device discovers many, simply go to the wireless menu and connect to the network you want by holding the stylus and clicking connect. Otherwise I rely on GPRS which works great- There has been a patch upgrade for sending or replying to emails with attachments. I have also noticed that it improved my GPRS connectivity especially when I have a strong signal- For using it as a phone, forget holding it next to your ear. This device is made to be used with a Bluetooth headset. I have tried a couple, the Platronics M3000 works the best. It has many features and accessories for longer term wear that makes it so comfortable. I rarely have problems with Bluetooth connection. One point to mention, if I answer the phone call from the Bluetooth ear piece, works great. If you answer from the 6315, the voice is low!!!!- Another note on using the 6315 as a phone. When my battery dies on my Blutooth earpiece, or want to conserve battery life, I switch to stereo headset and use the mic on the 6315 to talk, it works very well. Especially when listening to music and you get a call, as the music is put on hold it starts ringing. The last way of using it as a phone was through the speaker on the back as speaker phone, it's good in quite places.- As for driving and using the device, get the Microsoft Voice Recognition software. It works great and makes the 6315 a true hand free voice activated device. I have configured my voice recorder button to activate the software. Great while driving- Battery life is good, extended battery doubles the battery life.- I keep forgetting about this and remember it when writing long emails, it comes with a detachable keyboard that you simply attach and viola, you can type much faster.- I'm getting the Bluetooth GPS and a car mount kit during Christmas. I will update my feedback after using them.- The case is great and you can store 2 SDs- The device can be unstable sometimes; a simple reset does the trick. I make sure that I do it every morning as I run backups every night- T-Mobile has been great. I switched from Sprint and not going back- International use, I have traveled to the Caribbean, and Eroupe, and this device have been amazing. From the minute the plan lands, and I enable GPRS, I'm back up and running with the entire features that I have back home.What I would like to see in the next edition:- More memory so that I can add some more applications- Integrated voice activated features so I won't have to buy the MS package- The ability to lock the screen when the 6315 in the case. Since it keeps waking up to download emails, it starts turning things on and off as the screen is very sensitive-  Longer battery life, it's never long enough
The good:Finally!  An all-in-one device that actually does everything pretty well!  A couple years ago I bought a Sidekick thinking it would do it all.  It did, but it did everything rather badly.  The feedback on the phone line was so bad that everyone I talked to complained about hearing their own voices coming back to them.  I ended up swapping my SIM card back and forth between my trusty Motorola for phone calls, and the Sidekick to browse the web.  As a web browser, it was better than nothing, but only slightly.  It was awfully slow and timed out a lot.  As a PDA, it wasn't too impressive either.  The features were so stripped down that I ended up going back to my old Ipaq.  So I was schlepping around three gadgets, and carrying an oversized purse to make room for them all.By contrast, the 6315 has excellent sound quality as a phone.  As a PDA, it is great - just what I'm used to.  As a web browser, its speed is decent using GPRS, better with WIFI.  Plus Bluetooth!  And I have always loved the fact that Ipaqs have downsized versions of MS Word and Excel so that I can keep a running expense log, and do some writing when I have a spare minute.  Thus, despite the many problems I'll mention, I am pretty content with my 6315.Also, while some have groused that the Ipaq is only available with T-Mobile right now, for me this is a positive.  I use my phone ALL THE TIME, and I was fortunate enough to latch onto T-Mobile's 3,000 anytime minutes for $49.99 plan a few years ago.  There is no other company that has a comparable plan, with a comparable selection of gadgets and phones, for anywhere close to that price!The bad:There are some bugs that need to be worked out.  The phone turns itself off for no apparent reason now and then, and I discover hours after the fact that all my calls have been going to voicemail.  Also, even when I set it to require the PIN before making a call, sometimes it does, sometimes it does not.When I have the earphone plugged in, the phone makes no external sound whatever.  So if I make a call using the headset, and then just take off the headset without unplugging, all my calls and alerts are inaudible.It's not as hands free as I would like.  On my Motorola, I could just hit one button to open my phone book, scroll down a set number of times (1 for Mom, 2 for Dad, 3 for best friend, etc.), and then hit another button to send the call, all without taking my hand off the steering wheel or my eyes off the road.  The Ipaq requires both hands and my full attention to turn it on, access my contact list, navigate to the right person, and click the link that will make the call.  In other words, it demands more attention than a car radio, and is thus unsafe to use while driving.  Grr!The downright irritating:If you hold the device up to your ear to take a call, your cheek or jaw WILL touch the touch screen, setting off all manner of other functions or disconnecting the call.  There needs to be some way of disabling the screen when you want to.  The only solution I've found is springing another $30 for an INNOPOCKET aluminum case, which lets you at most of the buttons but protects the screen behind an acrylic window.If you have WiFi on, your browsing will be interrupted constantly as new WiFi sites are detected, and God help you if there is a T-Mobile hotspot anywhere nearby!  You will be rerouted to a security screen asking for registration and password, and even if you don't want to use the Hotspot and pay T-Mobile charges, you cannot get away from this screen!!!  I hate this so much that I only use WiFi when I'm darned sure there are no T-Mobile stores anywhere nearby.For whatever reason, T-Mobile sells the 6315 but none of the accessories, and in my experience, the sales reps at T-Mobile stores know diddly about the device's compatibility issues.  They offered me a Jabra Bluetooth headset, but fortunately I had read up in advance and knew that it was incompatible.  HP's website has a list of compatible Bluetooth devices, but T-Mobile doesn't sell any of them.  T-Mobile also does not sell the car charger, the spare AC charger, the extended battery, memory cards, etc.  Most of these you have to get from HP online, and pay a premium price for them.Forget the camera entirely.  It is worthless.  I do enjoy being able to download photos from my digital camera, though - it's like having a wallet full of photos to show off to my friends.The Upshot:If you're looking for a gadget that does it all reasonably well, the 6315 is that device.  There is lots of room for improvement, and it's possible that the Treo 650 will outpace it in the coming months, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the release of the Flipstart hopefully sometime next year.  But at the moment, the 6315 is the best there is, and while some of the problems are annoying, it's worth it to be able to carry a tiny purse again!
Despite negative reports from some disgruntling users, this is a very good unit.  To be fair, this is the most comprehensive device currently avaible on the market.  The battery time is longer than other PDA/smart phone devices on the market, and you can purchase a longer-lasting battery from HP.  Don't expect a device with so many functions will come cheap, it is not fair.  After spending some time setting things up (longer than I had expected), everything runs well as expected (phone, WiFi, email, bluetooth, internet).  The only complain I have is regarding T-Mobile, in some areas the phone connection was not good.  But blame it on T-Mobile, don't blame this problem on the device.  I would say I did not have problem in 90% of the areas I travel through.  Yes, the second generation will be better, but for now this is the best you can find on US market.  I am not going to waste my life waiting for the second generation, I need this device now.
I bought the hp6315 to replace my aging analog cellphone and in hopes of becoming more organized with a PDA.. which I'd never even tried before.  My g/f got her first PDA (also an IPAQ) 6 months earlier and I was intrigued by all of the available programs and how she was able to get rid of her organizer book altogether and sync her device with MS Outlook.Anyhow, long story short.. I had my reservations, but I bought my 6315 the day they came out and I really like it. After about 4 months, I just don't know how I got along without it before. It is with me everywhere I go and thanks to iPAQ backup and ActiveSync, I don't have to worry about data loss if it gets lost/stolen or damaged. I have yet to use the keyboard. So, I'm really glad it is detachable.It has a few minor things I would change (Listen up HP!):The external speaker should be a bit louder.Sometimes it loses the bluetooth connection (occasionally when the device goes into sleep mode.. this can be annoying).It would be nice if it had 128k+ on-board memory (or maybe 2 SD slots?)It really needs a button or switch to disable the screen.. particularly when in a call.I do have to soft reset 2 or 3 times a day.. also annoying.The camera is crap.. a novelty at best.  3.2+mp would be ideal.The software that comes loaded on it is just enough to get by.. you'll need to invest another $150+ in PPC software if you want to make it a true mobile office.  Luckily, most all of the software is available to demo for free first.I paid about $550 for the device, out the door, after taxes and TMo rebate.. pricey.On the positive side..It does have amazing battery life and the charging/sync cradle is quite convenient.The wi-fi and GPRS work great (once the settings are right).The screen is clear, crisp and very durable.The phone reception is fantastic.The carry case that comes with it is really nice.The T-Mobile customer service is absolutely wonderful.BTW, 3 absolute must have programs.. Space Reclaimer, Pocket Informant and True Toolbar. There are free demos available for all 3.
I bought the 6315 to replace a Kyocera 7315. The Kyocera was the worst phone/pda I have ever owned. I had nothing but problems with the 7135 which Kyocera nor Altell is not going to resolve. Now the 6315 seems to be much more stable with a few small issues. The issues are as follows:* a "soft" reset is required ever-so often to restore service or functionality.* no way to shut off the screen or buttons without loosing calls (I called TMobile who made mention they know its an issue and is working on a patch. TMobile/HP, get busy and fix the issue).*Battery life is low (standard battery) when running with bluetooth enabled.The device excells in several areas:*Bluetooth, WiFi, infrared, and GPRS/GSM all in one.*MS mobile (has lots of apps and is growing)*Very useful for remote access to servers, administration, etc.*Seems to be very stable, be careful of the apps that you install. Some apps available are not stable.*Motorola HS 850 works well (not available as of yet at most retailers).Over all, I am pleased with the device.
I bought the iPAQ h6315 about 2 weeks ago.  I mainly wanted something that I could use as my everyday cellphone, a decent handheld for contact/note keeping, something to pass the time surfing the internet, and something that I could use a bluetooth headset with.  I had several problems immediately.  The first is that the Jabra headset would not connect.  I was told it was incompatible by the HP company, and was given a list of other headsets that were compatible -- two headsets later, still could not get it to work.  Apparently it's a pretty common problem from what I've read online.  It also froze fairly often, requiring ~ 4 soft resets a day.  Although theoretically you are not supposed to lose any info on soft resets, I lost my contact list several times.  I had problems with phone reception in the middle of downtown Washington, D.C.  Friends who also had TMobile had good reception standing right next to me, leading me to believe the reception was a problem with the machine itself, rather than TMobile.  On the good side, the WiFi worked well, and the handheld (other than freezing up) in general worked well.  The screen had a nice resolution, and was a nice size.Pros:-  Nice WiFi-  Decent handheld applicationsCons:-  Frequent soft resets needed, occ lost info.-  Bluetooth would not work with multiple different headsets-  Poor reception in area that had good TMobile signals for  others.-  A little big, especially with the keyboard attached.  I returned it.  I spent too much time working with the thing, and was getting mediocre to poor results.  I decided to wait until the Treo Ace will come out (this month? next month?).
I am actually writing this while sitting at a Panera bread using Panera`s wifi network.  I have to agree with Rick`s review. I have all the same praises, but have a few additional negativesFirst, its handwriting  recognition in the block transcription form does not work nearly as well as my old Palm.Second, the volume on the phone is too low.  I almost cannot use the phone without the earpiece unless there's absolutely no background  noise.Third, the ringer is too quiet.Fourth, the "feature" of having the screen  still  stay active while you're on the phone is quite irritating.  I'd really like to see hp develop a patch to fix thisI've got to go.  I'll write more on the review when I've got more time.
I purchased this over a month ago. I like it overall. Following are details:Pros1. Connectivity features (GPRS, Wifi, Bluetooth, Infrared)2. Decent size (not too big, manageable)3. Screen Size (compared to Treo)4. Rubber sidings, help in good grip5. Decent memory sizeCons1. Cannot do a landscape mode2. Hangs every once in a  while (so far not bothered me too much)3. Speed is a bit slow (again has not bothered too much so far)
I have been a very happy Ipaq user since they came out. I was looking for a replacement for my old 3850. As a package the h6315 looks very good but one major downside (for me)The big downside is that it comes "locked" so that you can only use a T-Mobile card in it. On inquiry with HP/T Mobile you have to take out a years contract and they will only issue the unlock code after three months. I travel a lot and use my Ipaq for work with a corporate SIM card (different provider). This won't work for me. I think I'll wait and look for something less restricted.
The HP 6315 should never have been released. It is unstable and has to be soft rebooted about once a day but the big problem is the cell phone. T-mobile is the carrier but I believe it is the 6315 that is the problem as we have no problems with two other Tmobile phones in the same places. Worst of all the phone shuts down on it's own and you don't know it until you look at it. I thought I had a bad unit until I checked the web users forums for the hp 6315 and saw that everyone else also had these problems and other problems I had not noticed yet.Stay far away from this wreck.
That's all you need to know.  Camera, Cell Phone, PDA, Music Player, DVD (with software) player.  You will need nothing else for at least three to four years.
I thought I was getting a deal with this device, instead I got a steal. It is the worse device I ever had in my entire life. I would not recommend it no one.HP needs to take this back into their development shop and do some major work on it. I dont even know why they released this stupid piece of crap to the market.It is an embarrassment to my technology knowledge. I bought it to replace two of my devices, the HP iPaq 1945 and Sony Ericsson T68i, this was a really bad mistake.After purchasing the HP Ipaq h6315 in September 2004, I totally regret that buy.The device is a living disaster, it is total crap and waste of my time.Cons- Cannot align the screen after the first week.- Speaker phone is extremely low- Volume problems- Slow processor - 200mhz- Loading Applications takes a long time (due to slow processor)- Small installed RAM - 64MB, should be at least 128MB for a device of this type- Battery life is poor- Camera resolution is the worse I have seen on a PDA/Phone- No video recording feature on camera- No flash on camera / or supporting light- Cellular service is poor/weak reception. Stays for over 15mins before locating provider- Display is wash-out / sometimes yellowish- Heavy and bukly unit- Form-factor is poorly design- No integrated keyboard / have to snap on a stupid keyboard which adds more weight to the unit- Seldom hangs after using bluetooth and WiFi- Very expensive for this unit- HP overseas support is a total disgrace to the IT industry.- Lack of software titles available / need apps to take advance of the various features within  the device. i.e - bluetooth, Wifi and camera.Pros- Large display- 4 Wireless standards - GSM, WiFi, Bluetooth and InfraredI got angry and break the screen, because of the above issues I was experiencing with this unit. I really now hate this line of HP products and regret ever fooling myself into buying one.In addition, it let me want to stop using the PocketPC and wait until more vendors place suitable products on the market.I really love the Pocket PC O/S, however HP makes the worse device to compliment this software. I still need to get a portable device (PDA), so I guess I will continue looking, maybe the future Treo 650 or MPx might do the job.HP makes me want to stop using the Pocket PC O/S and start looking at the PalmOne solution.
Before I review the phone itself, a few words about Verizon. Their new plans count peak time till 9PM, not 8PM as it used to be. Even if you get more minutes, you're effectively loosing 20 hrs or so a month, and virtually eliminate night-time savings when calling East Coast M-F from the West Coast. This information is well hidden from prospective subscribers. Calling voicemail costs air-time minutes - make sure you program the phone to dial it automatically for speed. Their customer service has been easy to contact and pleasant to deal with, but there were numerous problems and mistakes that needed to be addressed when activating the phones and when reviewing the bills. Read your bill carefully.This stylish phone is quite well designed when it comes to integrating the variety of features it offers. There is, however, one glaring (no pun intended) flaw: the color screen is completely useless in daylight. I don't mean that it is difficult to read. It is impossible to read at all. No matter how you shield it with your hand, or try to find some shade; if there is more light than what you normally find indoors, the display simply looks as if it were turned off. There is no brightness adjustment, so it's not a question of setting the phone correctly. The only thing to be done is to find direct strong sunlight and then manipulate the phone just so, and maybe you will get a reading from this display as the sun rays reflect from the display's surface. Once indoors, or at night, there is no problem. The display then looks quite impressive and is functional.If outdoor viewing is rather handicapped, you do get compensated with a choice of wallpapers and screen savers for the display!Don't get excited about taking pictures with this phone. They are extremely poor quality. And yet, this is a gimmick pushed by both Motorola (the manual explains picture taking before anything else!) and Verizon, which wants you to pay some eight bucks a month to send up to 20 of these to other people. Someone is apparently joking around here.I have two of these phones. One of them has a somewhat brighter screen than the other, which makes manufacturing tolerances questionable. Again, brightness is not adjustable - only the duration of backlighting is. One of the phones initially had a problem with the display, but after wiggling the cover several times, the contacts apparently mated and now it works fine. However, the button backlighting turns itself off when you hit a key now and then, on either phone - someone working on power management has opted for reversed logic.The speaker phone cannot be turned on if the headset is plugged in. This makes it inconvenient if you want someone else to hear the conversation while you are using the headset. If you have the headset plugged in, folding the phone does not drop the connection - the phone disconnects only when it detects the other end of the line terminate the call. Be carefull and use the END key.Entering text can get complicated, even though Motorola tried to make it easy with their we-will-guess-as-you-type smarts - more confusing than useful. But once you get used to the basics of text entering, it's not too bad (except for that disapearing key backlighting I mentioned).Voice dialing works poorly - the phone usually does not recognize what one is saying. My old Samsung did much better than this unit (to put it simply, Samsung was useable, while this one is not). Also, it takes longer to dial with voice: you have to state a function first, than a name, each time having a little "conversation" with the phone's synthetic ego. A nice demo-level functionality, but quite useless in the field. The exercise gets even rediculous if you enter a person's name that's not common in English: the phone will insist that you pronounce it the way the voice synthesizer chooses to pronounce it, which means you either have to intentionally misspel it or else intentioanally mispronounce it. My old Samsung simply asked you to record your own pronounciation of an entry and then tried (quite reliably) to match it when you spoke it again while voice dialing.The selection of ring sounds offers a bunch of MIDI tunes that sound absolutely horrendous. Try using some of the more basic choices or else risk being taken for a moron by the public around you. Again, the corporate types want to steer you towards downloading more sounds and tunes for additional money.On the more positive note, the phone is stylish and convenient to use in other ways. The keypad and navigation buttons work very well. I like the single key speed dialing - but you have to dig deep into the manual to discover this feature. I also like that you can browse contacts, etc. while talking on line. In the dark the unit looks impressive and menus are thought out well. The speaker phone mode actually works. The contacts database is well designed, and you get a calendar and a calculator for good measure. The interface is quite customizable.But keep in mind that the plethora of functions can be overwhelming. This is not a gadget for technically challenged people.The reception quality is fine. Typically, you can hear people better (actually very well) than they can hear you. The headset that comes with the "Essentials Pack" works well and is easy to wear, but keeping the plug close to the ear canal can be a bit problematic. The leather cover looks nice and fits well, but has a tendency to quickly collect moisture between the display's surface and the transparent plastic that goes over it.I am giving it only 3 stars for taking a giant step backward in display usability and substandard voice dialing capability, both of which were implemented better three years ago on other phones using less advanced technologies. Cheap thrills driven by greed are unbecoming and embarrasing. If you can live with these limitations, go for it, you may actually end up enjoying it a lot for other reasons.
This is a great little phone for the money. I originally had the same problem with viewing the screen in the daylight but resolved it by changing the background wallpaper to none and changing the color scheme so the background is now white. This makes the screen easy to read in all but direct sunlight. Turning my back to the sun is sufficient to see the screen well.
Yes if you take advantage of a promotional price plan or purchase a subsidized phone Verizon Wireless will extend your plan. I don't have a problem with this 1 because I don't intend to leave and know I can change the plan at any time and 2 if they are paying for me to get a new cool phone like the V265 for free then I would expect to give something back (and I am not really giving anything because I am not leaving anyway).On the Phone... It is the best ergonomics of phones out there today, just the right size not to small not to big. All the features work well. The camera could be better but after all it is a phone not a camera. I like having it for the quality I would expect to always be in my pocket for emergencies or they hey let me get a picture of that to reference later. If I am taking pictures of the kids or vacations and I plan to print them later I carry my 5mp cannon! There is no cell phone that will ever produce this quality... Its all about lens size and I don't want a cell phone the size of my cannon.
i had used a nokia for 1 year - nokia 6610. it is an amazing phone. but with t mobile. i wanted a better network so had to switch to verizon.if i compare this to nokia... its not even close.bad battery.. 2 hours of talk time, which is not what they claim. my nokia easily lasted more than 200 mins. and is charged within 1/2 an hour!! this takes more than 4 hours to charge, even my laptop charges faster. so i have to charge this phone everyday or maybe 2 times a day!the camera is horrible, the display resolution is sad and depressing, if u compare this phone with the latest samsungs which have an amazing crisp and clear colors, so u can have impressive wallpapers. this hardly looks like a color screen, in this digital world.on the positive side, i think its keypad is really soft and gr8! better thn nokia maybe. and when you open the phone it looks impressive! the reception is good. speaker phone is good as well. u can record ur conversation, which is cool as well. also very easy to use!but if u "have" to go for verizon, i think this is the best choice, as samsung/ LG are not as good as motorola when it comes to reliability. and i think nokia and motorola are definitely better brands and better phone companies than samsung and LG.
I just love it, I have had a number of different phones on different carriers and have come to the conclusion that the Verizon Network is far superior and this phone is a good blend of strong features and good usability. The Amazon price is impossible to beat.
Overall, this is a good phone.  It has good phone reception and nice new features like a color screen, camera, web and txt messaging.  There is one "improvements" one would like to see that most other phones seem to already have.  You cannot associate pictures with people listed in your contact list.
Phone's display is so small and Verizon has a policy of extending your contract anytime you change your rate plan! I know several people who haveactually been extendedand they were never told or asked if this was ok! Beware of Verizon and this phone!
i've had this phone for about 3 weeks now, and battery does not last long. seems like there is a memory effect.  i can talk 1.5 hrs straight, and the phone is dead!
This phone is a great blend of cool features and a highly usable phone!
bought it 2 weeks ago for ridiculous $$$. never spent money on a cell phone before, im totally in love with it. switched over from sony T610 which is quite a phone in its own right, never want to switch back again. the camera is good enough for decent pictures, the MP3 player and external speaker are nice, videos are quite decent, and 10 minutes of video isnt lying. i can put about 9/10 songs on the included 64 mb card, and word on street is that a 512mb will slot in :)if you want to see my pictures:[...]if you want one, i can hook it upmoosecsx@gmail.com
This is the first so called "smart phone" I bought. I cannot compare it to the other's sice I have not used any, but this phone is way cool!!. The phone stands out in a crowd (specially the black and red one), the reception and quality of sound is exceptional and the picture clarity is magnificient due to its 1 megapixel capability. The video is also quite good. Highly recommended.
i bought this phone two weeks ago and i am using it with t.mobile and nothing to beat this phone in the pictures,video and the reception.i was really surprised to see the picture quality and the downloaded videos.i bought it from this website [...] they have good phones and good service.dont havea second thought even if you find the phoen expensive ull love it.
