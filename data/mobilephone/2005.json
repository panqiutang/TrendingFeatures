My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.
i had this phone for over a year, i loved it best phone i ever had, the only negative thing i can say is that the case is kinda weak and the holster holds the phone backwards so it doesnt break the external caller id if dropped, this means you have to take the phone out of the clip to answer the phone, unless you use speaker phone, id recommend this to anyone that wants nextel, best phone they had
I have had this phone for 3 years now I would never get another phone.  Over the time I have had this phone.  I have droped it... kicked it trying to pick it up.... and have ran the battery to dead several times all for it to recharge back in no time... I recommed the extra long battery for this phone I could go days before a recharge which was great for me.  But last week I left it in my pants and threw them in the wash all to find my poor little phone dying at the bottom of the washer.  I don't think many pones could even turn on after that abuse... but this one did... and well it doesn't work some part of the circut shorted and it just blinks now... but I just ordered another one and hope for it to be as good as the last one...David
MY HUSBAND ACTUALLY HAS THIS PHONE AND EVERYDAY ALL IHEAR IS, " I JUST WANT TO THROW THIS PHONE INTO A WALL." THE BATTERY LIFE IS TERRIBLE AND BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL SCREENS ARE GONE. OF COURSE SPRINT CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AS USUAL. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
This phone is very poor quality. It started to fall apart on me only about 6 months after I got it. One of the hinges snapped, so it wouldn't close correctly and the outside display would not come on. A few months later, the other side broke, and it was dangling by a wire. I would NOT reccomend this phone unless you only plan to have it temporarily.
I've had my 8100 for about two years.  Dropped it on pavement, concrete, wood floors, etc. at least 30 times so it has a ton of scratches but it's held up very well.  My 2-year old has chewed on it, licked it, smacked it, etc. -- still no problems.  Signal has been solid, intuitive usability is very good.  My standard battery was great for the first 20 months (several hours of talk time, a week of standby) and just now is needing a charge every other day.I'll definitely buy a Sanyo again.
I went through about 5 phones within a 4 month period always some kind of problem. Until I upgraded to the Sanyo 8100 which Im shocked to have now had it for longer than a year. I could have sworn it would just had lasted me about 6 months. So I rate this Sprint phone with 5 stars and I plan on staying with it till it dies or just stay in the Sanyo family.
I have had my SCP-8100 for 3 years now.  It has been a great phone till the last 2 months.  One of the hinges finally broke after the millionth time I have dropped it.  This thing has been laying in 7 inchs of snow for about 5 mins before I realized it wasn't in my pocket, and it never stopped working.  The only other complaint other than the hinge is the battery.  I had it for about 2 years and I had to replace the battery.  The life went from 30hrs too about 6hrs, on... not talking... I had to charge my phone while I was a work as so the battery would be good for my drive home.  But, I went to [...] and found my battery for $12.90, when the same battery at my local Sprint Store was $69.99.  Since I recieved the new battery nothing has gone wrong with my phone.  I love it and I would recommend it too anyone else who is wanting a good camera/media phone.
I have had this phone for 3 years now, and i cannot tell you how many times I've dropped it, and it is still running fine. I don't know what that other person did to it to make it break after 6 months. My biggest complaint about it is that after 3 years of working great, the battery is starting to crap out on me, but other than that, the phone is great. (I wish I could say the same for sprint's service).
I love this phone. I've had my own for over a year now and have since bought one for my son and for my daughter. Battery life is excellent, more features that I could dream of using. The phone camera takes OK photos (don't even try at a concert... haha) - and the more modern phones do better in this department, but I'm very satisfied. Just be forewarned. With Sprint PCS, you will encounter many dropped calls and ignorant customer service staff. I've been with Sprint for 7 years now, so I know what I'm talking about. I'd switch, but we get a really good deal through our company. But I digress... the phone is great, I highly recommmend.
I have had this phone for almost two years and it has now broken in half. This has been the best phone by far I have ever owned. I have dropped it a bizzilion times and all the features still worked. It has falling off a moving car, fell in my pool, been thrown into a moving car..  Nice tough phone.. Now I have to find a replacement...  Ugh....  I hope I can find another phone that can with stand the abuse and recklessness of the 8100.
this phone is great and not every one can get onethats what makes it so UNIQUE
I have had the Sanyo 8100 phone from Sprint for about 14 months.  After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.  I have not dropped the phone or done anything else to warrant all the damage.  The hinge to flip open the phone has completely broken -first just one side broke and pretty soon the entire thing broke.  Then just yesterday the display completely stopped working as well.  According to Sprint, I am not eligible for a new phone for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get a new phone that will probably just break after a year.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
This is my second 8100 (1st one died as I left it in the washer) but to this date, this is the best Sprint PCS phone that I have used.  This was recommended to me by the salesman at the Sprint store over a year ago.  Here is the quick list:Pros:1)  Signal:  Rarely do I ever experience any drop calls with this phone compared to my last 2 Samsungs.2)  Display:  Very clear and vibrant.3)  Quality:  As soon as you pick up the phone you feel the quality that it is made.  It does not have the Cheap feel on some of the Nokia and Samsung phones.  My first one was made in Japan and this one is from Malaysia.  Sanyo just makes quality phones.Dislikes1)  Battery Life:  The standard battery is weak.  It rarely lasted more than 2 days when it was brand new and now its about 1 day for me.  And I have 2 batteries.  I purchased an extended battery on Ebay for about $10 and it works great.2) Poor camera under low light:  But what do you expect with a cell phone right?Overall, its a nice phone I only wish Sprint would carry more Sanyos and Motorolas and stop carrying the terrible Nokias and Samsungs.
Almost all that needs to be said has already. Let me just say that I love this phone. Of all the cells I've owned, this Sanyo has the best reception, and quality of any of them. Of those were 2 Nokia, and one Keyocera.  The only issue I have with it, is in low light situations, (read...night-time...) the number keypad is very low lit, and extremely hard to see. This certianly doesn't take away from the greatness of the phone, just a small irritation during 8 hours of the 24 in a day.
This phone has nice features but I've never liked it.  Everything is great except actually talking on the phone.  I've always had trouble hearing people and their voices are often rattly, if that's a word.  Also the small size makes it difficult to dial.
dis fone is so cool it lets me have cool ringtones
Ok...this phone is great!  I recently upgraded it from a moto v180(screen went blank...would barley start up!...friends went through 3 of them!) and i must say...it overall is a very good phone.It has the typical camera that you would find for any phone on the market today.Reason for 4 stars...they have M Mode shortcuts for the internet EVERYWHERE!!!-t0m
This is a good all around phone, but each feature has something lacking.  As a phone, I agree with others that it takes forever to connect each call.  The ringer is very strange - it seems to only start ringing after one or two rings.I think the sound quality is fine, although you have to be careful not to block the mic while holding the phone.The camera is terrible, but serves it purpose.  Good for sending a photo of something funny to a friend, but not something you will want to save the pictures from.Bluetooth is tough to use.  This is my first bluetooth device, so I'm not sure if this is true of all bluetooth devices.  The pairing procedure is a real pain and syncing with my desktop takes forever and results in some strange anomolies in my calendar.The email is also v e r y  s l o w, but is good enough to get the job done.  No ability to forward messages or deal with attachments.The web browser is very basic and will only let you see mobile formatted websites.The big selling point for me is size.  This phone sits in my pants pocket all day and I hardly notice it is there.  I also usually leave it on vibrate only, so the ringer issues dont bother me.Battery life seems very strong for me.  I charge it every night, but use it throughout the day with very little impact on the battery meter.
I know it sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think this phone is the worst purchase I have ever made in my adult life. From day one I had problems with reception, with the volume and with a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message. It only got worse over time. The display is essentially impossible to read in sunlight or even interior light brighter than a 60-watt bulb. The photos are awful. I've had the phone barely a year and it has essentially stopped working now. It'll be a cold day in hell before I give Sony Ericcson any more of my money.
I love the look and style of this phone, but by far it has the WORST reception I've ever heard. I am CONSTANTLY dropping calls, and there can be very bad interference/static on my calls. I thought this was just a fluke, complained to AT&T; (when it still was) and they sent me a new phone. Still having all the same problems!! The camera is probably below average aswell. Though this is an older phone and I don't expect people to be buying it, I warn you, don't!!
i think that this is a pretty nice phone its lasted for a long time and has been dropped many times with very little damage. the best part about this phone is that it is simple and easy to understand. plus it has the coolest jumpnrun game on it ever! ok yea so the game deepabyss probably made this phone better since all the other games on it are kinda dumb..the worst part about this phone is that the joystick starts to get kinda sticky after a while.. but keep in mind that i have owned this phone for a long timeoverall its a pretty good phone not a very good camera thou
I bought this phone via e-bay (uh..) cool phone take it with me everywhere . Nick Mp3 player , Cool radio . great for txt msg . but the only thing I don't like is the keypad does not light upif you can memorize the QWERTY keyboard (which I have) then your ok , oh and also the number keys are a little small .good phone though.Nathaniel Newman
I have the 3300 and i bought it for 50and thats a good deal with no service too!!!!! If you have the CArd reader then your fine or if you have the cable which connects to the computer then your fine its all for the MUSIC!!!! IT COMES WITH 64MB!!!!!!!!!!!!its not much but its enough.... and it has radio just buy the headset which costs $$10 JUST TEN DOLLARS then your alright...PHONE $50HEADSET $10total $60
Overall I really like this phone. I've dropped it a million times but it keeps on working. Even worse, I've dropped it in the toilet twice! After two days of dry-out time (each time) I turned it on and it worked perfectly! I find that pretty unbelievable! I was shocked actually. And relieved. I thought for sure I'd have to buy another one. Unfortunately, in one of my droppings, the antenna broke off. T-mobile said they would fix it for $60! Instead, I went on E-bay and bought a replacement antenna, unscrewed the back and changed it myself.I agree with some of the complaints:*Screen is hard to see in bright sun*phone book takes too long to "initialize" after you turn the phone on*scrolling numbers across the screen is annoying*reception can suck (though I think this is more a function of T-Mobile's coverage than of the phone itself. I think this is true because I've had other phones with TMo service and had the same problem)*very juvenile selection of rings tones.On the other hand:*I like the"one-touch" txt msgsing -- just push the left key and you're ready to type  -- bang!*T9 feature (the default) for text messaging is great! For those who say it gives them the wrong word and then they have to go to Alpha Mode -- WRONG! If you finish a word and it isn't the one you want, BEFORE you put in a space, push the down key and it will begin giving you alernate choices. Example: if you want the word "food" it will actually give you the word "done" first -- which isn't what you want in this case. So simply push the down key and it will change to "food", push it again and it will change to "fond", push again and it will change to "dome", etc. When the word you were trying for comes up, just put in a space and keep typing the rest of your sentence.*Another T9 tip: for contractions, such as "can't", type in c-a-n-then the number "1" key (which will give you a period) - then "t". As soon as you hit the last letter ("t") the period will magically change to an apostrophe. Neat!*Still another tip: Sometimes you don't realize you've got a wrong word in your sentence til after you've finished. No worries! Just scroll back (with the left key) until the cursor is positioned just after the last letter of the word you want to change. Now push the "down" key to get all the other word options.*But that's not all: For punctuation, hit the number "1" key. It will give you a period. Push the "down" key and you will get a comma, a dash, a question mark, and exclamation, an apostrophe, an @ sign, a colon, a semi-colon, a slash, and a number 1. You simply keep pushing the down key until what you want is displayed.*Remember in T9 you can access numbers from all keys too. If you press the "a" key for instance but really want the number "2", just push the down key for options and keep pushing til the "2" displays.*Here's a T9 feature I discovered by accident: If you're spelling something weird that is not in the phone's dictionary (and by the way you can add your own words to the dictionary), then type the first part of the word (let's say you want the name "Darrel" which isn't in the dictionary) -- simply type in the first part of the word "Dar", it will first display "Far", now push the down key multiple times until "Dar" appears. Now, push the # sign to get a space. Now push the Clear key to back up. Now type the balance of the word "rel" and you will have the complete word. It seems that putting a space after a word, then hitting the Clear key to move back, somehow locks what you just typed from changing anymore. Now only the new letters you add on will change when you push the down key. It's VERY fast once you've done it a few times and keeps you from having to go into Alpha Mode.*I like the fact that the ringers are very loud. And so is the earpiece volume.*Once person said that there is no way to send a person to voicemail without opening the phone, which is then of course, the same as answering it. WRONG! When your phone is ringing, push the button on the side -- it silences the ringer -- but the phone is still actually ringing and will continue to ring as long as it normally would, except now you can't hear it.. When that time elapses it will click over to voice-mail.*This can be handy if you're in a place where you need time to look at the screen to see if you want to take the call but need to silence the ringer immediately. Even if you have silenced it by pushing the button, you still have as much time to decide to take the call as you would if you could still hear it. If you decide not to, it simply goes to voice-mail.*Someone else said they needed a special headset to fit the phone -- but I bought one at a thrift store and it worked fine. And unlike another's complaint, it allows me to answer and talk on the phone without flipping the phone open. It's great.*Another tip: Type up a little sticker on your computer that says "If found, please call (friend/spouse name) at (their phone number)." I have inadvertently left mine several times, and someone always calls my friend to say they have the phone. I made my daughter do this to her phone and one time I got a call from the Phoenix airport in the middle of the night telling me they found her phone.*To keep names together in the phonebook, I put a common word in front. Example: for restuarants, I put "Eat." in front of each one, then their name (like "Eat.Outback Stkhse"). This keeps all the restaurants together as I scroll through my phone book (I don't really like having the extra keystroking to find them in a "group" -- I just like to have them right there with the rest of my numbers).
I've read a lot of reviews of this phone and it's interesting to me  how people are upset at the phone, not necessarily because the phone itself is bad, but because they don't know how to work the thing.  If you take the time to actually read the manual you will learn how to do things the way they should be done and you can troubleshoot things that annoy you.  You can delete text messages with two clicks by pressing "delete all."  Are we so lazy that pushing a button more than once makes us a downgrade a product?  I like this phone - the reception is fine and no one has ever complained they can't hear me and I live in NYC, one of the noisiest places on earth.  So, anyway, here is the good:1) Small, convenient size2) Nice, crisp, clear screen (adjust the brightness so you can see it outside)3) Decent battery charge - not the best but not the worst either4) Phone book entry option when you dial any number - I like this feature because if you are dialing a number the phone asks if you want this in your phonebook.5) The phone works - period.The not so good:1) Yes the phone is a bit delicate but that's why I bought a case for it.  Case = no scratches or dings.  For some reason flip phones are delicate flowers while brick or candy bar styles like Nokia are tanks.  Spend $10 for a case or cover and forget about it.2) The ringer could be louder and there's no vibrate then ring option - just vibrate OR ring3) Really bad ringtones easily overcome by downloading new ones at T-Mobile.  I have Vince Guaraldi's "Linus & Lucy" on mine now.4) Handset volume can only be adjusted while on a call - for some weird reason when not on a call the exterior volume control on the side controls the keypad volume.  Strange but not insurmountable.In sum, I got this phone free with a rebate and for free it's not a bad phone. I don't need bells and whistles and I don't want my phone to do more than let me talk with my friends and family.  Buyer beware - if you want something more flashy then don't get this phone - it will disappoint.  Buy the Sidekick II or Motorola Razr if you want it all.  This suits me fine and the price was right.
I'm hoping I can upgrade to a better phone.+After several Nokia bricks, I was happy to own a light clamshell-design phone. No more accidental dialing! Caller groups and assignable rings are very useful as well. I like the silver exterior, the outside caller id screen, the color display and the outside light.  I've accidentally dropped this phone several times with no noticeable problems afterwards, so it's sturdier than it looks.=Reception is not thrilling but I live in a hilly area which seems to have spotty reception for everyone.-Functional problems:  First, the phone book takes forever to initialize, as others have noted. Second, the clock has to be set manually and it becomes more inaccurate as the battery slows down.  I miss the way my old Nokias used to grab the correct time.Aesthetic problems: The obnoxious ringtones that shipped with the phone were also a step down from the Nokia. (The pop songs available for download through T-Mobile aren't much better. It's truly sad when you have to search and download a ring that just sounds like a ring. )
I was surprised to see how many people wrote such negative reviews on this phone, seriously...I bought this phone 7 months ago and I still love it!  It's small, practical, reliable, and it makes calls and recieves calls like a breeze.  I know it's kinda delecate and it scratches easily, but that's normal wear and tear.  Sure the ringer tones aren't the loudest, but whenever I'm in a situation where I can't hear my ring tone, I just put it in vibrate mode.  Just hold the # key and it's on.  The ring tones aren't bad...I really like the "Blue Jazz" one it came with, which is what I have it set to.It's a fun and friedly phone to use...it has a special "tone" when you turn it on or off, it has lots of ring tones, lots of service light colors, lots of message tones, and the LCD screens on the top and bottom of the phone make it so convenient to use!  The buttons and overall finish of the phone is solid.  None of this flimsy crap like the Sony Erricson's have.  Overall, the layout of the phone is straight forward and easy to use.  It's really a nice phone.
I have had this phone for a month and have been happy overall with it so far (although not nearly as much as the S105 that i had before).  The one main advantage is that it is small and fits in my pocket very nicely.  The screen is a crisp color display and the reception (in NYC) is fairly good.  The one main problem that I have with it is the speaker quality.  I am often not able to hear people clearly through the phone, especially when there is noise on the street.  The battery lasts about 2-3 days without a charge (at a moderate amount of talk time) and for the most part is laid out very well.  For $125 bucks back, you really cant beat it.  Samsung is the best cell phone brand on the market today.
I have owned this phone for 15 months now, so I pretty much know the ins and outs of it.First, let's cover the negatives:1) It does not synchronize its clock with the tower, and the clock loses about a minute per week.2) The antenna permanently protrudes and may break, given enough pressure.  (This has apparently happened to at least one reviewer.)3) There is no way to turn off useless animation on the main screen.  Apparently every background has been designed with animation in mind, with the PURPOSE for said animation being a distant minor issue.  For example, my background of choice is a monthly calendar.  Above it is a large number that indicates the month (right now, "7"), but beside it are three mysterious cubes of differing sizes which rotate once per second.  WHY???  Also, in the period of time after I dial someone's number but before they pick up, there is another very mysterious animation: it looks like balloons on the bouncing up and down on the surface of water.  I would rather preserve the battery than to waste valuable power on puzzling me with useless animations.Despite the fact that I've had the phone for so long, it still sometimes surprises me with its well-thought-out design.The shell:I'm impressed with how durable the flip aspect of the phone feels.  I've compared it to other phones, and those just feel flimsy.  This one is either reliably open, or reliably closed, like a seat belt.  The earbud jack is tightly plugged by an attached rubber flap.  However, the power jack is not -- the phone came with a detached rubber plug which I lost soon thereafter.  The only control accessible when the phone is flipped shut is the volume control which also serves the purpose of activating the backlighting of the front display as well as of silencing an incoming call without disconnecting it, allowing you to silence it, make a very rapid exit, and to answer it then.  Very good design.The front display:The front display is generally not backlit but still on, like typical calculators.  When there is no action, it shows the time, date, signal strength, and battery life.  When someone calls, the display lights up and displays the person (or the phone number) calling.  When I receive a text message, it displays a mailbox.  If you are in a dark area and want to see the display, you can hold the volume toggle on the side and the backlight will turn on for a few seconds.The main display:Aside from negative item #3 above, the main display is well-designed.  In the white bar at the top there is signal and battery strength, and the bottom bar displays what actions the top two keys on the keypad will perform.  (Typically "Menu <---> Ph. Book")  Above the bottom bar is a clock, and the rest of the screen is occupied by a background of your choice.  I like the calendar because it's the most useful, but the phone comes with wallpapers such as "Season", "Eagle", "Bird", as well as several other semi-useful ones such as "Digital Clock" and "Analog Clock".  The main display will dim after about 10 seconds of inactivity, and will turn off about additional 20 seconds later.  (I think this is configurable.)Visual alert:The phone has an LED next to the antenna in the top-right front corner.  Typically it lazily flashes green once every ~10 seconds just to let you know that the phone is alive.  When someone is calling, it frenetically cycles through all its colors, about 5 per second, to get your attention.  When someone sends you a text message, it blinks about twice every second.  Quite useful.The menus:Every option of the menus can be reached either by scrolling up and down through nested menus, or by entering a sequence of digits on the keypad.  Here, too, the top-level menu shows just one option per "page", with the rest of the page being filled by another animation.  However, these animations are actually pertinent to the option rather than mystifying me.  This phone is very configurable: there are separate top-level categories for Sound Settings, Phone Settings, and Network Services, and they contain all kinds of stuff.  For example, you can configure whether the phone answers an incoming call when you flip it open, or whether you have to press a button explicitly.  You can choose from the standard three languages for the interface.  You can set up an approved list of phone numbers that the phone is able to dial.  You can set the clock to display military time both on the front and main displays.Phone book:You may add multiple phone numbers per contact, and the phone can differentiate between home, work, and mobile numbers as well as an email address, by displaying different icons next to each number.Predictive text:There isn't much to say about it since it is a standard feature nowadays, but it is well-integrated: in almost every text field you can choose to enter text in predictive mode.Stability:I've heard many stories of the operating system on cell phones being unstable and requiring a reboot every so often.  Not this one -- I never need to turn it off.  Furthermore, I haven't discovered a single flaw.  (The negative aspects mentioned above are by design, so I don't consider them flaws.)  It has been said that the phone is slow to initialize, which I suppose is true, but the simple solution is: don't turn it off!Battery life:To continue with my "don't turn it off" suggestion: there is just no need to, as the battery life is very good.  The indicator has three bars total, and I've only *once* seen it go down to two bars -- this is after about 24 hours of being unplugged and occasionally used.  It charges very quickly, too.  About 30-60 minutes after plugging it in, it's finished.
I know, people expect all sorts of things from their phones. Me, I value small size and light weight very highly, along with good call quality. I don't need cameras, ring tones, web access, or any of the other bells and whistles, and after 14 months of use, I can say this phone fits the bill wonderfully.My one bone of contention, is that I also want the phone to substitute for a watch. In this modern age of electronics miniaturization, this doesn't seem like much to ask. The E105 has a handy time display on the outside screen - but not only is it not connected to any time server, it loses a couple minutes per month :-(. I replaced one phone for this reason alone, but the replacement is just as bad...
well I got this phone in december 2003 and I paid about $50 or $75 after rebate, I forget, but I can honestly say that I got my money's worth plus more. First off I can't believe how quick people are ready to rip and degrade this phone, only because it gets scratches on it when its dropped, or because it doesnt have the best ringtones in the world. Sure I agree the ring should be a little louder but people cmon if you want a phone with features look for something else like a Nokia or a Palmone treo 600. Ive had this phone for almost 15 months now and I have not had any technical problems with this phone. This phone does what its supposed to do....make and recieve calls. But now I see that people are even complaining about a free phone, people you get what you pay for and I can say that this phone is definetly my moneys worth. It does lack some features that are growing popular these days but I am about to get the palm treo and that one has all the feature but all in all I say this is a perfect phone for someone who doesnt need too many features, needs to take and make calls, wants a good battery life, and doesnt worry too much about what it doesnt have and should have.
I've had this phone for almost 2 years(23 months), and it's still going strong.  There is a little crack on the main body near the hinge that's been there for about 6 months.  It hasn't gotten any worse, nor does it affect the phone in any way.  Mind you this phone has been dropped at least a dozen times, thrown clear across rooms, been used as a playtoy object with my guy friend and pretty much beaten up.  If timex were to have a phone, this one would be it.Although this phone doesn't have a camera, or bluetooth, it's awesome for what it is, a phone.  I took it to europe with me for 4 months and it worked in every country I visited.  You do have to call up T-mobile and tell them to set it up though, no biggie.  Plus it's frickin tiny!
I've had this phone for about a year now. I chose it b/c it was T-Mobile's smallest model and the sales person said that it has great reception. I do admit that the reception for this phone is very good. I've been in basements, elevators, and the middle of nowhere and still managed to find a bar or two. Now that doesn't mean you can find service everywhere. But I was impressed w/ how well it found reception. Unfortunately, that's about all the good I can say about it. On the downside talk-time doesn't last as long as stated in the description. I have all the power-saving features activated according to the manual to extend batter life and yet I'm still squeezing barely 3 hours out of it. Maybe I just have a bum battery but w/ lith. ion being the lastest and greatest it is not performing very well. Texting can also be a pain w/ the predictive T9 function. At least to me it's more frustating trying to text when it keeps guessing what you want to type and isn't even close to the correct word. I don't select the function, but it's still a pain to work around. The screen is very bright and colorful but like most it is virtually impossible to see outside even at an angle and shaded. I've had two glitches so far, the first is that there are times when dialing it just cycles through w/ no ring tone, almost like it's searching for a signal, even when there is one. The only way I've found to fix it is to shut the phone off and turn it back on. The second is a recent one, as of a few days ago, I have not been able to send a text msg. I can receive them fine, but to reply or send one I contiunally get the "error" msg. Haven't found a way to solve it. B/c of this, I'm headed back to T-Mobile to look for a new phone. Although it lasted a year, that's still not long enough to be considered a quality phone.
One year completed without problems. I like its light weight. Easy to carry in pocket.....a robust phone.. the cons are its low range of features.....but its battery life, reception.....is great
I was surprised to see some bad reviews on this phone. I have NEVER had problems with the phone. I own the phone for almost 16 months now, no complaints. I dropped it several times and yet it was in perfect condition. Very light in weight and so sleek it fits in any of my tiny purses. Charges fast too.
This is the phone I was using until the screen broke. Im giving it 4 stars because of how it is while its working lol. Really really easy to use. Easy on the text, I can text really fast with this phone. Its a small phone, good buttons. Good features on it. Easy to get to things quickly. One downfall is the service. I couldnt get very good service with this phone. While in buildings etc. Once outside it isnt no big deal, but in certain buildings ehh... got some trouble. But this is a good little phone!!! But it doesnt work anymore, the screen is black now, and I cant see anything. It happened out of no where to. Even though it has been dropped in water twice, and dropped on the floor quite a few times lol. But nothing serious. Its a good phone.
I love this little cell phone!  How it looks, its features, how it fits in the palm of my hand.  I've had it for 2 years now, and I never get tired of it.  The phone book and menu are on the display screen when I flip it open, so I can scroll to anyone or anything I need at all times, and it has fantastic color and sharpness on the inside.  Right now I have the 2004 World Series Champs Boston Red Sox as my wallpaper, and it's clear as the day I downloaded it.  Only problem with this little phone is that I accidentally dropped it one day, and scratched up the front, and now I can't find another one anywhere!!  I tried the newer Samsung phone, but I hated the look of it, and sent it back without programming it with my Sim card.  I'm still looking for a new e105--I can't understand why my cell phone company doesn't offer it anymore.  It always works, and I never turn mine off, it charges quickly, and I get excellent reception--even in elevators!!  I've had 6 different phones, and this is the only keeper I've found--anyone know where I can get a new e105?  Thanks!
This phone isn't that bad. It's very small and sleek. East to download things on T-Zones. The cons of it is that sometimes when I close it, it turns off (I hate that!). And when you first turn it on, you have to wait about five minutes to get the phonebook and text messaging option to work. That sucks! But it's very durable; I dropped it a couple of times (it only got a few scratches, including a few very ugly holes on the cheap plastic outside window). And I also dropped it in a bathtub full of water, and after drying it off (I dropped it in the water about 6 months ago) it still worked(s). But overall, I like it.
I have this cell phone for 7 months, and i can say that it is the worst cell phone ever. I have'nt made one call with this phone without the person on the other side of the line complaining abt poor voice quality. The phone goes in a slumber when i send or delete a sms. i had a nokia 3595 before, it is not as sleek or trendy as this phone, but it was a great cellphone.
I bought this phone in January of 2005 from TMobile. I was so happy to get a cell phone, so i really wanted it. I had previously had a Nokia 3595 and i hated it.After having it for about 3 1/2 months i think i have it down well.Pros: The cell phone is thin, more so than most other flip phones, the screen is very bright and very readable, it has games, some applications, and a GPRS internet connection.CONS: The battery life sucks and i usually have to charge it every 3 to 4 days! The ring tones stink, and the phone sometimes doesn't even ring when it should, the voice recorder is worthless because it doesn't record high pitch and low pitch sounds, the phone doesn't flip very well, and it is really easy to dent the front cover. I have a friend who has the same phone and she put it in her pocket, she was wearing slightly tight pants, and the front screen had cracked! The battery bar isn't very reliable because if i charge it for 5 minutes the bar shows that it is fully charged but the phone still charges.Over all, if you really dont care what kind of phone you buy you might like this one slightly.
I had this phone for over one year now and never had a problem with it. When my friends are complaining about the battery life of their cell phone, mine will get through 2-3 days without recharging it. Love it!
I got the E105 last Christmas, (free) through an online deal. I upgraded from an old school Nokia and just wanted a cute little flip phone that wasn't so obsolete. Sure, there aren't as many features on this phone as there are on others, but the basics the phone DOES have (such as receiving and making calls) work just fine. I like that this phone has a larger color screen than some Motorolas or Ericsons. The ringtones are a bit tedious and off the wall, but I've downloaded other ringtones that sound great. I've read other reviews where people are upset and irritated because this phone doesn't have the features they want, or it's so time consuming to get to the screen they need to get to, etc. I honestly don't have this problem. Reading the manual helps. I also read a review that said the phone will not charge unless it's off. NOT true. It's a good basic phone, light weight, and hey, I got it for free. I like it.
This cell phone is terrible.  I have had it a year now and I continue to hate it, and am finally about to get another one. The ONLY two good things about it are that it is tiny and it holds its charge for a long time.Otherwise:1.  The options for text messaging or adding addresses lock in Caps only--really annoying--cannot do lower case letters so YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARE CONSTANLY YELLING OVER AIM OR TEXT MESSAGING.2.  Falls and instantly scratches--the chrome looks terrible the very first time you drop it.3.  the hinges and lights have broken off.  honestly, folks, i have only dropped it a half dozen times, i'm not clumsy and have never thrown it, and it's dinged and dented all over.4.  You can never hear the beep to tell you another caller is trying to get through.5.  The multi-toned ring tones are IMPOSSIBLE to hear if you are in ANY place where there is noise (store, airport, etc) because there is not just one particular tone to get your attention.6.  Individual keys on keypad are too smooth and close together so it is hard to feel your way to press certain ones.7.  People are always telling me they cannot hear me clearly, this is not about reception but the speaker quality of the outgoing speaker piece.8.  This thing PALES in comparison to its predecessor the S105 which I loved.9.  In order to delete messages telling you you have a voice mail message you have to press 6 buttons to get to delete--way too much effort for something done so regularly.There are other things which I cannot remember at the moment, but to sum it up--the visually attractive qualities are ruined in the first week the first time you drop it; the sound quality is poor; you cannot hear your call waiting beep; and your text messages are ALL CAPS--with so many options out there, save yourself the annoyance!!!!!!  Don't commit and get trapped waiting a year to get a new (free) phone!!!!
I HATE THIS PHONE!  My husband needed a replacement phone.  He just had to have a flip phone.  OK, he instantly fell in love cause he's a gadget-a-holic.I can't believe as much as this phone was that it's T-R-A-S-H!The battery won't charge unless the telephone is OFF!  NOW what if you need to use the phone.  The screen is now all BLACK so you can't even read it.  SO now I have to purchase another cell for Hubby.  He's not even a major talker like his WIFEY so it should have lasted 4 ever!It's a cute phone, but I need something that's more durable for OUR cash flow....
Ok, I'm horrible on all things electronic. One of those people who anything electronic can't get to work, but once in a great while. The great while finally showed up when this phone came around.I bought this phone over a year ago and it's still going strong. I've dropped it tons of times and the buttons still work great, the case is still in good condition with a few scratches, but all wear and tear. I had to replace the front faceplate because I broke it by slamming my hip into a counter top with the phone face out in my pocket, but it didn't hurt the LCD screen or the LCD caller ID screen on the front of the phone. C'est la vie.The battery on this lasts for hours, I've gone a couple of days without charging it. The ringers aren't overly loud, but just set to vibrate and it'll get your attention, I've felt the vibration through my purse before. I get a great signal almost everywhere I am and I've rarely had a dropped call. There have been a couple of times where it won't connect, not many, trust me, but with a re-try or two it'll get going.Over all this is a really good phone. It's hardy and stands up to most things I can dish out and I'm hard on many things I own. It's well worth the money.
Could not afford to buy it new. I dropped it and yes it kept on ticking but I dropped it on its antennae and it broke off so I superglued it back on.  Some things can only happen to some people im sure.  Now, it could be because of that, but the phone drops calls without shame, left and right.  Usually in poor weather or when the signal is not strong.  So reception is poor but when the signals strong it is 95 percent reliable.  Battery is fine but you need to fully charge it and not keep it on too much.  that massive (relatively speaking) LCD display is what talkes up all the juice. So what if the addresses take a while to appear...the recently called numbers are readily available.  Funny but even after all of that I still like it because it is one of the most aesthetically pleasing phones out there.  I would recommend it to people who want a sexy phone but not a serious one.  IE.  You would not want to use this for business calls...It would annoy you.  Whatever you do make sure you do not drop it antenae first.
THIS IS ABOUT THE NICET PHONE I HAVE SEEN! ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY WERE GIVING THEM AWAY AT VERIZON. IT SHOULD SERVE MY NEEDS FOR YEARS TO COME. DAVE
okay, i had this phone for like...6 months and it was fine in the first month of so, but then..the battery kept dying, like every 5 inutes. seriosuly, well..i last it like last week so i bought a new phone, the mototrola v551, which is bigger, but a lot nicer, with more features, and i hope the battery stays good! AH dont buy this phone!
Over all I'd say it's a good phone. When I got it I wanted a camera phone but could not afford one so got this one instead. I have not had any problems with it other than it lacks some of the things I look for in a ceel phone such as*Camera*Speaker Phone*Being able to change the face plate w/o a screw driverAlthough I can change the faceplate myself it's a hugh hassle and I have to fight w/ it everytime.I love the it has the HIFI ringers and tha you can change the "service light". Another thing that sucks about it, is that it is so easy to scratch. I drop my phone quite a bit.. and it looks horrible. It still works great though. I've had it since November and will most likly keep it for around another month and than upgrade to the Motorola V300 since it has a camera and speakerphone.
I dont know what you people are thinking but this phone is bad.It oly got looks.The phone hardly has any features and it is really small and it doesnt even have a long recorder this phone cant do much you can only record for 30sec.In the nokia 3650 its a min and in the sony errsion t610 its as long as you want...This phone is a waste even thoe i got it as a gift...I want my Contract to end so i can get my Nokia 3650 back or get the sony errsion t610 or Z1010 this is a peace of garbage...
I don't know why so many reviewers here are complaining about the Nextel service, when in fact, service bars hardly vary from phone to phone. I've had my i730 from when it first came out and it was my first Nextel phone but I've switched my SIM card into other Nextel phones (a convenient feature of Motorola cells) and didn't see much of a significant difference in service. And granted, there might be a geographical difference in the overal Nextel service, but where I am in the city, I hardly have any complaints with either the call service or the Direct Connect availability.Onto the phone itself. It comes with a pretty durable looking steel cover and although I switched my faceplates almost immediately for a white cover (the plain silver was a little blah for me), I was never really too disappointed with its look and feel. The front screen is only a one-liner, but shows all the necessary information - time, service bars, date, and battery life. There are the standard Push-to-talk and volume buttons on the side and two buttons on the top of the mobile which can be used to make a call through speakerphone without flipping the phone open. It's a nice feature, though I haven't really used it too much.Perhaps what's most distinctive of the i730 out of all the other Nextel models is what they call the disco light, which is a circular light-up feature that flashes different colors according to whatever ringtone you use. It's nice to look at and would be more attention-getting, were it not for the fact that so many people have the phone, making it somewhat played out.Overall, the phone has decent battery life and I admit, I've been impressed at how sturdy it's been. I'm a pretty clumsy person and any phone I have tends to be put through some rough conditions (for instance, accidentally stomping on my phone with boots - don't ask), but the i730 has lived up to it pretty bravely. There are a few cons to it though. Depending on how heavy a talker you are, the battery life isn't so great. I have the 1000 minutes a month plan, which allows me to talk for a long enough time but my battery life usually can't survive the hours of talking I can do sometimes. Because I'm on the heavy-user side, though, I'm sure this won't be a problem for the average talker.Another downside I've found with both my phone and others who have bought the i730 is that the paint on the sides of the screen inside the phone will eventually wear and scratch away, leaving some unglamarous spots where you can see what lies underneath. It's probably a cheap paint job on the part of Nextel, but it's nothing a nice makeover can't fix. The i730 is pretty customizable because it's so heavily purchased, and you'll find a lot of places that sell and install whole new housings for you.Since Nextel has been coming out with a whole range of newer and shinier phones, I have recently decided to upgrade to the brand new i870 which just came out but the i730 has served me well. It goes for a pretty decent price now and in my opinion, it's well worth every penny.
This is suppose to be a review of the phone NOT NEXTEL SERVICE!!!  I was looking on here for advise on this phone and I got sick of the Complaints about nextel!!  stick to the subject people.. and try to help people out
Having moved to a new location where my Sprint service was useless, I tried the Nextel i730 by Motorola.  The results were much better than I expected, plus the fact that I got a phone that will hold 600 contacts.  While the phone is a little larger and heavier than my former Samsung, it is not a problem, at least for me.  I am well satisfied with the i730 and would recommend it to anyone.
I have owned this phone for 6 months and it works fine.  I started out with the i530 and this one is MUCH better.  It does so much more and I haven't had any problems with it.
I've read some of the reviews on this phone and I am laughing.  These people have lemon phones or something.  I've had my phone for over a year.  It's been dropped, talked on, and toyed with by my 2 year old and it has always and still works perfectly!  Nextel itself has kinks in their services, but that is not the phone's fault.  I love my phone and I would highly reccomend it again and again!!!
When I bought this phone over a year ago, I bought it chiefly for the walkie-talkie feature, speakerphone feature and international usability (...). After one year of use, the walkie talkie feature is the only above average aspect of this phone. The speaker phone is tinny, and interupts incoming audio if there is the slightest noise entering your mic. The cross-platform usability is such a hassle I never bothered going through the steps necessary to use it overseas. The worst part of this phone (besides Nextel's TERRIBLE network-- don't plan on using if you are more than 5 miles from a major interstate or metro area) is the battery life, which with minimal useage is less than two days. This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network. I would steer clear of this phone, and hope that Nextel's recent merger with Sprint improves the network it operates on.
Just to let the complainers know.  If you take the phone to the Nextel repair shop, there is a hardware and software upgrade to improve performance. I found out when I couldn't get the GPS to connect.
Let me preface this by saying I have bee a Nextel customer for a few years now.  I'm now at the end of my second contract and second phone.I upgraded to this phone last year because my old i90 was starting to look cumbersome and old.  The techonology just wasnt there anymore.The i860 wasnt out quite yet, so next to the i830, this was the hottest phone on the market.  I purchased it an re-upped my contract.At first I loved this phone.  I liked the internet and text messaging features this had over the i90.  I also liked the smaller size compared to the i90 and the nice color screen, but thats pretty much where it ended.This phone is made like a piece of jewlery.  After having it for about 4 months without dropping it, my sister dropped it once and it hasnt been the same since.  My i90 took many many drops and functioned flawlessly.  It turns off and on by itself and the call reception has always been terrible.  My friends can never get ahold of me because Nextel is always searching for 'the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach..."Nextel is great if you are still in college and all your friends have it (2 way), or if you run a business.  But if you are a regular person who is looking for reliable and fairly priced service and, durable phones, look elsewhere.
I have very conflicted feelings towards my i730.  On the one hand, direct connect, text messaging and web access are great, but I NEVER HAVE RECEPTION! What good is a phone if you can never use it? I would understand if I was venturing out into the "boonies" on a regular basis, but my phone drops constantly throughout the city of Chicago and the surrounding area.  In fact, the only time I don't have any trouble is when I'm in a smaller town.  I've heard rumors that the very first batch of the i730's put out do have a lot of reception problems, so that may be the cause of all my troubles.  I've had enough trouble that I probably wouldn't buy this phone again if I had the opportunity though.  I do want to say that Nextel in general is AWESOME.  They have great customer service and I love them!Oh, one more thing.  THANK YOU for putting in the advice for using direct connect on private. Nothing is more annoying than having to listen to other people's conversations just because they're too stupid to learn how to use their phone!
I got this phone for work relaited reasons.  It does exactly what I want it to do.  Yes there are areas where you do not get service but remember, the type of phone does not decide your service, the coverage of the carrier does.Facts:  This phone will make and recieve calls when you have service.  This phone will work with direct connect when BOTH YOU AND THE PERSON YOU ARE CALLING has service.  *Important that both of you have service*  This phone is capable of downloading ringtone, wallpaper, and games/applications.Cons:  The phone does not come with a data cable.To summerize this, If you a signal on the phone and you make a call, it will go through.  I work for a Police Department and use my phone daily for work. It works fine. If it has saved my butt a couple of times (and it has) then it will work for everyone else.
Nextel and Motorola have developed the ultimate "ultra cool, super sleek,great phone w/the i730. Not only does it have consistent great sound quality on calls, but the ability to quickly contact other Nextel friends or relatives with a single push of the Direct Connect button makes other phones "just another phone".**By the way, the Direct Connect (2 way radio) is usable in FULLY PRIVATE mode by simply pressing 1 button. The speaker turns off, you hold the phone to your ear, you scroll to the name of the bud you wish to contact, you push the button to talk and release it to listen and NO ONE has to hear your fast Direct Connect conversation. All Nextel phones have the privacy button for Direct Connect. It makes voice mail such a waste of our time.That is how I use my Nextel all day at work in the office, I also keep mine on silent vibrate mode for totally discrete private use.Look at any volunteer fireman/firewoman, construction person, cop, or young Jr High/HS kid in the Westchester/Dutchess/Rockland/Putnam County, NY region: you'll see a Nextel on their belt or in their hand. It is THE PHONE where I live.Just try one. They have so many plans you will find one you like.
This is a review for boost mobile (nextel's prepaid service).  I have a company phone when I travel during the school year, so I wanted a cool prepaid phone.  I had (still do) a Nokia 1220 (Tracfone) and that phone was good (very basic), but I only had service in my local area (Houston) and no where else.  After getting stuck at Chicago O'Hare without cell service, I decided I needed a phone that would get service in all major areas of the USA.  I have not been dissappointed!!  The rates are VERY reasonable for prepaid ($.15 - $.25/minute), customer service has been WONDERFUL, and it has (almost) all the cool features I had on my Sprint vision phone.  TM, internet and walkie talkie (to Nextel and Boost customers).  I hope what I read in an earlier review is not right about them getting bought out by sprint, because I was with them for almost 6 years and the customer service and plans went VERY steadily downhill!  If you need a REALLY COOL phone and do not want a monthly contract, consider Boost Mobile.
it is not the phones fault if your phone has no reception unless you have no sim card or a broken antenna. it is 100% where you live. thats y people are saying that they have the best reception ever and the worst reception ever on the same exact phone. so in all further reviews, leave out the commments on reception.
This is truly a terrible phone, don't let the new, long overdue features fool ya! Sure its about time they make a phone with a color screen to keep up with everyone else, and the new features are handy. But tell me.... What use are they if you cannot use the phone???? Every other call is a dropped call. And its annoying and embarrassing especially if you take business calls on them. Within about 8 months I went through about 9 phones. Their service department is pretty cool and is aware of the issue so they gave me no problems switching out the phone, they just never had any in stock! For those out there that are experiencing dropped calls, take it into a service center and let them put in a internal antenna they had to make for these units. It does help a little, any less dropped calls is an improvement.The Worst parts are of the phone:Is never having a signal, I can't even use the phone in my house anymore! Not at work and I am on the 15th floor, I have to stand on 1 baby toe to get 3 bars.The speaker phone blows out. When you download ring tones, they are too loud even on the lowest volume level. And when you use the speaker, it cuts in and out.Each time you download something, since the phones are so crappie, you have to keep getting replacements. They don't save your ring tones or anything you downloaded from IDEN. SO now I am just out of luck on the money I have spent on the past. Although they don't use IDEN anymore, I still was cheated!!The screen gets jammed sometimes. Very rare but true. I have to close the flip and re-open it.How about the phone just cuts itself off. Power Zero! Battery fully charged. Do warning or nothing.It ruins the Jarba earbuds. I have had to buy 2 of them because whatever is the problem, when you plug in the ear piece, it zaps it and the earpiece will no longer work. And you can't return those! So you are just our of $40+They refuse to recall the phone. The customer service reps, the service centers,managers, you name it from Nextel themselves has said they phone is "No Good" that "Everyone is having the same problem" and there is nothing they can do. When I disconnected my service the department that handles that offered to take $150 off the price for the i830 but I heard the reception on those were worse.Customer service doesn't know what the error codes are. If you call and report back to back dropped calls and tell them the code... They don't even have the reference guides to tell you what the code means.Oh and be careful when you change your package!! If you Upgrade or Downgrade it signs you up for another year to your contract. Don't do it. Stay where you are so you can get out.One positive thing I will say is that the rate plans are good depending on how much you use your phone and even though customer service is terrible, they don't say no. You just have to be patient over and over again until they fix it. Also be prepared to call at least 3 times back to back to make sure they handle the issue, that they did make the adjustment/credit. Each representative will tell you something different I promise you. They don't know the system, they don't notate accounts properly, and their knowledge is very minimal. I want a Pro on the phone I can look in the users guide myself. So get yourself a good book and prepare to wait.Myself, I have left Nextel for good. I was looking into Sprint but now since they merged.... I am sticking to plan A to the Verizon Wireless. So all of those people out there that are saying the phone is great, don't leave that area, and give it a few months. You will be changing you review. Because I too at first loved the phone.
The I730 of mine has served me now for over a year and a half. I have never had any major problem. Due to me using it all the time and dropping it a few times I am now looking for another to replace it. I don't have any problems with internet service, cell service or two way radio, unless I go out of the Nextel tower area. Which for me isn't very often. I wouldn't trade mine if I had to.
I switched to Nextel from Sprint about a year ago and purchased this phone as it was the best one offered. The phone for Nextel is nice, however the newer phones seem better, however if this phone was on any other service it would be very sub-par and would never sell. It is because Motorola has a monopoly on Nextel phones that they are not pushed to do any better.Pros:-Good java execution.-Good screen brightness and color.-I enjoy the way the contacts allow you to easily flip between multiple numbers for one person-Nice flexibility for the shortcuts-Nice speaker phone-can place calls without even opening the phoneCons:-Huge phone by todays standards. No real need in the phone being that large-Small screen compared with most of todays phones-Must go online for text messaging-Metal piece covering ear speaker falls off constantly-Poor reception inside any building and around tall structures-From time to time the phone will randomly shut itself off. It goes through stages though, for a week or so it will shut itself off almost every hour, then it will not do it again for several months.Overall not so great of a phone, however it is not like Motorola really has any push to make phones much better. Now that Nextel has merged with Sprint I'll be back on Sprint again and I will just go back to Samsung phones which I love this summer when the deal is complete.
This is the worse phone I have had, and Nextel is the worse customer service I have dealt with.First off, me an three friends purchased these phones from Nextel just over a year ago.  I think we paid around $150 apiece for them with contracts.  Well, about 3 months later, all three of our phones had defects.  Buttons had fallen off of two of them, and the third one had a defective screen.  After gettign a run around from Nextel about the warranty on the phones, we decided to just deal with half operable phones until our contract expired.  Just for your information, if you buy a Nextel phone and it breaks, they won't do much to help you.  They told me I should mail the phone back to Motorola and they would repair it and mail it back within 10 business days.  Notice that Nextel offered me no replacement phone, so I would be phoneless for 10 days.  Also, they said the only way they would repair it was if I purchased their service plan for 5.99 a month.  Just on principle I refused.  They sold me a defective product, just as they had two of my friends, and then wanted me to pay them money to make the product good.I will never own another Nextel product, and I would strongly advise any of you who are thinking about purchasing it not to.  You may wind up like me and my friends, with expensive phones that are superglued back together, only work halfassed, and basically bying time till your contract expires.
I got my Boost Motorola i730 in February after being sick of my Virgin Mobile phone only allowing access to mtv.com .  It's a bit more expensive to talk per minute but the phone itself is much better than the Kyocera Slider-type I had- for one thing, ringtones are very, very audible; the vibrate is strong as well.  It feels like you could drop it a million times and it'll still work- I've had it since February and it's been dropped quite a few times- still works perfectly.  The screen isn't as large as some I've seen but it's bright and colorful.  The phone is pretty easy to use, although I didn't know how to activate capital letters for text messaging until just recently.  My favorite feature about the service?  Unlike Virgin Mobile, who only allows access to one website, Boost gives you unlimited text-based internet use for 20 cents per day- it's great to be able to check my email and read the news over the phone.  My only complaint about the phone now that intial reception issues have been pretty much taken care of is that text messages sometimes take hours for me to recieve after somebody sends me one.  Other than that though, the i730 is working out just fine for me.
The i730 is a great phone, but I still think sprint is better. I gave this phone a rating of 3 because it doesn't recieve service everywhere you go. that's CRAZY! I thought nextel recieved signal anywhere. Currently I attend Wayne State and my phone rarely has service. On the other hand if I'm at home my phone never drops calls. Nextel really needs to step it up a notch, buI guess I can't say much about it because sprint will be buying them out soon.
I have been using cell phones since before (the now defunt) AT&T; Wireless was around, that was 1992 or so. I used an analog phone at the time and then switched to PrimeCo (before they became Verizon Wirless) and then SprintPCS. Up to that point I had no complaints about phones -- some had a better UI than others, but they pretty much did the same thing.I then switched to Voicestrea(before they became T-Mobile!) because I needed the international roaming feature, and they had the best rates on the market, and I could use the same handset, wereas with the CDMA providers I would have to pay for an additional service. This is were my cell-phone fun began. T-Mobile service was not bad at all, but I don't think that in the 2 or 3 years I was with them I was ever satisfied with my phone -- the volume was too low, the speakerphone was a joke, the phone was too big, reception was horrible, it kept on dying, etc, etc.I then switched to Nextel because I was tired of the billing errors involved with handsent replaments (out of warranty fees -- when the phone wasn't even 3 months old, re-stocking fees for phones I "didnt return" according to T-Mobile, etc, etc). I have been using this phone since late October or early November 2004 and I am glad to say I have had no major problems. The reception is great no matter where I go (I travel incredible distances in the state of Florida alone -- 15,000 miles since January, and that's just by car), the speaker and speakerphone are loud enough, and the phone is a decent size. In addition I can take the SIM card out of the i730 and place it in my GSM world phone for my trips to Europe, although the Nextel rates are a bit higher, they are about the same as what AT&T; used to charge, and what Cingular charges today.Another great feature on this phone (and all the Nextel Java-enabled phones if I am not mistaken) is the navigation function provided by TeleNav. Not only can it tell me how to get to point B, it also has a business finder, based on my current location as determined by the GPS reciever that is built into the phone, but it even has a handy "Gas by Price" function, although it only can sort the listing by lowest prices on regular or 87 octane gas, which I cannot use in my vehicle, it will display the prices for premium or 93/91 octane gas as well.
Ignore all the exteme negativity regarding Nextel's i730.  I have been with Nextel and have had the best service, compared with my former carriers, Cingular & Verizon.  Now that they are merging with Sprint, I am sure it will only get better.  The customer service, although not the fastest is very efficient and open until 1am EST.As for the i730, this phone was recommended to me by numerous friends/coworkers who own it when the antenna broke on my i60, after three years of use with little problems.  This phone is easy to set up with the manual, if you are literate.  Calling customer service to transfer my SIM info was easy, except for it took a couple of times to get the address book right.  This phone has alot of features that are easy to use and although it may not be the flashiest trendiest phone (if that's what you're into) it is still pretty sleek.  The ringtones/wallpapers are easy to download from Nextel.com, although I wish Nextel offered more options.Most of the complaints I read regarding this phone seem to be from people who are either too clueless, too into having a trendy phone, or too into the tech stuff and need their cell to mimic their home PC.  My only complaint is that sometimes I hear myself echo through the earpiece even when I have full signal, but this occurs so rarely that it doesn't really annoy me.  The phone holds a charge well, I don't even own a car charger.Overall, I recommend this phone for someone whose main concern is owning a reliable cell phone with a few cool features.
This phone is good, but not great.  I've had it for about two years. The second year the datebook started malfunctioning. No matter what date you would enter for future reminders, it would ring at 7AM the day before.  For ex., If I wanted the alarm to ring at 2:30 pm on March 25 and set it under the custom 90 minutes, it would ring on March 24 at 7AM.  I also didn't like the fact that this phone only holds datebook data for 3 weeks.  What if you need to check back in 6 months for reference to appointments.  They are erased!  If you can stand those annoyances then the phone is good, not great.
First of all, I would like to make distinction with regard to service - customer service specifically. Nextel has been GREAT!!! Just before Nextel, I was with Alltell. Their customer service at the local level was HORRID to put it mildly! It was so terrible, that I paid the $200.00 early termination fee after only 6 months. In a two year agreement, I would have paid out more than $1800.00 over the next 18 months for customer service that was frankly non-existent. You do the math. The carriers count on you not switching until your contract expires, but do not let them railroad you into believing that you have no choice but to "take what they give you"!With that said, on to the phone. I initiated service with Nextel over a year ago. I wanted the i95cl, but was told that it was discontinued and that the i730 had replaced it.At first glance and with little knowledge, it seemed to make sense. It's smaller, shinier, has more capacity with respect to contacts (600 instead of 250) and Java apps, it can hold longer names, has more screen resolution, and I could go on. BUT, after only two weeks to a month of use, other people began asking me to repeat myself while on the phone with me. They would tell me that I was "breaking up" while I was talking. Although I could hear them fine most of the time, this was almost always the case for the other party. Then, I began to notice that my signal strength was almost never constant, but often fluctuated - even standing still in the same spot. I took it in to service centers for software and firmware updates, I had microphones replaced, the unit replaced, etc., but to no availle. Nothing really ever solved the problem. There were also some quirks with the internet.I would also like to mention that the battery didn't last a full day on most days. In all fairness though, I do contracting and maintenance work and I do talk alot, but my  Motorloa v60 with Suncom lasted two(2) full days with the same amount of talking.Finally one day about 2-3 months ago, an associate gave me an i90 that he no longer wanted. He had purchased an i830 and had no use for the i90. I was told that the i90's and i95's were the "work horses" before they were pulled, so I decided to use th i90 instead of the i730. IT WORKED!!!! I had absolutely NONE of the problems that I had with the i730!! Of course, like any cell phone, there are a few problems here and there, but they are ABSOLUTELY MINIMAL compared to the i730.So began my journey for the i95cl. After some trial and error I quickly became an expert on ebay. I now have four (4) i95's in almost new condition. Two of these I traded my i730 for. With the exception of a few features and size, the i95cl is everything the i730 is and more. I still get the web, check the news, email, etc. with no problems at all.For the average consumer wanting Nextel, the i730 is packed with everything you could ask for - without being a camera phone. But, if you need a phone and rely on call quality, I suggest checking into some of Nextel's other phones.
I had a Motorola i90 phone that went bad, so I upgraded to the the i730 and I wished I'd never done it. I don't know exactly what it is, but the quality of service is far worse on the i730 than the older i90. I didn't have service in a lot of areas that I had service before. So I finally got an i850, and believe me that phone is a whole lot better. The call quality is better, the service is better, and the battery life is a lot better. If you are thinking of getting a nextel phone, skip this one and go for the i850. You won't regret it.
Finally the end of a frustrating 1 year contract with NEXTEL. This phone drops calls, doesn't get a signal, flashes error messages freaquently, often polutes your conversations with clicking noises, freezes up and makes text messaging a nightmare.  The nicestest thing about this phone is the speaker phone, works great from a distance even, that is . . . on the rare occassion you get a clear signal.  Don't waste your money with NEXTEL or on the i730.
I have owned this phone since June of Last year.  I thought the added convenience of Direct Connect services were something I might be interested in.  The phone itself is compact and easy to maneuver, It has number storage capabilities and ring tone changers, and background changing capabilities.  The battery life is much less than projected by nextel.  The battery reads full on the screen of the phone however your call seems to drop or low battery beeps after about 5 hours unused.  The low battery indicator beeps three times and drop.  No real warning.  The phone is ok .  Customer service for nextel is poor at best.  When you finally get through to a member sercice rep.  You have been on hold forever and they transfer you to kingdom come.  The Service is crappy the direct connect often displays A13 not real sure what that means. A great deal of calls are dropped and when you look at the screen it displays TRY AGAIN.  It is frustrating.  I live in the Suburbs of Philadelphia so cell towers are not a problem here.  I have many people on the network and they all agree.  Whats the phone without the service. I know this is a phone review so about the phone it is OK. The service is shoddy !
I've owned this phone for only 13 months - unfortunately 1 month shy of the warranty date and now I can no longer talk into the phone and hear the other person.  Only the speaker phone works, so now I have to shop for another phone.I paid $150 for this phone.
I was reading the revies regarding this phone and the service with nextel 1st off any cell phone service you go to is going to have problems. I had voicestream then they changed to tmobile and went down hill. My bills starting going up even though my usage was the same. I've had cingular and there service was ok but that was so long ago that I dont really remember exactly my problems with them. I had sprint and I have to say I myself, had the worst experience with them. Just about everyone I know had sprint at the time I did and they had horrible service. I could understand the systems having bad days and the service being poor at times BUT IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN THE CUSTOMER CARE REPS ARE RUDE AS HELL!!!!I read a review in here about someone saying they transferred there number from Nextel to Cingular and was charged ETF of 200.00. (I am writing a review because I read this review by this person) Genius, if you still had service with nextel and under contract with Nextel and you port over your number to another service provider YOU ARE CANCELLING YOUR SERVICE WITH NEXTEL! HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT? OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO CHARGE YOU EARLY TERMINATION FEES. ALL CELL PHONE COMPANIES HAVE EARLY TERMINATION FEES IF YOU ARE STILL IN A CONTRACT. You should have done your homework before making that change and trying to get over on nextel.Nextels service for the most part is ok. They have their problems like others and some areas are worse than others. I know this for a fact because I used to work for Nextel and had to take calls from people with poor service. That was a long time ago. I got nextel way after I stopped working for them because I just could not deal with sprint anymore. The worst service reported was on the East Coast and especially Florida after the hurricanes.
The i730 boasts features that are in demand in today's high-tech world. This flip phoneboasts a color screen, Speakerphone, One Touch DirectConnect, Voice Recorder, and Voice Activated Dialing.Additionally, you can customize this phone withdownloadable wallpapers and ring tones.But had ordered it off of Nextels site. They even gave me a code that saved me $50.00. Here it is for you all to share (CL897L) case sensitive. On the shopping cart page in the promo box. It is like an invoice thing. But I think it is a very good phone. You will enjoy the phone. Happy shopping.
I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse." I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as "customer abuse"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own.
I love this phone!I can not wait for Christmas so I can get this phone!!First,I use to have Boost then switched to Cingular then switched to T-Mobile(And I still have T-Mobile)and I am going to get the i730 from my great-grandmother for Christmas.If anyone says it's not good,that person is wrong.Just forget the negativity that people are saying about because this phone is off the hook!
I don't own this phone. I own the cheaper Motorola (Nextel) i710. I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since "downgraded" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars. My phone gets signal in places their phones are "Out of Service."Now you might say that maybe my friend just has a dud phone. Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone. Lots of features, solid and durable construction and good battery life. For me signal was more important that a silver case an an external screen but if you like those things the i730 is a decent phone to use.
While this phone worked well for the first couple months I owned it, I now have problems with service.  I rarely have full service where my old sprint phone never had a problem.  I am also really annoyed that the 2-way radio feature will sometimes malfunction and my phone also randomly shuts off.
For the money, it is a decent product.  I had my 730 for about 10 months before the stop button on top fell off.  I had my 730 for about 11 months before Airplane mode switched on by itself fairly frequently.  I had my 730 for about 14 months before it started turning off by itself.  I guess by then I had had my money's worth.  You can't expect these phones to last forever.  Not with Nextel/Motorola pushing new technology so often.  They want quicker turnaround on their newest hardware, so they offer less reliable/durable products that need to be upgraded more often.  It is pretty blatant, but they are not the only company doing so and they will continue to get away with it because consumers will continue to buy sub-par technology to stay 'hip'.  I can't wait until they release a new Blackberry the size of a business card with a fully-functioning keyboard and the masses swarm to purchase it and use a magnifying glass and fingernails to send e-mails out on it like idiots. /end rantMy i90c was so much better, and lasted much longer.
i have been a nextel customer for several years owning an i1000plus.  I purchased an i730 in April, 2004, because they told me my i1000plus was wearing out (i was having trouble with disconnects, etc.).  Just prior to the one-year warranty being up I took the phone to the service center with the problem of calls going into voice mail instead of ringing, not able to call out, etc.  They did some stuff to it at the service center and sent me on my way.  A few weeks later I was back to the same problems, so they took it apart, checked it out, and told me they were going to "swap" it out.  I had to go to another location for the sway - my understanding was that they were going to take my phone and give me a new phone.  When I went to the "swap" place, the lady told me my phone had gotten wet and they would not swap it out.  I explained that the service center had taken it all apart and the service center didn't say anything about it being wet.  Additionally, I have the phone with me all the time and I DID NOT GET IT WET.  After that episode, they replaced my phone with the insurance program that we pay 6 dollars a month for.  Soon after I got the "new" phone I was having problems with it - mainly my car charger had quit working, I was getting calls going into voice mail, and the phone wouldn't hold a charge.  I took it to the service center only to find out that I had my new phone replaced with a refurbished phone and with an AFTERMARKET battery.  The battery was no good and the guy at the service center told me the aftermarket battery ruined my car charger (which had cost 38 dollars).  When I called the insurance company to find out why they replaced my phone with a used phone and an aftermarket battery that didn't work, they, in so many words, told me it was too bad - that is what they do.  I purchased a new motorola battery (Nextel did give me a $55 credit on my phone bill to purchase the new battery).  I continue to have ongoing problems with the phone I have - it goes into voice mail, calls cut off, it won't work when my husband's nextel phone works in the same location, I have to wave it around to get a signal half of the time.  I am thoroughly disgusted with this whole process.  I have had this same nextel phone number for at least 5 years, all my business cards, letterhead, etc. has this number on it.  It would be a disaster for me to switch phone numbers.  I feel like I have nowhere to go, but to continue to pay $199/month for the service, $3.95 for repair, and $5.95 for insurance.  I cannot believe there are no federal or state laws to address this total ripoff.
I will keep it simple! People please do not write comments until you have at least owned the i730 phone 3 months or longer. Yes, at first you feel as though everyone who has negative comments about this phone maybe exaggerated! If you can help it wait til the merger is completed and pick from better variety of phones or keep the cheap phones like i60, just because it's more expensive doesnt mean better and I found that out for myself. I wont write anymore negative comments because I will be repeating everyone prior. I wont say every i730 phone is terrible because I know of one guy who says that he has no problem with his. My company uses Nextel and a bunch of us use the i730 and complains about the same issues. The reason I say three month about reviews is that some of the people write reviews early, about a month maybe after getting their phone, but no one keeps their phone a few months, most keep their phone a year or more. So future buyers will see the quality and longevity of this product as well as others. This is coming from someone who has three of these i730 on my plan and all have the same issues with all three.
After many years with Nextel and using their previous Motorola models. I expected alot out of this phone. I was very dissapointed. The phone itself like most newer Motorolas these days is poorly designed and cheaply constructed. It just feels cheap and flimsy. The screen while a nice size is grainy and looks terrible. I had problems with it turning on and off by itself and it does not hold a charge very long. My phone also placed itself in Airplane mode at 3 A.M one morning(waking me up) and started doing some very strange things.Pros-NoneCons-Poor build quality-Blurry Screen-Terrible Reception
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.
I wanted to get this phone because it has has walkie-talkie and ringtones and it looks fine.So I want this phone.
I share the concerns of others with this phone.  I was very impressed with the picture screen.  It has vivid color and clarity, although it is worthless in bright light conditions.  It is also an attracive phone on the surface.  But, that's where it ends.  The phone starts up very slowly when going through its initial diagnostics.  The response time for the function buttons is also quite slow, even when dialing a phone number.  The side buttons are an absolute embarrasment when they go off in your pants or jacket.  They are also very useless.  The ringer is not loud enough.  The outside plastic lense covering the clock easily scratches if you get the phone near change or keys in your pocket.  Even blue jean material will scratch it easily.  The picture screen also scratches easy and always holds your facial oils.  Finally, the function buttons are poorly lit to be useful in dark conditions.Unfortunately, I ignored the naysayers on this phone when deciding to go ahead and purchase it.  They were right and I was wrong.  My friends and family made much better choices and I can't wait to replace this disaster.  Motorola: please listen to your customers or you won't have any.
This phone was working okay until about 2 months after the warranty was off.  Just like a lot of reviewers on this list I too had problems with the buttons on the side changing my ring volume which caused me to miss some calls. But that's not a really big deal. All the bells and whistles work just fine. I just can't HEAR ANYBODY TALKING!!!!!!!! I keep telling my mom that she needs to speak up. Forget about hearing anything if you're outside or in a public place. I swear I've pressed this phone to the side of my head so much trying to hear I think I've got a cell phone shaped ear. Of course Cingular will not give me a new phone. The constant dropped calls didn't help either. But most of that stopped when I started my off-peak hours at 7 pm instead of 9 pm. Cingular seems to work on their towers after 9pm and on weekends which makes for dropped calls.  So I have 4 months left on my contract and I'm seriously contemplating changing carriers after 11 years with the same company and they don't seem care that they're loosing my business.  The free phones worked great, the modestly prices phones worked great,but the one I paid good money for turns out to be a piece of caca!
I am a person who has gone through a lot of different cell phones through different servers.  I have never had a phone that sucked as much as the motorola v400.  I had this phone for 4 months before it started acting up.  My ear piece stopped working and I would constantly have to put people on speaker phone and expose my conversation to those around.  I called Cingular and they sent me the same phone.  Two months after having the phone guess what? Yeah the ear piece stopped working again. And then my speaker phone started to have a volume control problem. Sometimes it was loud and others it wasn't.  The buttons stopped working, and the screen would go blank.  I am guessing that this phone is a real piece of crap because I called Cingular and they are sending me a different motorola because this one has been discontinued.  I swear, I will never buy a motorola cell phone again!
I'm tired of reading revues from people who just got a brand new cell phone and have absolutely no depth of history with the product.I purchased my V400 july 2004 and at first (for about 2 month) had no big problems the phone didn't strike me or the people i was talking with to have any great audio quality but it was usable.Then I was constantly trying to max out my volume since i couldn't hear what people where saying to me, most of the time i was rushing to a land line and called them back (great way to do business).Then the phone started to become unusable. People calling me couldn't hear me or i couldn't hear them. Sound distorted.The games worked ok and so did the camera. But lets be honest here give a phone that works first then ad the gimicks.I received consecutivelly 2 new phones in exchange of my original one. All of them did the same thing fine for 3-4 weeks and then hell broke loose.After 1 year of Hell and dropping from using 700min/month on my account to 150. I finally got another model.I hope my new Motorola V600 works or this will be the last Motorola phone I ever own.
I've had the phone for almost a year, and it's not bad at all.  The camera works well, and all the features are great.  However, my biggest complaint (and why I'm in the market for a new phone) is the volume!  The volume of the ringwer (even on loud) and especailly the volume of the speaker during the calls is HORRIBLE.  It's really hard to hear people you're speaking to and hearing incoming calls.  The speaker phone works wonders for this..except calls you don't want broadcast to everyone, and you can't connect the speaker until after the call's been connected.  So overall not a bad phone, but I've gotten to the point where I can't deal with it.  Hope this helped.
This phone would fool anyone, with it's great look and sleek design, but have it for just one week and you'll see the true side of it. Along with the buttons getting pressed mistakenly in my pocket, and POOR battery life, the phone drops calls.. ALOT!The phone drops calls worst that any phone I've ever had. Then I came to realize that Motorola knew about this problem so they decided to recall it. I called my phone carrier and they said thay couldn't do anything about it.. and they said I should give motorola a call. OK so I did, and yes you guessed it. They said that they might be able to fix the problem, but I'd have to send it to them for about two to three weeks without a loaner. What great customer service eh?I've since switched to the V360 and it's 110% better.
I've owned this phone for more than a year. It is bulky, slow-to-charge, prone to inadvertant changes in settings and finally, the keys are not easy to dial (number keys require very firm pressure, making one-hand dialing difficult). The sticky-key problem became so severe (no, it wasn't dropped in liquid)that I called Cingular while the phone was still in warranty. They sent another V400, which they claim was reconditioned. The replacement phone had no battery (you're supposed to keep the old one) and the face of the replacement was scratched and had clearly been abused. I kept the old phone and am switching service providers. Bad phone. bad service.
this is the best phone i've ever had. i used to think i had the best phone when i had the long nokia. i beat that thing to death i even ran it over with my car and nothing.  thew v400 althiough not as strong did survive a second story drop and has gone swimming with me on 2 occasions. although the phone isnt perfect anymore i dare somebody to throw their cell phone in the water. ill do it if u do it because i know mine will still work afterwards
I've had this phone for almost a year now.  Previous to that, I had the same Nokia phone (with Cingular) for 3 years.  No dropped calls problems, no call failed problems, nothing.  Occasionally, after making a phonecall, my bars would drop down to 1 or 0, and it would take 15 seconds or so to get my signal again.  Cingular suggested that I upgrade our phone.  So, we did.  In fact, we added an additional line to our monthly plan.  So we have 2 of these Motorola V400s.After using 2 of these for almost a year, I can tell you this.PROS:- Flashy looks- Decent camera- Nice display colors- Battery life is goodCONS:- Whenever the phone is in my bag or my pocket, the side buttons get pressed, which means my phone makes loud beeps.  The settings also get changed, which means my phone can be on silent and I have to reset it.- Extended dialing.  When I dial up my voicemail and enter my 4 digit code, each number that is pressed on the cell beeps for several seconds.  This is VERY annoying.- CONSTANT dropped calls.  Most calls are dropped after 12 minutes.  The person I'm talking to can hear me for about 10 seconds, but I cannot hear them.  Then, the call is dropped.- Call Failed - this happens ALL the time.  Frustrating when you need to contact someone and you cannot place a call.- Phone never rings - this is a common occurence.  My phone will be sitting on my desk and it never rings.  Suddenly it beeps - I have a voicemail... yet I never got a call.For the same price, there are plenty of other phone choices out there.  I am exchanging this with Cingular ASAP, since we haven't quite had it a year.  I hope my new phone is better.-
I purchased this phone last year sometime and have been using it since.  I am not very pleased with the phone for numerous reasons. Let me break it down in list form.PROS:1) Small, compact, light2) Good LCD screen, bright, good colors3) Pretty decent camera4) Good layout of the buttons that are inside the phone (not the exterior side ones); easy to pressCONS:1) Side buttons get mashed inadvertently when stuck in your purse or pocket.  This causes it to make a sound as it changes your settings.  Very annoying to have to reset it back to what you had it to before2) Intermittent freezing of phone.  I'm not sure if it is the phone's operating system or if it is just a defective unit.  Either way, it is annoying for me to have to open and close then try to power off and power on the phone to get it to respond again.3) Slow response to buttons being pressedI am looking at other phones to buy to replace this one.  If I were you, I'd look into other phones with similar options and features.
THe phone is kewl and has an awesome camera and Mp3 ringers, but its kinda bulky and heavy. I would suggest this phone for someome who wants a good phone and doesnt really car about how bulky it is. Otherwise its AWESOME =) !!!! <3 <3 <3
The Motorola v400 is a great all around phone.  It doesn't have anything too extreme but you can do some really clever things with it.  It is capable to do everything except record video.  It has a built in camera that is really good for taking photos of things that are not very far away due to its only downfall, a 4x zoom.  The clamshell design is very nice because you don't have to worry about punching numbers when the phone is in your pocket.  The display is very clear and the ability to change the ring status of your phone without opening it by the side buttons is a great feature.  Besides the obvious camera feature, the v400 has the ability to send and receive text and multimedia messages, go online and download games and mp3 quality ringtones.  The battery on the phone is good for about three days on a single charge.  Overall this phone is a very nice chioce for anyone who likes games and giving the different people on their phone different ringtones as it is compatible with just about everything you can find.
I got this phone in June 2004...after about 6 monhts, I noticed that the volume level was bad...it's so bad now that when people want to use my phone, they can't hear who they're calling because they don't know that you have to hold the phone TIGHT to the ear to hear anything!  I love the phone, otherwise, I don't want to replace it, but looks like i'm going to have to......
I have owned two of these and had the same problem on both: the inner speaker will stop working. Over 10 months, both phones failed, and eventually Cingular gave me a V551 (which also sucks for the same reasons).Other complaints:Takes too long to load new menus or change characters when text messaging.Cheap flip hinge will make noises that makes the phone sound like it will come in two.Port on bottom will not work after you carry the phone around for a couple of weeks. Charging portion still good, but transfer port goes bad.Cliffnotes: I am done with Motorola V series phones.
I bought this phone last April. It worked fine until August.-volume did not work-dropped calls-people hear me, I cannot hear them- the phone says connected, but it is not (I just hear myself saying "hello")I sent it back to Cingular, they exchanged it. The new one had the same problems except:-the screen went black and the keypad stayed lit.I sent it back to cingular after 2 days of having the phone. Cingular sent me a new phone. this one also sucks:-the side volume buttons do not work,-dropped calls-all the same problems (dropped calls, bad volume, people hear me I can't hear them, blah, blah, blah.....)The phone worked for me for the most part so I ignored the other stuff. Now it is annoying and I am 25 days out of warrenty and cingular will not change my phone. I will have to buy a new one ($250.00) or pay the $50.00 fee for the SAME MODEL phone. I HATE THIS PHONE! As a result, I hate Cingular too! As soon as my contract is up NEITHER Motorola or Cingular will get my money ever again.Reading the previous post I found the phone has been discontinued. A little to late for me.Motorola V400 sucks Do Not Buy!
i do not own this phone but my best friend does and i use it alllll the time. the big prb. is that she has a LOT of droped calls, i will be talking to her and then she will not be there!! It gets really anoying! We take pics of EVERYTHING, the camera is really good, does not have a light, witch is bad sometimes because u can not take pics in low light. Allso if u move to fast after taking the pic it will show up dif.,like when you are loking at it in the pic menu and then close up on it it is two dif. pics. My friend has had to take her phone to get fixed a lot because the pic ID was not working(it still is not working). But besides the droped calls and the problems with the camera it is a great phone!!
I have had this phone for about ~1 year.  Recently I have only barely been able to hear the person I am talking to on the phone. At first I attributed this to maybe a bad connection, but then I found out a friend was having similar problems.  I looked on the internet and found people were having similar problems.  This phone is WORTHLESS, it can have all the features in the world but if you cant hear the person you are talking to what is the point.I recommend not buying this phone.  If you are looking to buy another motorola I would check to make sure that it doesnt have similar earpiece problems.
I really like my phone. I've had it for nearly a year. Well anyway, I've had 3 of them, that is. The first one decided that it suddenly wanted to work on speakerphone only so the girls in the dorm nextdoor could hear my mom crystal clear. So I called Cingular for a replacement and got it. Wretched machine, it died when it said fully charged 2 days after I got it. So I called them up yet again for another replacement. The sales rep. was rather bewildered but I did infact send it off. In fact, as an apology of sorts, they sent it on priority mail with no extra charge to me, so I got it the next day rather than in a week and a half. I'm hooked on Cingular's service and this new phone also has a year warranty for any manufacturing glitches.That being said, this third one is working like a charm. The reception is pretty good and I love the features. Oooo, better yet, I realized that it also works in select areas of Mexico so when I go there with my church, Mom can call me w/o having to risk getting someone who doesn't speak English.I bought this one for $30 after rebates at Best Buy.
Just got my phone back from service. The screen went dark. I was told by the store that it was a common problem with this phone. Otherwise it is a good phone.
I brought my phone October of last year from the Cingular website..This is my very 1st flip phone & only reason I picked this phone was because it had really good features, its cute & it has mobile IM which is AIM & YIM..I was happy it had both of those on this phone because I love chattin with my friends soo I could be on both even when I'm on the go..However it has very bad reception..I give it 4 stars tho because it does not work inside buildings you have to talk outside & thats something I hate, but they have antennas for that, that can boost up your reception which I brought soo now I have no problems I can talk on my phone in buildings soo really I have no complaints..Its a good phone has great volume & a good camera just gotta constantly keep the lens clean otherwise your pictures won't turn out clear..I can't speak for others but I'm very pleased with my cell phone those are the only problems I had but I fixed it sooo overall I'm happy
I've had two...both have broken very quickly (one was a replacement). Stay away.
my husband had not one, but two of these phones in less than a year and they were both lemons!  The first one he had, the person on the other end could not hear you talking at all - it was like no one was there!  The phone was brand new! He had it replaced with the same phone and this one you could not hear anything on it!  He finally sent it back and just got a totally different brand of phone entirely.  I don't know if we just got two bad phones or if this phone is just not a good phone.  Either way, we'll never have another one!!!
I mean how can I complain... it was free with my service!Overall it is not a bad phone... it has plenty of options like text messaging and all that fun stuff... It has voice dialing (you know when you just say the name and it calls the person) if you feel like setting that up... A nice address book feature that allows you to store several numbers under one name and label them with cute icons like a house for home phone and a little cell for mobile phones etc...Sometimes it freezes up (kinda like computers) and you have to remove the battery to get it to work again!? What do you expect for free though?Major complaint: WHERE'S SNAKE??? I miss it! But there is a cute bowling game on it!It's a phone... it serves its purpose. It does not take pictures, but then again that's what cameras are for!

The Nokia 3595 is an ok phone but it has nothing more than the basics.  It is a rather big phone so it wont easily fit in your pocket, but it a good performer when it comes to actually talking, it holds a signal well and hardly ever drops calls.  The screen is color, but not a good color screen, it is washed out looking and dim.
Pros:Decent battery lifeYou can set profiles and each profile having a diffrent setting for  ringer,screensaver etcYou can group your contacts as VIP,Family etc and have the phone ring only when it is a call from family ..Cons:There is always a constant hiss on the speaker.( i am comparing this to my sanyo)Squeaky noise- looks like something is going to fall off.. whenever you press a button you hear the sqeak!Camera is absolutely useless!.. Minimal resolutionSpeakerphone is not loud.I would want to use a speakerphone when i drive, This is not loud enough for the road noise. I can hardly  hear anyone ( I live in NJ .. so you know that i would drive slow!)
I having been using Nokia brand phones for close to 10 years now.  I have tried Ericssons, Panasonics, Samsungs, etc... and I still prefer Nokias to all of them.  For starters, the menu design is great for the technically inept or for older folks who just want the basics. My favorite Nokia models were the 6160, 6162, and 5160. Those models ran off of a TDMA platform with AT&T; as the service provider and this one is CDMA.  This particular model is pretty basic. I hate flip phones so this was one of a few options available to me.  The display is pretty good - clear graphics and color.  I'm not a big fan of the keypad layout - it dips in the middle and I prefer it flat.  I do like the fact that it is backlighted though.  Talktime and standby time are plentiful enough for the standard user.  Hands free options for this model stink.  I haven't found one that I like yet.  In lieu of a decent headset I've been using the speakerphone option which works pretty good.  I don't need the camera phone and could do without it but if you are into stuff like that then you should invest in a case for the phone otherwise in less than a year your viewfinder will get scratched up due to its terrible location. Additionally, I prefer the keylock function on older models. Used to be that you could just hold down the endkey and it would lock.  This model requires you to press the menu * option.  If you are looking for very basic gear on the inexpesive side this is the phone way to go.
I had to downgrade my phone recently, as I needed some cash and my Treo was more of a luxury than a necessity.  So, I sold my Treo and bought the Nokia 6225.  I shouldn't have done that.  Even with whatever deals I got and the pocket cash I wound up with after the fact, this has got to be the worst phone I have owned.First off, the built-in camera stinks.  Now, I understand some people will say that it's a VGA camera, and it's not meant to make prints.  I don't mean that.  I mean that compared to other VGA cameras on phones, this one stinks.  It's constantly blurry and grainy, even in the best of lighting, with noticeable discoloration and aberration in lowered lighting.  I've played with other cameraphones, and none of them had picture quality this bad.  Even the Sony Ericcson T610, with a smaller picture file had better results.And then, let's not forget how Sprint disabled the ability to beam the pictures to other devices, which mean you have to use their PictureMail service as the only way to keep the pics.  Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!  It's a good thing the picture quality stinks, as I probably wouldn't even want to keep the pictures anyway, thus saving me money.The reception on this phone is decent, however, and I can receive calls even in my office.  My Treo's reception, however, was much better.  The speaker on this phone, though, isn't very good, and I sometimes have trouble hearing the person on the other line unless I have it pressed up against my ear a certain way.And then, battery life stinks, too.  After a 30 minute call and checking football scores a few times, my phone is down to only two bars, and if I take another five minute call, I need to worry if my phone will die on me.  Terrible.The only positive thing about this phone is that it's small and light, so it's easy to pocket.You get what you pay for, and this phone shows it.  Spend some money and buy a better phone--you'll be glad.
I like this phone, many features - camera, infra red to synch with my laptop, Nokia easy menus, pictures assigned to contacts.
I have been a long time customer of Nokia and have tried other brands but Nokia is the only brand that really gives consistently good service I can count on. I got a pair of these phones - one for me and one for my son. And had the same strengths and weaknesses with both. As far as the noise it makes when it takes photos - you can change the sound so that it is silent if you prefer. The camera doesn't take expremely clear photos but honestly about half of the camera phones I have seen have the same problem with not devoting enough pixel space - it's a camera phone. I really like the reliability of service though. Battery lasted a really long time and didn't have a problem with missed messages or dropped calls like I'd had with other phones. The big problem was - it did not stand up to the tough beating both me and my son put a cell phone through. ONly lasted about a year before the connective case started to fall apart, the on off switch stopped working, the face got scratched...the mechanics are great but the outer components are way too fragile unless you buy a case or are a very careful gentle person.
The phone battery drains very quickly, the problem may be is with the Sprint service and not with the phone, cause I used the same phone with a GSM service and the battery lasted for approx 3-5 days and now the abttery lasts barely for a day(with a talk time of 15-30 mins).
I like my little Nokia PM. When I went to buy it I just wanted the cheapest phone that was a little better than my LG I was using. I had my land phone cut off because people only call on my cell phone. I was going to get the plain Nokia but this one was on sale for just 10.00 more. My college age kid has the Sanyo 8200 and I won't lie her camera is fantastic because it zooms and has a flash but for an extra 10.00 I always have a camera handy and most of my pics have come out pretty decent. They always look better once they are on my PC. I haven't used the radio on the phone. I didn't get it for that purpose but I have the headset. Sprint's been decent to me and I got this in the Sprint store so for the price it is a good deal. Cell phones are just so expensive now due to all of the gadgets. This is a good basic phone. Don't expect expensive phone reception or expensive phone camera options when you are paying the bare minimum for a cell phone. I give it an A.  It serves my purpose. Has my phone book in it and I don't lose calls like I did on my old LG phone.
I have had 2 of these phones within in a 2 month period and I just went to the sprint store so that they can order me another.  The phone is cute but it doesn't hold a charge and even with good frequency it manages to still cut my calls.  The speakerphone option SUCKS! you can't hear anything and it always sounds like theres a fuzzy echo in the back ground and it's also like that when I'm using the handset.  They should have left it without a camera it would at least been 1 less thing for people who own this phone to complain about. Other phones have the option of zooming in, the kind of flash that the phone has and the sounds it makes when you take the picture, Well no none of that and on top of that the pictures are terrible in good lighting or not in good lighting, The color always looks weird.  Also you can't assign ringers to everyone that is in your phone book it's one ringtone for everything and everyone.  I love the phone cause it's cute but I can't stand the phone because it doesn't do none of the things that all my other phones use to do. It has a radio but there's a special kind of headset that you use and that's all good and well but it's pointless when you can't enjoy what you bought it for in the first place.Also the web option is extremely slow and when you log off the internet you have to shut your phone off and turn it back on so that you can make a phone call cause other wise you won't be able to until like a 5 minute or so wait, Why? I don't know. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED, LOOKS ARE DECEIVING!!!!!!
I had this phone for about three months and i hated it. first of all the camera was HORRIBLE. this is the worst camera phone i have ever had. the vision was also very slow and often quit on me. the battery was also HORRIBLE. i got about 3/5 of a day without charging it. the reception was the only good thing. i never had a droped call. but overall i would not advise this phone to anyone in any age group.
I had an AT&T; NEC 525 and decided to pay $175 to switch to Sprint.  I called and asked how much a camera phone with speaker cost and she said to get a Sanyo PM-8200 it is there beast phone, and it costs $130, i said i did'nt want to spend over $100 and she said to get the Nokia PM-6225 for $70, but it is not a flip phone, and i said i okay.  When i got it at 10:00 A.M I charged it, at about 10:15 A.M. and left it alone until i had to go somewhere at about 3:45PM 5 hours and it said full battery.  About 45 Minutes, 10 Min. of Vision, 25 Min on Phone after I left the battery was almost gone and about 10 Min, with locked keys the phone was dead.  1 Day after I went to visit my dad and the day after that I was tired of the horrible phone and went to the Sprint Store.  When I got there I was happy because they had the Sanyo PM-8200 for $100.  When after a 15 Minute wait I got up to see a represenitive he said since it was a telesales order I had to return it over telesales.  Then I was mad and he asked his manager and he let me do it.  Then he tried to chare me $70 for an $30 difference, so then his manager had to fix what he did.  i wish the lady would have told me about the promotion then I would not have had the problem.
camera. speaker phone. stereo FM radio. two places you can plug in headsets. can store 400 phone numbers. email, internet. a lot more...Don't even listening to other viewers' words.  Go do your own research.it gets great signals.  I had a samsung, i will not waste my money on that brand.  Made in Korea, do they make good stuff?  Go figure.  Nokia company is from enrope. If you go to asia and europe, the majority of the cell phones you will see on the street is Nokia.  Only stupid "Bush controled" the country use damn samsung and LG etc.Take a look at those who gave bad reviews,  they are from the midwest, southern states.  Freaking farmers and corn eater.  Just like those who voted for Bush.wake up "brainwashed bush controled" people. Get out side the box.
I purchased this phone as an upgrade replacement to my SCP-4900 about a month ago. I have compared it to my old 4900 as well as a SCP-8100 in terms of reception and function. Overall, it has been a decent phone, but it does have its quirks. My current firmware is v1.007SP, PRL 10025, hardware 0202 for those of you that care about these things.First, the bad:- Noticeably worse audio quality in the built-in earpiece compared to the other phones. I think that putting the camera in the same part of the phone as the earpiece speaker made them have to compromise the earpiece quality. The 4900 was clear but too quiet, the 8100 is loud and clear.- Reception is different. The phone always shows fewer bars than both my 4900 and 8100 in the same location (2 bars vs. 4 bars). However this said, I think all three phones are comparable in reception - the first week I had the PM-8200 I went all over town with the SCP-8100 to compare. I have read that Sanyo used to exaggerate the signal strength meter in the older phones and that the 8200's signal bars are now more in line with other phone manufacturer's. Some places I can get better reception (ie. make a call) with the 8100, in other places only the 8200 works. Strange.- Battery life is somewhat limited. Sanyo states 12 days' standby life for the 8200. I manage 3-4 days at best (I am a 700 minute-a-month talker and use the web an average of 5 minutes a day). I can easily talk 2+ hours at a time without problem. I was spoiled by the 4900 with 1 week between charges minimum with the same usage pattern and 16 days if I didn't use it much. The 8100 I have to charge about as often, though, and that's only rated for 10 days' standby.- Build quality is not quite as good. In comparing the other two phones, the 8200 is not quite built up to the same standards (eg. the hinge is looser, the finish coarser). Of course, this may or may not have an impact on functioning.- I find the polar bear animation irritating, but fortunately this can be turned off. A choice if different onscreen 'Buddies' would be appreciated.Now the good:- Reception is quite good overall, I get signal in the places I need it (work and home). Sprint's coverage is rather good here in Sacramento, CA, about the same as Verizon and much better than either Cingular/AT&T; or T-Mobile (I'm a former customer of Cingular and AT&T; before they merged). Likewise for San Francisco - my friends there with Cingular borrow my phone to make calls.- The camera, although not as good as other maker's, now is up to VGA resolution and has a flash.- The camera flash (really just a bright LED in the cover) can also be used as a flashlight (just hold down the volume toggle while the cover is closed). This is good in a pinch trying to find the keys you've dropped at night.- You can text message now without having to go on the wireless web, unlike the older units.- The phone now has a real GPS chip imbedded for locating the phone in e911 conditions, but some may also consider this bad for privacy. I don't think this feature is entirely functional yet anyway.- The web browser is much much faster than the 4900 and also noticably faster than the 8100.- The ringer can now be set to ring at the lowest volume and vibrate at the same time. Before it was either high volume with vibrate or vibrate only.- The screen is bright and clear.- The phone now has a built in clock. Sprint phones in the past have relied on the network to provide the phone with the time so if you didn't have reception, the phone couldn't tell you what time it was. With this phone you can.- The speakerphone works reasonably well, although not as clear as on the 4900. The 8100 does not have a speakerphone, although the earpiece is loud enough you'd think it did.- The phone has analog (AMPS) capability, unlike almost all GSM phones. Not really useful in a urban setting, but if you go out into the countryside, many rural areas are still analog only (the analog signal travels further than digital requiring fewer antennas), which may be a lifesaver in an emergency. Roaming on analog is normally $0.50/min, but Sprint has a nice Free and Clear America option that lets you roam on any carrier (including analog) for $5 extra/month. Good if you're the outdoors type. Be aware, however, that if you are talking in analog mode your phone number is vulnerable to cloning.Overall, I would recommend this phone and am glad I bought it, despite the flaws I mentioned above. I, like many Sprint users, are fond of the Sanyo phones because they have been the best performers in the past. Other phones to consider if you don't need a camera are the SCP-4920 (candy-bar style) and the RL-2500, both these phones are by Sanyo with good reputations.
I'm glad that so many people have a great time with this phone and I must admit I loved it as well, until about 6 months after I bought it.  I am VERY careful with my phones, usually keeping them in great condition for years and one day I open the phone and the circular bar, where the flip front rotates, cracks.  Of course, dealing with sprint, they are not to blame, and the manufacturer is not to blame.  Apparently, I am to blame, and as my punishment, there is no one that I can even pay to fix it and I was informed that I would have to buy a new phone.Well, I don't like when people tell me I HAVE to do something, so I decided I would deal with the crack until it was completely broken.  About 2 weeks later, the phone decides to stop responding to the charger after 5 minutes or so, so I wake up and take my phone to work and have it for about an hour without touching it before the low battery warning comes on.I hope that I just got a bad phone and they can do something with it down at the sprint store, but I noticed some of these problems creeping up pretty often, especially the charger.  (Of course Sprint told me they don't have any of these listed as a common problem with the phone... Thank you Amazon reviewers!!!)Good luck with yours, but I'd do a little more research unless you want to spend your days on hold and/or screaming at Sprint supervisors (one of which made me cry), or writing bad reviews on Amazon.
I have been with Sprint for almost 2 years now and have had 3 different phones.  Out of the 3 I have to say that the Sanyo 8200 is the best.  I love the screen call feature.  I've read the other reviews and alot of people complained about the audio quality.  I haven't had that problem.  Now, I just recently had to get a replacement under the warranty because the vibrate did not work but other than that, I think the phone is great. I love the design of the phone, its compact and light and comes in 4 different colors.  I orginally wanted the red but went with silver only because at the time the Sprint store that I purchased the phone from did not have the red one in stock. Im thinking about upgrading though.  I never keep cells phone for a really long time.  If something new comes out and I like it, I usually buy it.  I like the new Sanyo 5600 but Im not keen on spending $500 for a cell phone.  I think I may just settle for the Sanyo MM 7400.
All the gadgets in the world can't hide the fact that this phone sounds horrible. I first thought it might be a bad phone, so I exchanged it. Guess what? It's the same for all of the 8200's. I love the reception but if you can't understand the person on the other end what's the point? It's like owning pretty car but it it can't shift into drive. Stay away from this phone.
I fell in love with this phone at the store: great design, great features, great camera, I was psyched.  Then I started using the phone - the WORST audio quality!  Everyone who calls me sounds like they're coming through a train terminal PA system.  The static is in the phone, it's not the reception.  I'm still using this phone because I still love the design, but just know you're buying a phone with terrible audio.
I've had this phone for a little over 6 months now and as a lot of others have said, my charger is on the blink. I will plug the phone in and all night just listen to it beep on (charging) and beep off (not charging). No matter how I position the plug it doesn't seem to help.Another thing that I noticed from day 1 is that the sound is not good at all. I would actually get into arguements about the bad quality of the phones others were using to call me before I finally realized that it was my phone that was causing the issues. I find that the only way I can hear people in a place that has any noise around them without it being muffled is by turning the volume all the way down on my phone... but then I have to strain to hear what they're saying (lose lose situation).I always keep my phones in very good condition and because of that am pretty dissapointed about the problems I've been dealing with, especially with the charger -- those constant beeps are SO annoying.Because of these irritants I would def NOT recommend this phone to anyone... There must be other better models out there somewhere.
I first bought this phone right off the line (3 days after it was put in stores) For 4 months it was the best phone i have ever had. decent quality in pictures, advanced text messaging (text messages came direct to my phone rather than me logging into a site to get them) and the speaker phone made talking a little easier when i needed full movement of my head to see what was around me (IE. driving, walking etc.)But the biggest thing that seems to plague the new sanyo picture and video phones is the place you plug into the phone to charge the phone. WHAT HAPPENED?? Only four months into owning this and i have to jimmy the phone so that i can just charge the battery. And i am not the only one who has this problem. Many of the guys i work with are sprint users and have this exact phone or one similar and have the same problems as i do. This major defect makes this phone a bad sale. i mean how can you use the features if you can't get power to the phone. Sanyo needs to find a way to fix this, and then this phone type will once again be the ace it was when i first bought it.
Like everyone said before, I bought this for all the features and the great battery life.  All those have delivered except I feel like the battery doesn't last that long anymore AND the charger that they provide starts to "get loose" and stops charging the phone correctly after a while and you have to get the alternative charger for the phone.  This phone gets great reception and I get reception in places that most other people don't...ONLY ONE PROBLEM....... YOU CAN'T HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO YOU!  The speaker in the earpiece of this phone is terrible.  I thought it was me at first.  I thought that it was the OTHER person's cell phone because how could it be mine if I had full reception bars?  Well it is the phone.  The speaker is simply a piece of junk.  Hopefully Sanyo will correct it with future phones because I really do like everything else about the phone.  I gave it 2 stars though because the basic function of the phone is obviously the most important thing and that is seriously lacking.
I have exactly the same problem Daniela had. The circular bar has cracked after one year. I was always VERY CAREFUL with the phone, never dropped it.I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
This is a good phone with many features. It does well in all areas except for the basic function of having a conversation. It will connect almost every time a call is placed, and a call is almost never dropped. The problem is you cannot hear what the person is saying. When the volume is as high as it goes you cannot hear because it is scratchy and you dont get the persons voice. When the volume is as low as it goes you can hear the persons voice clearly, but it is so low that you cannot fully hear what they are saying. The people I have called say that they hear me perfectly..The speakerphone is good and can be pretty loud. It is not perfect though. It is a small speaker, not a large speaker so the sounds isn't as good. Though it sounds well for the size of the speaker.The phone does use alot of power. One average my phone only lasts about 36 hours making one 10 minute call.This is my second model of this phone i have owned because the last one i had stopped charging. I do not know if it was the phone or the charger, but it stopped charging. Thankfully i had purchased insurance for four dollars a month and they replaced it. I highly recommend getting insurance with this phone because theh phone costs 250 dollars. Four dollars a month (in my case) is nothing to make sure that if it brakes i dont have to pay another 250 dollars.This phone has many features, it really makes you think of seven years ago when cellular phones only had an address book. It's main feature is the camera. The camera works well, but in high resalution (sp) it can only take 27 pictures. In low resalution it can take well over 120, but there is drastic difference in the quality. It has frames you can use, and also has multiple color modes. Sepia, Negative and Black and White are just a few. It can take up to 8 shots in a row.This phone also includes voice memos and call screening. It has internet which doesn't work well with low service areas. I recomend at least "two bars" when using internet. It has text messages and it can send and recieve. It also lets you create personal folders. It almost always will send and/or recieve a message even in low service areas.I give this phone 3 stars because it lacks the main purpose of a phone which is calling, but it does have many features. It is a great phone and very fun..I do recommend insurance though.
Sprint in my opinion the best wireless carrier out their. It is odd that they merged with Nextel, because they are my second favorite.Sprint's native network reaches over 250 Million POP. That, with the roaming, their network reaches 290(Digital only phones) or 295(Digital and analog phones) people. that makes it the largest Wireless network in the USA.You get to roam on Verizon's, ALLTEL's, ect networks for free as well.Sprint only offers Unlimited data plans. They offer them for both their Visions and Power Visions access. Prices range from $10 to $25. $25 being the Unlimited Power Visions (EV-DO) access with all of the Sprint TV channels and some Sirius satellite radio, along with other streaming radio channels. Other content can be added, but you would need to check the list. They are always adding new things.Sprint is the only carrier that will let you use your Smart-Device like a Treo 650 with the unlimited Handset data plans. So with Sprint you can use the Unlimited Data on your Treo 650 for $10 a month. Both Verizon and Cingular charge $45 a month for this. T-Mobile $20.They also allow their customers to use their phones as modems, with moderate use. Other carriers either do not have this feature, or have it shut off.Sprint has also added Free Incoming plans to their Fair & Flexible plans. These are plans that keep adding new minutes to your plan, as you go over your bucket.this keeps you from paying 45 to 60 cents a minute in overages. Also keep in mind that other carriers charge roaming and long distance fee's on top of the overage fees. So you can be paying into the $2 dollar a minute range for going over your plan minutes. T-Mobile USA is notorious for this. You pay a fee for the overage minutes, a fee for the long distance, and a fee if roaming. T-Mobile USA's network is pretty small, so you could roaming easily.Another thought to throw around. Is Sprint uses 1900MHz signals for their CDMA/EV-DO coverage. They are also building out their 800MHz coverage with the licenses acquired from Nextel. Since 1900MHz needs more towers to cover a given area, this allows your phone to have more tower choices to choose from.This also increases Internet speeds, because speeds drop with distance.So I have found Sprint's data speeds to be faster then Verizon's. And Much faster then Cingular's and T-Mobile's Internet speeds.Sprint also uses Lockline for their replacement insurance provider. They cover Any phone on your account, purchased from Anywhere, no matter if it is New or Used. Other carriers insurance providers only cover new phones purchased from the carrier.I could go on and on, but just take this into consideration before choosing another carrier just based on a commercial. Or the bucket of minutes they "Claim" they are going to provide you. Minutes don't mean a thing if the network is not dependable and the calls sound like crap.Also keep in mind that Sprint uses CDMA, which is the same network technology Verizon uses. CDMA is the most efficient network technology.Check out [...]and[...] for more info.
All the good stuff you've read about this phone is true.  I have only one issue with this phone.  I have trouble understanding the other person.  Especially when there is any kind of background noise.  I read all the reviews and figured the people complaining about the sound quality were probably using the wrong end.  I really wanted to like this phone.Unfotunately, being unable to hear and understand the person on the other end is a deal breaker.  Perhaps I just got a bad phone.  I'm going to exchange.
I have had this phone going on a year now and can faithfully say that I have very few complaints!! First of all the phone has NEVER and I mean NEVER failed me! This will be the 5th Sanyo I have owned, starting with the faithful 4500, and have never been let down. I have seen numerous complaints about sound quality, but short of the volume being a little low on occasion, I cannot see too much fault. The speakerphone is only half-duplex, but most cell phone speakerphones are only HD at the moment. Also you cannot expect board room sound out of a tiny micro-sized speaker! It does very well for its size. Ready link performance is top rate, as well. All in all another great Sanyo product!
I have to tell you all that I am so impressed by this phone, it amazes me!  I am not easily amazed or overcome to write a review on anything.  But seeing this here is awesome and I just got off the little bugger (in a very good bugger way :)  The sanyo Silver SCP-8200 is one sturdy and reliable phone.  I am rough with the phone, I have dropped the phone at least 3 times already and I have been a klutz like that forever and since I have owned the phone almost 6 months now.  Not ONE SCRATCH, NOT ONE DROPPED CALL, NOTHING BUT GREATNESS FROM THIS EXCELLENT 100% PERFECT PHONE!  tHE SANYO PCS-8200, ALSO HAS AND DOES EVERYTHING FROM VOICE DIALING/2 way text messaging/ quick keys etc.... and a speakerphone and walkie talkie (READY LINK/R-LINK) THIS PHONE IS THE BGEST ON THE MARKET TODAY, I EVEN BOUGHT MY WIFE ONE AND SHE IS SO PLEASED WITH IT, SHE TAKES PICTURES OF EVERYONE IN HER PHONE BOOK AND ADDS A PICTURE TO THEIR NAMES SO WHEN THE PHONE RINGS IT SHOWS THEIR PICTURE ON ONE OF THE 2 SCREENS AND THEIR IS A CLOCK BUILT IN TO THE CAMERA PHONE EASILY VISIBLE AND DATE TOO ON MAIN AND SUB LCD SCREENS. SO I DO NOT LIKE THE SPECS ON THE PAGE THAT TOOK ME HERE.  THAT COULD MAKE SOMEONE PICK UP THIS NOKIA I HAD AND RETURNED BEFORE THIS PHONE.  HORRIBLE!  PLUS I DO LIKE MY KYOCERA FLIP PHONE ALSO, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T MATCH UP TO THIS ALL INCLUDED PCS VISION PICTURE PHONE/SANYO SPC-8200 SILVER (SPRINT AND QWEST) BOTH ARE MERGING BY THE WAY.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS PHONE TODAY, YOU WILL HAVE A 15 DAY OR SO TRIAL PERIOD, SO I KNOW BY THEN YOU WILL HAVE PLAYED WITH EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE PHONE, TAKE PICTURES AND GREAT QUALITY TOO; BETTER THAN MY GATEWAY DIGITAL CAMERA.  THIS IS THEE ONLY PHONE TO BUY AND THE ONLY PHONE YOU WILL NEED FOR A LONG TIME.  RECOMMENDED HIGHLY THE  HIGHEST RANKING AND NOT EVEN A 2ND THOUGHT ON IT,  THE CALLS ARE SO CLEAR AND ALSO HAS A VOICE LEVELING FEATURE ON IT, CRYSTAL CLEAR CALLS AND NO DROPS.  I LOVE THIS PHONE!GOSH, I HOPE JUST ONE PERSON READS THIS AND GOES AND BUYS THIS PHONE, I KNOW HE OR SHE WILL BE AS X-STATIC AS I AM.  GOOD LUCK WITH A GREAT PHONE :O)ENJOY AS I HAVE AND WILL FOR MANY MANY MORE MONTHS EVEN YEARS AHEAD OF ME, TO COME.***A MUST OWN PHONE - HANDS DOWN TOTALLY AWESOME AND EVERY FEATURE THERE IS IN A PHONE LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE IS ON THIS MODEL; SOOOO.....  WHATCHA WAITING FOR GO GET THIS PHONE "NOW"!"*****" 5 OUT OF 5 sTARS THE HIGHEST RANKING!!  THIS PHONE IS THE BEST~
I purchased a new Sanyo PM 8200 in 10/04.  I loved the phone at first.  Then about 3-4 months later (January or February) I noticed the part where my phone flipped open was cracking.  I immediately took it to the store to see if my warranty would cover this crack.  The CSR said it would and they'd tried to fix it.  I left my phone for 45 minutes.  Upon return I was told that since there was a TINY crack near the antenna on my phone, that my warranty was void.  It took me refocusing my eyes numerous times just to be able to see what they were referring to. So I left with no resolution. And very discouraged and upset.In May '05 my phone stopped charging.  Again, I went to Sprint hoping that maybe this time they would value my years as a customer and help me out.  Again, I was cast away with NO resolution.  The CSR said she wasn't familiar with my problem,(even though I researched the problem on many websites and there were many users who had experienced this) but she'd have a tech look at my phone.  After 45 minutes, they said nothing was wrong with my phone, even after I asked them to plug it into a charger and they themselves saw it wasn't charging. The CSR suggested a new battery. So I purchased a new battery, thinking that MAYBE my 7 month old battery had died.  I was LIVID!  I was even more upset when that didn't solve the problem. I went back to the store a few days later to return the $60 battery and to see if maybe someone ELSE would be a little more helpful and he was.  His name was Clinton and he replaced my old phone charger with the bar charger.  He said that would solve the problem and it did, but only temporarily.  As of  July, my phone won't charge AT ALL.  I have to prop it certain ways to trick it to charge, but even after an hour and a half, and it says its fully charged, it IS NOT and when I try to use it, it dies immediately.  Now I have no use of my phone because it won't hold a charge.  Will ANYONE at Sprint PCS help me?  I have always taken my phone in when the problems were in their infancy.  Now the problems have worsened and I feel I have nowhere to go for help.  I want someone to help me and let me know that I'm not giving my money away to a company that could care less if I am a satisfied customer or not.

This is really a nice phone. I have had it 10 months and never had a problem with it,but its true about sprint customer service they are really terrible to deal with. If my contract was up I would already be gone. Its worth the 150.00 to leave and believe me I am ready!But as for the phone its been a good one for me!
When I initially reviewed this phone, I gave it glowing endorsements based upon a unit that met specifications.  Unfortunately, after acquiring a few other units I have come to the conclusion that many critics have been correct.  While I still think this is a decent phone, it appears to have been plagued with inconsistent manufacturing standards, slightly cheaper components, and higher failure rates than other Sanyo models.The Sanyo 8200 is a solid phone that will be far superior to many alternatives. Not to mention, with the deals you get for signing a 2 year agreement, this phone can be a great value. Sanyo added a few extra nice features for this phone like an alarm (yippie!!!) and appointment calendar. But overall, the features are only slightly above average compared with the current generation of phones. Let's face it, some of these newer phones have really raised our expectations.The phone camera is not top-end but decent for daytime use. Of course the speakerphone quality is high quality as usual with Sanyo phones.The signal strength isn't as good as the 4900 or the 8300.  I suspect they cut corners on the antenna. If you are a person that demands 5 bars in every location, get the 8300 instead. In addition, the MM7500 and the 9000 will probably both offer stronger antennae with their superior next gen features.  While the reception sounds fine, this phone averages 2-3 bars.The screen resolution is also good but not fantastic. The memo recorder could have used much more memory.Sprint coverage is better than advertised as long as you use a good phone. Customer service is not as great as it used to be, but it's still better than Verizon.  I'm switching friends off of Verizon to Sprint. Believe me, if you have bad reception, you have a bad phone and it's time to use that warrantee. With this phone, I've had to go back to the Sprint store countless times to get them to swap it out.Several reviewers have stated they have problems with sounding garbled during conversations. Most likely, this is another case where you need to utilize that warranty or return policy. When the phone is good, it's good. If you're having problems, you probably have one of the 30% of these phones that comes off the manufacturing line with hardware issues. They might not give you another model, but they definitely have to replace the phone.Also, be mindful of the firmware version of this phone.  Even replacement versions are shipping at rev 25.  You should go to the store to update your phone to rev 29 or better.One thing that is a big disappointment is the lack of accessories that come standard with this phone. Not to mention, when are manufacturers going to make a data cable standard?Unfortunately these criticisms apply to all phones. Sanyo has added some nice features to this model. Even with its flaws, it's a decent deal for the price. If you can afford the next generation, however, I would recommend it.  Best wishes!
Summary: Buy the new Sanyo 8300. It is the best sprint phone I have found.I just bought the Sanyo 8300 last night. It has the best reception of any Sprint phone that I have owned. Reception is the top factor for me when I buy a phone since my home and work are in borderline areas. I have owned the Sanyo 8200, 8100, and 4900. The 8300 is a huge improvement in reception versus the 8200 and 4900. The 8300 works in areas of my office where you cannot ever get a sprint connection with the 8200.At one point 2 years ago, I actually bought the best phone of all the Sprint manufactures. At the time the Sanyo 4900 was the only phone that provided better reception. I would say the 8200 and 8100 are similar to the 4900.
Sprint in my opinion the best wireless carrier out their. It is odd that they merged with Nextel, because they are my second favorite.Sprint's native network reaches over 250 Million POP.

the customer who wrote the negative review on her terrible experience with charging the phone is ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!  She is not lying...this experience is what has led me to the Amazon website today to try and purchase alternate charging accessories since my phone will not hold a charge and reflects "charge complete".Another issue is the purchase of a warranty for the said phone...because Sprint's customer care is so disgusting one should ALWAYS get maintenance...I had my phone for 2 days beyond their 14 day requirement and Sprint would not allow me to add maintenance, so I am a VERY disgruntled customer!
Although the Sanyo 8200 has many great features, there are three problems that may be inherent in the design of this model.1) Overheating of the handset with backlit turned off. Although store testing finds the product to be within the appropriate testing range, this does not mean that there is not a problem.2) Adjustability of the receiver volume. After repeated testing at all levels, either cannot hear everything being said or voice echoing occurs or voice distortion at higher levels.3) Receiver feature and camera feature share same space.  When switching from left ear to right ear, it is difficult to find a position to hear from.  Have to move the phone almost below the earlobe to get reception.I found this to be true with at least 6 other phone users.The Sprint Store does not take these problems seriously enough to replace the phone for a different model.
I purchased a PM8200 back in October 2004. I've dropped it, it's gotten wet, and it kept on working just fine, camera included, until late June of 2011 - the screen has gone out, but I can still make and receive calls. That's saying a lot for the durability of this phone.Now if I can find a phone that's as durable and as easy to use as the PM8200, I'd buy it without hesitation.
I have enjoyed two previous Sanyo phones and when the 8200 came out I was eager to get one.  However, after having the phone for about 3 months I knew this one was a "bad apple". The voice distortion is so acute that I am often embarrassed by how often I have to ask people to repeat themselves.  If you use your phone for business calls, like I do, look elsewhere unless you want to constantly ask your customers to repeat themselves.  Just recently I have been facing the battery charging issue mentioned by several of the other reviewers.  I am disappointed that this product does not live up to the service I received from my previous Sanyo's.  I will say that the other features of the phone have been okay, but overall I would not recommend this phone.  I spoke with Sprint several times regarding the voice issue and either they didn't care or dismissed it as bad reception.  Bye-Bye, Sprint!
I bought this phone about a year ago and would recommend it with a few reservations.  Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:1) It has a very good camera which gives good picture quality.  I have used it to take pictures of everything from outdoor pictures of the sea to indoor pieces of furniture I am thinking of buying and it always focuses and lights well.2) The speakerphone is very useful - I didn't really think I would use it and it wasn't a feature I looked for in a phone, but I have used it so often, I can't do without it now.3) Reception is very good.  I often get reception when other sprint users don't and it is clear and strong.Cons:1) My biggest complaint with this phone is that it is not terribly durable.  I have had to replace it 3 times in 1 year because the hinges always break (from just regular opening and closing) and it eventually looses it's connection to determine when the phone is opened and closed (which means the phone will drain itself of battery and will answer if you touch it when it rings without giving you a chance to screen the call.  If you do buy this phone, definitely sign up for the maintenance plan (which is about $3-$4 a month through Sprint).2) Although it is not big or bulky, it is not one of the most compact out there.  I have seen several smaller, thinner phones and must admit to feeling a bit of cell phone envy when this happens.Overall I think this is a good phone for the money with quite a few features, but the need to constantly replace it is making me look elsewhere.
I bought this phone for FREE in dec 2004. (special)2 months later the head set wouldn't work anymore. (the head set to plug in the jack and speak hands free, and i have a few plantronic headsets that work great, the big ones.)Store would not give me a blue one, only silver. 2 months later the head set wouldn't work anymore.Given the run around at the sprint stores and tech and made to drive over 500 miles going back and forth (in 35 mile increments).Given 3rd phone, got to my car and started to make a call, head set wouldn't work right out of the box. That's less than 90 seconds after leaving the store.Given 4th phone the same day (not working this same day, 2 bad phones in the same day) and would keep beeping, the icon for battery would blink from full charge to BEING recharged (not in need of, but being), while half muting the person on the other end of the phone call.After 4 hours in the store this day, even though they saw it was not working, refused to replace because their tech guy went home and he was required to say it's broken before they change it out.My previous phone was the sanyo 4900 which i had to replace in the first week, but has lasted for the last 2 years, very dim screen and big, but worked great.The 8200?, I got it free and it's cost me so much money in time and gas and trouble, feels like It's cost me $1000. By far the worst quality phone I have dealt with in the last ten years.emailed sprint and they have agree to allow me to take any of their phones and they will credit the 229 list price.Did not offer to compensate for all the BS their store reps have put me through. Worst people in the world at the sprint store in Asheville, NC... patton ave. Hendersonville road and mall is where you should buy if your in this town.I've liked sanyo alot, but now I'm almost scared off of them. My old samsung wasn't as strong in reception and battery life, but I'm using cnet to investigate phones that have the same problem with everybody.I do have a few friends that have not had AS MANY problems as I have had and they are hard on phones, my 4900 still looks new. I'm very easy on my phones.If I had not gotten 4 bad phones....just rating the phone on the features and the like, I'd probably rate it 3 stars at best.The phone is average, imo. The worst thing about the phone, from all the phones, is to listen to a conversation on the phone, you either have to turn the volume down to the lowest, if you turn it up so that you can easily hear the other person the sound becomes very distorted and choppy.Based on that one thing, I would not suggest buying this phone. Add in the problems I've gotten with the 4 bad phones, I can not give this a good review.
This is a great phone! It has all the features such as camera with flash, calendar and other stuff. I have no problems with it except for one. The metallic seems as if it is prone to scratches and it feels awkward when I handle it with extra care.
I bought this recently at RadioShack and am probably going to return it. Like some other reviewers, I am experiencing constant voice distortion with this phone - voices sound slightly garbled. The phone doesn't drop calls but I am having a really hard time hearing clearly and am often having to ask the other person to repeat what they just said. The people I talk to say they can hear me just fine. I can't recommend a phone that fails on such a basic and important feature as reception clarity.
and it does everything that I could ever imagine (web, pictures, alarms, downloads, speaker phone) - except streaming video, which the newer version (PCS Phone Sanyo MM-7400 (Sprint) has.One great buy!
I got this phone after switching over from Verizon.  The first thing I noticed was an audible hissing when I'm talking on the phone.  I went to 3 different sprint stores and tried out all the models that were available and there was noticeable hissing on almost all the phones.  But most notably on Sanyo models.  The phone that had the least background hissing was the LG 325, but I wanted a flip phone.  The PM 8200 also has a horrible speakerphone (it's loud, but very distorted and cuts out when there is cross-talking).  The PM 8200 also distorts the caller's voice slightly.  If you've never had a good cell phone like an LG, (my previous verizon phone was the LG 4400 and callers sounded crystal clear), you may not notice the relatively bad sound quality of most of the Sprint phones.  I returned the 8200 within the 14 day period and instead got the Samsung RL-A760.  The sound is much clearer on this phone with less hissing, but is slightly larger and does not have a camera.  the speakerphone on the Samsung is much better and does not cut out during cross-talking, at least on my end.  overall, the PM8200 is a good phone if you can stand the hissing and distortion.
MY PHONE IS A CANDY RED GETS LOTS OF ATTENTION USING IT, BUT THE THE RING TONES ARE TO LOW IF YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PURSE YOU WILL NEVER HERE IT ,YOU HAVE TO PUT IT ON  VIBRATE AND RINGER AND KEEP IT IN YOUR POCKET. NEVER COULD USE THE SPEAKER PHONE I COULD HERE THEM BUT THEY COULD NOT HERE ME  MY VOICE WOULD SOUND MUFFLE.
Okay, this phone isn't perfect but it gets 5 stars.  Why?  Because at this moment its the best value for your money.  Sure, the 650 is better, but unless you want to lock yourself into a 2 year contract its going to cost significantly more.  Other comparable options cost similar to the 650.What I use it for: I'm a T-mobile customer and this phone is a) cheaper than the phone through T-mobile and b) is unlocked.  So when I'm in Europe this spring I can simply replace the SIM and go.  Note that this is the GSM model - it won't work on Verizon or Sprint.Pros: Syncing is effortless, scheduling software mimics Outlook 2003 perfectly.  Phone works great - good reception and sound quality.Cons: No bluetooth, no WIFI (the 650 lacks this as well).  Screen isn't hi res, camera quality is low (if you want quality get a digicam, I have a Canon S400).  Lets be honest - this is yesterday's technology.Unknowns: Reliability.  I've only had this phone for a few days, and we'll see how it stands the test of time.Conclusion: If you want the latest and greatest get the 650, Nokia 9300, or something else.  But you'll be paying that early adopter premium.  If you want something that elegantly does the job at a great price then get this.
As far as design and user-friendliness, I can't say enough about how great this phone/pda combo is.  I just wish it wasn't such a POS!I bought an unlocked Treo 600 directly from PalmOne.com about 1 year ago, as I travel internationally and didn't want the hassle of being limited to just one carrier's simcard.  It worked wonderfully for a few months, synched effortlessly with Outlook, and was a breeze to enter data into with the qwerty keyboard.  I loved trading in my Palm and old cell phone for one combined piece of equipment.  The only problem I had right from the beginning is that my earlobe (which must be a genetic abnormality, as I haven't seen any other mention of this problem) would line up just right with the "hang up" button on the touchscreen and would disconnect my calls.  I would finally realize it when my phone would ring loudly in my ear as the other person was already calling me back while I was still talking.  I can excuse this issue, however, and blame myself for apparently holding the phone at the wrong angle.  No problem.And yet... about 6 months into my ownership of the Treo 600, an extremely loud buzzing sound emerged on the other end of the line.  I couldn't hear it myself, but everyone I talked to asked if I was being electrocuted, or being run over by a train, or if I was standing on the runway instead of in the airport.  I called Palm and was obviously connected to Thailand or India or wherever the call center (which certainly wasn't a problem, just an observation) and they said this was a common problem and they'd be happy to send me a new one.  Great!  I got my "new" Treo very quickly with no charge for shipping, but was somewhat displeased to find out it was a refurbished phone and my old one I sent back was in better condition (as far as scratches on the body, screen clarity, etc.).  Anyway, I was so happy to get rid of the problematic one that I went along with it.  Now I wish I hadn't!About a month ago (just past the warranty expiration on the original unit, not sure it would even transfer to my refurbished one) the Treo's screen calibration kept becoming inaccurate.  I'd reset the calibration and not 10 minutes later it'd be off again.  It would get maybe 1 inch off calibration, so I'd intend to choose one calendar entry, and it would instead hit the button for Monday and skip to another day!  Or I'd attempt to pick 5pm and it would highlight the entry at 10am.  There was apparently no fix for this issue, even with hard resets, reinstallations of software, etc.I was pretty upset that within just over 1 year I was already trying to replace my second Treo.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I pawned it in Asia to a used cell phone vendor that was so desperate to get an American phone he didn't seem to care that the screen was misaligned, and now I'm here on Amazon purchasing a Blackberry...
This is the 3rd piece of junk treo i have been given. I have suffered through spontaneous reboots, dropped calls, locking screens, you name it. Now the latest is screen bleeding that no one will cover. This phone is junk.
I have just received my treo 600 from Amazon. Brilliant service and bang on time.I read the previous reviews and was concerned about buying this phone.However,I do believe that there were some bad phones around initially.... ( the treo 600 came out in 2002/3 if my memory serves me correctly). The phone you buy today is bug free ( well mine is??). This phone is the best I have ever purchased- and  is pretty easy to use. I had a treo 270 some time ago - but dropped it and it was not worth repairing.There is no comparison between the two- and I think the palm Os is better. The battery life is as stated, and it easily pulls in my GSM signal at the extremities of the cell range. So why all the bad reviews? Frankly, I dont know why.You dont need the 650 .But I must admit, that I never seem to get the lemons???
I was in the market for a phone, and I gave this a try, because I liked the fact that I could carry this around instead of a phone, an MP3-player, and a PDA.  Although I list more cons than pros here, I really do like the phone a lot, and I would recommend it (4 stars).  The cons are minor things that I think would be a nice addition, and some people might find it helpful.Pros:- Combines a phone, MP3 player, and PDA in a nice package that fits in my hand.  All three have functioned very well for me.- QWERTY keyboard (though it is a bit small)- PalmOS (standard PDA OS; easy to synchronize with your computer)Cons:- No bluetooth (not a big deal for me)- No WiFi- Audio quality (phone is so-so, MP3 is decent)- Low-resolution screen (650 is high-res)- Requires special adapter for listening to MP3s (you can't simply get a 2.5mm-to-stereo adapter from RadioShack.  Otherwise the phone uses its speakers to play the music)- The camera is pretty much useless at VGA-quality, and don't even bother taking indoor pictures.I would also recommend getting the following accessories:- ZipLinq retractable USB sync cable (~$30; also charges the phone)- Seidio earbuds/headphones (~$30; made for Treos, you can listen to music with this one)- SD memory card (for MP3's)- a case (under $30 - if you don't want to keep it in your pocket)- PDANet software ($30 - allows you to use the phone as a wireless modem if you have Internet access in your phone plan)One last thing is, you can get a pretty decent GPS unit for another $150.
I'm not sure what these last few negative reports are about!  It's weird that they all come one right after the other.  If I was a suspicious type...but I'm not.  Maybe there was a bad manufacturing run, or some people just had real bad luck, but my experience has been excellent.  As long as I'm on the subject of negative reviews - I've got tons of third party software loaded and this treo is more stable than the Windows XP desktop that I'm typing this review on.  It does crash, but, very, very infrequently.In fact, this has been the best piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned.  I've had it since the month it was released, and I'm still using it all day, every day, even up to now.I've used it with two different carriers - first Cingular and then T-Mobile.  It has had excellent reception, (better than my wife's Nokia), from both carriers.And it is pretty rugged.  I've dropped it: 5 or 6 times - on concrete at least twice.  It's chipped up, but still works the same as the day I bought it.I bought a 1 gig SD Card, and I carry around a lot of music.  So much that I never use my iPod anymore.  I also joined [...]and I have room for one or two spoken-word books too.On the large internal memory I have eBooks, games, business applications, docs, spreadsheets, a video player, more games, and did I mention games?The phone and PIM functions are smoothly integrated and email is a breeze.My company gave me a RIM BlackBerry 7510 phone + email device.  It is absolutly primitive compared to the Treo 600.The Treo's screen is super bright, easily visible even in bright sunlight.  I love the fact that I have a keybord on the phone even if I don't use it all the time.  I installed a thirdparty application that lets me write Graffiti style right on the touch sensitive display.The fact that it is a Palm device means it is as configurable as you want it to be.  There are tens of thousands of software applications and upgrades available.So, in summary, in one pocket I carry a great phone, a fine chess partner, a calendar, my contact lists, a memo/note pad, an ebook-reader and half a dozen ebooks, an Audible player and a couple of audio books, an MP3 player and a bunch of songs, a fantasy role playing game, a backgammon game, poker and a solitaire card games, an MS Word doc reader, the "Bejeweled" game, a midi music sequencer, an email application, a world alarm clock/timer, a space conquest game, an investment calculator, and 10 or so more things (mostly games).I LOVE this phone. And it is unlocked, so I was able to change carriers with no hassel - if you've done this recently you will appreciate that this is no small thing.So, you may be wondering, "is this guy just going to gush?  Isn't there anything you don't like about the phone?"Well yes, in fact, the camera sucks. It is better than nothing and I have had occasion to use it a few times, but it is low resolution, somewhat distorting and useless in anything but well lit situations.I'd still say it was the best, most useful piece of electronics I'd ever owned, even if there were no camera.
I bought the unlocked TREO 600 one year ago for $549.  It has been replaced 3 times.  I gave up and bought the unlocked 650.  It crashed in 2 weeks.  I returned it.  I am now stuck with a 600 that is now out of warranty.  Service: forget about it.  All you will get is put on hold from India and they charge $25 per call after a few months.  The 600 reboots itself, turns itself off, loses all email settings, causes duplicates in OUTLOOK.  13 birthday reminders is 12 too many. It corrupted my address book and changed people's names and phone numbers, even after I did a hard reset and uninstalled and reinstalled the software.  You will never get to talk to a US Palm tech, only India.  I bought this from the Palm store.  The phone has  known issues with older SIM cards. I am now getting the Blackberry.
Everyone in my family now owns a Treo, and each one of us has only good things to say about it.  The phone gets excellent reception; whereas I've heard many people in my town complain about getting poor service on their cell phones, I have never been unable to place a call on my Treo or been cut off during the middle of a conversation.  Those unfamiliar with the Palm OS will find it wonderfully easy to navigate and to configure.  Furthermore, there is a vast and diverse array of progams one can download for the Palm OS, ranging from games, e-texts and MP3 player software to business applications, medical references and legal dictionaries.  I originally had some qualms about the fact that the Treo had a keyboard instead of the graffiti system to which I was accustomed, but I've come to prefer the keyboard.  I can write with the Treo keyboard much more quickly and conveniently than I could write with the graffiti system on other Palm Pilots.  That being said, those who prefer graffiti to the keyboard can always download programs that enable one to write with graffiti directly onto the screen.  Also, I've found the Palm Portable Keyboard (sold separately) to be very helpful and easy to use when I need to write more than a few lines, and I would recommend purchasing that item as well.  My heart goes out to other reviewers who have found their Treos to be fragile, but I cannot claim to have had the same experience.  My Treo has gone everywhere with me during the past year and has hardily withstood much wear and tear during that time.  I've dropped it a few times without any consequences.  Furthermore the screen is as bright and easy to see now as it was when I first got it.  The camera part of the phone is admittedly lacking in quality.  On the rare occasion when I need to use my Treo to take a picture of something, I make sure to take several different pictures on the theory that at least one will turn out as a passable representation of what I was trying to photograph.  But the Treo's advantages as a phone, a Web browser, a word processor and a PDA far outweigh any inadequacies the camera presents.  In summary, my Treo is easily one of the best electronic items I've ever owned, and I would highly reccomend it over any other phone and any other PDA.
I sync my Treo with my apple computer and have no problems (you'll need the "missing sync" software). The Treo itself has some issues that have disappointed me, however:Like all PDA Operating Systems (OS's), including Windows, they tend to crash a lot. What I've discovered is that this OS is extremely stable but only when I load the right programs. It's like driving a car, but only down certain streets, or you'll fall off a cliff. It's hit-or-miss adventure; you'll have to load programs one at a time and after a few days, see if they created any problems or crashes. If not, then you should have no issues with crashes; then go ahead and load the next one. If you experience problems, you can delete it and it will resolve the crash issue. But not being able to use a program (especially a much needed one) is very disappointing and a downfall for some users like me. This hugely limiting factor seems to make my Treo resemble more of an expensive organizer. Some folks simply live through the PDA crashes but I can't adjust to it. You need to count on some good luck and hope a program will not cause problems. The good news is that the few times it has crashed, I never once lost my data and could go on using my PDA as before. This is important if you're not near your computer for a sync. You simply unscrew the tip of the stylus to reveal a pin that you can use to hit the tiny "reset" button. The Treo re-boots with all my data, contacts & calendar intact.Bluetooth: The lack of bluetooth is also a bummer. I did not think I would need bluetooth, but now realize its usefullness. As technology improves, this Treo is at a disadvantage.Phone contacts: You can easily pop in your sim card but you can't save or utilize the phone book on your sim card. You'll have to either import your contacts from your computer or type it into the phone manually. This is not a good feature if you pop your sim card between different phones.Internet: Good colors & graphics, but connection is slow. A real pain to type quickly with the thumb keyboard.Portability: This Treo is quite bulky and heavy. It's not one that you can simply throw in your pocket and go hang out in the park with. It gets in the way and fits better in your handbag or briefcase. But then you might not hear the phone or feel it vibrate, which is defeating.Photos: The quality of the pictures are not very good. You can easily set the phone to display a picture of your caller, but that's not a remarkable feature.Graffiti: You can't write graffiti style on the screen. You have to use the thumb keyboard or type it in with the sylus.To Do List: If you accidently tap the box next to a To-Do-List item, it will delete your note and sometimes you can't undo the action, so be careful.For most of these issues, there are folks selling third party solutions. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.There are some pluses: the Treo is a quad-band phone. I use T-Mobile in NYC and get great reception. I also travel all over the world to places like India, Egypt, & West Africa and call home with perfect reception. It has a never ending "call-log" that has helped me in many ways. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.Personally, I think this Phone/PDA is too expensive, too heavy and needs some upgrading. The PDA/phone market is slowly improving but it needs a lot of work. If you must buy this Treo, keep a small cellphone nearby so you can pop in your sim card and throw the cellphone in your pocket when you want to travel light. Otherwise, you'll be tied down to the Treo's bulkiness when you don't need it.
I've had this phone for 8 months and since then Palm had replaced my Treo 600 4 times.  I've never dropped nor scratched it but it's just the phone itself that's messed up.  Every now and then there's a problem with this phone but I will still keep it coz I paid so much on this cr*p.For those of you who are thinking of getting a palmOne Treo 600, think over 100 times first okay?!HoneybeeChicago, IL
A few friends bought the 600 when it first came out--nightmare quality problems.  But it looks like Palm's worked the bugs out, and prices are coming down because of the 650.  I have Cingular service and it works great just about anywhere; if you travel around the country Cingular or Verizon are safe (but relatively expensive) bets.  The only difficulty I have with the 600 is the keypad--the keys are small packed tightly together.  Otherwise, screen navigation is easy, battery life good, phone sound quality better than any standard cell phone I've used.
I have had this phone for over a year and was pleased with every aspect of it, other than its size.  For anyone shopping for a PDA and wants it to have phone and internet capability you realy can not go wrong with this one, especialy since the price has gone down dramaticaly after the introduction of the Treo 650 which if you have the money has some nice upgrades that would have made my life easier.
I enjoy the features of the phone, however there are too many kinks.I am on my second replacement since Mar '05. The first phone had a mysterious orange blob that seemed to migrate on the screen, and a strange humming. The replacement worked for one month and also has a strange hum. The third phone is in route via mail.I have not had any problems with Cingular. They don't seem surprised by my complaints and promptly send replacements. However, I am looking into purchasing a Blackberry, instead.
Think twice before you buy this.  My first and second Treo 600s had identical problems, where they couldn't find the network for some reason, and the answer button wouldn't work.  I got the first one in February 05, and the 1st replacement in April 05.  The second replacement came a week later.  Now, this one has developed these orange pixels [[...] and Sprint is going to replace this one.  I will note that Sprint has only replaced my phone with refurbished phones, so I can just imagine that I'm just waiting on my replacement phone, which is just Joe Schmoe's broken phone that has the same darn problems.  I just hope that all of these problems keep happening within the warranty period.  If you can, buy the warranty.
Phone has excellent features but has bad reception.  Just after a month (right after the store exchange policy expired) the charger is not working.  Some loose connection may be. I read somewhere else that others are having similar issues. It is frustating to have your cellphone breakdown because of the charger issue.  How can I recommend this to anyone with this kind of issues ?
Don't bother with this one.  After 3 months phone function is essentially dead - Verizon won't serrvice it - you have to send it back to Palm - constantly drops calls, poor reception, freezes up - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HUNK OF JUNK!!!!
I got this phone and put the money into it so that I could add some handy software and have an all-in-one piece.  This was the most pathetic phone I have ever had.  I replaced it a total of 5 times before I just made T-mobile send me a completely unrelated phone.  I spent so much money to get so little.  The phone with just lock up all of the time, would not get service randomly that was unrelated to the service provider, it would need to be reset daily and then would constantly have to be backed up in fear of losing information and having to do a hard reset.  I do not recommend this phone for a toy for a baby, much less for a user who really wants to have some sort of function other than looking at the pretty buttons.
I bought the phone from verizon and had to replace it 3 times in the first 4 months. Phone kept restarting and disconnecting when I inserted a hands free ear/mic. Design for hand free is bad...never fits well. Sound quality is bad.I would say you get what you pay for. The PDA is nice and all, and web feature is great if you don't mind a $120+ bill each month. Still for $150 the phone part is terrible. Now I'm stuck with it for another 18 months. UGHBuyers beware!
Good tricky phone!Proseasy to use; good battery; there are thousends of softwares available to leave you notebook home; you can use it as your MP3 player; easy text writingConsthe software sometimes freezes;
Don't buy this phone ever. I had it for just over six months and now it's having problems from last 3 months... Drop calls whenever it wants..:) Now, popping up orange pixels on screen and seems like dead or burnt pixels and it's growing day by day.. I called T-Mobile customer service and they are sending the replacement because it is under warranty.. What if it wasn't? Do the math.. They also charged me shipping for sending replacement. Ridiculous, isn't it????I am rating it 1 because that is the lowest score you can select here.. It's < -infinity
Bought one second-hand, (out of warranty), and within 7 days it got orange pixels on the screen.  I did a search on the web, and lots of people have the identical problem - [...]
I have heard a lot of bad comments about this product. I think the problem is that there have been different versions of the Treo 600. But the one I had was perfect, had it for a year and never gave me a problem, even dropped it a few times. I recently got my Treo 650 and gave the 600 to a friend; this one is so much better. I'm happy :).
This phone/pda has real problems.  I too am waiting for Joe Schmoe's phone to be refurbished by Cingular and sent to me.  I am just hoping that I am within the warrantee -- something that Cingular cannot confirm, although I have had the various phones almost a year -- or just over a year.  You are asking for it if you buy this device!
I bought this phone 2 months back. This looks good and it has more functionality of PDA and also works as a good mobile phone. The concern here is some time when you make a call it is not getting disconnected and we need to switch off the mobile mode.The speaker phone quality is good and talk time is also good.I recommend you can buy this but see for better option also.
I transitioned from a regular cell phone and a palm vx to this treo 600. The 650 was not available at that time.This phone works great. It crapped out once and all data was lost (synch backup a week before). Otherwise it works great.Pluses:- Palm functionality integrated well with phone functionality.- SD Card reader- Camera- backlight keyboardMinuses:- Very slow data transfer via synch - instead transfer via sd card- low res screen- camera is pretty poor in quality, but comparable to some first generation camera phones- small keyboard buttons- need adapter to use headphones- very low volume speaker and poor quality speakerphone- No graffiti pad- Not bluetooth or Wifi (although I heard you can get a wifi sd card)I would highly recommend you get a nice case to protect this phone and screen protectors to minimize damage to the screen.
What a waste of time! This piece of junk disconnected the phone call; the system just frozen and not responded and the PDA system crashed ALL DAY LONG. Palm exchanged the phone 3 times in the last 6 months and they are all nightmares... Get the Sony P910 or Blackberry if you don't want your callers to get very upset.
The pda and its features are very good but the phone does not work well with T-Mobile.  I'm on my third treo 600 with T-Mobile and the service is aweful Everywhere!
If you have any sense, don't buy this phone.  I paid $700 for this phone when it first came out.  After the first three months the mouth piece went dead.  I got another one and it went all staticy so I had to send it back.  The camera has never taken a decent picture and recently I dropped it and the screen damaged.  I called to get it repaired and they want to charge me $179.  That's almost $1000 for a cell phone.  I ask you, who doesn't drop their cell phone at least once?
Don't spend your money on this device.  Mine is recently out of warranty and the battery is a problem.  Even though there are replacement batteries for sale on the internet and instructions on how to replace the batteries, neither Sprint nor Palm will perform that service.  The only explanation I can think of for this lack of service is an attempt to force an expensive upgrade.
The PDA features work well.  Syncs up easily with computer.  However, phone reception is terrible.  Admittedly, I live in a fringe area but the old Sanyo 8100 worked just fine on the Sprint network.  Even bought external antenna to improve reception and stop dropped calls but did no better.  Ready to sell and start over.
I'm giving it 1-star for the service from Amazon concerning this item.  I ordered one on Sunday Aug. 21 and was told it would ship on the 23rd or 24th (it's advertised as "Usually ships in 2 to 3 business days.)  By the end of business on the 24th I called and was told they didn't have the phone and the new estimated ship date was now Aug. 29.  On the 29th, I called in the morning and was told they had the phone and it was scheduled to ship out.  In the afternoon I called again and was told it showed to be on backorder and they had no idea when it would ship.  That's when I cancelled the order.  Watch out, for it still says "Usually ships in 2 to 3 business days."
I had to return the item because in the description it was not made clear that the phone was not compatable with Verizon's cellular network.  I ended up buying the phone directly from verizon.
This is definitely a good cell phone.I have seen all those fancy cell phone with huge screen and photo capabilities, but what's the point? I only want to call people with my phone, and if it does that, I am happy, and this phone does it well and has a good price.I have also dropped this phone about 50 times since I got it 6 monthes ago and not a single thing has gone wrong for the phone as a result of my carelessness.I think this is a perfect phone for someone who wants to keep things simple
The LG is a great cell phone.  I agree with the previous reviewer, if you want a camera, buy one.  The phone is small, easy to use, and has all of the necessary features you need.  I also bought the accessory kit from Amazon, and everything works great.Bottom line:  Great Price (free), great reception, small, easy to use.
The LG C1300 is a sleek, small and very nice cell phone!! Since this is my first one, I was shocked when I got it for Christmas!!! I couldn't believe it!!! This phone is amazing by having an incredable LCD display that is bright and clear! It has very good sound quality when talking/listening to people and when listening to ringtones. There are a few "cool" ringtones such as: Twilight and Rock Me, but that's about it. I would recommend buying your own. The one of the down sides for me is the battery life. The talk time is only four hours and stand-by time isn't that long either. Since I don't talk on the weekdays anyway, I usually leave my phone off. But during the weekends, I talk on it forever causing the battery to run low. Another down side is the external mirror. I wish it could have been an external caller ID or something nice. The only useful thing is the LED light implanted in the mirror telling if your phone battery is charged or not. Overall, for my first cell phone, this is great!! Has everything I wanted in a cell phone! The only two concerns are battery life and the external mirror. If you are considering in buying a cheap yet great quality design, BUY THIS!!! Oh by the way, Cingular ROCKS!!!!
First, I hope no one reading these reviews is considering actually paying for this thing. I think that you shouldn't even take it for free, for two reasons: 1. you'll be paying a bundle a month for a service you can barely use, and 2. you probably passed up another free phone that no matter how bad it is, has to be better than the LG 1300.My major complaint is dropped calls. (The battery life is a little thin, but I would say not a major problem.) But it's really tough to have a conversation more involved than "when are you getting home?" "seven." "okay, see you then." because you will spend half your time saying, "wait, can you say that again?" The reception is awful (/with/ the new antenna) even when the phone doesn't drop calls. Plus, the sound quality is really poor, and as other people have said you have to grind the phone into your ear to make out anything the other person is saying.DO NOT take this as a free phone as I did - ANYTHING would be better. If you have the choice between this phone and a cardboard box with numbers written on it, choose the box. At least you can keep photos in it.
Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better("red") antenna, but they didn't get to a lot of them, especially the "free" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call "Warranty Service" to get the new "red" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs.  --If you live in an apartment; DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is..
Do not get this phone. I got it for free and it was cool at first but after a few days I got *dissapointed*. Sometimes when I dialed a number and hit the talk button, I put the phone to my ear and waited. Then I looked at the screen and the *useless* thing had gone to the main menu. Also the volume is *really* bad. You have to push the speaker into your ear really hard to hear somone on the other end.WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!
For years, I have resisted the whole cellphone, constantly connected to the world thing.  Then, this Christmas, my folks decided to put me on their Cingular family plan and finally force a cellphone on me.  At the cellphone store, all I cared about was finding something small, simple, and unobtrusive.  This phone seemed like it would fill those requirements perfectly.  Well, it has.  Both call quality and battery life have seemed more than adequate.  I live on the edge of civilization in northwest Colorado where cell towers are few and far between, but I have had what is (to me) suprising success in getting a good signal where one would expect one to be.  It's small size is a real boon to me, or anyone like me who does field work outdoors and has to carry around all manner of other gadgets and equipment and doesn't need a large device getting in the way or getting banged up.  If you need a good reliable form of communication and also don't need it to be the center of your life, this model fits the bill.
My wife got this phone to replace her Samsung X427m that was stolen.  I suggested she stick with the Samsung but she wanted something different.  She got this phone off of Ebay for $50.Even at $50 this phone is not worth the money.  The phone's problem is that the reception absolutely sucks!  I am lucky to get 2 bars in my own house using this phone!!  Whenever she calls me on my cell or landline phone, the call drops after 5 minutes or so.  Its not my cell phone because my SE T637 always has at least 4 bars where ever I go.  As a matter of fact, I was just on the phone with her and the call dropped for the 3rd time in 10 minutes.  I have been trying to call her back, but the call won't go through.This phone reminds me of the nightmares of MetroPCS' pitiful coverage.  But the problem here is not Cingular service, its the phone!  I can't believe Cingular would allow their name to be branded on this piece of garbage.LG sucks!  I will never purchase another LG phone again.I will be getting my wife the Samsung X427m which we had no problems with and NO dropped calls!the only good thing about this phone is the bright screen, but what good is that if the phone doesnt work worth a crap to begin with??NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!
It's your basic phone.It calls, it receives, and keeps a phonebook.It has one game, and the basics of calculator, memo, calendar.The graphics/wallpaper isn't that great, but it's just a cheap phone anyway.It has some cheesy ringtones, rather ridiculous actually seeing as how my friends are always laughing whenever they hear my ringtone.It has a vibrate feature, but you can only use the vibrate feature for two levels: when silent & on vibrate, or when on loudest & on vibrate. Anything in between like on level three ringer, vibrate is unavailable.The mirror on the cover is fairly useless, except for the occasions when you need a quick check for food in your teeth.Yeah, the buttons on the side push easily from vibrate feature to the maximum level, but it doesn't happen too often.Occasionally the screen stays black for 5-10 seconds when the phone is flipped open quickly, which is pretty dumb, seeing as the point of a flip phone is to "flip" open the phone quickly to view the screen. Go figure.The weight of the phone is surprising. Very light. I like the compactness and lightness of it. A big plus.The phone responds about 3-5 seconds from when you push a button. It's a little aggravating.The earpiece is rather irritating too. You always have to smash the earpiece against your ear to hear someone screaming from the other end. In turn, you must scream into the mouthpiece to have the other party hear you. And if you're wondering, it's not the service quality. I tested it with my old Nokia 3595, where I can hear perfectly fine and whisper and have the other party hear me.The battery life has been okay for the past 1 and 1/2 years I've had this phone. Sometimes the battery lasts a long time, but other times, the battery drains for no apparent reason.Regarding signal, I receive about 1/2 the signal on the LG than what I receive on my old Nokia 3595.
the battery standby lifetime last only 1 day! it is practicallyuseless.
I really don't understand all the negativity about  this cell phone.By far, the best one I've ever had. I have had mine for six months now, and I have not suffered from any of rhe problems others have listed. This phone is reliable, powerful, and virtually indestructible. I have dropped this thing numerous times, (Blind folks tend to do that) and it hasn't quit on me yet.The volume is loud and clear. I have NEVER dropped a call, with it. In fact, I can get calls on this thing WITHOUT the antenna!If you want a simple, powerful cell phone, unfettered by bells and whistles, this one rocks!
I got this phone 2 weeks ago and I love it I have not had a problem with it and I get a great signal so I don't know what all the dissing is aboutITS A GREAT phone, and I charge it 1 a week!!!
The phone can ding up a little easier than what I am use to with cell phones. But overall, I am pretty sastified with this one. I love how small it is and how I can stuff it in a pocket or purse, or even just carry it around in my hand. The ring tones selection is good and the vibration is good as well. Most cell phones I can never use on vibrate, because I simply do not notice when the phone rings. This little sucker will let you know. Not a perfect cell phone, but no where close to being the worst I have ever owned over the last 11 years!
This phone is the worst and most expensive phone I have ever owned (I got it before it was free).  It has horrible reception and it drops calls left and right especially in areas of higher density.  The clarity of almost all my calls is incredibly bad.  It scrathes very easily.  Vibrate only works on the loudest ring or no ring (nothing's wrong with it, that's just the way the phone is) and the ring tones are very hard to hear unless you pick one of the loud annoying ones.  It doesn't tell me when I have voicemail messages.  Voicemail doesn't work half the time.  There's no voice recorder or loud speaker.  You can't see the screen in the sunlight.  Speed dial is a pain because you can't press the number then the call button, you HAVE to hold the key down, which doesn't sound like much, but if you've had a phone that worked differently, it's annoying.  There's no snooze on the alarm.  The sim card takes forever to load when you turn on the phone.  The battery life is so short if you talk a lot (Four hours talk time).  I'm a college student and my phone is my main source of calls and I have to charge this phone almost every day and I have to take the phone charger with me even if I'm gone just for the weekend.  I'm very unhappy with this phone.  I wouldn't even get an LG again.
This phone is not worth the money they charge for it. The voice message never worked right. The volume buttons were on the side of the phone so I was always turning it down to where I couldn't here it on accident. But the worst part is having a contract with cingular. I had a problem with the voicemail so I called their service number and waited 30 min just to speak to someone and they didn't even fix the problem. And they were charging me minutes to talk to them. My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up. Now Cingular wants the phones, manuals, chargers and box back or they will charge us $250 each phone which is outragous. I of course don't have the box or manual. This phone and cingular are not worth the trouble and expense.
This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna "upgrade". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone.
-I've had this phone for about one year. I've hated it since week one.-It's a bit too small (which I suppose some might like)-I get dropped calls all the time (Cingular)(I never had a problem with that on my OLD Nokia)-the volume can never be turned up enough-the ear piece is worthless-the buttons on the side are a pain because they get pushed and it changes it to silent mode etc.There was a recall on the orginal antenna. I had mine replace with the "upgrade" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone. It makes me wonder why Cingular would put thier name on a horrible phone.....oh yeah, they don't care about thier customers.
This phone is horrible. I live in the middle of a big city and i dont get reception in my own house. People sound gargled and like their in a tunnel. The mirror on the front get scratched way to easily. I think the only thing cingular was thinking of when the made this phone was the size. it is the worst phone i have ever owned. DONT BUY IT. Its a waste of money. Find a better phone that might be bigger, but at least u will be able to talk on it. :( I wish i could give it lower than a 1 as a rating. I would give it a -5.
This is the worst phone I have ever had.  The speaker is terrible.  You have to shove it into your ear to hear anything, even after you have turned the volume all the way up.  After having it for 3 MONTHS, the screen went blank and I couldn't see anything.  Luckily, Cingular sent me a new one.  However, the battery would only last for about two days with the new one, and I had to buy a new battery.  The buttons on the side are a pain because they will get pushed inside your pocket and make the phone beep and go out of silent mode.  Very annoying. So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT!!!
My fiance and I both purchased one of these phones about a year ago. My screen went completely black about two-three months ago and now his is slowly fading. The phone still works fine, but forget about reviewing missed calls, viewing your phone book, changing your ringtone....it is pretty much a useless phone. I thought my phone was an accident, but now that his is non-functioning I know it is LG's fault. Don't waste your money, you will need to replace it.
it gets horrible reception except in the most covered area. i live less than a mile from a major shopping center with a tower and i get no reception standing in my front yard. i have to call three or four times before my call goes through because i get "network busy" or "call ended" signals incessantly. ive had it for less than 6 months and the screen is very loose at the hinge. the buttons lose their spring action quickly and several of the buttons backlighting have already begun to fade.poor signalpoor designpoor qualityminimum of featuresand it cost me $180 without signing up for another two years on my contract.
Both me adn my mom bought this phone about 6 months ago.  She's had her's replaced once already because the screen woulnd't come on.  Neither of the phones ever get good reception, with an average of 2 bars, which quickly disapear if the phone is lifted to the ear.
Just buy it unlocked, save some dough.  Its not worth signing up for, but if you need a replacement cheap, then this is it.  Also, LG managed to make the menu system kind of easy to navigate.  My new R3 should be so lucky as to have a "clear" button.
Where to begin?I've had the charging problems that others have mentioned. Also, the phone sometimes just turns itself off. Very convenient when you're expecting an important call. The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung.
I have the LG C1300.. the design is good but it is too small, and that idle light i hate.. the ringtone quality is real tones & mulitimedia is ok and text is the very best.. it can handle text better than anyother phone that i have had. the battery when i talk on my phone in an average weekend it lasts me the whole weekend and i stay on the phone for a total of 42 hours in the eqlivent of text and net and that sort.. and the call quality is not really that all awesome some days i can call out and sometimes i cant cause the phone is weird and in a 5 bar place i cant call out sometimes and it has been doing that too me since i got the phone.. and my quote "ALL-in-ALL" opinon is be careful when you choose that phone there a more downs than there is ups with that phone. so i would like to say that i warn you not to get that phone..
I've had the 1300i from Cingular for about a month now, and I love it! Everything is perfect about it, including the text messaging, internet, and LCD display. The only problem I've had with it is that I have had a couple dropped calls, but I barely have reception in my room anyway, so thats why. but GREAT phone!
I just got this phone last week from Cingular. I got it for $29.99 which I thought was a good price. I don't care much for Cingular. I am an old AT&T; customer. I don't always get my messages on it. I have tried to register it with AOL mobile and I still have not gotten my confrim message yet. I don't like the side buttons I am always hitting them. Otherwise I like it so far.
i got this phone about 3 months ago with cingular. i got one of those "go phones". my previous phone was a tmobile nokia 3595, i decided to go to cingular because tmobile did not have any service at my school. so far im happy with the phone but not cingular, my phone is out of minutes within 2 weeks when it should be 4, on my old phone it was 10 cents per txt message & im, and it was free to recive, cingular is 5 cents to send 5 cents to recive, at first i thought that was ok until i signed onto aim on my phone, i went on my computer and talked to my friends i felt my phone vibrate and it alerted me that i had used 5 cents, these messages kept coming for every message that i had sent on the computer, with my tmobile phone it would foward the ims to my cell but it would not charge me cause i did not use my phone i used my computer. also i had went upstate and i was roaming, since i had a prepaid plan i couldnt make or recive calls, with my tmobile i never roamedPros: downloadable games graphics and ringtones, can do everything a plan can do (prepaid plans), good service,Cons: Expensive, charges you a cent per gigabyte on internet, cant make calls when roaming (prepaid)
I purchased two of these phones at a discounted price when I signed up for a Cingular plan. Both phones are already broken and I have only had them for 6 months. My wife's phone had the corner of the phone crack and then break off making it hard to open the face without having the screen slip out of the hing. My phones screen just got a great big blob of color in the middle so I can't read anything on the screen. The phone was great while they worked, light weight, easy to use, good ring and opptions... I'm just not happy that it lasted only 6 months. If you do buy this phone be sure to get insurance since it will probably break at some point.
I have had this phone for about 5 months now and its had problems since the beginning within one day of having it the hindges started to sqeak on and off. About a month ago i could make absoutly no calls because their was a signal problem. and just a couple of days ago my volume got screwed up and now it can't go past level 3, which is VERY hard to hear. Another thing about this phone is the ringer it cannot be turned off ascending so you cant hear the ringtone untill about 20sec later. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE
C1300i is the upgraded version with better reception now. Just got it so no comment on the battery life but one of the web review praise the battery life and reception.This one I just got has a bad text LCD screen that is hard to read but the graphic screen is bright and clear. Weird.Will go back to Cingular store to get it fixed or exchanged.
This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! I too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. The most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. I swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND GET THIS PHONE! UPGRADE!
I am actually on my second phone because the other just stopped working. Sometimes it would not allow me to touch certain keys, so I sent it back to Cingular. I thought the problem would be resolved after I got a new phone, but I was wrong. Now sometimes when I go to use the phone I will try to dial out and it will say EMERGANCY ONLY and all bars are full for reception. Another thing it does is go off on it's own. It also takes a long time to read the sim card when turned on about a minute. Another issue is the ring tones are verylow on sound so I hardly ever hear it ring unless on vibrate and it's in my pocket. Sometimes to phone will alert me of a voice mail message but no list of missed call. Or it will ring a half hour later informing me of a message received when I have another call. I hate this phone so much. Sometimes when it does not allow me to call out I will open up the battery back and reinsert the sim card then it all of a sudden works or I will hit it against my hand and it will work. This Phone is a curse do not get it. My coworker has this phone and she has the same problems. I can't believe I paid $129. on this dam phone.
I have had this phone for about a year and I love it. But it is so small I lose it occastionly but it is my own fault.;) My parents have the same phone too and they love it to.
my only complaint about this phone is that the screen is very sensitive to scratches. Within a week of ownership, I counted a  tottal of six scratches from the keypad when I closed it. other than that, this phone is awesome!
i have this phone, but in the prepaid version. It is the cingular GO PHONE. I have some likes and even more dislikes of this phone. In prepaid version, it only has one game, spaceball. Which is just SNAKE with a different name. It says you can go on the different types of instant messangers, use the internet, and download different graphics, tones & games. but that is not true. every time i go to use any of them .. it always say GPRS not found. i have no clue waht that means, but i guess prepaid versions were ripped off with the choice of internet and pretty much all fun, if any, with this fone. This fone has good quality ringers, only 1 or 2 good backrounds. HORRIBLE reception. every time i try calling my friends out on my bike or something, i have to jam the fone up to my ear just to hear them. it has vibrate which is good for when im in class, because my parents always tell me to turn off my fone is school, but when you turn it off, if anyone calls, you wont be able to see missed calls if its turned off so i just keep it on.it has .. i think 20 ringtones. theyre ok. it has speed dial. but no voice dial and no voice recorder :( also no speaker :(it does have 255 fone book entries available and i think it has like 3 way calling and call waiting so thts ok. so yeh i guess i wood reccommend this fone .. but now let me recap all the things this fone dont have SPEAKERFONE, VOICE DIALING, VOICE RECORDER, INTERNET, RINGTONE,GRAPHIC,GAME AND MULTIMEDIA DOWNLOAD, CAMERA, VIDEO CAMERA, ughh i dont know why i even got this fone but yeah thats all the things it doesnt have so there ya go. and if you want good reception, dont get this fone !!
I recieved this phone as a bonus from Cingular to upgrade to a family plan.  This is by far the worst reception on a cell phone that I've had in the 10 or so years I've been using cell phones.  I can't use it at all inside my house.  Even when I'm driving and I'm getting a strong signal sometimes I can't make out what the other person is saying.  I feel like crushing this phone sometimes.  I have had people call me 3 or 4 times and I never know about it and than they will get through to me and say that they've been trying to call me and while we are talking it will notify me that I've missed 3 calls.  Unbelievable!!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
This phone is alright, It scratches up though, and it has a weak signal in general, It's a good phone, just for calling people like at school, on trips, calling mom or dad and for calling friends. I only got it cause It was free.
This is a very good phone.  Mine has been through the washing machine twice and it still works.  The volume could be a little louder, but that's my only complaint.
at school some moron stole phone(nokia 3595) right out of my backpack in woodshop.so after being yelled at by my parents i took my christmas money with my dad to the cingular store. right away this cell phone was push on my dad. with in a heart beat we came out with this phone. first the reception sucks with this phone it has a low battery life and i feal like ill crush it but as far as a phone goes its okay
I've used this phone for 1 month.  I like it so far.Pros:1. The battery life is good.  One charge lasts 5 days for me.  I don't talk much though.2. This phone does not come with good ringtones.  But you can buy one with average $2 from Cingular or Samsung website.  Samsung's Samsung Fun site also has a few free ringtones.3. The reciption and the charging time are acceptable.4. People in the phonebook can be assigned to different user groups, and each group can have its own ringtone set.5. Just dial "1" to connect to your voicemail box.  Pre-set for me, at least.  You can set yourself too.6. Hold on "#" to turn the whole phone in silent mode, an easy thing to do before a meeting.  And the same action brings all previous settings back.7. Speed-dial list is seperate from the phone book.  My previous phones are like the first 9 numbers in the phone book are speed dial numbers.  This phone is like you can pick a person/number from your phone book to fill in a speed-dial position.Cons:1. No camera, if that's what you want.  I don't need that though.2. You have to open the clip to see the time.  And the time is in small font, unless you select "Digital Clock" wallpaper.3. Not related to this phone though, customer support guys in Cigular are mostly not very knowledgeable.  Don't ask them questions other than your plan or bill.4. The big Cingular GPRS connection button is quite annoying, if you are not going to use this phone to connect to the internet.  The review below about setting it to an unexisting profile is gold.  Detailed steps: Menu -> My MEdia -> MEdia Net -> Settings, pick those unset ones, like "Profile4 Info", and Select.5. Once a phone is fully charged, there is no message like "Charge Completed".6. You can not set individual alerts.  Like I don't want to hear the annoying alert when a batterying is running out, but I do want to hear an alert if I get a text message.  No, I cannot do that.  I have to turn all alerts off.7. No IR port.8. The earphone has some contact problem.  (Maybe only mine.)
I got this phone as a replacement for my venerable and trusty Siemens S46. I'll comment solely on -the phone- and not on the service (which has been fine).Good points:- Fantastic screen- Good to excellent reception- Fairly simple menu navigation* (note caveats below)- Included applications, media, games, etc. are high quality- Very thin and light, even with battery- Excellent battery life (5-7 days on standby)Bad points:- The button configuration on this phone is very strange - maybe this is just due to the Cingular configuration, but I keep thinking the largest button (with the Cingular logo) should be "Dial" by default, when instead it is inexplicably mapped to flip over to GPRS mode.- The phonebook lookup is -awful-.- There is no copy to/from SIM card feature. This means that if you want to, say, copy phonebook entries without buying the USB cable, you have to enter them by hand.- The headset jack is very hard to open and suffers from a loose connection and static.- The keys have no raised dots to center yourself without looking at the phone - while hard to describe, this makes it very hard to dial the phone with one hand, something which I have been able to easily do with most other phones.
I got this phone for my daughter as an added line on family plan(free from Cingular, because I bought the Motorola V551 from Amazon as the main phone line), and it is perfect for her use(she is 15.) Seems solid, very very lightweight, nice bright screen, good sound, and better signal than my motorola! The battery life is EXCELLANT! My motorola burns out before a day is over, hers goes for days. However, very litte features, which is ok for someone like her. No camera of course, but she didnt want one. Not very customizable. Cant change what is assigned to the buttons(like I can on my phone) and I hate how the middle and the right arrow buttons connect to media or the internet. I put an internet block on her phone from Cingular(customer service), but she was still able to access the media mall and was browsing ringtones before I realized, and made her stop! The data transfer costs!Comes with a few games, mine had one demo game. More wallpaper choices than mine as well. Cant view who's calling or the time from outside of phone when closed. We set the option to not answer when opened, so we arent answering calls we dont know who it is first. All in all, pretty nifty phone, simple, easy to use, one touch to write a text message, and other simple menu features.Buttons are flat, as are mine, but if looking at it(to type text message) not a problem, but if in a prompt command on a call, have to move it from ear to see what numbers I am pressing. All accessories are cheaper here at Amazon versus anywhere else.
I like the big screen.Great color.Great sound.Sturdy.I think this phone is quality.  I like it.I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a speaker phone  but it's a good phone and I wouldn't change it.-correction, if you go through Cingular, you can get voice activated dialing.  However, are you too lazy to just dial the number or use the phonebook?  Besides, they charge for that and it's just not worth it.I've had it for about six months, and it's been a good phone.  I haven't had any issues with it.  Battery life is fairly well, sturdy.  I was told that you can never ever drop it in water or get it even a little bit wet.  Several people I know who own this phone have told me they ended up replacing it.Now, if you want to find a phone that is very sturdy, check out Siemens.  I washed one through a full cycle and it still works!Again-do not submerge in water.  Do not drop while raining.  Do not use while raining. Do not use with wet hands, whatever you do, keep water away from this phone. It may still work, but there could be issues with this phone once it is wet, and you'll want to replace it.If you are seriously looking for a phone that will last, check out Siemens.  Ecspecially the blue/silver one that T-Mobile has.  It worked after going through an entire wash cycle.  Just used a blow-dryer and a dry sock and it was like new! :)
I have the Samsung X427M and a plan with CINGULAR. I have had a few phones in the past on my cingular plan and this phone is, by far, the worst. If you cannot hear the person you are talking to on the other end and they cannot hear you, what good is the phone?If I could give this item 0 stars, I would. Cingular needs to revamp its network and test the phones it carries.Jon
Total, utter, complete junk. Trash. Rubbish. Garbage. No one can EVER hear me on the phone, its always "hey man, you're cutting out" even when the damed thing shows 6 bars! And I live in NYC/North Jersey area where there's a million towers. This is the lowest quality piece of trash I've ever owned. Avoid it at all costs. I just called Cingualar today (11/28/05) and they've had many complaints about this model's recpetion, etc., they're sending me a brand new Nokia 6102 for free, as this piece of crap was still under warranty. The warranty rep at Cingular told me its a problem w/ the phones software- apparently Samsung didn't mfg. the phone to the right specs or something. Good riddance, I'll never purchase another Samsung product for as long as I live after putting up w/ this thing for 4 months.
I got this phone as part of a rebate deal, trading in my trusty T-mobile service (and venerable black and white Motorola V66) for this shiny colour phone with Cingular's "More bars in more places" network.In both regards I've been disappointed.The Samsung x427m phone, first of all, does not come with an earpiece. This fairly inexpensive addition would have added tremendously to it's usefulness, and assuaged fears about radiation (see below).The phone has a tendency to interfere with speakers; I can only guess that it emits more radiation, such that it provides sufficient signal to drive the speakers. As it stands, it is aesthetically a minor annoyance to hear the speakers buzz occasionally when you bring it within 10 feet of a speaker, but the hidden health problems could be more serious. I am sure it is within the legal limits for radiofrequency emissions, but it still a little disconcerting nonetheless.You would think with increased emissions you would get better signal quality, but that is not the case here. Roughly 10% of my calls have to be redialed because for some reason or other the reception is so poor I can't make out what the other party is saying. Occasionally my voice gets so distorted over the phone that my friends cannot recognise my voice.The phone itself is not particularly user-friendly. It is not simple to save a number to the phone if someone dials using a new number to you. The number shows up, but there is no option to simply "add" the number to your phonebook. You need to retype it in to add it under an existing or new entry.The ringtones are either annoying or barely audible. I have missed quite a few calls because my phone was in a jeans pocket, and the material absorbed the sound. If you listen carefully though the music is quite nice.There are some good points about the phone. The games are quite neat; the chess is way too easy, but otherwise the games are quite playable. The battery lasts for quite a long time; it'll probably last 5 days with light use. The phone feels pretty solid and I've dropped it a few times without much consequence.Overall though this is a phone to give to your school-age kids. It won't make too much noise to disrupt classes, as you can muffle it with clothes, it doesn't have a camera so you won't worry about the issues associated with that. The interface is sufficiently cumbersome that you can enter the numbers permitted for dialing, and not worry too much about your child adding all of their friends. It looks nice enough that your kids won't look like they're carrying a brick or some obsolete product to school. It's light enough that it won't overload their schoolbag, and doesn't need to be plugged in every night so they can be a little lazy about maintenance. It's cheap enough that if you lose it, you can just get another one.Just teach them Morse code so that when you can't hear them you can still communicate by pressing the buttons. Oh, and pack a metal helmet to block the radiation. Then you're all set!
I have been browsing the internet for a very long time know to know if this is the right phone for me. My answer was yes,yes,yes!  The polyphonic weird ringtones are what I prefer, actually. I like it because there is no external display, and the whole front of it is a bright, shiny silver colour that makes it look smart. It is very compact especially because it is a "flip" phone. I hate the phones with cameras because it makes it too expensive and plus you get a digital camera seperatly and it would still take way better pictures than a cellphone would. This is the phone of my personality, compatibility and it is the one of my choice. So if I was asked to reccomend a cellphone to someone, my answer would be the X427.
This phone is horrible.  I've had several samsung phones in the past with very few problems.  I read the Amazon reviews and decided the good outweighed the bad and took a leap of faith.  Note to self, I should have not jumped, because I've had nothing but problems with this phone.Problems:*Bad to NO reception*Dropped calls*Unreliable caller i.d.  (when I'm on the phone and someone else calls me, it picks a random number from my phone book as the caller, so I NEVER know who's on the other line).*BAD phoneI would not recommend it to anyone.  If I didn't have a contract w/Cingular, I would end my contract.  The best they can do is to replace the phone with the same one, because I may have gotten one from a bad "batch".  The funny thing about this batch, 3 of my friends w/the same phone, has the same problems.  Now I have to pay the cost to just get a brand new phone, because I'm hating samsung x427's right about now, and not very pleased w/Cingular, who has no solutions to my problem.
Honestly I don't know what everyone is complaing about, the phone works great for me! Maybe I got lucky, not sure, but I have no complaints. The reception isnt the best, but again I live in the mountains and thats normal for us with any phone or carrier. I havent had any dropped calls, ever, the battery is strong, it surfs the web fine, stores my numbers. This phone is excellent for me because all I need is a phone and text messaging.
If Cingular does anything with the X427m, its lowering the bar. I can't describe how much this "complementary" phone sucks. There is nothing I can think of about this phone that is worth buying or even worth receiving as a free gift because it will only bring frustration and disapointment.When i got this phone upon signing the two-year rediculous plan with Cingular, I was not informed that I would be stuck with this cell phone for 2 years, not being able to upgrade without paying the retail price. Cingular customer service is so poor, when i asked to upgrade because i had enough with the X427m, i was suggested a down-grade for $100.If there was a zero id rate this peice of junk with that. This phone has a poor speaker, you cant hear the person your talking to, the service is worse than the Nokia i had 5 years ago, you cant send or save a text message unless you have the full 5 bars, dont even bother trying to download pictures or sounds cause they turn out terrible, and its just not even worth the consideration. The graphics and ringtones already on the phone are ridiculously retarded and sometimes you even have to wait for the phonebook to load.The bottom line is, dont bother getting this phone. I cant even fathom what the engineers were thinking when the made the X427M because it is nothing short of a complete joke. If you get sucked into signing a contract with cingular, i highly recommend investing in a cell phone far from the X427M rack.
In this day and age, it is refreshing to find a simple phone such as this. I don't think I'm alone in feeling that a phone should be a phone, and nothing more. With all the extra features these days (including cameras, movies, bluetooth, etc...) I find this phone's "lack" to be its main plus. The display is crisp and clear, the keypad is very responsive and hasn't worn down after quite a bit of use. Moreover, it is perhaps the most sleek phone on the market (in my humble opinion). The rounded metal exterior is very appealing, and its size makes it even more so.I would comment on reception, however I feel this varies from area to area. That said, I did switch from Verizon and have been getting better reception in three different states so far (VA, PA, and MA).I definitely recommend this phone for people who want simplicity in such a compact form.
This phone*Drops calls*the caller id is innaccurateI also don't recommend Cingular. I have yet to see the benefits of their 'raising the bar' campaign. I experience spotty service and frequent dropped calls even if I am in a Metro area.
I love my little phone. The battery  stays charged. You can hear loud and clear. Cingular is great. DONT get a phone on Cingular online they are totaly useless. Go to the Cingular store and buy it. They know what they are doing.
We just switched to Cingular, b/c Sprint wouldn't give us free phones for re-upping another 2 year contract. I like this phone-- it doesn't get hot like my old dinosaur did. However, the interface is a bit complicated. Why do I have to flip through so many menus to check voice mail, etc?? Also, I have yet to figure out an easy way to turn the ringer off. My old phone had a one-button solution. Guess I'll check the owner's manual.Oh, and the tip from the reviewer below about putting a password on the internet is GOLD.
I have had this phone for about 8 months now and have had no problems with it except the occasional problem with the phone book/caller id.However Cingular sucks.  their saying is raising the bar, well they need to find the darn bar first before they can raise it.  i'm breaking my contract and switching to a provider where i'll get a signal.
I used to have the Samsung x427 (for a year actually).  I was really excited when I first got it, because flip phones are so sleek!  But as the months when on, I learned that the phone was not all it was cracked up to be.  After the first few months of owning the phone, It would just randomly turn off, then back on, for no reason... no problem with the battery being low or anything, just decided to turn off then on again...  that was so annoying!  When I got it over a year ago, Cingular was offering it for free!  It's now at least $50 with a plan!  I would not pay money for this phone!  You'd think that over the year they would offer it for free still, not make it more expensive!  Also, I got my phone with a camera for $50!  The samsung x427 has very few features.  Only plusses:  It's small and very cute and stylish.  That's it though... Not recommended!!!
Overall, I'm very happy with this phone!  I've had it for about 6 weeks now, with no problems.  By far the best thing about it is its size.  You will not find a smaller phone-- or if you do, it'll cost $200 rather than FREE.  I'm a girl, so being able to fit my phone into my front pants pocket has in the past been difficult.  No such problems with this phone!  The web wriststrap that comes with it makes it even easier to retrieve from my pockets or purse.  Reception has been normal-- nothing spectacular but all my calls are basically clear.  The menus make sense and are easy to navigate without much trouble.  The few games that are included are pretty fun, but the one thing I can't stand about this phone is the ringtones.  They're awful.  Absolutely terrible.  There's even one of a CAT MEOWING.  I'm too cheap to buy more, though, so I have my phone set to the generic old-school kitchen telephone ring.  It's funny because it sounds really real so everyone gets confused because it's a cell phone, not a regular phone...  And one other thing: all phone book entries must include the area code to show up properly in caller ID.  I think that's kind of lame.Anyway, I really have no significant complaints about the phone.  It's overall a really good little phone.
This phone was great to start off with. But after about 3 1/2 months the phone started to drop calls every so often. Now 1 month later it is dropping calls very frequently. Sometimes with five bars the call just dissconects. I know it's not Cingular the Motorola v551 in the same exact spot is still crystal clear. Do your self a favor stay away from the x427m. If you buy Cingular try to get the v551 from [...] and you will get a great quality phone for free! (P.S.-This phone shouldnt even have 1 star)
As others have mentioned, the caller ID on this phone is very unreliable. It will display random names from my phonebook instead of the actual caller every few calls.Although this is annoying, the customer service from Cingular is worse. I have been sent to about three stores. I have been put on hold for over 20 minutes at a time when I call the warranty office. I have been sent a new phone with the exact same problem. I have gotten a new SIM card, which did not solve the problem. AND, since I was given a new SIM card, the woman who helped me "killed" the original, therefore deleting my entire phonebook. I had to re-enter everyone I know manually.This phone, although it is very cute and has a handful of good features, really is a pain in the butt.
This phone lasted two months before it the horrible reception forced me to get a new phone. What can I say cingular costs far too much for the terrible service.DO NOT GET THIS PHONE
this phone is so awsome it has all you need and all the latyest gagets and stuff so buy it and its cheep
Ok look I have to Sell Cingular wireless Im the Anoying guy that calls you and trys to set you up with a plan and a phone. FIRST things first, the most reliable network . The biggest joke in the world. second your all getting ripped off on those phones The smasung is really only Worth 20$ but you guys are paying 49$ for itWe basically work like this, WE AT CINGULAR DO NOT LIE ABOUT THE SERVICE , WE CANT HELP THEY DIDNT ASK.... me I have T mobile Its the best. SO DO NOT GET CINGULAR WIRELESS>>>>>>
The speaker is fine. I dont agree with all the whining about the speaker. It may not be the best speaker out there, but it works just fine. Sleek and stylish, lots of nice features, great user interface, very intuitive. Super lightweight and has a really nice front display. All in all, a nice phone.
Okay, so I started reading reviews AFTER I purchased this phone. Seeing all of the "horrible sound quality!" comments, I was pretty nervous. And I had a reason to be. The sound quality on this phone is awful! I don't think it has anything to do with Cingular or reception, as I've never had problems with cingular before. I just can't hear anything on this phone and what I do hear is muffled and distorted. My friends are tired of me saying, "What did you say?" over and over again and they can't even hear me half the time. Also, I've had several instances of the phone "freezing up" on me. I'll have to remove the battery to get it to start working again.It's a great looking little phone and the camera is pretty cool and fun to mess around with - but in the end, it is a phone. When you can't use a phone for it's main purpose, you have some problems. Samsung should have put a little more time and effort into the speaker instead of into all the little options that don't really matter much.
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it. the sound/reception is terrible, you have a hard time hearing the people you're talking to. already i've had problems with the phone "freezing up." when turning the phone on/off it will just get hung playing the start/end animation song. also sometimes when just talking on the phone you can turn it off by lightly touching the hang-up button. i orginally went into the store to purchase the samsung p207 put the representative talked me out of it.
I purchased this phone when signing another contract deal with Cingular. It was relatively cheap (about $60 with a 2-year contract). This was about three months ago. I've already gotten rid of the phone earlier last month.I could not make calls with this phone. Not that it wouldn't dial up numbers, but I could not make out anything being said by the person on the other line. Horrible reception indoors and out. I live in the Las Vegas area and always had a great signal but no matter how many bars were showing, my reception was still bad. Only once did I have a decent call. Cingular has great service and considering the area I live in... only shows this phone is a bad choice on reception.Other then that, there are a lot of neat things about the phone. It looks great, is very light-weight (was amazed at how light it was), has many minor but useful features, picture quality was decent and cool additions like digital borders and different shooting modes.The color screen was small for my taste but none-the-less very nice. Vivid colours. Text was easily readable. I could not customize the home screen as much as I would've liked. Included wallpapers were boring, even though animated at all times. Being able to change the display text colour can be cool but pretty much useless. Would've prefered to been able to change the skin colours. External screen is wonderful. Shows everything you need to see in the same vivid colours as the internal screen. External screen blacks out after a few seconds though. They should've made it, at least, show the time indefinitely.The numbers on the keypad are easy to use and easy to see. The navigation dial in the upper middle is a little difficult. Often times I ended up pressing numbers when trying to use the dial. Buttons on the sides of the camera are small, but easy to use and provide a little added help with shortcutting.Menus are easy to navigate, can customize the way it appears in three ways. Ringtones included are as boring as the wallpapers so plan on purchasing your own ringtones. Games included are all right but hard to play with a keypad.Samsung made it relitively easy to use this phone. Anyone young to old should not have a problem getting to understand it. I never had to pick up the manual except for the one time when trying to learn how to use the external screen as a camera viewfinder.As said before, camera has decent quality. The colours come out a little faded, but they look better then any previous phone I've had. You can choose many different colour modes (sepia, black and white, emboss, negative, etc.)... a selection of digital borders to add around your photos. Day and night shooting modes (not much difference between), vertical and horizontal shooting, shot series (which enables you to shoot multiple photos quickly in a row (did not like this feature because it made pictures very small). Multiple zoom and brightness/contrast features work well. The funnest camera I've experienced on a cell phone.My favourite feature was the service light (tiny light on the outside lid) that would flash continuously whenever I've received a call, message, or voicemail. If I was away from the phone for a period of time and it was silent, the service light would let me know I need to check it by flashing a lot. Would like to see this done on more phones.The casing of the phone will catch eyes. It size will too. Often people said the phone was very nice looking. I liked the added black touch on the front. Casing scratches easily, though. Will begin to look cheap over a short period of time. The battery IS the back cover, which I absolutely hated because if I lose a battery, I don't want to lose a back cover either. Stupid decision on Samsung in my opinion. They placed the headset jack on the top of the phone for easy usage. Phone closes very securely and does not bang up the phone or keypad while doing so.Sound quality is not great. Volume does not sound high on the highest setting. You'll have to make sure to be in a quiet place.I gave this phone a two star rating because of the reception problems (mainly) and volume. I couldn't make calls so I got rid of it. Not everyone has this problem obviously, but Samsung phones are known for their reception difficulties. So, please keep that in mind while purchasing this phone.It is a wonderful phone for early teens. Adults, business men and women, gadget lovers, stay away.
ok let me start by saying this phone looks great the features are great....but i bought this phone about 35 days ago and have had to exchange it 3 times through warrenty already 3 times!!!! for the following reasons.1) first phone would not stay connected, 2)second phone would power off and i would have to take the battery out and put it back in to get it to power back on 3)it allways gave me problems connecting to voice mail and to text messages and dropping calls, let me explain this i live in a spot with full bars other famially memebers do not have this problem. i fell in love with this phone when i seen it but after 3 faulty phones i will never purchase a samsung phone again, i swithed to the motorolla v551 and love this phone no problems with connectivity i miss the color screen on the front but hey i bought this phone for talking not admiring its looks, i hope this helps you choosing a phone but if i were you and you were debating on this phone i would say be verry weary.oh yeah almost forgot to point this out ....you cant hear squat on this phone in a quite space witht he volume all the way up....my convos on this phone was asking what? what did you say?
I previously had the Samsung E105, with a hands-free kit and everything.  When I got this E317, I expected to be able to use the hands-free kit with it; however, the E317 has a different connection jack, so I had to buy another hands-free kit.The menu navigation is fairly good too, but definitely not quite as easy as I thought.  The menus seem to be promoting the use of shopping for ringtones and the like, so the first menu item you get is the MEdia mall instead of something more useful like Recent Calls.I have to admit that the external screen would be more useful if it stayed on all the time like on the E105.  The phone comes with a rather small selection for ringtones (hence the Shop for Ringtones options?) and wallpapers.  I'd definitely suggest a connection cable to transfer your own ringtones or buy them from Cingular, whichever one gets you the ones that you really want.The camera on the phone is not really good; I find that the colors are a little over-saturated.  Then again, this is a camera on a phone, so don't expect insane colors and resolution.  The button on the right side of the phone is useful for taking pictures of yourself, but honestly, is more of a nuisance than a good option; it's easy to press-and-hold this button while it's in your pocket and you end up with a bunch of black pictures in your picture album.On the up-side, however, the phone is fairly customizable, much like all Samsung phones are.  Keypad tones, ringtones (when you've got the ones you want), wallpapers (likewise), text colors, even pictures and text for the external id as well.Overall, the usage is quite good. I have no idea what the other reviewers are getting so riled up about (sound quality is not crystal clear, I admit, but not so bad that I'd return the phone - it's really not that noticeable, unless you're nit-picky).  Definitely a good deal if you get it for free, but it's almost a unit that you have just to tide you over until the next best thing.
I like this phone. Its small and light with a nice look and color. The volume could be a bit higher. Im not noticing all the problems others complain about while I do agree the volume in the speaker should go a big higher. The motorola v551 is too heavy of a phone to expect to want to keep for a year or more.
I got this after accidentally dunking my Moto V551 in a cup of coffee (which, judging from V551 reviews and my boyfriend's experience with his V551, was probably a blessing).I'll admit I was sold by the external color screen. I also had a Samsung previously and was very happy with that phone - it "lived" for 2.5 years, brought me through contract and when it did finally crap out it was just the display that died, the actual phone still made and received calls.So kudos to Samsung for making reliably good phones.This phone does just fine for the basics - it has good reception, I never drop calls, sound is on the quiet side but still reasonable. The phone book works is easy to use. The display is bright and the color is vivid. Buttons give good "click" feedback when pressed and menus are reasonably well organized. Charges well, except good luck finding a replacement charger besides ordering another Samsung one (see 3rd party accessories below comment below). Everything *basic* works as it should.It's the *extras* where the phone starts to lose points. First, the camera SUCKS. The V551 was crap overall but at least the camera was decent. The E317 has a VGA camera and it's very hard to get a picture you can actually see anything in. Then again, if you want to take pics I suppose you should be using a digital camera, and not your phone.Another gripe I have with the camera function is the external button that activates the camera. Considering the camera is crap this is probably a superfluous feature anyway (you're not gonna go around whipping out your phone to take pics), but it's especially annoying because I am constantly having to delete pictures of the inside of my purse. This also drains the battery.The games are all right - a bejeweled clone, a pipeline linking game, golf and chess.The ringtones blow. Only one "normal" ringing sound, the rest are music-like tones that WOULD sound okay except for bizarre sound effects that are inserted - birds, people cheering, cats meowing...Finally, it BUGS ME TO NO END that Samsung phones do not take 3rd party accessories.So:**GOOD**-Good reception - haven't dropped a call yet-Solid phone-Decent volume in calls-Good color display-Decent menus-Okay games**BAD**-Sucky camera-Annoying external camera button activates camera when you don't want it-Horrid ringtone selection-Can't use 3rd party accessories!Overall I expect this phone to be as reliable and longlived as my last Samsung phone, which I was very happy with. If you want a decent phone that's small and has a cool color screen, but don't care so much about the camera and other bells and whistles, this is a good choice.A note about Cingular - it's a fine carrier unless you actually need to call customer service. They're only around business hours Mon-Sat I believe, and quality of the service is VERY variable. If you don't get a satisfactory answer you can call a few more times and you might be able get someone who can actually help you. This has actually happened to me - I had a billing issue and called 3 times. The first I was dropped while on hold. The second I was told the CS person would "leave a msg" for her supervisor and I would be contacted within 72 hrs. I thought, fat chance, and called a 3rd time. I got a very helpful CS who solved my problem in 5 mins right over the phone. This aspect of the CS may be good or bad depending on your point of view. Me, I can't wait till contract is up so I can go back to T-Mobile.
I have used this phone for about three months and It is such an improvement reception wise over the LG phone I had used. It also takes fairly good pictures. I took it to a recent concert and I was pretty close to the stage but I got great shots. My only complaint is that the volume control is on the side so while the flip feature protects from accidental calls I do sometimes hit the button and turn my phone up or down without knowing it.
I replaced a high-end previous generation nokia with this phone based primarily on its small size.The good:*Size. This phone fits easily in my pocket. I had a tiny nokia and this phone was the only flip phone at the Cingular store that was nearly as narrow.*Signal. I find the signal coverage to be slightly better on this phone than my nokia (despite cingular's advice to the contrary).*Battery life. I go a few days between charges. The phone seems to charge quickly, too.*Usability. I thought it would take time to get used to something other than my nokia but the menus were easy to use.The OK:*Camera. The camera is not great in low light, but is fine overall. One annoyance is the camera can be turned on using an external button. I've taken the occasional picture of my pocket. Also, you can't seem to get rid of the camera's shutter sound (I haven't looked that hard, but it wasn't obvious).*Sound quality. I think sound quality is lower on this phone than on my old nokia. I can hear people fine, but there is a little bit of distortion, like you might hear if you turned your stereo up too loud. It seems to help to keep the volume down a little and/or to tilt the phone slightly away from my ear. Like most phones there are volume buttons on the side of the phone so its easy to adjust.*Customization. I don't feel like I have as much control over ringing patterns, displays, etc. as I did on my nokia. Still, those are the kinds of things you get used to.The bad:There are really no deal-breakers for me on this phone. So far its been a good deal.Overall a very capable phone. I'm enjoying it.
ive had this phone for about a day and so far the sound quality is just AWESOME! it was so great, i could just put the phone on my desk and i could hear it jsut fine. So i dont know if i happened to get a good phone out of the bad ones that people are tlaking about or if samsung has improved it or not in the past weeks? months? (i dont know how long this phone has been in the market)but the hands free microphone is annoying, it does not come standard with the phone, and its not a standard hands free plug, so you're forced to buy their mic.the package did not come with a holster thing either, and the instruction manual takes up about the whole the box, but whatever.overall, the phone is awesome, i love it so far =]
Had the Phone on cingular serves for five days now bought the 317 for my self and the samsung 427m for MY Daughter took mine back to day because the sound quality is so bad, had to ask the other person to repeat them selves most of the time. My Daughters 427m sounded great good sound quailty so I traded my 317 for the 427m. the only thing I miss is the front display
The sound quality is horrible!  I purchased my brand new samsung e317 on ebay.  I first assumed that the seller had jipped me.  Reading these reviews, now I know differently.  If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased a different phone.
I have had the Samsung e317 flip phone for about eight months now. Its capabilities  include Text Messaging, Multimedia Messaging, Ring tones, Games, and Photos. This phone has a screen on the front which can be set to show photo caller ID (which I really enjoy). It is small and compact, and have a exceptionally good camera providing you are not taking far away photos (but I have found this to be the case with all picture phones). The only complaint I have about the design of this phone it that the photo button is on the outside of the phone...thus I have about 43 pictures of the blackness inside my purse.  The battery hold its charge exceptionally well. Truthfully, I don't use my phone all that much during the day, but it is always on -- and I rarely have to charge it. The e317 gets the best reception of any flip phone I have owned. Overall I would highly recommend this phone if you are in the market for a descent flip phone with a few extra "bells and whistles", but are no interested in spending a lot.
Hi.  Just upgraded my cell service and got this phone.  I've had it for two days.  I'm wearing levi's jeans today and the camera starts up and takes pictures (in my pocket!).If you keep your phone in your pants pocket, don't buy this phone!I'm on the phone with cingular right now exchanging my phone.
well i got this phone in early march of this year and i over all really like this phone. the things i would like it to have are to be able to take videos, even though it makes up for it by holding up 70 something pictures. the camera quality could be better and i wish it had a flash. the black on the front of the phone is cool but after having a case on it it got marked up. ive never had a disconnected call before. but when you buy music ringtones its kinda fuzzy, but i think all phones do that. i think this phone is more for younger people but to those who are picky about little things than you might like it but whatever. i think it's a really good phone though.
I'd have to say that i'm in love with this phone. I recently received it last week, and can't stop playing around with it. For starters, the external display on front of the folder is great. You can choose what color you want it to be, and it has a neat little service light on it as well. Once you open the folder, the screen size is pretty good. The buttons and layout are nothing differen than you average clamshell phone, but that's ok. The softkeys are nice. As for the features, the phone is incredible. Theres too many things you can do to write down, so I won't go into detail. However, let me just say that once you connect to Cingular's MEdia Net, you will be hooked. Lastly, as far as everyone talking about the poor sound quality, just buy the additional earpiece(probably best to get it in the 3 piece travel package) and you should be hearing fine again.
Why Cingular continues to sell this phone is beyond me?  Surely Samsung had to know what a terrible phone they were putting on the market.  The main problem is clarity.  There is so much distortion that I really have a tough time understanding what people are saying.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
Volume/speaker is indequate.  Phone is NOT as teeny as predecessor 307.  "Many different ringtones" equates to exactly 11.PATHETIC.
It's a lot cheaper to use than any postpaid plan if you're a casual cell phone user. I make about 3 calls a week. The coverage is pretty good, but strangely spotty. I can literally walk 40 feet and go from no signal to a good signal in some places.  I mostly got it, because at the time I got it (04/04), it was the only prepaid plan that used a Nokia phone.  I really like the Nokia user interface.The per minute charges are a little confusing, because each card buys a different number of minutes.  Also what each card buys changes as T-Mobile competes with other prepaid plans.  At least as I write this review, $25 buys you 130 minutes and lasts for 3 months, but if you "top up" i.e. buy more minutes before the expiration date, all your minutes are renewed for another 3 months.  Last June, T-Mobile had a deal where your minutes lasted for a year.My husband uses Virgin which he's really happy with and at the time I bought, Virgin was little cheaper.  However I find his phone very confusing to use.  And as far as we can tell, the coverage in the SF bay area is about the same between Virgin and T-Mobile.  And now T-Mobile is a little cheaper.  I'm sure the price wars will continue.Since the cost to switch is the phone, and the phone is the biggest investment you'll make, I recommend choosing a prepaid plan based on the phone and the coverage in your area.
This is a good way to purchase the refill card from Japan. To using network-phone "SKYPE",I can re-charge a balance.
T-Mobile revised their Prepaid plan; this card now gives you 1000 anytime minutes, good for 365 days.  It also will make you a permanent "gold rewards" customer, which will pay off on future card purchases (consult their website for details).  This card, I believe, is the best deal in prepaid, as long as T-Mobile's rather skimpy rural coverage area isn't a problem.
According to the T-Mobile rep I talked to today, any unused minutes at the end of the year can be rolled over, provided you apply another refill card before the end of the year.  Once getting this $100 card, ANY new card will give you another year to use the minutes, since you become a gold rewards member.[UPDATED TEXT] It used to be that once you applied a $100 card, a $50 card would then also get you .10/min (500 minutes) - and again, all the minutes including old minutes will be good for another year.  However, now it appears that this policy is changed for new accounts.  Unless you initiated service before the policy changed, now you need to add $100 each time to keep the .10/min.A beneficial change to their plan is that now roaming is included on these plans.  It used to be that only post-paid T-Mobile customers could use other networks.  Now pre-paid phones will roam to other networks for the same .10/min.
This card now has 1000 anytime minutes which does not expire for a year. 10cents a minute is a good deal. Price of this card is same at all retail locations, but with Amazon you can avoid taxes. Bad thing about Amazon - Had to wait a long time because of out of stock.
This card is T-mobiles best offer for prepaid minutes.  It offers 1000 minutes that don't expire for a year.  For many of us who use a cellphone very little, this offers cellphone service at a price of less than $10 a month.  Amazon ships this item on tiny turtles if you use the "supersaver" shipping, so don't expect it next week if you purchase it with this option, but since you save on sales tax, and if patient, can get it shipped for free, any whining such as mine about shipping speed should fall on deaf ears.  Keep in mind the A9 discount which will knock another couple of bucks of the price.  This is a great cellphone value!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you're looking for a good prepaid pay as you go plan, then this is it. You get 1000 minutes for $100, which is 10 cents a minute, and their are no hidden or extra fees, that's all you pay. Plus you can use this for a year without having to refill, and you get the gold reward benefits. And if you're an existing t-mobile customer, their are no activation fees. The service is also very good, I've had no problems with losing reception or dropped calls. For the most part it's good, maybe not as good as sprint or verizon but I can't tell the difference. If you want to make this an even better deal, you can find these cards cheaper on ebay (NO taxes!!), I got this for $85 on ebay (8.5/min!!), and it works perfectly. This is the best prepaid deal by far, you won't be dissapointed.
No need to buy here, you can buy it on tmobile website directly using credit card, just type in your tmobile phone number, your credit card number, how many minutes card you need, you can get it immediately after 1 click, no tax for it at all. Don't bother to buy here, waisteing shipping time and cost.
I ordered this card, but the card clearly says "Unused minutes expires 90 days after activation of this card".  It is not 1 year!
Being a techno geek, I love this device.  The HP iPAQ h6315 is a Pocket PC with the convenience of a phone built in.  It runs Windows Mobile 2003 as the operating system which allows for a huge assortment of both free and for pay software to be downloaded on to it.  However it also acts like a computer in that it will periodically lock up.  When this happens, a soft reset is easy to perform and you can be up and running in less than a minute again.Things to do when buying the device:1.  Immediately upgrade the firmware to the latest.  At this time many of the units in stock still have the original buggy firmware.  If you are familiar at all with computers, upgrading the firmware is relatively easy.2.  Order yourself a 1GB Secure Digital memory card and a PC card reader.  Put the card in the reader and give the SD card a volume name (this fixes a bug).  Then put it in your iPAQ.3.  When installing applications, install them to either the iPAQ File Store or the SD Storage Card.  Also create a My Documents folder on the SD Storage Card and put your documents in there.  Set up Pocket Internet Explorer to cache files to the SD card.  Set up Pocket Outlook to save email to the SD card.  The goal is to save as much as you can to the SD card or the iPAQ File Store as possible.  You want to save your precious RAM for running programs.4.  To protect your screen from scratches and to be able wipe off smudges, get yourself a good screen protector sheet.  Several brands are available.  Stay away from the cheap ones.  You get what you pay for.5.  Read the h6315 forum at PDAphonehome.com for answers regarding this device.Pros:The coolness factor.  It really is a small computer.  As long as you have WiFi wireless access or phone service, you have connectivity to the internet.  You really can view web sites with Pocket Internet Explorer.  Also you can retrieve and respond to all your email.  Server admininstrators would find the Terminal Services client handy.  This unit also works as a great MP3 player.  If you are a VB .NET or C# .NET programmer, it is a snap to write software for this device.  Oh yeah, it is a quad band GSM phone as well, so it will work overseas.Cons:This device is a small computer, so if computers fustrate you, then this device is not for you.  It is not as fast as the latest Pocket PCs.  This was done to save battery life.  The other Pocket PCs will run for 3 hours on a battery charge where as this unit will work for an entire day on a charge.
I bought this from T-Mobile a week ago using the Amazon discount. My feelings for this device are mixed which explains the 3 stars.Good things first :-This is the device that I have been looking for, for years. It has everything - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IR, GSM Phone etc. MS Mobile OS and Outlook makes it the best partner for synchronizing Outlook items from your PC. I use it for synchronizing with my work PC over USB and with my home PC over the wireless LAN. I love it. Setting it up to synchronize over LAN was not easy because the user guides do not provide any instructions. Also, I can browse and check my email when I am connected to a wireless LAN.It is a little uncomfortable to hold in your palm as a phone, but don't buy it if you are going to primarily use it as a phone. It is meant to be a PDA with phone feature on it. I use Jabra BT200 bluetooth headset with it and it works just fine. Of course, you need the phone to make an outgoing call (unless you use voice-activated dialing feature, which I haven't tried), but you can receive a call using just the bluetooth headset.When connected to USB using the cradle, it gets charged over USB which is a neat feature. I keep the external power cable at home and the USB cradle at work.Good things kind of end there. Now the bad things:-This device is definitely in a beta stage. I don't think it has been thoroughly tested with all the features and memory management before they released it. I frequently get errors (usually while starting Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) or non-responsive buttons. Most of these problems go away with a soft reset. I am ok with a soft reset once in a while because it takes only a few seconds and I don't lose anything. But, the real bummer happened yesterday (after one week of owning it) when it suddenly switched on by itself (I had it in my pocket at that time) and completely reset itself to the factory state. It wiped out all my outlook items, programs, headset set up, PC partnerships etc. in a few seconds. I couldn't get a clue as to why it happened. It is impossible to do something like that manually even if I wanted to do it. I am trying to make myself believe that it was just a freak incident and won't happen again, which I know is not the case when it comes to computers. I have another week or so to return it. If this happens again, it is going back. I will keep this review updated....The other bad things - the leather pouch that came with the device is too big. I can't imagine anyone wearing it on the belt.I feel I can write a novel on this device ... More later.....
I have had my 6315 for two weeks, now.  I use the phone for business and have 5000 minutes/month with T-Mobile--and I use them all.  Unfortunately this device is not best suited to my needs.  I spend a lot of time on the road and dialing contacts, even when in speed dial mode, is too cumbersome.  For $40 you can get MS Voice Command, a well-reviewed voice recognition system for these Pocket PCs.  That would help, I imagine.  With a normal cell phone you can hold it in your hand and very quickly navigate between contacts with your thumb.  This device requires you to look at what you're doing, and either use the stylus (while driving:  this requires two hands) or the smallest tip of your finger (sometimes able with one hand) to select your contact (which is very small) or voicemail.The primary reason I am returning the device is because of the above difficulties, and the dreadful reviews I have encountered online regarding the unit's interface with all manner of bluetooth headsets.  I have yet to read of anyone's seamless experience with a bluetooth headset used over a long period of time.There are additional bugs that are irritating, but can usually be solved with a soft reset--your "contacts" list will spontaneously be rendered inaccessible--the phone will sometimes freeze while trying to receive one call while on the line with another call.  While relatively small bugs, I paid over $500 for this device and, naturally, I expect better performance.There is no way to inactivate the screen yet still use the phone, and this is often a problem.  Holding it to your face will sometimes activate other buttons.  Leaving it in my pocket without putting it in standby mode has randomly dialed phone numbers.  An unfortunate flaw for a high end device.The wireless features--other than the bluetooth note, above--are very good.  Using Pocket Internet Explorer works pretty well.  I was not able to use the Pocket Inbox for email.  I did buy a bluetooth keyboard and have generally found it easy to use with the 6315 and very helpful for typing emails in the car or taking notes in meetings, though once it would not connect for some reason.The screen is excellent. The battery life is good when one considers how much this PC is doing at once.  Again, I am on the phone many hours each day and, thus far (2 weeks), I have gone all day without having to recharge.  The processor speed is slower than many PPC's, but quite adequate and helps preserve battery life.If I did not rely so heavily on my cellphone, I am sure I would keep the 6315.  This device is fantastic as a pocket pc.  But you are paying $500 for a ppc and a phone.  Both must work excellently.
I read a lot of reviews online. Was I to give up my Z600 and H5555 for this H6315. Some people seemed to love this unit some despice it. The slower processor and only 64MB was a major concern after getting used to the fast processor in the H5555 and the 128MB of ram.I decided to go for it after debating for a while. I got the unit it was way cool speed was not to big of an issue but it would constantly lock up on me and had serious issues. Many times I had to soft reset the unit 2 or more times in a row to get it operational. Well after a week the SD slot died and I got a new unit on advanced replacement since HP offers a 14 day replacement guarantee. I was ready to throw the thing into the wall and stomp on it then go get the sledgehammer to finish the unit for good.I'm glad I did get it replaced the new unit been working as flawlessly as I could expect (after using a H5555 for well over a year and a H3670 for well over year before the H5555).Bluetooth drains the battery but nothing worse then any other device I used before (Z600, T68i to mention a couple of previous bluetooth devices). Bluetooth seems to almost be designed to drain your batteries. But the H6315 outlast my Sony/Ericson H65 bluetooth headsets battery so no major complaints.Camera. Works as well as you might expect from a cellphone camera (not very well). It sure is a improvement over my old Z600 and in par with my wifes Nokia 6600. Don't expect anything fancy after all it's only a 0.3Meg pixel camera giving you a 640x480 picture (far surpassing most cellphone cameras I seen).Flash? Would be nice but then no other cellphone have a flash either. If you want a decent digital camera then you should buy just that a digital camera not a cellphone or pda with built in camera.The slower processor have not been a major issue that I was afraid it would be. Programs takes a bit longer to launch and it takes longer time to boot but nothing extreme.Memory. I do miss the 128MB ram of my H5555 I could do just about anything and install apps to my hearts content without having to worry or running low on ram. Having to use 68MB again have turned out to be a bit challanging need to be more careful to make sure I store more on my SD card and less on ram and have to be more careful on the apps I install and be sure not to not install a bunch that I do not use.Conclusings:I really enjoy this unit. To be able to check my mail, get weather and news and even view MSNBC on the go is really nice thanks to GPRS and WiFi. It hurt to have to buy MS Voice Commands to get voice dialing which I was used to from my T68i and Z600 this should been included with the cellphone.I do not miss my Z600 or my H5555 very much but wished I had more RAM in this unit.My first unit frequently looked up and was horrible but after gotten it replaced I have almost only good things to say about the H6315 obviously my first unit was defective and I suspect the QA is not what it should be since I read numerous reviews of other people that have had horrible experience that resembles my own with this first defective unit. If you buy one and it frequently looks up on you bring it back to the store you bought it from and have them replace it under the 14 day return/replacement policy that HP offers on these.
The short review is:  The HP iPAQ h6300 series is a good continuation of the iPAQ line, adding GSM/GPRS data to the 802.11b and Bluetooth of the 5550 series.  If you are looking to upgrade your iPAQ to the next level, this is the device to buy.Unless you are a die-hard iPAQ fan or you need the specific features of this device, however, I would not recommend it.The Verizon VX66, Sprint PPC 6600, and Siemens SX66 are all superior with a newer operating system, faster processor, better battery life and the keyboard slides out reducing the overall size and giving one less thing to carry.  The US versions of these devices usually do not have Wi-Fi - so if that's a requirement you're back to the iPAQ.If your main desire is for a camera phone with some PDA capabilities - you'd be better off pursuing a Symbian or Windows Smartphone device rather than a PDA.  They're better suited for someone who only needs access to their mail, calendar, phone book and such.Finally, if your main goal is wireless e-mail or wireless web, then the RIM Blackberry and Danger Sidekick II are better tools at far lower prices.If you're still set on the iPAQ - it's a really good product for it's intended market.  The radios are all top-quality and I get probably 150% or more of the published range.  If I forget to turn off Wi-Fi, the unit will pick up countless access points as I drive home from work.As a phone, it's really too bulky for more than occasional use.  I quickly invested in a Bluetooth headset.  You can't make outgoing calls, even with Voice Command installed, but for incoming it's great.  There is definately something wrong with the headset software though:  Only one headset I've found works with it reliably - the Motorola HS810.  With that out of the way, I just leave the PDA in my briefcase until I need it.The camera does not do well in low light - you pretty much need daylight.  The various white balance adjustments and such worked well, however.Memory has been my biggest adversary.  Installing applications on the SD card works fine: as long as you don't switch cards.  You can even create the My Documents and Windows\Start Menu\Programs folders and whatever you put in them will show up right along side the main memory.  But, when you remove the card - the icons stay.  Now it's a test to see if you can remember what app is on what card.  Data files are fine -- only applications have problems.  I finally chucked it and sprang for a 1GB card to just get it over with.I've seen the iPAQ do everything a laptop can - and do it all wirelessly.  For me, I shed a whole pile of devices and cables for something I can put in my front pocket - and while it's not great at anything, it's good enough for me.
I never had any problems with my IPAQ Internet or the T-Mobile Service. My IPAQ 6315 is a sophisticated all in one phone with a camera. People who had trouble with their IPAQs may do well to learn a little more about them. I went to [...] and found that happy customers refreshed their unit daily. If you want to save word documents or memos, you will need to have your cradle attached to your computer to back it up.  Not a big deal and not a difficult task. T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.  The cost is only $29.95 a month for full wireless internet. I tried Sprint for double the amount and sent it back. They claim to have faster service, but there were browser limitations that made it seem no faster to me that the IPAQ. Verizon is a little faster, but $49.95 a month. You cannot use Sprint or Verizon with the IPAQ. I strongly suggest nobody use Sprint, they were terrible.
A word to the wise - stay clear of this phone. Why - bad reception, dropped calls, constantly seeks service. T-Mobile? - no help, no support. They have replaced phone once - same problem. I was even told by their wireliss people that this was not a device to buy  - but yet T-Mobile refuses to issue credit or deal with the issue. For those who have posted glowing reviews, you either have not used this phone for a period of time or are plants from T-Mobile or HP to give good review. This is a very poor product. I expected more from HP.
I see alot of negative press surrounding this pocket pc but I've experienced none of the problems that have plagued other users. I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that they upgraded the firmware april 1st (and released the upgrade for current users).The unit was pretty phenomenal when I bought it and I did expect a few bugs here and there, nothing is perfect. However, since the new firmware release (available on HP and T-Mobiles website) I don't even experience those. I never thought I'd come to depend on such a product, even the previous Pocket PC's I've owned were a toy at best. If your looking for something that will do everything you need to and then some, this PDA definately does "do it all".Pro's:  What CAN'T this unit do?Con:  Price, you get what you pay for though. Only available on GSM networks.
I've had this phone for 5 months now. The pda functions work with all the reliability of microsoft. All the programs you can want are easy to download and easy to use.That said, the phone is the model of a beta! After the first downloaded patch got the thing working at all, it is full of problems. When it sleeps, calls cannot wake it up. Very often you cannot "hang up" a call and must soft boot the phone. The number of times you have to re-boot will remind you of every time you've given microsoft the benefit of the doubt in the past.The concept is great. And if my jaba bluetooth worked even half of the time, I would be happy. As it is I continue to miss calls and get delayed voice mails.... not entirely a bad thing, hence the 2 stars.
Do not buy this device if you use expect a decent phone.  I have used many HP iPAQ PDA's and they are great and this one is as well for that purpose.  The phone; however, is barely usable.  It is not at all convenient to use, the call quality is absolutely horrible, it drops calls on a regular basis, and half the time it doesn't even ring until making one single sound just before going to voicemail.I was excited a couple of months back when HP/T-Mobile release a ROM upgrade that was supposed to fix many of the problems with the device.  I installed the upgrade and IT GOT *MUCH* WORSE!  Unfortunately, I couldn't find a version of the old ROM image to downgrade it back to, so I was stuck with it.After painfully using this phone for 7 months, I finally had enough and paid full price to purchase another phone a couple of weeks ago.  I'm tempted to just throw my 6315 in the trash!
I consider myself a Pocket PC power user and I have to say that HP has done a good job with this device, the unit I have received is fairly stable, construction of this ipaq is one of the best I have owned and I think i will own it for a good time (or until hp has released a newer and smaller one.)Pros:Battery lifeMaterial case construction.T-Mobile's good support in unlocking the device.very good displaygood phone reception.all in one pocket pc device.Cons:Poor quality pictures from the vga camera.Poor bluetooth headset recognition and connection.Big antenna.No button to hide the lcd keyboard while in callsPoor video playback.included leather case is too big.This pocket pc is well worth the price, I replaced my Ipaq RX3715 and my V600 and I have nothing to regret.
My main problem with this unit has been poor sound quality, like the speaker is cracked.  This is apparently due to software issues that t-mobile attempted to fix with a ROM upgrade introduced in March.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find anyone who tells me that this will fix this problem and keep it from recurring.  To make matters worse, both t-mobile and HP do not provide any information about whether or not this problem can be fixed, and the t-mobile staff are not told anything about this issue.  I did the upgrade and when the problem recurred, was told to wait, that there would be a solution coming soon.  I waited, and now am being told that the unit has gone out of the warrenty period.  Now there is no support, and even the unusually thin stylus is no longer available.  This is a defective unit, and it may take a class action lawsuit to get t-mobile and HP to own up to their responsibility in foisting it on the public.  I hope they decide to do the right thing before this happens.
Just I wanna say this this is not a good phone but nice handheld. I am using this ipaq almost a year and last month t-mobile sent me new one because I was getting too many miss calls then tey sent me new h6315 but guess what, nothing is change still I am getting miss calls:( I think I am going to buy new "cell phone" .
Please note that this is about HP6315 as a cell phone from T-Mobile. It is okay as a PDA but it will make you miss your old cell phone. I, regularly, experience line drops. It does not roam well at all that when you are moving in a vehicle, it is most likely that you will not have a good cell phone service. It is very slow to find a tower to connect. Since it consumes considerable amount of power, it goes to standby mode quickly and then, when you power it up, it is very slow to get signals. Its rather bulky antenna is not doing much good since it does not have strong reception at all. T-Mobile sent field tech several times to check for signal strength in certain locations where my 6315 is weak and they say that their signal is fine.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AS A PHONE FOLKS! ...but it can be usefull in many other ways, of course.
Based on magazine & web reviews I hoped this was finally the answer to integrating my "electronic leashes".  I was looking to consolidate my cell phone, Blackberry & existing Pocket PC. When it works, this device is pretty close. It really is a pretty cool and useful device - when it works.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work a lot of the time.  The GSM radio is pretty weak. (I live in San Diego and travel nationwide, and this device looses conctions 10x more than my previous GSM phone, or those of the other people I travel with).  Not helped by T-Mobile network problems.  Despite T-mobile's claims to the contrary, it will not register on the Cingular / AT&T; networks when the T-Mobile network is not available.  Further, incorrect network configurations at T-mobile made GPRS (data access) useless for first 6 weeks.  After 2 months,I am still unable to send e-mail via my POP3 e-mail accounts.  No satisfaction from tech support.  They cancel all trouble tickets after 30 days - fixed or not, so they now claim the problems are fixed because the tickets are closed.  There also is no expert on the iPAQ 6315 at T-Mobile - every issue (bluetooth, mail redirector, internate access, Wi-Fi, etc. requires you to talk to a different group (with a significant wait of hold for each).  Other problems:  Bluetooth is faulty - if the 6315 goes into standby while headset is paired, it will wake up but is unable to re-connect headset(known issue - supposed to be a fix out in Jan 05 - still waiting). Even more frustrating, once this happens you cannot answer a call without going into radio to shut off bluetooth or resetting the iPAQ - so you miss the call.  Battery is pretty marginal with moderate use, it will barely make it through a normal business day.  Still waiting on the high capacity battery.My advice:  I believe the HP 6315 is the best conceived of the first gernation of Pocket PC Phones.  If you are in areas with strong signals and willing to suffer "early adopter syndrome" - go for it. It is cool when it works.  The bugs can mostly be fixed with a software update.  Otherwise, wait 6 months for the bugs to get worked out.  After 2 months and 65 hours on hold with T-Mobile & HP tech support, I switched to a Blackberry 7290.  It has been flawless out of the box!
Having a phone and pda combined into one unit is a good idea but not one that actually translates into something that works for t-mobile.  I'm don't know how this phone would preform on other networks but ont he t-mobile network it never worked properly.  Unless you were in your house or driveway you won't get your calls.  The calls will go directly to voicemail, and the phone will not ring becuase of low signal. Even after applying the free upgrade offered from HP through the t-mobile website the phone did not work properly.  This ended up being a waste of $600 for me.The compter part of the pda works great. Playing games, keeping my calendar and task list was about all I could do on this phone. Surfing the net was impossible unless you purchase the $40 plan from t-mobile.  The phone has a wireless card in it but it never worked properly with my home network.  Also the bluetooth never functioned properly for transferring data or using the buetooth handsfree.  the infrared transfer worked fine.The camera was another disappointment. It was supposed to be a 3megapixel camera but it did not take pictures like one.  The shutter reaction is extremely slow and the pictures were very graining.  There is a $9 flash attachment that you can purchase but I didn't want to spend anymore money on this item.
I am a power user and currently use the T-Mobile PPC Phone Edition - after trying Treo, etc.  The upgrade to the iPaq cost $400 and was not worth the time and effort.To start, the phone quality was awful, reception was OK but not as good as with my back-up (free Nokia) and locked up several times needing a soft re-set to get it working again.  Several issues with the T-Mobile PPC remain (turns itself on regularly running down the battery, numerous soft resets needed daily).  The extra memory was great, no running out of program memory too quickly but programs still "hang" requiring soft resets.  The camera was fine, not something I need.  The pocket versions of Excell, Word, etc worked fine.The device itself was fine.  Overall it was adequate but not worth the $400 - $500.  Save your time and money on this one!
Some of the problems with this phone include:1) Randomly disconnects from GSM signal. You won't notice it and miss many calls. When you do only a soft-reset will bring the signal back.2) Crashes often requiring soft reboot.3) Sometimes displays the message "Static Caption."  There is no way out of this other than a soft reboot.4) Sometimes crashes during answering of calls. Requires soft reboot.5) Sometimes displays the message "Would you like to call <xxx>." Pressing Yes or No gets you the same question. Only way out is a soft re-boot.6) Disconnects frequently and randomly from Blue Tooth headsets (even approved ones). However the icon on the phone shows the headset as being connected. You never know where you call will go.7) No keypad lock, will dial random people in your pocket.8) If you leave the phone on a desk and don't look at it, at some point it will turn the screen on and run the battery out.9) Neither HP nor T-Mobile will support this phone. HP refuses and passes all calls to T-Mobile. T-Mobile usually plays dumb and tries to do an exchange, "troubleshoot the problem", send you a new SIM card, whatever it takes to make you go away.In short, this is one of the worst pieces of equipment I have ever purchased. It is hard to believe it will ever have enough of these bugs worked out to be usable.
I installed the upgrade hoping it would end my frustrations.  Nope!  It's not usable as a phone.  It drops my calls 80% of the time.  When not dropped, the reception is barely intelligible.I've had my 3615 replaced by T-Mobile 4 times.  Each time a replacement (refurb.) comes it has the same phone problems and various other issues such as lock ups, involuntary resets and so on.  When pointing out the futility of replacing a junk 3615 with another 3615, my friendly T-Mobile rep. sticks to his impenetrable script and says he would be glad to help me solve my problem by sending me a fully tested 3615 replacement.My other favorite problem with this outrageous piece of junk is the relationship between HP and T-Mobile.  HP refers you to T-Mobile when asking for support.  T-Mobile says "we depend on HP when trying to resolve these issues".  Seems like neither one wants to take responsibility for it and are waiting for the whole thing to fade away with time (and warranty expirations).  Shame on both!
Does everything, except work when you need it to.  I've waited for the new ROM upgrade, and it's still horrible.  Crashes regularly, sleeps and doesn't wake up (except with reboot), drops calls all the time, sometimes screens will be missing the button that makes them go away (OK, now what???), bump the touch screen with your cheek when on the phone (and who knows what you're telling it to do at that point), goes into "Flight Mode" on it's own (to turn phone "off", you turn "on" Flight Mode, and vise versa, which sum up user interface design).  I have to credit both Microsoft and HP for doing a poor job, and T-mobile for selling it and not taking it back.  I have a very long memory, and share my opinions.  It's the worst device I own, maybe ever.  Cost so much I can't bear to replace it, and not worth much on ebay, for good reason.  If you want to pay extra for a PDA then chose this.  If you need to make phone calls get something -- anything -- else.
Do not buy this phone, I purchased it when it first came out and it has been nothing but trouble. marginal reception, terrible blue tooth, HP is supposed to upgrade the bluetooth still waiting.  proccessor is slow, camera colors very muted super low contrast. I purchased the extended battery for $99.00( which you need) It just died after 5 months HP will not replace. this is the worst PDA I have owned.
This product was not designed by engineers with Cell Phone experience.HP is a big name in PDAs but they are not on the map in cell phones - this product demonstrates this.  Don't order steak at a seafood restaurant.I replaced my T-Mobile IPAQ 6315 with the Verizon XV6600 - After the grief I have had for 5 months with the IPAQ 6315 (actually 3 of them), the AudioVox XV6600 is a pleasure.  I generally love HP products, but I guess they have no phone experience. I don't understand how the T-Mobile Engineers could have qualified the 6315 for use on their network.The April 2005 software upgrade only slightly improved phone operation.The HP IPAQ 6315:1.  Drops incoming calls2.  Drops outgoing calls on first try3.  Has poor audio for both parties on phone call4.  Cannot be programmed to automatically answer incoming calls while using a headset5.  The navigation pad works very poorly
I see a lot of bad reviews on this site about the HP 6315, and I think the reviews are misleading..  this thing is above average all the way around.It's not a stellar phone by any stretch but it works as it should for what it is. Get a bluetooth headset.. talking on the phone with out one extended periods of time can be a pain, and it's volumne is somewhat lack luster. I think a lot of people EXPECT it to be a phone first and a PDA second and that's NOT this equipments purpose.Wanna yammer non stop for hours on a cell phone, by all means, knock yourself out, but buy a good cellular phone....this isn't the equipment to do it with. Or buy a blue tooth Headset for your Ipaq.....I've used mine all thru Europe and the Middle East and found for the most part it switches bands easily, picks up a  signal rather quickly and works well in all but the most hard to reach places like elevators.. but the phone feature is just that, a feature not the primary purpose. Used with a Blue tooth headset it becomes much more bearable as a phone. Did I mention ....Get a blue Tooth Head set for the phone yet?I haven't had but a few dropped calls on mine, and those were international calls. Secondly Im on a much less robust cellular network in the ME then in the states and STILL the 6315 does the job ....So I can't see where the complaints about missed calls is so heavy, not saying it doesn't happen but just that it's not my experience with my 6315.As far as the software glitches, yes it freezes at times, BUT I found the best thing to do is simply get into the habit of each morning, doing a reset on it after it sits over night in it's charging cradle... that reduced the problem I had with freezing by 85%.  And do periordic BACK UPS...This isn't a PC...it takes a little more effort then the PC at home that hasn't been shut down for the last 2 years.Where this piece of gear shines is as a PDA it's almost idiot proof and with my MS Outlook using ActiveSync it's phenomenal, contacts, appointments, e-mails, word, excel and even a few songs to relax with all at the touch of a button. The display is clear and easy to read as well, and I use mine on planes quite often to read the latest books.Web browsing is a snap as long as you can find a hot spot and set your connections right.I don't wish to hurt anyones feelings...but this is not a piece of gear for the first time buyer or average no technical person to buy, in other words you are only going to have grief if you order this and pull it out of the box and expect it to somehow  magically work for you.Secondly ...... READ THE MANUAL...duh...Take your time setting it up, and I would wager that would alleviate 50% of the problems people are saying this thing has on here.....as for me...I would buy it again in a heart beat :-p
Although, I can't comment whether, it is still a smallest handheld featuring integrated three-way wireless capabilities. But one thingis sure: the speaker is cracked. Is is a defective piece. Also the integrated camera, to say the least, is pathetic. And what kind ofprocessor is Texas Instruments OMAP™ 1510, it frustrates more than it processes. It is very slow. On the software side of it  HP hasdone a good job by providing some, great third party add on applications. Sad part of it all is the defect's are minor, and canbe fixed easily. But the inertia and indifference, towards the problem, is inexplicable. Overall it is a satisfactory product.
Save yourself some time and just take the money you are going to spend on this phone and flush it down the toilet and then go and buy another cell phone. Some of the problems with this phone are: The phone locks up on a regular basis.  Since the phone is listed as a Tmobile compatible phone you would think that you could use the Tmobile website for downloads, think again, you can not use the tmobile website for any downloads. If you buy this phone with a tmobile service plan it will end up costing you way more than you think. You will sign up for a plan and find out later that something you need is not included and will cost at least another twenty dollars for that service. When it is all said and done yu end up spending twice as much as you planned. You will get messages from websites or numbers you have never heard of and that are not full numbers so you can not call them back and ask them to stop the messages. To make it worse most of the time the messages don't say anything. You figure out how to stop the messages and take the steps to put a stop to them. Then while you are in a meeting you start getting the messages again. There are websites that you visit to try and download things for your phone, only to find out that your phone is not compatible and no matter how many times you cancel your account you will continue to be billed for the site. As for actual phone service if you sneeze or turn your head your service will be dropped. Don't plan on talking to anyone very long. If the only choice you have in your area is T-mobile and this phone, you may want to take two cans and run a string between them and use that. It is cheaper and the service is better.
I bought this about a year ago freshky released. we have other phones in the house(Nokia) with bluetooth and same resolution camera to compare too. the result is that HP 6315 has  - zero battery life (bad Windows power management)  - bad camera (same hardware low res cvamera takes great pics on Nokia)  - disfunctional blootooth (would not talk to any computer really (Nokia does)  - it restarts by itself in the middle of conversation  - bad sound quality in speaker and ear piece.Windows even managed to corrupt my SD extension card with my pm3 musics ...just total junk - stay away from WIndows Mobile and other Microsoft products.
The HP portion of the PDA works fine and is supported by an excellent HP service. But when it comes to the phone part, it becomes a night mare. T-Mobile US is one of the worst service providers. When calling customer care you get routed in a circle and after several call you come back to the first service agent you remember by name, but he does not remember anything.I strongly recommend to abstain from buying the specific product. The "marriage" between HP and T-Mobile should be long divorced. A bad taste remains on HP-products as normally they realy care for their customers.Something T-Moible still needs to learn.
Beware - this item can only be used with T-Mobile service.T-Mobile will NOT unlock this for use with any other carrier, unless you comply with the following:You must be a T-Mobile customer for 90 days (yet their minimum service contract is for 1 year, with early cancellation fees), and you must fax them the receipt indicating that you paid full retail price for this product.  You will also need to provide them Part#, SN#, EMEI#, your T-Mobile acct#, and last 4 of your SSN#.It is thus recommended to steer clear of this device, because its resale value is nill.
It is a product that make me feel happy, it is better than I suppose
Obviously the intuitiveness of the phone is dictated by Windows Mobile Smartphone 2003 - which at best can be described as OK.  Feature wise it's right up there and of course it integrates seamlessly with Office via Activesync or over the internet.  Which does bring up the issue of configuring it.  I bought it for use with T-Mobile and I found it quite difficult to navigate which T-Mobile services I'd need to get all of the functionality on the phone - combined with the fact that since this phone is unsupported by T-Mobile, you'll need to manually configure the email/internet etc.  Finally got it all figured and now everything works well.  However, using all of the features will consume your battery.  Heavy usage of the email and internet features will mean a battery life of about 1 1/2 days.  Lighter use, or no use, brought it back up to about 3 days on standby.  Sound quality is excellent and construction is above par with one caveat - the screen is made of plastic which is anything by scratch resistant.  Advise buying a carry case.
If you call TMobile's tech support or visit a store, they will sell you the $19.99/month plan to go with a phone like this.  It is not at all necessary.The biggest problem setting up internet access with this phone is how deeply buried the settings are in Windows Mobile 2003.  Here goes:  labelled as Action(keystroke)Start... (left Select)Settings (8)More (9)Data Connections (1)Menu (right Select)Edit Connections (1)GPRS Connection (5)Menu (right Select)Add (1)When you're there, Fill in the description, Set 'Connects To' to Internet, Set the Access Point to [...](still has the retro url).  There are other access points you can use, like [...].  Hit the discussion boards.  Most say that the access is included with plans above $39.99.  Your mileage may vary, as they tailor some plan features to different markets.That was all I had to do to get this running.  Most of the information is on T-Mobile's website, under the Configurator.  While this particular phone is not supported, just choose a Pocket PC phone (like the HP) and adapt the directions for the OS.Once it's running, the browser is great.  I like the fact that you can force it to display images larger than the screen (normally it will resize to fit, making maps unreadable).  You can use Google Local without too much fuss.  Great phone for the price.Only real downside to phone that I've found:  Secure Digital slot is not SDIO, so no Bluetooth (or WiFi) for you.
Scrubs season two came out on DVD where I live yesterday (Australia) and I have to say that the quality of this box set actually managaes to surpass that of season one. Once again, the special features are entertaining and informative without being too lengthy (perfect for my short attention span). The best short doco is one which features many of the on-set jokes between cast and crew - you really get the feeling that these people don't just turn up and make a sitcom for the money.While it's disappointing that there are only 22 episodes in season two, as opposed to the 24 from the first season, what is lost in quality is made up for in quantity. Once again we see the janitor (my absolute favourite character) do his best to make JD's life hell, while getting choked up when JD gives him a new mop (of all things!). Music also features heavily in these episodes, with the return of 'Ted's Band' seeing a fantastic rendition of the theme song from 'Charles in Charge'. Check out the extras to see these guys do their own special cover of the Scrubs theme song.Even the menus are exciting - containing the entire Scrubs theme song, which is seriously catchy (sings) ...but I know, I'm no Superman... (all right I'll stop now). In the episodes themselves, the picture is very clear and the sound is great too, and excellent transfer from the source material. Considering the terrible pattern in which these shows screened in Australia, it's nice to be able to watch them in order as intended. All in all, this is a fantastic set at a great price - where I'm from it's about half the cost of (for example) Simpsons and Frasier box sets. And because Scrubs is just one of those shows you can watch over and over again, it's well worth every cent.
I replaced a 6120 BlackBerry with this phone.  I was astonished at how easy it was to set-up. It comes with the OS already installed (Microsoft Mobile 2003). The VOQ Mail Pro software is really nice and better than Outlook.  The boot time is a little slow but that is the OS not the phone (its Microsoft Windows, come on ppl).This phone works great on the Cingular network.  I receive an excellent signal.  Much better than the Blackberry (on the T-Mobile network).  The usability with this phone to navigate back and forth through the features is great.  Again, better than the blackberry 6120.I will be buying more of these phones in the future if I can get access to them.  Sierra Wireless discontinued this phone which is too bad.  I reviewed many many smartphones and PDA's before making my choice with the Voq Pro phone. For the price ($150 US) this phone has met and exceeded in some areas all of my expectations.  I considered purchasing the following:- Treo 650- Samsung i730- iPAQ hw6500The only feature I wish this phone had was bluetooth for transferring files between my phone and laptop.
If, like me, you've bought the 1st season of this already legendary show, you're biting your nails wondering is there any way to make November 15th come any faster!In our pretty jaded age of reality TV and cheap shock-value entertainment, Scrubs is one of the few lights in the darkness in terms of razor-sharp script, character develpoment, laugh out loud moments, superb acting and solid, consistent development of characters from season to season.This is basically a really long winded way of saying that Scrubs is, quite simply, brilliant. This is one of the few shows in TV history, quite like the Simpsons I suppose, that is so funny you keep expecting to wake up in your bed laughing, realise that a show this good does NOT, in fact exist, and that your world is all the poorer for it! Thankfully that's not the case tho...Season 2 continues to develop the characters of JD, Turk, Elliot, Carla and the inimatble Dr Cox in a similarly hilarious (and sometimes poignant) fashion as season 1. All the other supporting characters we know and love are back too, and with lots of celebs jumping on board for an episode or two (Scrubs has fast become as fashionable a cameo vehicle as The Simpsons or the late great Friends)Our heroes are now a lot more experienced and versed in the ways of hospital life, but year 2 brings new challenges. And of course Dr. Cox cares not how experienced they have become, he needs no encouragment whatsoever to dress them down as often as possible!Season 2 picks up after the bombshell that Dr Cox's ex-wife, Jordan, laid on them all at the end of Season one - Cox's love for Carla (and Turk knowingly witholding that information from Carla!), Elliot's love for JD, JD's brief fling with Jordan herself and other revelations are all waiting in the wings to be continued as Season 2 commences...The Season 2 episodes list is as follows:25: My Overkill26: My Nightingale27: My Case Study28: My Big Mouth29: My New Coat30: My Big Brother31: My First Step32: My Fruit Cups33: My Lucky Day34: My Monster35: My Sex Buddy36: My New Old Friend37: My Philosophy38: My Brother, My Keeper39: His Story40: My Karma41: My Own Private Practice Guy42: My T.C.W.43: My Kingdom44: My Interpretation45: My Drama Queen46: My Dream JobSo there you have it. Bets taken now as to how long this show will run for, but barring any of the actors pulling out, this one is already a monster and will run until the wheels fall off; a prediction that I, for one, am thrilled about! Season 2 is still a couple months off but I think I'll pre-order mine now in case they are all sold out!
If you haven't seen the first season, it won't matter too much, because this is where everything really begins to take a foothold.  I said in my review for the first season that Scrubs was the first truly classic 21st century sitcom, and if you didn't believe me when you saw the first season, you'll definitely be changing your tune when you watch the second season.  This season isn't as immediate as the first one, mainly because the jokes are so intelligent, humorous, and sometimes subtle that it's easy to overlook them the first viewing.  Emotionally, however, this season has a stronger, more mature core, and that's apparent on the first viewing, and the writing has grown as well.The jokes are definitely more memorable.  Everywhere I go now I practically make a reference to jokes on that show (especially when Dr. Cox is trying to come up with another girl's name to call J.D.).  I want to meet the guy who came up with the line "...she sent him to surgery where you guys helped him kick that nasty oxygen habit he had once and for all!" because the wit in that one line is just to die for.  The visual gags, such as the massive Rerun dance fantasy and J.D. getting a shower of spit from Dr. Cox, leave a mark of originality that most shows lack.The more dramatic parts coalesce even more than last season.  Even episodes that start out quirky end up making the most impact such as "His Story" and "My T.C.W."  "My Philosophy" is probably the most emotional episode of the season, made even more so by J.D.'s subdued reaction to a patient's death at the end.  Each character has evolved and made even more human.  Dr. Cox is the most transformed; he still has the bite and sarcasm that makes him Dr. Cox, but he showed more of the cracks underneath the surface this time around, allowing for an understanding of why he is the way he is.  J.D. also has grown; at times his mistakes are hurtful and not as humorous, in short he has become human and not just a humorous focal point.Enough of me talking about this.  Check it out and see for yourself.  You'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't get the second season!
I got hooked on Scrubs last season and I was so surprised at how original and funny it is. It completely re-wrote the standard comedy format and there's really nothing like it on television. It even made hospitals funny. I'm can't wait for season five but I know it will be worth it.Scrubs follows the life of Dr. John "JD" Dorian as he tries to make it through life as a doctor. His roommate Turk helps him along the way and he's constantly fighting off his attractions to fellow doctor Elliot. Dr. Coz, the chief of staff constantly gives him advice but most of what he says is trying to hurt him rather than help him. Dr. Cox affectionately gives him the name newbie. Turk's girlfriend Nurse Carla watches out for JD and adds a lot of comic relief. Then there's Dr. Kelso who runs the hospital. Everyone pretty much fears him. Rounding out the perfect ensemble is the Janitor who's had it in for JD ever since the first episode. I have never laughed so hard at a comedy in my life.Scrubs also deals with some hard issues like death and friendship and it's so powerful that you leave the show touched after those episodes. It's heartwarming, funny, and it has no laugh track. The perfect formula for a great show.
Like many people out there, I caught on to Scrubs during season two. Back in May I bought the season 1 set and it is without a doubt the best season package of the year. It's creative design on the DVD menus, discs, and packaging have yet to be rivaled and it is so packed with bonus features that it has set up nearly impossible standards. I have no doubt that season two will be just as phenomenal (but hopefully with better cover art) and I can't wait to see the episodes again. This is one of those TV shows that gets better as the years go on, not worse. I'm also extrememly happy with the quick turn-around time for release of the second season, thankfully we don't have to wait a whole year, and hopefully the other seasons will be released quickly also.(...)has all the info about bonus materials, if you're too anxious to wait for amazon.com to update.
Scrubs the Complete Second Season is one of the greatest DVD collections ever. The content is so surreal and whimsical it would take a robot not to laugh. The drama is so subtle, it really seems to be just like real life. The extra features include great behind the scenes and commentary. Scrubs is perfect for any occasion.
This show has the most consistently well written episodes of any sitcom on TV. It never has received the recognition it deserves, but it is truly the funniest and cleverest show I've seen.  Everyone in the cast does an amazing job.
I have always loved 'Scrubs', and was absolutely thrilled to see it had been released on DVD. It certainly did not disappoint.Honestly, this is a really magnificant series, and well worth the money. The humour is accessible and endearing and the characters are wonderfully likable. 'Scrubs' has a wonderful inspiring aspect that avoids the undue sentimentality of so many other sitcoms.I think the second series is funnier than the first, though I love the focus on character growth in the first series. But really, both are extraordinarily worthwhile buys, if simply because of the sheer number of viewing hours.So if you missed an episode or just love Scrubs...this is a must!
In the second season of Scrubs, one of the few genuinely funny comedies left on TV, life at Sacred Heart Hospital doesn't get any easier for Drs. John "J.D." Dorian (Zach Braff), Chris Turk (Donald Faison), and Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke), who are now residents.  In fact, things only seem to get worse for them, but for us, that only provides for more laughs.In the first season, much of the focus was on how demanding the life at a hospital could be.  Evil bosses like Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), mentally unbalanced mentors like Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), and a psychotic Janitor (Neil Flynn, now a regular) made life at the hospital hell.  While there were a few bright spots, like Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), who became fast friends with J.D. and became Turk's girlfriend, there were many hardships to overcome.  Now, while things still are difficult at the hospital, the newbies have got their routines down.  This year, the characters' personal lives serve as the focus.One of the biggest story arcs involves Dr. Cox's ex-wife Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), who is pregnant with another man's baby.  Meanwhile, Turk decides to propose to Carla (in a very hilarious way), while Elliot and J.D. still find dating a challenge.  Elliot falls head over heals for a very nice, very attractive guy, but when she learns that he's a nurse at the hospital, she has a hard time accepting the fact.  Meanwhile, J.D. has a constant stream of bizarre relationships from Lisa the Gift Shop Girl (Sarah Lancaster) to Jamie Moyer (Amy Smart), AKA Tasty Coma Wife (or T.C.W. for short), a woman who's husband is slowly dying while in a coma.Sound effects and fantasy sequences are still a major contributor to the comedy this year, but not as much as last year.  Still, this show has some of the best cutaway sequences this side of Family Guy.  Some of my favorites include J.D. and a German patient dancing to the song 99 Red Balloons, while another has Elliot and Jamie doing the "Rerun Dance", complete with matching outfits (there is a very interesting story about that in the extras section).  Furthermore, in one of the most original openings in sitcom history, singer/songwriter Colin Hay performs his song Overkill and follows J.D. around the hospital, showing up in bizarre places, including the morgue.  Another great thing that I started noticing this year is the very subtle placement of things from earlier episodes in subsequent ones.  While this show came before Arrested Development, AD is what made inside jokes like that famous, so I'm going to compare these references to those of AD.  For instance, in one episode, J.D. remembers how he bought a ventriloquist dummy to impress women, then in a later episode, we see it in his room.Some of my favorite jokes are the ones involving the Janitor, who was allowed to interact with characters besides J.D. this year.  He is still tormenting J.D. for no reason, but this year, he begins to badger Turk and Dr. Cox.  Originally, there was going to be a twist where he was only a figment of J.D.'s imagination, but when they realized that they were going to stay on the air for a while, they started writing scenes for the Janitor with other characters.  Neil Flynn is a comic genius; he delivers his lines so well, and is great at improv.  In the alternate takes extra, some of the greatest stuff are the things that he didn't say.Still, one of the greatest things about this season was the episode "His Story".  Nearly every episode begins with the word My, because each episode is narrated by J.D.  In "His Story", the episode is told from Dr. Cox's point of view and we begin to see what makes him tick.  This was a very new and fresh episode, and in every season since, there has been an episode told from another character's perspective (so far we've gotten Turk and Elliot, and Carla is coming up next, but I can't wait for the Janitor to get one, but it probably won't happen).The list of guest stars this year may even be better than last year.  Many actors from Spin City showed up this year (Bill Lawrence also works on that show), including Heather Locklear, Alan Ruck, and Richard Kind.  Furthermore, Dick Van Dyke, Jay Leno, Jay Mohr, Ryan Reynolds, David Copperfield, and Fred Berry.  Furthermore, the returning characters of Dr. Doug Murphy (Johnny Kastl), Dr. Todd Quinlan (Robert Maschio), Nurse Laverne Roberts (Aloma Wright), and Ted Buckland (Sam Lloyd) had many great appearances.The music on the show is almost a character itself.  Often, the background music is used to help tell the story or transition between drama and comedy.  There are very few shows that I can think of that music plays such a pivotal role (Veronica Mars is one of them, and even that show doesn't use music as such an essential thing).Finally, the extras on this set are amazing.  Television DVD sets tend to get the short end of the stick when it comes to extras.  Sometimes, they'll have one or two good commentaries (with a bunch of other lousy ones) and some featurettes that are very hit or miss.  On the Scrubs sets, all of the featurettes are entertaining.  I haven't listened to any commentary tracks yet, but, judging by the quality of the other features, I am sure that they are also very well done.In short, this is another great Scrubs set.  I would reccomend it to everyone with the one caveat (to some people at least) that some of the sex scenes are a little racy.  The show is shot at an abandoned hospital, which many of the network execs find to be either too far or too creepy to visit on a day-to-day basis.  Therefore, the crew is able to get away with stuff that most shows couldn't, so there are a few very steamy scenes, and if this is a problem for you, beware.  Otherwise, enjoy another great season of TV.
Ever since I first saw Scrubs I've been smitten with it's distinct brand of comedy. Each character is different than the others and has their own story, not to mention they're each relatable in their own twisted way. Although the series still focuses solely on JD, there are points in every episode which explore the inner thoughts of each person. Even the massively misunderstood Dr. Cox gets his turn in the spotlight when he takes the place of JD and we really get to know the real him. There could be no better way to follow up a season like the first than with one like this. Season 2 continues from last season's ending fight where Cox's ex-wife tells every secret each person had.Each person seems much more human this time around, not that they didn't in the first season. I was happy to see that we got to learn more about Elliot. She was the one person that you really never got to know, and as expected she's a full load. You could always tell she was overly stressed but now you learn why. But don't think that just because you learn more about the characters that you won't be laughing a lot along the way. Each episode is chalk full of laughs and an equal amount of sadness. I will admit though that the dramatic scenes aren't as dramatic as they were in the first season. Nothing has really changed from season 1 to season 2 and I like that. JD and Turk are still best friend, Carla and Turk are still totally in love, JD and Elliot are still trying to figure out how they feel about each other, Cox and JD still have a love/hate relationship, and JD and the janitor are still creating waves.With a slew of great guest appearances, a great basic plot line, and terrific acting on everyone's part, there's no reason not to love this show. Each episode tends to deal with a different human emotion and does it's job with flying colors. There's no show on TV right now that makes its characters seem more real, even though they're completely fictional, and that is as important as anything.
What can be said about the best sitcom on television that hasn't already been mentioned?  The second season of Scrubs is so incredibly brilliant.  It's worth purchasing for the episode "His Story" alone, a 40-minute episode in which Cox does the narration.  Buy this the moment it arrives in stores, or suffer.Oh, and thank you, whoever you are, for improving the box art over the first one... although anything, really, would have been better.
2 things that made me change 5 stars to 4:SLOW boot (windows)....Low battery life....
The second season of SCRUBS aired during the 2002-2003 season on NBC and despite the network's constant delays and time-slot shuffling (something NBC has still yet to outgrow) the show maintained its fan base and gained its stride. If you're unfamiliar with the series then you are in for a real treat. Basically SCRUBS is a sitcom that is tailor made for 20-somethings but somehow transcends the limitations of most other shows and finds an audience in most all demographics. The show does this by combining drama with quick witted humor and probably the most slap-stick in a TV series since The Dick VanDyke Show (speaking of which, Dick VanDyke guest stars in the episode My Brother, My Keeper). SCRUBS is honest and farcical all at the same time. The show can make you laugh out loud at one of the many "day-dream" sequences then have tears welling up in your eyes not 10 seconds later. It's the most unique and fulfilling half-hour on TV today. And now it's on DVD so you don't have to sit through those lame commercials!Whereas Season 1 focused more on "the job" of being a doctor/surgeon/nurse and how these 20-something interns relied on each other to get through the day, season 2 focuses a little bit more on the personal lives of the staff at Los Angeles' fictitious Sacred Heart Hospital. But make no mistake, just because focus shifts towards personal lives doesn't mean the cast ever strays too far from the hospital and the pressures that "the job" still brings (see the episode My Monster). As far as personal lives go Season 2 sees some old flames from Season 1 rekindle then quickly dwindle: J.D. and Elliot (not a gay thing, Elliot is a woman played by the sexy Sarah Chalke). While other relationships become more serious: Dr. Cox & his ex-wife and surgeon Turk & Nurse Carla. Also guest-starring in several outstanding story arcs are Heather Locklear (as a sluty pharmaceutical rep) and former NYPD Blue & Silver Spoons star Ricky "Call me Rick" Schroder (as a male nurse or "murse").And if you're a fan of Bonus Features then this set will not disappoint. Even more features than the previous volume, season 2 has featurettes that delve into what really makes the show tick: the day-dream sequences, the character interaction, and of course the music. Series creator/writer Bill Lawrence also delivers 7 outstanding commentaries with the main cast on 7 great episodes. The Season 1 commentaries where a bit stale and had a lot of silence, but Bill & the cast seem to be trying on these and actually deliver commentaries worth listening to. And there's also the requisite deleted scenes and bloopers features. All in all SCRUBS Season 2 is just about the most fun you can have with your DVD player without making a trip to the adult video store.
Scrubs breaks the comedy mold and blends humor with drama and oddly enough it just works.  I would rate Scrubs as only slighly behind Seinfeld as one of the best comedy shows of all time.  The cast has a certain chemistry and beleivablilty that takes you in.  If you want to see something that can have your sides hurt and be different then try Scrubs!

In addition to the other reviews...Season 2 contains the episode titled "My Overkill" in which Colin Hay, of Men at Work performs a beautiful accoustic version of their song Overkill. It's one of those episodes that gives you the chills when you hear this song performed in the manner of which it is. Colin Hay, the troubadour, follows J.D. around the hospital; towards the end of the episode, the song helps Dr. Cox get back to "life as usual".
This is the funniest, warmest show on tv, I love all the characters, I have laughed, I have cried, I have laughed and cried at the same time, it's one thing few shows can pull off. I just finished watching the First Season on DVD and i'm blown away. Everything from the package, the menu designs, to the show itself is top notch. I can't wait to see what Season Two of Scrubs in DVD has in store for us. And I love that cover!!!!
Scrubs is a rare show in the fact it can make you laugh and cry within a few minutes and sometimes at the same time.  The characters while a bit wacky at times are very believable as is the show in general.  This is one of my favorire "SitComs" on TV.
This is one of the best sitcoms to ever hit the tube.  I hope that they continue to make more and more episodes.  I have already watched season one almost three times.  Hopeully November gets here quickly.
I love the phone and all its features but am having trouble getting help from T-Mobile setting up the web functionality. This phone, it seems cannot acess the WAP services that is commonly known as T-Zones ($4.99 extra per month) rather you have to access the internet via a GPRS connection ($19.99 a month extra.) I would have never bought this phone had I known this incompatibality with T-Mobile. Let me know if anyone has any other remedy to avoid the GPRS $19.99 fee.
Though it hasn't been released yet, i'm already peeing my pants with laughter just thinking about the ABSOLUTE BEST show in decades. Scrubs is awsome. When this Season 2 DVD is released, I'm SURE i'll watch it over and over again, as I have with the first Season. I can't get enough SCRUBS.
I don't know if I can wait until November for the second season on DVD! This show is, hands down, the BEST sitcom on television. Not only is it side-splitting hilarious, but it also has a tremendous amount of heart. I absolutely love this show. I cannot wait to own the second season on DVD!!
I have have over 50 different phones in the last 5 years. I am addicted to technology. This phone surpases every expectation I have had. I absolutely love it.
I have to admit I didn't even know this show existed till half way through the second season, but now i just can't get enough of this show.  Everything that could be on so many T.V. shows is all put into this ONE sitcom. The actors and actreeses have some the greatest chemistry together. I have watched the first season way too much for my own good but that just proves how much I love this show. I am LITERALLY counitng the days down till the 2nd season is released
Undeniably Scrubs is the best TV show NBC has to offer. At the end of season 1 J.D. was feeling confident that things were finally turning around but as J.D. had quickly learned throughout his first year of residency if things seem too good to be true they probably are. His mentor's ex wife spitefully reveals she had a quickie with J.D. and leaves the entire Scrubs crew with their mouths wide open as she spills other tidbits that's sure to turn the Hospital of Sacred Hearts upside down.Verdict on Season 2: Can't hardly wait!
i usually dont write reviews for things that han't come out, but i just got excited when i saw this was finally being released. WOOOO!! cant wait, this is a great show.
This is the GREATEST show ever!! Now I know it may seem a bit stretching it to say its the best, but hands down, no show in the history of television managed to put out such sincerity, honesty and down right hilariousness in sitcom. Hope this show will last through MY residency. I'm living the JD life!!!
[...] Scrubs is personally the best sitcom out since Friends. Season 1 was great and season 2 is even better and season 3 is even better and season 4 is even better. Season 2 features such great episodes. Great Loves. Perfect.
season 1 was one of my favorite shows ever. very very funny, very original, superb main character in "JD", all that. now i am watching season 2 and its just gone. i've laughed twice in 4 episodes, while season one had me in stitches the entire time. its like they are repeating season 1, but without the jokes. the same people doing the exact same thing, even nice musical numbers thrown in, but it just ain't what it used to be. i strongly suggest not buying these dvds without at least sampling an episode. however, starting at around episoe 12 the show gets back in gear and while still not as great as the first season, it does become thoroughly enjoyable. this continues into season 3 which starts out great.
The phone is reliable and a workhorse, totally keeping up with all you want to do.  It's fast and expandable, as both a voice activated phone and a MP3 player, movie player, camera, for GPS directions, etc.  Buy it and buy all the wonderful accessories for it.  With Sprint's fast and cheap data plan you can surf at high speeds and have any ringer you want!
I bought the Motorola V265 phone with Verizon service in May on sale on Amazon for $99, with a $50 Verizon rebate and a $150 Amazon rebate. So this phone rates super good as far as cost is concerned (assuming the rebates come in OK, which is a big IF). 1 year contract, 450 minutes for $39.99/month.For comparison, my old phone was a Nokia 5165, with AT&T; Wireless (now Cingular) as the provider. I'm a low minutes user, but this is mostly because I got horrible reception at home.I live in Falmouth, MA. The region isn't well-covered by cell towers, and is moderately hilly with dense tree growth. Add to that, the fact that I live at the edge of a bay. So cell strength is a big deal for me. I spoke with co-workers and cell phone accessory retailers and most said that for the street I live on Verizon had the best coverage, although it still wasn't that great.==== Phone Minuses ====-It seems to have a short battery life, although I plan to test this with more rigor and see how it stacks up to the advertised specs.-The sound quality is a little tinny. The Nokia was more far-away and hollow sounding. The sound quality can't stand a candle to even a cheap corded land-line phone.-The camera is pretty awful, but I didn't expect much. Plus you have to pay extra to get your pictures from the phone to your computer.-The extendable antennae doesn't seem to add too much to the signal strength, and seems like it would break easily.-The volume and speakerphone buttons are in an inconvenient place on the side and they are always in the way of my thumb.-The buttons are too small and I'm a person with small hands, too! Other button configurations have seemed easier to use. I liked the raised rubber-ish buttons of my old Nokia better, and even some of the flat-ish buttons that rocked a little.-There's no protective cover for the camera lens.==== Phone Pluses ====-Lots of features to delve into, many I will probably rarely ever use but it's nice to know they're there.-I absolutely love the speakerphone feature.-A must-have feature for me is an external phone jack. A lot of phone models I looked at in stores, while they had the port for the external jack, the actual electronics weren't connected. Having this jack means that  I can go to an electronics store like Radio Shack and buy an external antenna (and the proper connecter) and get a better signal. So far, Verizon's signal is OK as compared with AT&T;/Cingular.-I like the external display; having the black & white contrast helps readability but like most screens I've tested doesn't do well in direct sunlight.==== Verizon Service Pluses (as compared to AT&T; Wireless/Cingular) ====-They seem to take more of an effort at making sure I'm satisfied. We'll see how long this lasts. I have my doubts.-I was able to port my existing phone number without hassle and the procedure took about a half-hour taling to a customer service person on the phone.-The signal strength at my house is much better. With AT&T; Wireless/Cingular, I could not make outgoing phone calls sitting on my living room couch. With Verizon, I can actually make calls, although the clarity is not great. Because of restrictive zoning laws here, most companies share towers, so I suspect the difference is a matter of one critically placed tower.==== Verizon Service Minuses ====- **** Verizon started charging me monthly fees BEFORE the phone arrived in the mail! ****Apparently, if you buy the phone through a third party like Amazon, they deem service to start at the date of purchase, rather than the date the phone is actually turned on, presumably because Verizon can't control the actions of the third party. I asked a Verizon customer service person nicely, and they agreed to prorate the bill for the difference between the date of purchase and the date of delivery. The refund did show up on the next bill.-The billing cycle for the monthly service charges is for the month ahead rather than the month just prior (as AT&T;/Cingular had done). This is likely to cause problems when I decide to end service (see below).==== FOR AT&T; WIRELESS/CINGULAR CUSTOMERS ====I have had tremendous problems on the AT&T;/Cingular end of the porting process.First, the customer service number (800-888-7600) that's on my bill keeps spitting me into the Cingular phone menu. To get around this, one customer service person said, at the prompt to enter your wireless number enter a dummy number (like 000-000-0000) to get into the AT&T; service area. There is one other hitch. Apparently the AT&T; phone menu dumps you into the GSM department. If you have digital service (like I did), you will need to find a way to get to a person in the Digital department (I never was able to do that using the phone menu options).***** Second, AT&T;/Cingular billed me for a full month's montly service charge even when I ended service in the middle of the billing cyle!!! *******I called several times, most times not even able to access a person who could deal with AT&T; accounts. So I did some web research.I found that in March 2004 AT&T; Wireless was sued in a class-action lawsuit for doing this very thing. In the lawsuit AT&T; Wireless was accused of violating the Federal Communications Act and imposing an "unjust and unreasonable" charge by assessing the full monthly charges after switching to another provider before the end of the billing month. Apparently, just recently (in May I think) AT&T; Wireless settled out of court. I think this would have been huge had it gone to trial.So, with this information at hand I managed to finally reach a customer service person who could handle AT&T; accounts. I asked nicely to have the bill prorated. She said no. I told her about the lawsuit, explained that I'd like AT&T; to do the right thing, and she finally relented. She later confided that making the change to have the bill prorated was up to the discression of the customer service rep (!!) so be nice and polite when you ask.On a side note about Verizon: people at my office have had problems with Verizon billing them multiple times for the same call, so be sure to check your statements.==== FOR EVERYBODY ====Depending on the terms of your agreement, you may be liable for a full month's service charge when you change services, even if you stop service a day after the new billing cycle begins. Keep this in mind when you port your old number.*** Be sure to read your service agreement with a fine-toothed comb. You will probably need to spend a couple hours to fully understand it and it will feel like you're back in school in a foreign-language class. BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTRACT. If you don't understand something, get a customer service person to help you. Just like with credit card companies, if it's in the contract, you gotta pay it. ***
This phone is smaller and lighter than the more expensive v710. If you don't need bluetooth, a higher megapixel camera and video capability, then the v265 is the phone to get. Keep in mind that in order to e-mail the pictures you take with any camera phone, you will need to pay extra on your Verizon account for this service.  Verizon makes money on this but it doesn't mean you have to pay for this extra service if you don't want to use it.The Motorola v265 phone does what it's supposed to do and I agree that the Verizon network is the best in many areas of the USA. The analog capability of this phone is a real plus if you like to take road trips away from major metropolitan areas. You'll still have service where digital only phones and providers will be totally useless.Small and light, works well and priced right. In many ways, it's even superior to the much more expensive V710; it's smaller and some have even said the audio quality/reception is better with the v265. In fact, I can hardly believe how good the mic quality is. People I call can often not even tell that I'm on a cellphone! This is a huge improvment over my old cellphone and I'm a happy camper. A good value in my book.
I purchased a Motorola V265 with Verizon service plan from Amazon.  Here is my experience:First phone that I received had these problems: 1) terrible static in both the ear receiver and microphone (basically, I had trouble hearing people on the phone and they complained of not able to hear me clearly); 2) keypad backlight was dim. I notified Amazon and they shipped a replacement V265 right away.Second phone that I received from Amazon had bright keypad backlight, and the receiver and microphone seemed to work fine, BUT the phone's vibration tone did NOT work.I took my 2nd faulty Motorola V265 straight to the Verizon Wireless store and the tech support guy exchanged it with another new Motorola V265 on the spot.  I checked to make sure that the phone sounds clear and is fully functional before I left the Verizon store.  I later shipped the 1st faulty phone I received back to Amazon.So far, my 3rd Motorola V265 is working fine without new problem.  I only use it to make calls.  The camera is totally useless, so don't buy it because of the camera.Lessons that I learned:1) If you buy a Motorola V265, you have up to 66% chance of getting a bad phone.2) Amazon has great customer service3) Verizon has great customer service4) Get Motorola V710 if you want camera and analog roaming5) Get Samsung A670 if you want camera and need no analog roaming6) Get Nokia 6015i if you want analog roaming but no cameraWould I buy V265 if I have to do it all over again? No.
What i like about this phone is it's excellent sound quality. The speakerphone is incredibly good. It's even clearer than using earphone. However, the digital camera sucks. You'll never use it. But if this is not what you want, it doesn't matter. Someone criticize v265 that the backlight of key pad sometimes doesn't light up and think this is an error. Actually, this is because the phone is set to power save mode, which automatically turns off the backlight of keypad if there is sufficient light.The LCD screen is bad. You could barely see what it shows under sunlight.i rated 5 stars since the phone is the best in all fundamental qualities of being a cell phone, such as the sound quality & reception.
GOOD - Good, clear phone with easy to customize features.  In addition, it has a very good speaker phone compared to similar phones, which gives you added option besides the earpiece.BAD - Camera is absolutely horrible!  Very few features, horrific resolution, and very limited brightness.  Also, even if you have another motorola phone, you still can't exchange phone books.
This phone is the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. We purchased three of these phones and all 3 have been replaced. You cannot hear anything unless you use speakerphone.  It also just turns off while you using it.  Please take my advise and don't waste your money.
This is a pretty solid phone, I got it with a two year subscription for 50 some bucks last winter and right now I think its free with 2 year contract. Definitley worth it. If you're just looking for a great day to day phone, this one is great. Its not gonna be the best web browser or have bluetooth connectivity but its got a nice loud earpiece and loud speaker. Screen is a little small (only comparted to the next gens that are out there now) but its not like you have to squint or anything to see. The camera is not that great, but anything VGA really isnt worth even taking pictures.If you're sigining up for verizon, and dont really care about what phone you have as long as you can call people then definitly get this, dont worry about sprining the extra cash for the v710 or e815. But if you're looking for something more stlyish, or with more advanced featuers or a better camera, go for those.
this phone has all features that much more expensive phone has.. right now verizon is offerin this phone for a low price of 49 after rebate.. its perfectly worth it.. the phone has impressive display with atleast 6 color options the blue key light is nice especially in the dark it stands out perfectly clear.. the speaker phone is very good, its clear and easy to hear.. i have had this phone for two weeks and i only charge for about 1/2 to hour at night b4 i go to bed and its on 3 battery bars the whole day.. the only poor qualities i can think of are the camera phone, but if u think about it u are buyin a phone not a camera its only an accessory the other thing the shinny black face plate is easy to scartch smudge with finger prints.. also the name dial feature is totaly usless unless u us standard names like william andrew gary etc..
None of the problems other reviewers have listed here have come up with my new phone (it has only been a week, however...)Its a very cool looking phone with a nice, but smallish screen.It keeps recording a terrible sounding message for the voicemail - but the people I talk to say that I sound perfectly clear on their end, so I don't know why that is happening.As with most phones, the camera is kind of pointless - that's why you buy a camera.  Phones are for phoning, cameras are for picture taking.  Stop trying to get everything to do everything, and they'll work better.
I bought this phone last July, after I finally decided I needed a cell phone for school, work, etc. I bought this one mostly because I heard Motorola was a good brand, it was Verizon (the best service in my town), and I liked how it looked. I read a lot of mixed reviews before buying it, but I decided to go for it. I just want to say that I am overall pleased with this phone and have had few problems with it. I agree with other reviews with a couple of issues, such as the menu being difficult to read in direct sunlight and the buttons being somewhat small. Other than that, I can't think of anything else negative about it. I usually get good service, all of the parts and charging pieces work, and the phone has been durable. I really don't agree with all the reviewers saying this phone is a piece of crap and don't buy it. When I purchased it from Amazon, all the rebates came out so that I got the phone for free and the extra money paid for a month of service. With all the good deals you can get with this phone, it's definitely worth the price. I would recommend the V265 for people who don't want to spend a lot of money but want a reliable and attractive phone.
First off, Verizon Wireless has superior coverage and a great network. I love the phone, battery life better then all the phones ive had in the past and ive had maybe 5 or 6 phones already.Has all the features like txt messaging,voice dialing,mobile web and can download ringtones,games, wallpapers etc. everything works really well. The only thing wrong with this phone is the camera isnt as great as other Motorola phones. i know a couple people with Motorola V400's and their camera is noticably better then the V265's camera, But other then that everything is great on this phone.
I got one of these for free to replace my wife's older candy-bar size phone. Basically, for free we got what we paid for. The phone stopped working after about a month and had to be replaced. It's nice and loud like most Motorola phones, but the voice quality is not particularly good - her calls to me sound muffled. But she likes it OK, mainly because the battery lasts forever, the black color is spiffy, and she can finally control the ringer volume from the side rocker switch without navigating any menus.This phone's too small for me - but if you like tiny phones it's definitely tiny. Camera and screen are of below-average quality.
well this phone is the worst of the worst here folks it might have a cool compact look but buy does that camera make the world seem like it is just a blurr... literally. Crappy reception, in my opinion this phone should get thrown in a lake somewhere.....
I've read the reviews and it's amazing how different they are. I for one LOVE my phone and I think maybe the carrier is the difference.  I have Altel and I love them!  We've tried all of the others and found them to be of poor quality. My daughter had an Audiovox and it was terrible so she switched to the V265 along with me. I love the features, I don't have a lot of knowledge of them but we find them very easy to learn and use.  As with anything, you can't just pick up a piece of electronic equipment and expect to know everthing about it unless you're my husband...lol..he is actually the purchasing agent of a large company and had to try out a lot of cell phones and phone companies before he settled on Altel which is awesome.  I think some people have an easier time learning or catching on to these little gadgets and we are in that catagory. Anyway, I've found Motorola to be very very reliable and I haven't had any problems with mine yet, everyone just loves it and so do I..
Ok, so this phone isn't perfect but I don't know many that are. I have to say that I've had great reception using this phone in most places, even very unexpected ones such as out in the middle of the woods. It's comfortable and the screen is great - when lit!And to be honest, I don't think I've had a dropped call - ok, maybe once - but otherwise it connects most of the time and I don't randomly lose folks as I did with an older Nokia.Buttons are tad bit small, and, in contrast to what I mention above - if the the screen is not lit you CANNOT read it. Bad design for sure.Battery life is pretty terrible, which is one of my biggest complaints for sure.
I got my V265 a few weeks ago, and noticed that it had a tendency to come out of its belt clip.  Unfortunately, it came out for the FINAL TIME without my noticing it.  Can't say that I had it long enough to learn to like or dislike it.  However, Motorola should hang its corporate head in shame for providing that shoddy belt clip.  After talking to others who had the same or similar phone, I find that this is a common problem.  I'm back to using my old Nokia for the rest of my service contract, and won't bother with Motorola crap anymore
I purchased this phone for my elderly father and all it accomplished was make both of us much older! Charging issues seemed to be the primary demon and even after repeated trips to verizon it still was an issue.I finally realized battery charge time option was not set correctly and at least that problem went away! key pad rediculously small , screen you can't read at 20yrs old let alone 80yrs old and a phone conversation volume that would make anyone visit the local drug store for a ear wax removal kit! dropped calls , static if you did connect, clumbsy awkward feel and my fathers relentless complaints have all contributed to the final fate of our v265! I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone except fisherman and hockey players ! If you do purchase one of these phones be sure to get the insurance It's a must if you expect to get a replacment when you throw the thing in the bay!  WITH THE REST OF OURS!
I am on my third v265. I used to have an LG which I thought was pretty generic, but it turned out to be a better phone than this. I dropped my LG in the toilet, so I needed a new phone. I got the v265 because it was the most comfortable/affordable phone available at the Verizon store. I also thought that Motorola would be of better quality. I was wrong.The first phone had a problem with the "voice recognition key". They button was kind of mushy and didn't click when depressed. I noticed it at the store, but thought it was intended to be this way. After a couple of hours I realized that the button didn't function at all. I took it back to Verizon the next night.The sales person tried to replace it with a refurbished phone even thought I had owned this less than 24 hours. I raised a stink and they got a brand new one out for me. They took about an hour to set it up and sent me on my way. This second phone had problems too. The button that was supposed to register that the phone was closed didn't work, so it constantly said "Verizon Wireless" upside down and the key lights would always come on. It also wouldn't hang up when I closed the phone. I took this one back within 24 hours as well. The guy at the Verizon store told me that this was a known issue with earlier version of the v265. I asked why he would sell me an earlier model with known problems, but he didn't have any answer. They tried again to give me a refurbished phone. I wouldn't have it. Eventually they pulled another v265 out of the box and set it up for me. At this point I was ready to get a different phone, but all the other phones at the time were about $50 more. I decided to give this one last try. The sales person claimed that this one was the newer model that didn't have the problems.The third phone hasn't caused me any problems so far. It's been about 3 months. The buttons work and it registers when the face is closed. I don't think this phone is very well built and I think I'll need to replace it within the year. If that's the case, I will try to hold out until I can find a good deal on a camera that has been out long enough to get good reviews.Pros:1. I like that you can use MP3s as ringtones. Not essential.2. Looks kinda cool.Cons:1. The photo quality really isn't that great.2. Too many "known problems" that I have already encountered.3. Fragile feeling buttons4. No bluetooth or IR to transfer photos
About 4 months ago, I strolled into Verizon in hopes of trading up to a better phone.  I previously had a Motorola phone, which I was not completely happy with, but was convinced by the salesman that the V265 was the way to go.  After all, he proudly had one strapped to his belt, and spoke as highly of it as I do my daughter.Four months later, completely out of the blue, the screen has a pulsating flicker and would not turn on. No problem, I simply marched into the Verizon store.  I was given another V265.  A "refurbished" phone.  Great, someone else's used problem.  Interestingly enough, the salesman who sold me my phone was now sporting another non-Motorola phone on his side holster.  Clearly, he too must have experienced all that the V265 doesn't have to offer.After two days with my replacement phone, it too started experiencing problems with the display.  It simply would not turn on.  The genius technician at the Verizon store informed me that I had to "push" the back of the phone in order for it to work properly.  Forgive me, but I did not see this in the instruction manual on how to operate this phone.  This wasn't the type of help I was looking for after wasting my time at the Verizon store again.I think by this point, anyone would agree that this phone plainly sucks, and would be more comfortable with another brand altogether.  Unfortunately, this phone keeps coming back like Columbo, or a bad girlfriend.  I was told by Verizon's Customer Service that it is their policy to continue replacing customers with the same refurbished phones in hopes that one will work.  They do not allow you to switch phones unless you buy a different one at full price.  Thanks Verizon, I'll remember this when my contract expires....This phone is horrible.  The sound quality sucks, the color display sucks, the battery life sucks, and don't even get me started on how finicky this thing is to take a charge.  Need I say more?
After using this phone for a month, I'm about ready to run it over with a steam roller.  The first week seemed to be going great for the phone, and I left for college.  Ever since I've been here, it's been absolutely horrible.  At first, it randomly beeped "Low Battery" so I figured maybe a small error, so I restarted the phone and it would go away.  As weeks went by, it continued to get worse.  I would hook it up to the charger, and it would read "Charge Complete" on the outside cover, then unplug it and "Low Battery" would flash.  I have even let it sit out for the night trying to charge, and I still get nothing.  It would randomly turn off on me, which is quite embarrassing when speaking with a relative.  For a phone that's supposed to be on silent, why does it beep on "Low Battery"?  Kind of the defeats the purpose of silent if you ask me.  The screen unlit is impossible to read, and the phone feels flimsy.  I got this phone on August 8, 2005 and September 19th, it finally decided to refuse to charge or turn on anymore, leaving me without a cell phone.  Considering the other reviews I've read about this phone, I shouldn't even give it a star, it truly is a crappy phone.  If Motorola thought this phone was acceptable to release to the public, someone must have not been thinking straight.  They might want to consider redesigning the battery compartment, as I think that may be part of the problem (easy for the battery to loose contact), but I don't know.  I only gave it two stars, as the call quality was clear, and I received great reception (I do live near a phone tower, but still).  Also, Verizon Wireless customer support is excellent, friendly helpful people on the phone.  All I can say is, spend the extra $ and find a more reliable, solid phone.  My old Nokia 3360 from ATT Wireless was slower, heavier but I never had problems with it.
I bought a V265 in November.  My second one just died (a short of some sort...either way it won't turn on).  I went by Verizon to buy a new phone.  They said they could replace it, or I could buy a new phone at full retail cost.  Now...why would I have it replaced again?  I got 11 hours of battery life, 13-14 at the most.  The charging mechanism does not stay in the phone (most of the time you have to set it at an angle and oh-so-gently put the phone down).  And it continues to break in the same fashion (first, shutting off at random times; then unable to turn on).  I only got the Motorola because my old StarTac lasted for years.  I will no longer purchase Motorola phones, and I'd rather not deal with Verizon's policy to continue to replace the phone (that continually breaks) instead of allowing you to purchase a different model, make, or brand at a price that isn't outlandish.
I love the speakerphone...but the voice dialing never understands anyone who has tried to dial with it. The phone's battery always dies early, and it has had to be replaced three times for various things - mainly it will not close all the way and makes the battery die.
As many have experienced, the Motorola V series of phones continues to have issues making a connection to the charger, either in the car or at home. The connection port on the phone is very flimsy and tempermental. I always had a problems connection to the charger with my previous Motorola phone, and when it finally could no longer connect to the charger (only days after the warranty had run out of course!) I was told the problems with the Motorola phones had been resolved. Needless to say, this was well..bu...innacurate, shall I say?I will never ever buy a Motorola phone again. The present one I have, a second replacement and only 2 months old, is again exhibiting this problem. And to make it worse, because it constantly fluctuates in the car between being connected and not, not only does it make it hard to speak, but it sometimes "freezes" the phone and disconnects the caller.I can't wait to start looking into what Nokia has to offer.
i bought this phone in march and have replaced it twice since then (it's november).  the people at verizon say it is a piece, and they are just poorly made.  generally it works fine for a while, then there is a lot of static on the line.  this is a common complaint, again per verizon.  it's happened twice.  i wonder why they didn't mention it when i bought the phone.  also, it sometimes reboots when you are trying to send a text message cold, i.e. not replying to somebody.  i would highly recommend getting anything else.
There is a glitch in the switch that determines if the phone is flipped open or closed. When I open my phone about a quarter inch the outside screen momentarily shows the time again, just like when the phone is closed. At that point your call will get dropped if you have your phone set to answer upon opening it. It only happens if you open your phone slowly. The switch sometimes malfunctions when I close my phone in that it thinks it is still open. I have to close my phone a couple times to get the outside screen to show the time again which means it is closed.I went to a local Motorola service center. They had a similar gitch when opening their demo phone but not when closing. I was told by them it would take 3-4 weeks to get it back if it was sent in for repairs under warranty. The local service center was out of loaner phones so I was out of luck unless I was willing to give up a months worth of phone service for which I pay $40 a month.The service representative suggested contacting Amazon.  I just tried returning my phone to Amazon, but I was not allowed to return it.  There is a 30 day return policy that appears to be strictly enforced (I bought mine a month and a half ago) even thought there is a 1 year warranty on the phone.  Even if they did allow a return, I would be without a phone for who knows how long while it goes through snail mail. I am angry.Because of the cost of mailing a return and the loss of service while making an exchange, I would NOT recommend buying a cell phone from internet stores like Amazon. Also, I was charged for phone service by Verizon starting the day after I made the purchase even though I did not get the phone in the mail for over a week after the purchase.
I bought two of these phones, hoping for improved battery life and better connections over my old LG4400.  What a mistake.  The V265 is the worst phone I have owned.  The buttons are very small.  The clip that ships with the phone does not hold it. I lost my phone several times before buying a leather holster, which still does not prevent the phone opening when you don't want it to.  I receive lots of voice mails now, because practically no one can reach me directly.  Battery life is about the same as on the old LG.  Overall I traded my LG, which sometimes dropped calls, for the V265 which hardly ever completes them in the first place.  I am seriously considering reactivating my old LG.  I have not been able to transfer pictures from my V265 to my wife's V265.  Verizon customer service told me "huh, it should have worked!".  I recommend you save your money and don't buy this phone.
had the identical problem as previous writer. The phone's exterior display does not recognize when the phone is closed, so it always shows "verizon" instead of the time/caller ID. This is a problem because when I open the phone, it does flicker on, then off, thus hanging up on the person! When I went to return it, the guy in the store confessed that another customer had a similar problem.should be replaced soon. hopefully will get a good one.
It was time for a new every two phone.  Got the V265 from VZ as it was a trimode and looked cool... but the first one developed a major static problem and made it so you couldnt talk on it.. VZ sent out another new one and now only a week later it is doing the same thing.  Thankfully its within the time frame of the satisifaction and VZ is changing me out to a different phone altogether.  Hopefully the Kyocera will be better!
I have a v260 which is basically the same as this phone.  I decided to write in the V265 review area becuase v260 can no longer be found on amazon.  Anyways, I'm on my third phone and when I went to go get it the people at verizon said that there is a KNOWN defect with this phone and that it usually breaks after about 2 months on average.  Why should I have to keep getting this same phone if there is a KNOWN defect?  Unbelievable!!!
A paper airplane with a note and a strong wind is more effective than this phone.  First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.  Now I cannot access my voicemail because it will not recognize me hitting my security code, I even had the code re-set, and it still did not recognize me hitting the buttons.  I have had this phone for a little over two weeks, and this going to be my first and last Motorola ever.  The camera, forget it...I understand that this is a camera phone, and the pictures are not as good, but the pictures are horrid on this one.  The voice recognition is a joke, you have to say it 3 or 4 times, so basically you could of manually dialed faster.  When I do connect, the battery lasts maybe an hour and a half.  I did not get my phone through Verizon, I have mine through Alltel, and I will never forget or forgive them over the way they handled my little own little ulcer builder in my life.  Seriously, if you are thinking on getting this phone, find an alternative phone, even though it looks good; because I am telling you, all you will have is 2 years of having a good looking phone, with no functionality.
The previous phone I had was rubbish. It was the equivelant to American Soccer. Simply appaling. I was about to leave Verizon, when i spoke to the sales representative, one thing lead to another, her sweet sexy voice spoke brilliant colors to me, and she even said, "humm...the camera is actually pretty good." I'm not the first to say, but the camera on this phone is garbage. This phone faces other problems. When in the sunlight, as i normally am in California, you can not see the screen at all. The screen is rather small, and it's bulky. The batty life runs about three hours talking time, but the idle time is about three days. Idle time isn't important though, because you want to talk on the phone. I'm about 7 months into the phone, and it's slowing down on me. Not cool. Verizon is tricky really, because they seem to struck a deal with Motorolla, in ensuring that fine Americans like ourselves get stuck with rubbish phones. Do yourself a favor, get something else, like the LG VX7000, i'm about to purchase that soon. By the way, the Raz'r from singular is just as bad. No inchurance on the phone for a reason. Though i must say, my phone calls don't drop. That's pretty cool i guess.
ok heres the story of my phone...it was found in a pile of snow then my friends girl friend had it for a while...then i got it and its been nothing but trouble.ok it has some cool stuff like a cam and you can email audio to it and what not...but damn its got static issues and mine decided to say "screw it im gonna keep my backlight on 24/7/365!"i enjoy the speakerphone option but even that is pretty crappy...its just ghetto.its a step up from the kx414 i had but still...its caused so many damn issues...if i could afford a new cell id get a LG VX8100...you can store up to a gb on it with the expansion card...so good. yeah dont get this phone its pretty much a paper weight
This  is a very good phone, alot of phones offer the same features but motorola phones are just better than  LG Samsung Audiovox etc. With verizon as your subscriber you cant go wrong clear reception not like T-mobiles garbage system or nextels you keep breaking up trash thats probably why they went to push to talk so you would overlook the clarity. All i have to say is i know you can hear me now.
It is a light weight handy phone. The camara works very well. There are several useful additional features in the phone. The only problem I encountered is, since it is a triband and is supposed to be carried to other countries where there are varient power supply, it should have a universal charger with it. The one that comes with the phone works only in 110V power outlet.
I bought this phone beause I didn't want to swtich my current service.This is a great, easy to use phone. It is perfect for someone who's looking for something easy to work with, it has a simple and in detail user's guide, the battery has a long life span, and it has a good size screen.I read many negative reviews on this phone on various webpages but I still decided to buy it. I have no regrets. A lot of people said this phone has a bad camera quaility. From the pictures I've taken I see no worse quality in this camera phone than any other. A lot of other flip phones have a longer display screen inside which tends to strech the picture. This phone is a perfect screen size that keeps the picture to the right dementions.The caller ID is simple and shows on the outside of the phone when someone is calling. You can set your option to show a picture and where you have to open the phone to answer it.The speaker phone is another good feature on this phone. It is very loud and clear and is perfect for when you are driving or need your hands free.I've already dropped this phone and acidentally smashed it underneathe my chair. There are no sratches on it and its still in perfectly good working condition. A lot of people said this phone was like a toy as was fragile. I don't understand how it can be fragile if I can put a metal chair on top of it; unless the person that said that was throwing this at the wall repeatly or beating it with a baseball bat I see no problems with it.Over all I give this phone a 5 star rating. I've had no problems with it and it is well worth the money you are paying for.
If you want a phone with camera because you actually plan to use the camera this phone is not it, it's rare to get a clear image w/it! It's compact and that's nice for purses and junk. You can find many accessories for it, and if you like musictones they sound great on this phone! I have never had any problems w/reception. I think that the best thing about it is that it is durable. I have dropped it too many times to count on cement and tile, and I didn't break any part of the phone or camera. Seriously though, had it not come free w/my plan I would have NEVER gotten it. It's really not worth paying for.
Bought Motorola v220 with plan from Cingular. After six months, screen just went black all of a sudden. Heard it's a common problem for v220. Everything else was good...
I've had this phone for almost 9 months and have had very little trouble with it.  It's compact, very stylish, and has some great features.  As others have commented, the screen could be a bit bigger, but it's not all that important to me.  My only complaint is I did drop my phone in a parking lot a few weeks ago and now there are 3 nicks on it.  This is my 5th cell phone and all I've dropped on pavement (bad habit I know) but this is the first, though, to show any damage as a result.  Luckily, the damage was only cosmetic.  So, it's not the sturdiest phone, but overall, it will survive some rough handling.
this phone sucks big time!....ive had it for 6 months...now its a piece of trash
I love this phone, I've had it for four months now and it works great. True it has no bluetooth but the infared works just as well. Only fault is that the back case is a little loose but still stays on other than that, this one is a keeper!!!!!!!!
Nokia released 3 (ONLY 3, the 7610 is NOT a part of the group) Art deco mobiles which are all about looks.7260: The Smallest and cheapest7270: The Mediam clamshell7280: The Expensive masterpiece  Since these phones are only made for looks, I give the 7270 one star. I had the phone for a month, very ugly and looks very cheap, also it has the worst assembly which makes look more of a cheap imitation toy rather than a $500 mobile.  As for the functionality, the phone works great, great display, great features, no bluetooth though.  So if you seek envy, crank up your wallet and get the 7280, if you seek envy and functionality, crank up your wallet ALOT and get the $1000 Nokia 8800. But If u seek supremety, get ready to max out a lot of plastic for the $40,000 Nokia Vertu Signature series.
I'm part of the market RIM targeted for this phone - people who really didn't want to carry that blocky blue thing and wanted something a bit more phone-like. Looking around the building, I think they're succeeding, but wow, what a terrible phone.Physically: the phone is light - it also feels flimsy and the casing feels fake. I've already dropped it a few times (par for the course for me in general), and it's survived, but I feel like a stiff wind causes some risk. The screen is already scratching, though slightly and unobtrusively.Blackberry-like features: I also won't extol the virtues of the Blackberry - either you get it or you don't - except to say that Outlook/Exchange integration is excellent, the best Calendar integration, in particular, that I've seen. I don't know why the Contacts don't sync wirelessly, which for me isn't much of a problem but may be more difficult for others. I get emails to my Blackberry faster than they appear in my Outlook. Level 1 messaging, which isn't defined absolutely anywhere for the customer, is a great feature. I cannot comprehend why you can't default the mailbox to your inbox, rather than the everything-you-do-box, but c'est la vie.Much gnashing of teeth about the keyboard. I can empathize, but having never used the normal Blackberry keyboard, I can't compare. I don't love SureType - it doesn't pick up new words well, and I'd like some autocomplete - but it's fine. My bigger problem with the keyboard is I mistype all the time, and I have small fingers. Not sure what happens to the larger-digited among us.My real complaint, though, is that the basic functionality of a phone is _painful_. I ask very little from a cell phone: mostly, I want quick access to the address book, so I can find names when I'm at a traffic light or walking, and I want to do it without looking at the screen very much. In this, the Blackberry fails miserably. I have to turn this dial and click that and type lots of letters and then turn the dial again. Makes me want to throw the thing out the window. This is not a hard problem - every manufacturer has solved it! - RIM could do so too.I want easy-to-lookup Contacts (one problem with the Contact Outlook integration is I don't have names like "Joe" and "Mom" and "Home" in my contacts), but I concede the problem there, though it's solvable.I'm getting mixed results on the reception, either with the phone held to my face or with the included headset.So yeah, I'd buy it again, but I'd hold my nose.(Wrote the same review for the 7100g and 7100t, since they're the same phone)
If you already use a BlackBerry, you don't need me to spend a bunch of time talking about how useful the mail service is. If not, there are plenty of articles about the basics. So, I'll focus on this phone's useability and shortcomings as compared to previous BlackBerries and as compared to other smartphones.The first thing you notice about the phone is the feature you will appreciate the most; the large color screen. I love how everyone harps on the size of the BlackBerries. The fact is that you can't have a large screen and a keyboard on a phone the size of a matchbook. The size of the unit is about as compact as could possibly be expected for what it does.The second thing you will notice is that the battery cover is slightly loose. This makes the whole phone feel cheap, which is a shame because it's actually well-made other than that one flaw. You do get used to it, but it's amazing how much a small defect like that can change your perception of the phone.The useability of the unit is as good or better than the previous iteration of the BlackBerry, the 7290. It takes a few seconds to grasp that instead of having a screen full of icons that you scroll through to get things done, you now have a compact text menu that accomplishes the same thing, usually faster than before since you have fewer things to scroll through to get where you are going. I like it better.Another big improvement: this thing is much easier to hold and use as a phone than any other BlackBerry. Hands down. No possibility of accidentally hanging up on your call because the side-mounted escape key does not perform that function anymore. This was one of my most severe criticisms of older BlackBerries. Now you have a real dial and hangup key. Much better. Also the earpiece is natural and the sound is much clearer. Older units were almost impossible to keep centered on your ear and the sound volume rarely was high enough.The Bluetooth functionality is still nearly zero. I can't tell you how annoying that is. I keep hearing that they are planning on un-crippling it soon but for now the only thing you can use with it is a wireless headset. The one I have worked pretty well with the older BlackBerry units but I find that the volume is too low on this new one. Maybe there is a software or firmware upgrade that will fix this, but I have not explored that yet. NOTE TO RIM: FIX THE BLUETOOTH. NOW. (UPDATE: BlackBerry still has not fixed the Bluetooth. I have now been through three units via warranty exchange and have used three different brands of Bluetooth headsets. None have corrected the volume, and all produce an echo that is heard by the other party but not by myself. Very disappointing. I am seriously considering the 8700c as an upgrade.)Another thing, and this applies to all BlackBerries not availing themselves of the expensive but excellent BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) software solution: there is no "wireless sync" of your email, even though the option appears on your phone. I cannot understand why they don't grey out the option so that users can avoid spending their precious time trying to chase this handy but unavailable feature. With BES, however, your corporate Exchange Server will be continuously and wirelessly synced with your Outlook. This is the ultimate solution.Failing BES, which ordinary users without a corporate server will never have, (plus it costs $2500, making it hard for small businesses to afford either - are you listening, RIM?) you can choose to use the Web Server or the Desktop Redirector. I recommend highly that you stick with the Web Server. The Redirector forces you to keep your desktop computer on all the time, and it is annoying even when it is working properly. Web Server is the way to go here.With the Web Server, your emails come to you realtime, automatically. It's great, and is the key attraction to BlackBerry in the first place. As to the functionality of composing emails, I can only say that the full QWERTY keyboard of the 7290 and other iterations of the BlackBerry is better than this one. I miss it. On the 7100, there are two letters per key, and the phone figures out what you are trying to spell using predictive text software. Generally it works OK, but it is tedious to spell proper names, technical words, etceteras. You need a little more patience. On the other hand, it's a giant leap forward compared to regular phones where you have to multitap to get the right letters. Further, what you give up in text entry you gain in phone dialing, which is MUCH easier on the 7100.This is a true integrated device. When someone calls, it instantly looks up your contact and displays the name as it appears in your Outlook address book. If someone emails you, when you open the email, if you click the wheel the options that are presented are specific to that email; only options that you can actually accomplish will show. You can call the contact who emailed you from this screen, respond to the email, SMS that contact, etceteras. No lookup is required.I found the sync between Outlook and the 7100 to be flawless. MUCH BETTER than Palm OS, and as a longtime Palm user (since 1995) I know what I'm talking about. You can even sync it to multiple address databases (I sync to my personal addresses and my corporate addresses simultaneously) and it did fine with 4500 addresses in memory. It has NEVER locked up on me or performed even a soft reboot.There are a bunch of ringtones, which I could care less about, but they are now polyphonic which is a large leap forward for RIM. And, a speakerphone that actually works rather well.The holster is great as long as you don't try to clip it to your belt or anything else. In other words, it's useless. The holster on the 7290 was very useful and well made. Not sure why RIM moved away from that - big mistake. You won't use the holster. I recommend you just carry the phone in your hand or pocket. Choose a pocket that doesn't have keys or change, though, because this thing will get scratched if you don't take care of it.Overall, I like the phone. I just hope that RIM will address its shortcomings in the next round and come up with the ultimate integrated phone solution (which - trust me on this - doesn't currently exist. Period.) I think it's the best available, including every Windows Mobile device, every Palm device, and every Symbian device, many of which I'm familiar with either from personal experience or from having researched them. The 7100 should tide you over until the ultimate phone does eventually get created. We are probably within a year or so of a five star smartphone, for those of you that can be patient.
This is a very good cell phone and Amazon.com gives the best deal. But, you can't transfer your old phone number from different provider to Cingular through Amazon.com. If you transfer your old phone number, you won't get your mail-in rebate. Please read amazon.com mail-in rebate rules carefully!!!You can read about how to transfer your number through this link : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/508597/102-6686881-6992121
On my request quest for mobile e-mail, I purchased the BlackBerry 7290 from Cingular.  While that phone had a good color screen and filled my require for bluetooth, I found it to be an absolute brick to carry around and to hold to your face when a regular phone was desired.The BlackBerry 7100g released a week later and I promptly traded in my Blackberry 7290 for this one.  This device is almost perfect.  The screen is large and vivid and very easy to see.  It has all of the features that are common to the blackberry's such as the scroll wheel.The thing that impressed me most with this device is its usability as a phone.  While larger then today's typical cell phone, it is modeled after the candy bar phone and is very comfortable to hold and talk on.  The reception is typical compared to my other phones.  Having bluetooth and speaker phone both combined into this device makes it the most usable phone that BlackBerry has available.The only things this device lacks are:  Camera  Real Music/Sound Ringtone capabilities  MMS messaging capabilities
Until now, the cell phones I've been carrying around, get smaller and ligher with each iteration. My last cell phone was a Siemens SL56 - so you can imagine the flashback to late 90s I had when I got my BlackBerry 7100g. Due to my job and the amount of email I get, my company bought me one. I've been pleasantly surprised, the good most definitely outweigh the bad so I'll go through them below.Good1) Email push is wonderful. Real-time emails from my corporate server and my gmail account. Now when I'm in a meeting or on travel I can increase productivity by not having to wait to answer email. I can respond to friends faster also.2) Speakerphone. This is the loudest, most clear speakerphone I have ever heard.3) WAP brower/screen size. I don't know the exact dimensions but it's a big screen.4) Price - this is cheaper than the smart phones with better email integration.5) Weight - it's surprisingly light for a phone this size.6) Holster sensor - this is really cool. You can set your phone profile differently depending on whether its in or out of the OEM holster. Ingenious.7) Suretype - some people hate this. Since I've never had a previous BB and my previous text messages were painfully composed on a standard numeric keypad on the Siemens SL56 - the suretype technology is wonderful. In the 2 weeks I've had the phone, I've sent over 100+ messages and have only corrected a word manually 5-6 times due to Suretype picking up the wrong word.8) PIM synchs faster than the IPAQ to my desktop.9) Scrolling wheel for navigation - again - this is so much better than arrows or 4-way buttons. The wheel is just way more intuitive. It somewhat simulates the scroll on a mouse.10) Multi-tasking: You can have multiple applications going on simultaneously including a voicecall.Bad1) Size - even though its got a better form factor than previous series, it still feels like a brick especially when I hold it up to my face.2) Regular voice-calls. I hear other ppl perfectly. I've been told that if I'm talking in the car while the window is down, I'm incomprehensible. I could get away with something like that on my previous cell phones.3) "No voicemail" SMS popups - when all of your voicemails are checked it sends an annoying SMS that your mailbox is empty. You have to manually delete/close the popup. I know I'm picking at little things, but it's the little things that really annoy me. If anyone knows how to bypass this, let me know.4) Answering a call. It's a little tedious. You either have to press a tiny green call button or push the scroll wheel in (if you have bog fingers you could easily accidentally scroll to the "ignore call" option and send someone to voicemail by accident. Wish they would have a bigger more obvious button to answer voice calls.Overall though, I'm really pleased with this phone. If it were a little smaller - it would be a 5 star phone. I've never owned a BB so maybe I'm being too easy on RIM, but this is a nice feature packed phone which is perfect for the corporate user from a data/voice perspective.
I have a very unique experience with the Blackberry 7100. For the reason that my first purchase of a PDA-phone was a Treo 650. I used the Treo 650 for exactly one week, and then traded it in for my current Blackberry 7100. The Blackberry 7100 is vastly superior for a few signifigant reasons.The reasons are the smaller size of the Blackberry 7100 is outstanding. The Blackberry's e-mail is much easier to sync with my corporate e-mail (which is the main reason I purchased the Treo 650 in the first place), and the phone quality is simply excellent. The Treo's phone was too large and the volume was insufficient.Lastly, the Blackberry is the easiest full PDA phone you will ever use. The new Blackberry has accomplished what they set out to do from the begining. That is to create a phone with an e-mail , browser, and contact manager, that will take you a few days to become comfortable with, not a month.
After carrying around a pda and a phone, I decided to go for something that included both functions effectively. I had a "smartphone" before and though it was small and nice, it was very difficult to type in appointments and data with the tiny keys in it.  The Windows Mobile was pretty good but not what I really wanted. I purchased this phone and immediately saw that I no longer had to bring 2 devices with me.  I have a good function phone with great PDA functions included.  I also set up the phone to receive my personal and my work email. Its good to have all these features in one phone.  The bluetooth works flawlessly and though the phone is a bit on the bulky side, its not very heavy or uncomfortable.  I recommend this phone if you are tired of carrying 2 devices to keep your schedules, tasks and emails.  Really good phone with great features.
If your looking for a slick thin phone that has 100 options and gadgets and advertises with the chic crowd...you know someone wearing sunglasses advertising it, then this phone is not for you. If your like me and and you spend 50 hours a week at work a lot of it traveling and you need the basics done well then this is the phone. No it doesn't have a camera and no it doesn't play music. It does do a really good job of "pushing' ur emails to you, sync's well with your PIM, the phone is definitly the loudest(one of my pet peeves with my other phones was that even all the way up I could barely hear)phone in the earpiece. I 've gotte great reception, the screen is just the right size.  I think the browser works well.  I've not yet had a probelm with battery life. If I had to describe the phone its a work horse for business. The 3rd party software is limited but the only thing I use is a E wallet. I recommend it.
Praise:1.  The new PocketMac software for sync-ing Blackberry to Mac is fantastic.2.  The reception is excellent.3.  Battery life is very robust.4.  Screen resolution is better than average.5.  Menu layout is fairly intuitive and navigation is simple.6.  USB charging capability is handy.Complaints:1.  Mac users, the PocketMac software doesn't come with the phone.  It's available aftermaket only.2.  The trackwheel is undersized and difficult to roll accurately.3.  Because BlackBerry contracts to info-secure government agencies, the bluetooth doesn't support any data transfer whatsoever. Forget using salling clicker or any other fun/useful bluetooth application.4.  The plastic casing is thin and seems inadequately flimsy to house such versatile, rugged software.Summary:  The addition of Mac syncronizing is practical, giving well-designed accessiblity to icalender, address book, and macoffice.  The phone is savy, but the regulated bluetooth capabilities are extremely frustrating.  If you want to have more fun with your phone, check out the Sony Ericsson W600i.
This phone is a pretty good phone; much more liek a phone than the original Blackberry phones. It is about the same size as the TREO 6xx.Here is what I liked about the phone:1) Push email was really useful. That is when the email automatically gets sent to the phone.2) The scroll bar was cool and easy to use.3) Bluetooth was very easy to set up.4) The browser emulated 4 different browsers; rendering the pages slightly differently but adding functionality with certain emulation.5) Able to read attachments without extra software.6) Fairly inexpensiveHere is what I didn't like:1) Big on the waistline; attached to the belt it was a pain.2) Very little software customization out there. No themes, no 3rd party software that was free.3) Push mail service and data service was expensive.....4) No accessories; i.e. cases; docking stations.5) The syncing was a pain.6) Can't transfer files via bluetooth only the earpiece was available through bluetooth.All in all this phone is above average I liked it, and if there weren't other pim/smartphones out there I would have kept it. Due to its size, cost, and compatibility I found the Audiovox SMT5600 to be a much smarter buy.

I was originally using a Blackberry 7510 with Nextel Service, which was great, but Nextel service is limited out in remote parts of the country. So made the switch to Cingular and the 7100. The service is available about everywhere in the country. I drove from Florida to Colorado and never lost a signal. However, compared to the Wife's Motorola, the signal strength is not the best. The email system is good, the same as any other Blackberry. The battery life is excellent. The thing that bugs me the most is the ringer selection. There are about 30 different ringers, but they are all weird sounds, No normal ringers to choose from. Only cheezy sound effects. Oh well. It is cool that you can email your self any picture you want and then use it as a desktop on the phone. Overall good deal.
RIM Blackberry has still not quite figured out how to make a cell phone.  Don't get me wrong...The e-mail functionality is incredible.  However, the phone quality is poor -- bad reception, dropped calls and weak design.It is so bad, that I do not think you can use the 7100 as a primary phone in the U.S.I am keeping it for data, but without the monthly voice plan.  I am ordering another phone for voice.Would that it were were not necessary to do so...
Word to the wise! Don't make a miskate because the return policy between Cingular Wireless and Amazon.com is awful. I have been trying to resolve a return for weeks. In the interim, I received a bill ($149.00) from Cingular Wireless for a service I never used on a phone I don't have and never used.
I love having the ability to get all my email forwarded to the blackberry, it's so convenient. And the improved typing system on the 7100 makes it extrememly easy to reply to them all in a snap.  The large color screen is definitely a big improvement over regular phones.  The 7100 offers not only email capability, but also a large Address Book, Task pad, Memo Pad, Picture storage (which you can download from your emails), numberous built in ring tones, SMS (aka text messaging), an easy to use internet browser, games and so much more.  I love my 7100 and would recommend it highly.
The Blackberry 7100g is certainly a novel concept but execution suffers from all the first-attempt flaws one fears.My biggest grouse is the lack of flexibility in the feature set and set-up. It is designed to integrate with your work email system and contacts or calendar manager - ask anything more and you are stuck.- It is frustrating and difficult to do mundane routine tasks if they have not previously integrated with your email suite (Lotus Notes in my case).- If you choose to separate work and play (RIM why is that so hard to contemplate) it gets worse. For instance, you cannot save numbers to the SIM without a host of steps, and once done, it takes 10 seconds to load those numbers every time you access them. The only solution is to save my grand-aunts phone number at work!- The Java browser is inept at best and page loading times make dial up feel state of the art.- The screen kills the top 20% with an annoying static graphic - why use so much of the screen to tell me the time when it could be used to display an email message. Does it really take a consumer clinic or a consultant to tell a designer that?I am tech happy and love playing with buttons, but this is just too much work. The whole Blackberry revolution is uplifting and showcases how technology makes our life so much more efficient, delve deeper and you realize why technology also serves to frustrate and alienate.
I am really impressed with this phone - checking my emails on the move is the best way to deal with my urgent emails. I am currently using vodafone through (airtime manager)and the recepion is great.
I am using the Blackberry 7250 through Nextel and need to move to a GSM service for business in Europe.  I got a 7100g and immediately put it back in the box.  I expected it to be different, but it's just a piece of junk compared to the 7200 series.  The case is light and cheap feeling.  The thumbwheel is hard to access and the menu structure is less friendly.  Unlike the 7200's, the 7100 screen turns off with the backlight.  No backlight - no screen.  This has got to be tough on battery life.  The screen has a large title bar across the top that takes-up way to much of the screen.  What's left of the screen is simply too small compared to the 7200.  Back in the box and back to Cingular to get the 7290 with the big screen, great thumbwheel, individual keys and quality feel.
I was a Nokia user for a few years with 6610 as my last handset, and I was little hesitant to buy a phone from a different brand, so I ordered the V330 through T-mobile ($100 upgrade) after I was sure I could return it (within 14 days). When I got the phone I was pleasantly surprised that I liked and I was able figure out and use the most useful features at once, so the phone stays! I will give my detailed reactions to the phone to the paragraphs to follow based to my last phone (Nokia). It is a lengthy review, but you can go directly to the features that interest you.Phone Manual: Covers only the basics do not expect to learn everything from the manual; I was kind of frustrated at first but, as I was discovering features of my own I had a discovery satisfaction.Sound Quality: I will only say that I get the filling that the other person is next to me! The speakerphone is not super, is just ok. The volume for both modes is sufficient.Ring Styles: You can select vibrate, vibrate and ring, vibrate and then ring, soft and loud.Ring tones: I have tried it with midi and mp3 songs. The midis are always excellent, however, with some mp3 the sound is not that good, probably because of the process of converting them to smaller file size for the phone, and I plan to find a good mp3 editor to edit my mp3's for the phone. If you upload a regular song the sound is great, but probably it will use most of the phone's memory. The volume of the ring tones is loud enough but compared to my Nokia is not as loud; however, I never used my Nokia to its maximum anyway but it is nice to know that you can.Personalization: You can personalize the wallpaper, colors, screen saver like most phones, but what I liked most is that you can personalize the home keys (cross in the center), left/right menu keys, and smart key functionality: You can assign them anything you want from the main phone menus like: Phone book, AIM, Ring styles, phone status, e-mail, Bluetooth etc. With that feature I have very fast access to the features I need most.Shape: I like the clamshell design, I really like it when I use games, t-zones or any feature because I can hold its keypad horizontal with my fingers and have a pleasant view to the screen.Screen: Very bright and clear screen.Outside Screen: Blue letters, I like that I can easily see the time. I wish if the ringing mode was shown on the outside screen as well.External buttons: With the volume key and the smart key when the phone flip is closed you can change the ringing style by pressing the volume key first, and then the smart key. In addition, when the phone is ringing and you press the volume key the phone goes to a silent mode of ringing, that's useful because sometimes I might not be able to answer it and I might don't want to reject the call.Camera: VGA: 640x480, nothing to be exited about.Java: You can install java games and applications, there many free on the internet, so if the phone misses a feature you would like to have, there is still hope that it might be a java program for that. I install mine either using Bluetooth or WAP, it took me a while to figure it out. If you want to send a java game or app to game or app to your phone from your computer, somewhere in your pc's Bluetooth application it should have an icon named: OBEX Object Push on "Motorola Phone", where "Motorola Phone" is the Bluetooth name of the phone. The only thing you have to do is to drag and drop the ".jar" file to that icon and follow the prompts on your phone to accept and install it.Internet: You can even have an HTML browser on Java (there is one available on the internet to buy), but you have to have the Internet plan in order for that to work. In my opinion it does not worth it to have the internet plan just for that, but if you have it anyway is not a bad idea. By the way, you can access many useful sites just with t-zones like: mobile.google.com, mobile.yahoo.com, in addition to them there many other sites if you do a search for them. For the t-zones e-mail to work you have to have the "T-mobileWeb" feature on your plan which I believe is the same as the paid t-zones option T-mobile used to have.The phone is listed to have its own POP3 email capabilities, but there is not dedicated application for that, I am not sure if it is something on the messages area.Messages: I am not a heavy text messages user but I have send a few regular SMS and MMS and I liked the messages application, however I think this phone (I wasn't able to find it) does not have delivery notifications option for SMS, however, there is for MMS.Bluetooth: Is a nice to have, you can transfer files and use wireless hands free. I have tried hands free operation by connecting my phone to the computer as a head set but the sound was not stable, it will be ok for 1-2 minutes, and then it will be terrible.  However, I tried my phone with HS-850 and the sound is great, in addition, I am using the HS-850 with my computer for internet phone conversations and the quality is also excellent. It seems soundwise my phone and my computer are not a good much, it's not a problem anyway I just wanted to test it out of curiosity.Networks: Quadband (850/900/1800/1900) which works with all the GSM frequencies available. In addition, you have the option to select the mode manually (instead of auto): either 850/1900 or 900/1800. In that way I believe you save power because it only scans in two bands instead of four. I have mine in 850/1900, the USA bands. The reception is as good as my Nokia's, maybe slightly better. The nice thing about V330 is that you can attach an external antenna on the back, this is very useful for me because on the office I have 1-2 bars and I have to be still whenever I am talking to the phone, which the external antenna I am expecting things should much more better.Battery: It takes 3-4 hours to charge when it is empty. In terms of battery life it lasts a day or two but keep in mind I used the phone a lot for calling, wap access and Bluetooth usage so I believe will last much longer after I settle a little and I don't "play" that much with the phone. I am a little bit disappointed for the battery status indicator, is only three bars, I wish it had more steps like in the phone status, battery information which has six bars on there.Phone Book: Not as good as my Nokia, but is ok. If you want to add more information to a name make sure you transfer it to the phone's memory, you can have more numbers for each person but you will have his name appearing as many times as its phone number's. The good thing there is an option to group the same person's numbers when you go through the menu.Voice Dialing: I don't use it much, but seems to be fine.Calendar: It's called date book and is has what is expected from a calendar, does not have a birthday mode like my Nokia. I think this phone does not have to do lists (some sites list it that it has, at least I was not able to find it).That's my experience with V330 so far, thanks for your patience reading my review.
I like this phone. It feels well made and has a beautiful quality generously proportioned screen; a definite plus for folks who like games on their cells. Although the Amazon listing calls it a Tri-band phone, it is in fact Quad-band. Most importantly for me, it speaks Mac. Using a data cable ( pick up a cheapie on ebay ) it functions flawlessly with iSync for iCal and Address Book. The only thing that I'm not very pleased about is that contact email and addresses don't seem to transfer to the phone ( the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ). There might be a way to accomplish this, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.But what I really like about his phone is that it functions quite handsomely as a wireless bluetooth modem. My phone uses the T-Mobile network, and combined with the "  all the data you can eat " program ( around $20 a month ) and my iBook with a D-Link BT adapter, and I'm good to go. The set up is a bit complex, but the nice folks at T-Mobile supplied me with the  info.It's controls are very easy to use and it looks great, I live in a signal challenged area, but I have found that the V330 works better then any other cell I have ever owned. The photo quality isn't anything to write home about, though the zoom feature is pretty effective.  Generally speaking I like my cell phones to have data card capacity, particularly for photo storage, but T-Mobile has a nifty Album feature which lets you store your pics online. I was also impressed by this little phone's sound.The V330 is a real winner!
This was my first clamshell phone, and I like that aspect of the phone, but that's about it.  It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas.  The biggest issue is definitely the battery.  I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days.  This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE.  I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds, but it is extremely frustrating.  Also, I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of the menus, but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time.  I won't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS:POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS:Looks goodCompact
This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone'... more so than the common tri-band devices.World phones are generally equipped w/ both 1900 and 1800 frequencies. Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys. The screen is vivid and bright. The ringtone gets plenty loud. For these reasons, it's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone. I just got one for my mum.Of course, being a quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, the general ease of operation can only be so easy. That 'said,' many a senior probably couldn't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.One more thing - That it's blue, not the de riguer black or silver, I like.A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies. Go 'head on, Motorola.
I've had the phone for 14 months.  It's been very reliable.  I've dropped it many times, got some chips and scratches on the cover, and the phone keeps performing at top grade.  The battery life is getting shorter over the time tho.  I start to charge it every day, when I used to charge it every two days.Voice quality is superb.  Menu is easy to follow (I never needed to read the manual.)  What I like most over other phones is that it captures absolutely beautiful pictures with nice colors and reasonable details.  I also purchased a data cable to tranfer pictures onto my laptop, easy!Unfortunately, the signal reception is poor at my place.  Before you buy this phone, check the reception of T-mobile in your area.  This is a great phone if you are lucky to live at a 5-bar region.  Otherwise, get ready to apologize (to the other side of the line) over and over again every time your call gets dropped. :PBy the way, I'm not sure if this is sth. about T-mobile or the phone-- summer daylight saving time doesn't get adjusted automatically, you have to restart the phone (twice a year).
The two V330 phones are working great in all functions for three months, then one of the LCD screen went blank. However..All functions are intact and i can make calls.. use bluetooth.. speaker phone... just that the screen is all white.  Called T-mobile.. its under warranty.. and will be replaced soon. HOWEVER..  TMOBILE USED TO HAVE FREE HANDSET EXCHANGE PROGRAM, NOT ANYMORE !!! IT WILL COST YOU $9.99 TO SHIP THE REPLACEMENT PHONE EVEN IF ITS UNDER WRARRANTY AND THE PHONE IS DEFECT.If you get a good phone without defect... Good for you..if you get a bad phone... be prepared to spend 10 bucks to exchange a likely refurbished phone (Yes, replacement may be new or refurbished according to Tmobile).
I got the V330 and at first I was greatly disappointed. The phone wouldn't hold a charge for more than 24 hours.  I called T-Mobile and they sent out a new battery.  The phone still didn't work.  I called back and they decided to send out a new phone. Still, the new phone would not hold a charge. I called again.  They sent out a new charger.  The new phone was not working well and cutting out which other reviewers have written to complain about.  Well, I called T-Mobile again and they gladly sent out another phone.  Finally this phone is perfect.  I love it and it stays charged, the camera is great, the speaker phone is great.  No worries.  Yes, it took me working with T-Mobile, but the customer service was amazing.  I never had to pay a cent and in the end they solved each and every problem until I was happy.
I have a small criteria that a cell phone must measure up to:1. must work at home*where I do most of my calling*my parents can hear me very clearly*not full signal since I live more on a hill2. must work at work*full signal strength*is also get good signal around town in San Francisco3. must have bluetooth*wireless headset is a must...we live in the 21st century...wires are no good!The V330 so far meets all of that criteria.  So far so good!I have an Apple powerbook and just upgraded to Tiger.  The iSync did not recognize the V330 which is *not* a big surprise since it's so new but this phone is just like the V551.  So I found this link:[...]I followed the instructions and added the configurations found at that link.  So now the V330 syncs up with my iCal. yah!I don't really care about features like camera or video recording. Yeah it works...blah blah.  My only gripe which is common with other users, the menus are not intuitive.  You have to dig deep into the menus to turn on or off the bluetooth.  Lame.  The datebook is not super easy to get to.  The color screen is nice, but hey I've been staring at a black and green screen on an old Samsung phone for the past 4 yrs...so anything color is nice.
I switched from a Samsung E715, which was a great phone.  As this is my only phone, I need reliability, so I did quite a bit of research, and went ahead and bought it.Pros:Cool looking phone, sets itself apart, for sure.Bluetooth, I LOVE wireless headset feature!Nice screen, sound quality is fine.Cons:Hard to find a good case for it other than the dang puches.Speaker for ringtones and speakerphone is on the back.  If you lay your phone down (or put it in one of the stupid "pouches") you will muffle the volume considerably.Takes forEVER to charge.  Allow at least 4 hours every time.Overall, a good solid performer.  I haven't experienced any of the issues the negative reviews stated, and am very happy with the phone.The BT headset I am using is the Cardo Scala 500, and they match up well.I have been a Tmobile customer for three years, and while I can get better coverage elsewhere, I have been spoiled by Tmobile's customer service, so they keep my business.
I'll start by admitting I've only had the phone for 2 weeks. So far I'm pretty happy with it.  (As some other reviews pointed out, this phone only became available in May.  Reviews saying people have used it for months are probably mistaking it for the v300.)  The jury's still out on T-mobile.Pros --Pretty good voice sound quality-Good sound quality on mp3 ringtones-can communicate with laptop using bluetooth without additional software (I was able to add mp3s)-Screen is very bright-Very long redial list - 10.  (My old phone had 5)-Works well with the Motorola HS820-The size is nice-Plenty of faceplates available (I noticed someone gave it a bad review because it's blue - that's changeable!)-Speakerphone's clearer than I expected it to be.-Buttons are easy to use and intuitive-Outside display is easy to readCons --I'm sure I read somewhere it has USB connectivity. I want to clarify that it does NOT come with a USB cable.-Motorola didn't include any sync software.  It's available for an additional charge.-Menus are not intuitive.-The phone takes FOREVER to turn on.The camera is a typical phone camera.  I certainly won't be using it to take any special shots I want to keep forever. I wish it could store addresses along with phone numbers.I've been using T-mobile for 3 years.  I had a samsung phone from Voicestream, which was bought out by T-mobile quite some time ago.  Just in the last 6 months I started having a dead zone in my neighborhood and in a couple of other areas around town (Savannah, GA) where I had previously not had a problem getting a signal.  When I contacted T-mobile, they told me I needed to get a new phone.  Unfortunately, that didn't help.Although it isn't perfect, I like it better than any of my other cell phones or any others I have used.Just a tip - if you are replacing a phone, you can transfer the sim card long enough to copy your phonebook.  If you don't have your numbers saved to the sim card on your existing phone, there's probably an option to copy them there.
I just let go of my motorola v188 and went to the store to get a samsung x495 from T-mobile, but what i saw on my screen was not what i saw at the stand.  The Samsung was not what i wanted.  Though it had all the features i was looking for : speakerphone, hifi, it did not look sturdy.  And the white outlining was horrible, not that i care that much, my cell goes in my purse.  So i really had to shop.  Finally I ran into the V330 (didnt like the color) but the sturdy look was perfect (i have two small kids).  When the associate was exlplaining all the features i was impressed. Especially by the blutooth--that is a plus for me.  The camara I didnt care about because I have a digital camara of my own but it became a plus because my husband decided on the Razr so we could pic message eachother (his in the army so his gone alot).  And the fact that both the razar and the v330 are both international its a plus too.We are stationed in hawaii and get fairly good reception here but I have noticed that our previously owened v180's didn't get as good reception as the V330 and the razr.  I wasnt able to use it in my house downstairs now i can talk anywhere in my house, some places better than others-but its better!Aslo I campare the V330 with my husbands razr alot.  The reception is the same.  we will have like say 3 bars and his will change to four then mine will change a second later.  . All the features all the same only his phone looks better but his a guy what can i say!OH and the voice quality on both the phones are the same so clear!!!!  and loud ringers!!!We are both happy with our phones, i would say we bought two of the best phones out there!! thanks
This is a very nice phone.  Much nicer than my Razr V3 that I returned 3 times because of the high pitched whining noise... if you can live with high pitched static when answering calls (yes, this only happens when answering... NOT when making an outside call).  I like the color (and toying with changing the face plates) and the functionality with great battery life.  Its camera is pretty descent as far as cell phones go.  It is clear and works.  It is not super fancy, though it has a lot of fuctionality.  I am a bit disappointed that T-Mobile and Motorola don't have more choices right now, as I would have been happy to buy them.  Anyway, if you want a good phone with Bluetooth (BT), then this is a very good one.
UPDATE II: We have owned and used 2 of these phones for well over 6 months now. In that time period I managed to drop my phone a number of times, sometimes on very hard surfaces. Other than light scrathes and a slightly misshapen antenna, the phone works perfect. Does it ever drop a call? Yes, if the reception is poor. This is a function of the network rather than the phone. Our phones have not frozen up a single time. I can send and receive text messages just fine, no problems. I never turn this phone off. It needs a recharge every 3-5 days depending on usage, which is quite reasonable. Recharging does take a rather long time, several hours, but hey, nothing's perfect. As far as displays "just breaking": please do not store your cellphone in a cement mixer, people! This is a brilliant and sturdy phone, and all the people writing bad reviews have some sort of grudge against T-mobile or Motorola, which is OK, but don't knock a perfectly fine phone in the process.UPDATE: a LOT of the negative reviews are about the V300 which looks very similar to the V330 (identical really, except for the keypad) but lacks many features and in general is far inferior. Any reviews starting with "I had this phone for a year" and similar are NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS PHONE. This phone became available in April of 2005.I have owned about half a dozen cellphones over the years. I never paid (after rebates that is) for one and I intend it to stay that way, so this review is not for those willing to blow wads of cash for the latest and greatest because they use it professionally or have an all-overriding need to hear people gasp when they take their phone out of their pockets. Obviously, you would not expect a "better than free" phone to have the absolute greatest specs available. Still, the V330 is a surprisingly full-featured phone.I also believe that discussing coverage issues is largely moot in phone reviews, because depending on your geographical location, you may think that signal strengths are absolutely perfect, or that (put your provider here) is the worst carrier ever. I get five bars at my house, but only two or three at my work.So far I only talked to customer service once, but they were perfectly helpful and hold times were not excessive.When I was shopping around for this phone I had a few requirements that I definitely wanted:1. It had to be a flip phone. I had enough of the "bar" type devices, especially the cumbersome process of locking the keypads and difficulties of answering calls quickly when fishing it out of pockets, backpacks, etc.2. It had to have a camera. This was just to make it a bit more fun. Seems like you only have half a phone without it.3. I would have liked a quad-band phone so that I could use it anywhere during my travels.I was not too worried about bluetooth, voice dialing, or speakerphone capabilities, but it is definitely nice to have those as well. Bluetooth is especially sweet because you can easily up- and download pictures, games, create new ringtones, etc. without having to pay all those fees to T-Mobile. It is too bad that they have no games on their T-zones yet though.The phone has a decent battery life as well, although leaving bluetooth on does shorten it considerably. The keypad is well laid out and handy, and the "joystick" button is easy to use and fairly intuitive. All in all it is a good phone, voice quality is great, and I can actually hear the person at the other end which was not always the case with my previous (Nokia, Samsung, Mitsubishi, etc.) phones.Now for the few and minor shortcomings: The manual is much too brief in the discussion of the many, many features of this phone. Most of the omitted stuff is fairly straightforward to discover though. The built-in memory is not all that plentiful (5 MB). This could certainly be improved upon. Voice dialing takes a bit of patience and I am not fully convinced it is a very useful feature. And the phonebook lists each number separately even if they belong to the same person, resulting in tons of duplicate lines. This is probably the most annoying feature of this phone. But for the money, I can live with that.
Okay, so I have only had this for a couple of days so I can't really speak about battery life, but I am already lovin' this phone. Having bluetooth and mp3 ringtones is awsome; I will never pay for another ringtone, AND they are the actual song (MIDI can go to hell). Quad band GSM is cool because I know that I can get service anywhere in the world. I havent had it freeze or anything. The main display and the camera look great, in some cases the digital zoom is actually useful for shots that will stay on the phone(normally throwing away pixels make cameraphone images look horrible). The quality of the speakerphone and the voice quality  is average, but nothing to complain about. The external screen is sharp and is quite legible even w/o the backlight, imho. Its up to debate whether not having an external color screen is a bad thing, as a color screen needs the backlight and therefore wastes more power. The phone is compatible with any standard 2.5mm headset, which is nice. So the only feature that I really regret is the lack of a flashcard slot. I guess they do this because thats one of the few features that only the high end phones have, but if this had a transflash slot I could use this as an MP3 player (although this this would obviously require the data cable instead of bluetooth). Another very minor quibble I have is that the photos are too small when you have them for picture caller ID, they could easily be a sqaure inch, but the images show up in 1/4 of that size (even though the extra area is completely wasted!). All in all, however, I am very pleased with this phone, I paid $100 for it AFTER rebates, so the price here is a steal. GET THIS PHONE, is all I have to say.If you do get this phone visit [...], you can download great wallpapers (just use the ones for the v300, since they are the same)
[...]On to the instrument now. This phone has the following pros and cons (IMHO):PROS:------1.  Bluetooth: Amazing feature which allows you to download all the pictures and videos from the phone apart from ofcourse the hands-free option. The bluetooth features included are File Transfer, Dial-up Networking etc.2.  Speakerphone: The speaker on this phone is of a real good quality. Of course the quality also depends on the signal strength.3.  External Display: Well light for digital time display, signal strength, battery life and bluetooth indicator. How much more can we ask of an external display?4.  Keypad: Well organized, decent color schemes, ergonomically designed and everything in its place. Some people whine about the T-Mobile logo but its no bother for me.5.  Software: I have always liked the software on motorola phones. Good amount of choice in ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers with download options too. The networking and connectivity is great and office tools (calendar, calculator etc.) live upto expectations. The only flaw in the phone book (as one reviewer pointed out) is the lack of categories (home, work, mobile etc.)CONS:------1. Dimensions: It is a bulky phone which requires a belt clip if you want to save yourself the embarassment of a bulb shaped pocket. If you don't want to wear a clip I'd suggest the RAZR for a few $$$ more.2.  Weight: It is certainly one of the heavier phones in the market. So if you are moving from a lighter instrument you might want to consider this issue.3.  Display: The display screen has the magical powers of going black when the display light goes out (default is 20sec but I had to set it to 60sec to work with bluetooth). Ofcourse by pressing any key it will get back on.4.  Antenna: Considering the fact that this phone is heavy and bulky the MOT guys could have shown some mercy on the size of the antenna. It could have been more like the antenna you would find on a T722i.5.  Camera: It's not the best resolution but would work if you are not looking to make a photography career by using the camera on this phone.I have been researching cell phones for 2 months now. If you are looking for a decent flip-camera phone which won't cost you very much but has the latest features (bluetooth, speakerphone) for a 1 yr contract ... go for the V330.
First of all, the reason I bought this phone is solely because of its quad-band capabilities.  I travel all over the world, and its good to always be in touch with people no matter where I am (and believe me, I've been to some strange places.)I didn't buy it for the Bluetooth technology or for the built-in camera, though I'm sure they work great too.  To me, a camera phone is a camera phone, and while the Bluetooth technology is exceptional from what I've heard, I have no intent of looking like a cyborg walking down the street.  So scratch that from my decision making.Anyway, the last phone I had was the Nokia 6610 (tri-band.)  It's also a great phone, just a bit outdated (that, and I've superglued it back together twice.)  Comparitively speaking, here goes:1.)  The V330 definately needs to be clipped to your belt, otherwise you have a big bulge in your pocket (no pun intended).2.)  While it weighs 4.3 ounces, is not heavy.  Compare it with all of the new stuff coming out, and it's light.  Besides, if you can't handle 4.3 ounces, then how do you drink beer, with a straw?3.)  My biggest annoyance is the phone/SIM card memory.  Obviously, the phone does not work without a SIM card.  If you're like me, you want your numbers to be storred on both the SIM card and the phone memory, just in case.  However, if you copy everything over from your SIM card to the phone memory, you end up with every number you have being listed TWICE.  There is absolutely no way to tell the phone to only show SIM memory or only phone memory. (I even asked tech support.)The only way to see the numbers once is to have them saved ONLY to your SIM card or ONLY to your phone memory.  The problem is that the SIM card holds 250 entries, while the phone holds 1000.  Given the choice (which I shouldn't even have to do), I use the phone memory.  I actually had to put the SIM card back in my old phone to erase it, as the only way to do it in the V330 is one at a time.4.)  My other quirk is the users manual, primarily the phone book.  The instructions are terrible!  I'd like to think that I'm an intelligent person, but I litterally had to experiment to figure out how to use its features.  And this goes for almost all of the features.  1-Touch Speed Dialing, which you can only use from the phone memory, isn't even talked about.  And the "Smart Key" on the side of the phone, I've yet to figure out what it even does.  I guess I'm not smart :-)5.)  The last thing I care about is the fact that I can't lock the phone without going through about a 5 step procedure to do so.  If you don't lock it, the outside butons get pressed, which changes your ringer settings (vibrate, loud, etc...).  If you do lock it, then you have to press a code to answer the phone if it's ringing (hope you remember it), and meanwhile, it keeps ringing and bothering everyone around you.So that's my critique.  I plan on keeping it, just to see if I like it better over time.  It was painful to get it set up the way I want it, buut I eventually got it there.  Just a few leftover annoyances that I'm sure I'll get used to.  Personnally I like the Nokia 6610 phone (as I don't use all of the bells and whistles).  the only reason I got this one is because of it's quad band capabilities, which I haven't yet tested out.
This phone sounds allows calls the be as clear as a land line. I am a former ATT/Cingular customer and just switched to Tmobile, this phone, combined with the great service has been excellent. When I talk to people on it, they think I am on a land line. AMAZING. Very pleased with the V330
Purchased the v330 from T-Mobile two weeks ago. Note I have not tried the bluetooth technology yet.Pros:- Great sound on both ends, even while traveling- Never have had a call dropped. Strong signal while traveling in SE Ohio- Easy to use- Small for the amount of features- ITap text works great- Good customer service- Voice dialing works! (But you can only voice dial numbers stored in the phone memory, not the SIMM card)Cons:- Does NOT come with USB cable and software to download pictures/video from phone to computer. About $50.00 to buy cable/sftwre from T-Mobile- The Call/End buttons are reversed from the every other phone- Speaker phone does not sound good at all- I carry the phone in my pocket. The button to change the ring styles is on the side of the phone. My pocket lining has changed the ring style a few times without me knowing it- At the time of this review, T-Mobile does not support any games downloads for the v330- Poor documentation on how to use ITap for messaging- Comes with AOL IM instead of Yahoo! IM, although Yahoo! IM can probably be installed- Message inbox memory limited to about 30 messagesUpdate: 14FEB06 - I have had to have the phone replaced because it would not maintain a strong signal and kept dropping calls.  It took about a week of calling customer service to get them to replace the phone, and then they made me return to the dealer to have the problem verified.  That is when I found out phones replaced under warranty may be refurbished.  In addition T-Mobile charged me to ship a replacement phone covered by warranty.  I talked to a few friends who have had their phones replaced with other service providers, and they were not charged shipping.On the bright side, games are now available.
Bought this phone directly from T-Mobile. You have to be careful when reading ratings; people are rating the wrong phone, picking on their service, etc.etc.I've had this phone for 2 weeks; charged it 2 times.  Batteries will not last as long when you take lots of pictures, use bluetooth, mess w/ it all the time, etc., it's just common sense.Everything works, good choice of ringtones, decent pictures, battery life, features and on and on.  Really can't go wrong, especially when it's free.
First off, anyone who says they had this for for 6+ months (or 1 1/2 years for the matter) is ignorant and confused with the V300.  The V330 is the culmination of the V300 and the V600.  It has the sex appeal of the V300, along with the pimp appeal of the V600.  Coupled with a bluetooth hands free head set, this phone surpasses most every expectations.  Among the most notable qualities are voice dialing, mp3 ringtones (which can be transferred directly from your computer via Motorola's Mobile PhoneTools 3.0), video camera in 2 modes, VGA digital camera with 4x zoom and AIM with the quickness.The cons a few and far between:-Aim use is charged PER MESSAGE through T-Mobile.  Unless you have the 500 SMS messages for 2.99, AIM can rack up a few extra dollars-The video camera is hard to configure to get the longest video/audio clips.  However, if you wanna call motorola, the reps in Iraq will get you all the facts on recording video within 5 min.All in all THIS PHONE ROCKS!!!
My problem is with the carriers who do not get the best possible deals from the phone manufacturers. I have seen lots of great deals where with a NEW contract, you can get a great phone for nothing. Yet if you have been with T-Mobile, or any of the service providers for a long while, they can not give you that great deal you may find elsewhere.I think the service providers are missing the boat and loosing customers because they do not reward customer loyalty, but rather prefer to spend additional money to recruit new customers.I have been with T-Mobile at least 3 years, maybe more, and have put all three of my kids, plus our foreign exchange student on T-Mobile. Now I need a new phone, and wanted the free deal on the MotorolaV330 I saw on line but thye can not give me that deal. Makes me want to let my contract run out so I can come back next year and get the better phones that the current loyal customers can't get.Just had to get that off of my chest.
The Motorola V330 Phone (T-Mobile) has a known audio connection defect.  Both T-Mobile and Motorola are well aware of the audio connection problem as they get a large number of them returned for this vary reason.  There is a one-year warranty on this phone and both T-Moblie and Motorola will return it when it breaks within the warranty.  However, they only replace the phone with the same junky Motorola V330 you just returned and (((it will break again))).  After Walmart, T-Mobile, and Motorola giving me the runaround on the one year return policy T-Mobile finally exchanged the phone.  However the exchanged phone only worked for 3 weeks and then it had the same audio connection problem.  When I contacted T-Moblie and Motorola they said I could get a new price of junk Motorola V330 for only $150.00 or I can pay to have mine fixed for $100.00 The Motorola customer service rep located across the globe in India was so nice she said she would even give me a 10% discount since I have had trouble with their defective product.  I said that's great I have only been paying $50.00 a month for the past 24 months for a cell phone that does not work due to your company's problem.I would advice anyone that has the misfortune of buying this phone to contact their states attorney general, consumer protection agency, and find a lawyer that is doing a class action lawsuit against defective audio connectors with the Motorola V330 phones.
This is the worst phone we've ever owned. Drops calls like crazy, poorest reception ever, keypad locks up constantly, and the charger works intermittantly. First phone I have ever paid money for and the 5 free phones I've used before this one have all worked ten times better.I would not buy unless you are going to use the rebate towards a different phone!
I love this phone. It has a unique look to it (not like the normal silver look with most phones today)and I love the keypad. The only thing that sucks is you have to turn it off every now and then in order to send and receive text messages. The camera on the phone is not bad either. I only have to charge it every other day and the charging time is not long. Love it!!!!
I love this phone.  It has great reception- in places that my old phone had only 1 or 2 bars, this phone has full reception.  It is easy to talk on, and the bluetooth feature works well.  The camera takes good pictures.  i am very impressed with the "flip" mechanism on this phone- very sturdy.  A great phone!!
I am on my THIRD V330 phone now, and am about to demand that T-Mobile supply me with a completely different model. The first one wouldn't charge because it wouldn't recognize that the charger cord was plugged into it, the second one had LCD screen problems and wouldn't hold a charge, and for this third one I had a new battery sent to me from Motorola and a new phone, but SURPRISE, I've had it for less than a week and already it won't hold a charge. This phone is a piece of crap, and after looking it up on the internet, I found that a lot of people are having these same problems.
I just purchased a V330 and have fallen in love with it! Reccently I had a V300, and thought it was pretty good, but the feature difference between the two phones is amazing. The V330 has so many more capabilites.... the reception is much better, the screen brighter, the camera greater, the look sleeker.... everything about my new phone is great! Keep up the good work!
Atlanta, GA here, and fairly satisified after using this phone with t-mobile for about 3 months. Calls fade or get dropped occasionally, but this could have been a problem with the person/network on the other side of the connection. Overall, call quality has been OK. Not many complaints on the interface, but sometimes it's annoying to have the ring tone selection buttons on the outside of the case (keys get pressed by other items in my pocket). I use it with a motorola bluetooth headset and works great. Highly recommended if you want to talk while driving. Love the MP3 ringtone because I can have it play whatever I want when someone calls. As for other features (camera, video, etc.), can't say much about them because I don't use them much. A solid phone, given the price.
I am extremly happy with this device and would definately recommend this phone to all who are thinking about getting one.First of all it has very nice reception capabities.Very nice options it apears to be an all around nice quality bang for your buck kinda cell. (hope this helps)
Good:The screen is big and bright.  The sound is loud and clear on the handset and on the speakerphone.  You can transfer your own Midi and MP3 files for ringtones from your Mac (avoiding network fees).  You can store 4MB of JPEGs on the phone for a brag-book.  Speakerphone on V330 can be activated anytime during a call.  No software install nec for Mac OS.Less Good:Some of my favortite features (like calculator) are deep inside the menus.  Mac OS iSync works only over USB cable (and it's a special Motorola cable for this model), and file transfer works only over BlueTooth.  But they both actually work!  Sound is distorted over standard audio plug earpiece, but sounds great on the BlueTooth earpiece (for $80).  Be carefull using the holster accessory (make sure it clicks). Camera is VGA (it is just a phone, after all), but works well in low light.
I have this phone for the past 2 months and I wanted to get rid of this junk. They charge an exorbitant price for this phone, but ultimately it is a useless electronic toy with no real purpose served.The reception is pretty bad with T-mobile and every one in five times, I miss the call. Speaker phone is horrible, my friends always complain about a loud noise.Battery life is okay, but noway matching to that of Nokia's. Motorola has to learn from Nokias, I cant imagine how the Moto Engineers come up with such a clumpsy design.The front display panel broke all on a sudden. Remember , not even 2 months are over. I called the T-mobile customer service and guess what ? They dont cover this under warranty ! They cover only manufacturing defect; to my surprise, they dont think it is a workmanship problem, putting cheap quality parts in their phones.Overall I would rate this phone much below the average expectation and very poor in design and quality. One might argue that there are one thousand other features on this toy, but if it can't serve the basic purpose of a phone, I dont think it can be called as a phone.
I've had this phone for two years now, and I'm really disappointed with it. When I first got it, it worked great, loved taking pictures and messing around with the ring tones and all that. After a while though, I noticed that the whole phone seemed to degrade before my eyes. The earpiece in my first phone went out (I'm on my second one now), and I had to put everything on speakerphone or dig the phone into my ear just to hear somebody. I figured I could live with that, it wasn't too bad, and then the phone began to display the message UNABLE TO CHARGE. Now, anyone with this phone longer than 2 weeks may begin to see this message. I called the T-Mobile customer service/tech. support guys and they said it was a factory defect. So this phone is pretty much bound to fail and stop charging after a period of time. When I called customer service and asked them to replace the phone, they tried to get me to do the whole song and dance of "Did you check the cord?" but they eventually sent me a new phone. I've had the new phone for about 2 months now, and the earpiece is shot already, I can't hear ANYTHING out of it, not even if I dig it into my ear. Every now and then, I even get that message that says UNABLE TO CHARGE and it's becoming more and more frequent. Luckily, my plan is up soon. Overall, I would say pass on this phone and ignore the reviews that say "This phone is great! I've had it for 12 years with no problems!", it's just the T Mobile guys trying to work you over. Just remember two words when you read their reviews: FACTORY DEFECT.
My old Nokia almost never dropped a call, but my new Motorola V330 can drop from 1 to 4 calls per day, in the same area, with the same service provider.  Everything else about the phone is very good, except the ring volume button is outside the flip top, and it is easy to accidently change it to soft or silent, and then miss a call.  It would be better if this button was protected, like the key pad is.
The battery life is poor and it takes 6 hours to charge this monster.  The phone quality is a bit flimsy especially for motorola; so don't drop it or buy a really good case.  Outside of that the phone works and the camera is o.k.  If I had the choice again I would go with a nokia phone.
I have had this phone for a month now and have been quite satisfied with the phone and T-mobile. I do have to say to be weary of all the initial plan charges.  I am especially dissatisfied with double taxation, first on the activation fee and then on the monthly fee. Thus, a $35 activation fee is more like $42-$45 per phone. Back to the phone, it is easy to carry, has good reception, although occasionally calls just disconnect. The phone is the perfect size to keep in a purse, and since it has a rubberized top, it doesn't get all those scratches you normally get from keeping the phone in your purse.  I also recommend making use of the bluetooth technology.  This phone supports v1.2, so I also purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth Headset ($39), and it works great. You can keep your phone in your pocket/purse or while driving and not be bothered by carrying it. Other user's comments also apply:Pros:- Good customer service- Voice dialing works! (But you can only voice dial numbers stored in the phone memory, not the SIMM card)- Small, rubberized top, good sized buttonsCons:-Multiple phone entries for one person-Honestly, too many features, which can really be confusing and probably will end up never using them-Because of all the features, the battery does not last as long as my previous monochrome Samsunglast, but it is not bad-Does NOT come with USB cable and software to download pictures/video from phone to computer. About $50.00 to buy cable/sftwre from T-Mobile-The side buttons for ring tones and other programmable functions such as the phonebook are awkward, sometimes I don't know which ones to pressOverall, I recommend it.
The difference between a good cell phone and a great one is in the small details, which this phone misses.On the positive side, it has almost all of the features I want:1.  Big 2.2" color screen with SVGA quality2.  Bluetooth for wireless earpiece/microphone.3.  Built in speakerphone4.  Voice activated dialing with bluetooth5.  640 X 480 camera with 4X digital zoom6.  AIM Instant Messaging7.  Plays JAVA games8.  Internet and instant messaging9.  Large 5 MB memory capacity which can store lots of pictures, video and games.10.  You can purchase a cable and software to u/l and d/l pictures, ringtones, etc. directly from your computer.  With a little hunting on-line, you can also get software to really mess with the phone!11.  Most thematic elements can be changed including Polyphonic ringers, wallpaper, screensavers, etc.So, what is wrong?1.  The phone book is misorganized:  Almost every person I want in my phone book has a home phone number, a cell phone and a business phone.  I want a phone book that has one entry for each name, and then a subdirectory for each of the different phone numbers and e-mail addresses.2.  The 5 way navigation key with center button is hard to use as it is too small, and the button in the center is hard to push, particularly if you have large fingers.3.  The "call" and "hang-up" keys are not properly backlit so that it is almost impossible to see them at night, even in a nearly pitch black room.  (Why is the camera button well lit when you have no need for a camera in the dark?)4.  The hands-free voice dialing requires such precision in the timing of saying the name, and you have to say the name loud, and in a quiet environment, or it won't work.  This virtually requires you to look at the phone when saying the name, which defeats the purpose of "hands-free."  A person can look pretty stupid yelling out someone's name over and over again in the middle of the shopping mall.5.  The phone is a bit on the heavy side, at 4.3 ounces, although not horribly so.  (For example, the Motorola Razr and Sanyo SCP8200 weigh in at about an ounce less.)6.  The front screen is the typical little motorola blue/gray clock display instead of a proper color screen.7.  The built in speakerphone is not loud enough, particularly when using the Motorola/Cingular leather phone "glove" as it covers the speaker.In summary, it is a good phone which, if Motorola had invested a bit more creativity and care in developing, could have been a great phone at the same price.  Again, it is the details which are wrong.
Ok, well first of all I want to make clear that I didn't buy this phone through amazon.com, I bought it directly through the tmobile.com website. When I decided to switch from cingular to another carrier I looked at verizon and tmobile, after hearing that tmobile wasn't as good as cing or verizon I was a little worried, however at least in my area (South FL... Miami/Fort Lauderdale area) I get great reception everywhere I go and even inside my own house which is great because I didn't with cingular. Of course you all know that this has nothing to do with the performance of the phone. Ok, so I've had the phone for about a month, ignore people that say that they've had this phone for around a year... they're DUMB... this phone came out May 2005 so they're referring to the Motorola V300 NOT the V330... they look exactly the same except for the awful keypad on the V300. The V330's keypad is more like the V551... it's nice and organized and not crazy looking like the V330. The phone has a nice screen, it's bright and colorful, and if you put it on the brightest setting you can see it outside in the FL sunlight which is great.  The battery life is good too, I get around 5 hours of talk time which is better than my old phone, I use my phone a lot for text messaging, making calls... so far so good. The camera takes good pictures, if it had a resolution of 1 MP it'd be awesome, but the pictures are ok quality and besides I got this phone to make calls and not to take pictures. The menu is great, you can customize it however you want, even the left and right soft keys... you can assign whatever you want. The only downside to this phone is the phonebook, it could be better but unfortunately it takes a while to figure out how to use... those who say you have more than one entry are partly correct... you need to save your contacts on the phone, if you want to add another number for the same person you scroll down to more... then you add a new #, however you're not done yet... in order to only see 1 # for you contact you must go to your phonebook press the menu key, scroll down to setup, then in view change it to "Primary contacts", it's on all contacts by default... after doing that you should have 1 entry and you'll have more than 1 number for you contacts, you can even add an email address if you want. Besides the phonebook this phone is great, I'm more than happy with Tmobile's customer service, reception and most importantly my phone... motorola definately made the V330 a great phone.
Ok here's a  first Q, are the people who gave this phone a horrid rating check to make sure it was the V330 and NOT the V300? That brings me to my second point, the look of the phone is almost exactly the same as the V300 (now THIS particular model was almost crappy) so people might have confused it. A friend got this phone a little while ago and so far he seems to have no problem with it, in fact he is immensely satisfied and I am myself planning to get this phone and after much much asking around and reading countless reviews, I dont think the phone has bad reception OR drops calls , I would blame T-Mobile in some areas. So practice before you preach!!!
I had been using cell phones for the past 15 years in two different countries. Many people rated this phone like it is really bad and I believe this ratings are unfair.If you only had used Motorola phones in the past, like in my case, none of the features like the SENT button in the right is weird. I have a phone from work made by Nokia and I really can't get use to it because the SEND Button is on the left :-).Before buying this phone from  T-mobile I went to a store and played with one, I recommend to do this with anything you are planning to buy from an online retailer, if you know the product before hand it will not surprise you when it arrives in the mail.I recommend this phone! I love the bluethoot headset, no cables!
I bought this phone in July. Wait about 2 weeks to get my phone. overall is fine, but the battery seems not good. Each time it uses about 6 hours to charge the battery. Like today, it has been charging for almost 14 hours, still charging! Unbelievable.
I got this phone as an upgrade to my old V300 model via T-Mobile about six months from the day this review was made.  There are some things about the V330 that are better and worse than my old V300.For openers, the good things are that Motorola caught on to some of the quick key innovations that Samsung conceived for their phone brands available to Sprint customers:  quick keys to access T-Zones and the camera are the two most prominent.  Also, the V330 has Bluetooth capability, which I can't comment on since I don't have a wireless headset to take advantage of this feature.  Those are the advantages to the V330 over the V300.My disappointments with this phone compared to the V300 is that whenever I am reading or writing a text message, it is interrupted whenever new ones come in.  I never had that problem with the V300, and Motorola needs to work out that issue with all their current and future models immediately.  Of course, the only application that incoming SMS and MMS messages will not interrupt is use of Java-based gaming applications.Also, whenever several text messages come in, or even at unexpected times, outgoing text messages will not transmit to the recipients; the phone has to be turned off and back on, and then each outgoing message has to be manually resent.  This too is extremely inconvenient, and is yet another issue Motorola needs to immediately resolve; otherwise, I may go back to buying Sony Erricson phones as I have never had such problems with their earlier models.Overall, the phone is decent.  It is not superb.  It will be once the recommended improvements are made.
I have the 'older' V300 version. I've had it for about a year now, so I'm under the assumption that it is much like the newer 330 model, except for the new "blue-tooth" technology addition. In general, I like TMobile's service. I've been a customer for about 3 years now and except for the gradual decline in acknowledgable customer service representatives (they are so clueless sometimes!), I have no big complaints. But back to the phone...the "outer" soft keys/buttons are sooooooo annoying. If you just touch the phone incorrectly it makes that dumb 'churp' noise and changes the ring volume on your phone. It wasn't until I read the previous reviews that I remember how much I hate when my phone does that--it seems that I had blocked-out the whole experience. I'm also having troubles with the charger, and sometimes the words, "Unable to Charge" comes across the screen. When the phone is "Unable to Charge" you're not able to receive or make calls, use any of the phone's features, or fix the problem without losing your mind (i.e., swearing, throwing the phone, bending and twisting the phone charger's cord, turning the phone on and off and back on again, for example). I've also noticed that if I don't turn the phone off every day or so the phone will sometimes go dead or the words on the screen appear 'encrypted' because they're all collasped on one another (on the outer screen) and the inside screen goes completely blank. Overrall, the phone is very durable (I drop my phone at the least several times a day), has decent memory and the HIFI ringer function is awesome.
I have read the reviews of the other owners and agrere and disagree.  First, yes, the ear piece volume does seem especially low.  I have mine permanently set on high and I'll have to "dig" my ear into the earpiece to hear conversations when I'm anywhere other than alone in a quiet room.Second, the phone does let you store different numbers for a single contact.  When you're editing a contact, simply go to the bottom of the "Entry Detail" and select "...More..."  My phone came with quite a large owners manual that taught me all of that.Two additional problems I have experienced is first, with call dropping.  If I don't turn my phone off every few days, when I call someone after 12 minutes it will spontaniously drop the call even though I have a full signal.  This is not a problem if I turn the phone off every 3 or 4 days, perhapse I"m just lazy.Lastly, if you carry this phone in your purse or in your pocket, expect it to make a LOT of noise.  Someone mentioned that the smart keys on the side are complicated to change the volume.  They are also sensitive.  When I place it in my purse it constantly is beeping at me and changing the volumes.  Sometimes it will even turn the volume off un-beknowns to me.  One positive feature is that it does have a vib then ring feature which I enjoy.
This phone has everything I want. Worldwide bands, video, still cam, (very sharp pics too), Bluetooth, (love my new bluetooth headset), crisp sound, great screen! WOW! I had the V300 so this upgrade is just what the Cell Phone Camera Doctor ordered! Great speakerphone and Ringtones too!Patty
I have used V300 (not v330, but I assume they are in the same line) for over a year. At first I really disliked this phone. The reception is slightly better than my previous nokia, but still missed a lot of calls especially in buildings. The camera is a lamb, and the menu is not as clear as Nokia's. One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side. Whenever you happen to touch it, the phone will let you change the ring tone mode with another side button. Since I carry the phone in my jeans, the ring mode is always accidentally changed to vibrate or even silent.But my impression to this phone began to turn to the bright side after I mindlessly carried this phone in my swimsuit and jumped into the Michigan lake. Of course, the phone refused to work right out of the water. But after I dried the phone with a electronic fan for two afternoons, the phone come back alive like a miracle! If you are a careless person like me, you may found this feature very useful since you could put the phone into the washer or something.Basically, that's why I give it a four star. Without the story above, I would have given it a one star.
I have been using this phone for quite some time now, it has not given me any trouble at all. The only down side of this phone is that it a bit heavy and the camera is not that great. Otherwise this is proabaly the best flip phone T-mobile has to offer.
I've been using this phone for about three weeks on the T-Mobile system within CT and while travelling. It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the "smart" keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the "secret". The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret. If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use, then I'd probably have passed on this phone (and any other Motorola using a similar scheme).If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low. I'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception, I don't think you can go too wrong with the V330.
I've only had my phone for a day, but I wanted to correct some earlier reviews that stated otherwise. I did have to update iSync via Software Update, but after that the sync worked perfectly--all my address book contacts and calendar events popped right over--fantastic!
Excellent call quality, compact, not too heavy or light, good battery life (goes a few days with moderate use between recharges), loaded with useful extras like calculator, alarm clock, calendar. Speakerphone works well, decent camera for a phone. Relatively easy to use and navigate thru features. Lots of available entertainment for whoever's willing to pony up extra dough. Bluetooth is awesome. It is exactly what was missing from v300. Motorola could've restyled it though.
I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse." I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as "customer abuse"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own.
I've had this phone for awhile now and I must say that, I am quite pleased and happy about it.  The battery life is great and the ringtone/MP3 tones, sounds amazing.  The keypad is also very comfortable to use.  It may be a teeny bit big, but overall.. Motorola V330 is a great phone.  Bah, the speaker also works well!
I had this phone for 27 days out of 30 and I returned it despite liking all of the phones features.  I have never been a big fan of Motorola phones, opting for Samsung since Samsung phones are usually a little more user friendly and offer more fluff.  Let's face it, easy to use and lots of toys isn't always a bad thing.Any way, let's get to the phone.  It is NOT hard to use and I found it much more user friendly than other Motorolas.  The phone is a little bulky compared to comparable flip models but that really isn't a big deal.  All of the fluff features were okay, the browser was a tad on the clunky end and I had repeated trouble downloading from the T-Moblie site.  The speaker phone was phenominal and it allows you to use it with the phone closed, which is very convenient.So the phone itself was great, awesome features and good quality, so why did I not like it.  Two reasons:  1. Weak antenna, and I mean weeeeeaaaaaak.  I lost signal everywhere and got "no signal" indications in places my previous Samsung T-Mobile phone received service.  It also seem to take a long time to return signal after losing it.  2.  Weak battery.  I got only about 2 hours of talk time and it took close to 5 hours to charge it.  Not good.I returned it and exchanged it for a Samsung x335.  I now recieve a good signal EVERYWHERE the v330 did not and the talk time on the battery is about the same.  The x335 takes only about an hour and half to charge, is smaller, and packs most of the features of the v330 with the major exceptions of blue tooth (which I don't care about, as I have no desire to walk around looking like George Jetson with that bulky ear piece on my head); no world phone capability (don't care b/c when I am on vacation in Europe I really don't want the phone to ring); and no web browser (don't care, if I want to surf the net I can do it at home).  The only drawback to the x335 is the beyond horrible carrying case and the speaker phone only works with the phone open, which is kind of a pain as it is difficult to put the phone down or clip it back on your belt when talking.If the v330 had the signal and battery strength of the x335 it would win hands down, but it doesn't.  As an added note NEITHER of these phones work as well as my old Samsung S105 variant that finally died after 2.5 years of heavy use.  So maybe T-Mobile should offer us better phones all around or this long time customer will look elsewhere for a great phone with great service.
Never think of buying this phone. Ask me, this phone had lots problems but mainly it crashes and displays the main screen. I have missed more than 50% calls attended on this phone. While talking it disconnects on its own. I can't make call because it freezes. I am just waiting for 1 year of contract to complete and i will break this phone with my own hand. Totally waste of time & money. Never buy.
I was a little skeptical getting a new phone over the internet, but great Amazon's price (and very generous rebates) convinced me otherwise.I received a phone within three days (free shipping), programmed - ready to go.  Amazon's instructions regarding rebates and how to keep the same phone number (from T-Mobile) were crystal clear.This phone has everything you need: great voice quality, easy to use, Bluetooth connectivity, acceptable digital camera pictures.In short: very happy with this purchase.  It was a very pleasant on-line purchasing experience.Thanks Amazon.com!
Considering this phone is new to the market, I am laughing at the reviews that say they have had this phone for a year+...Only complaint, wish it didn't look like the v300.Best feature (for me) Blue tooth is compatible with my car...I love driving handsfree:)
I recently purchased this phone, and coming from a Nokia 3595, I must say it is a step up.The color display is bright and crisp, and so far I've had no problems as far as dropped calls, or limited functionality.  I like the rubber case also, as it makes the phone easier to grasp during conversation.The one gripe I do have is that the keys are not out far enough, and almost seem like they are stuck in a bit.  They are just meant to be sleek, but it almost is to the point that it's not very effective.  Also, lighting on the 7 and 9 keys seems a little low quality, but in pitch black you can still see all the numbers so it's not a big deal.This is my first Motorola phone, and I highly recommend it as a cheap alternative flip phone, if you're not willing to shell out the bucks for a RAZR.
Phone arrived and worked well right from the start.  Bluetooth connectivity with DataPilot software works (phonebook and calender).  Camera functions nicely.  Browsing capabilities are very well refined.  Text entry seems a little cumbersome (Prefer the A630 for this).  My wife loves it (it is her phone, mine is the A630) because she doesn't really care about text entry.
I think Susan Newb (hahahahaha newb) has just had a stroke of bad luck. Perhaps it is because of her name, I don't know. The v330 is without a doubt the best phone T-Mo has right now, and I haven't noticed any bugs or glitches.This phone's features really make it the flagship phone of TMo (think of the phone as the Super Star Destroyer Executor and TMo as the Galactic Empire). The phone never drops calls as compared to the horriffic v180 (my exgirlfriend has a 180. Now you know why she's my ex), and it doesn't have a lot of the problems that other Motorola phones seem to have.All in all, I have had the 330 for 4 months now and I am VERY happy with it.PS. Susan Newb, you are a newb.kekekekekek ^__^
Not only does the address boook force you to enter multiple numbers for one person as separate entries, the coverage of T-Mobile is spotty at best.  In addition, since I am unhappy with the coverage, I tried to cancel w/in my 2 week window- only to learn, that since Amazon.com activated the phone 2 weeks before I even started using the phone, that my 2 week grace periood was over before I even turned on my phone.  Now I must fork up the cancellation fee as well as eat the cost of the phone.  I am extremely unhappy with T-Mobile for not making an exception. [...] it is automatically activated for you.
I am using this phone for last one month. This phone really looks great in terms of features. The signal is getting dropped frequently and end up receiving more voice messages than actual phone calls though phone is on.The battery gives only 12 hours standby or 60 minutes talk time.
I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky, strange things would happen when ever I charged it, when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard. They seemed to have fixed that with this latest version of the phone. My understanding is that they have combined the features from both the v300 and the v 600 to make this phone. I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone, voice dialing and voice memos, now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300. I like what the body of the phone feels like, but a change of color would be better, maybe silver.
I ordered my phone on June 14,2005. Note said ships within 2-3 days. Its July 13,2005 and I just received the phone! I never received an email from Amazon customer service for the delay. If your in a rush for this phone call Amazon customer service to verify that it will ship in the "2-3 day" stated on the screen.
I have a previous account with T-Mobile, with a free phone that broke down. I found the best new phone and service plan using the excellent Amazon website and ordered it.When I got the new phone, T-mobile refused to move my old phone number to my new phone and account. They complained that I had bought it from an outside source rather than throught them. They aggressively tried to get me to cancel my new phone and account.They claimed that I had not informed them within 30 days, so they would charge me an extra month on my old service.It was a terrible experience. Do not buy a T-mobile phone or serv ice, ever.
This phone has the worst reception, and worst sound of any phone I have ever used.I was excited to get this phone [upgraded from a SE T610 -- a wonderful phone besides the common recharging problem].  It had all the features that were important to me -- namely a colour screen, bluetooth, and lots of contacts.  The phone was an utter let down.As stated above the reception is HORRIBLE.  It will drop calls with all the bars showing, people are constantly saying, "What?!? SPEAK UP?!?" and that's IF you can understand what they are saying.  The simple act of moving your head will change the reception quality.  What good is a cell phone if you need to stand completely still, and don't interrupt the speaker (because interrupting the speaker degrades their voice quality).Stay AWAY from this phone.
Important: Ignore all reviews that mention anything like "I have owned this phone since January", "I bought this phone a year ago and...", etc. All of these users are reviewing the older version of this phone, the v300, which had many less features and much more problems.If you are looking to get service with T-Mobile, this phone is by far the best available. It is Quadband, which means that you will get the best coverage here and abroad. Many T-Mobile phones do not support the 850mhz band, which has become increasingly important to T-Mobile customers in the past year. Although none of T-Mobile's native network uses 850mhz, T-Mobile has recently made many roaming agreements in areas of Northern Wisconsin, Minnesota, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and more. This feature will only become more important. Currently, the only T-Mobile phones that support this band are listed at this website: [...] . T-Mobile has only announced these new roaming agreements in the Minneapolis area, but do note that they are elsewhere too. You can view T-Mobile's coverage map and the huge areas that are now covered via 850mhz roaming at [...] .Currently, Amazon is also selling the Nokia 3220 and Motorola v188, which also allow roaming in these areas.Compared to the v300, the v330 also adds EDGE for faster data speeds, video recording, bluetooth for wireless headsets and wireless syncing with your computer, *improved reception quality on all bands*,  and an improved keypad design.Update: Almost all new T-Mobile phones support 850mhz, so there is no reason to only consider this phone. (However this is still a good phone and has all of the same features as the razr but for a lower price)The only T-Mobile phones sold through Amazon that DON'T support 850mhz roaming are the p735 and Sidekick 2.
I've had my phone since February and it's okay.  At least once a day the phone just freezes up or hangs up on whoever I am talking to at that time.  And it does that even when I have full signal.  I plan on buying a new phone and from other review I've read it probably won't be another Motorola.
I have been a T-mobile customer since 2001 and up until recently I used the well out-dated nokia 3390 phone. The phone had limited features but great reception and vocal quality was always clear. Once in a while i had a few dropped calls but it was nothing to pull your hair out about.Recently, I switched to the Motorola V330 expecting an upgrade in quality as well as features. This Motorola phone is complete garbage.  While the camera is fun to play with, the perks end there. The menus are convoluted and the button response is sluggish at best. The phone drops probably every third or fourth call, and my 2001 model nokia got better reception.  The worst part of this phone is when you try and place a call, sometimes it will freeze  while dialing the number leaving the "dialing person x" screen up on the display. At this point, you cannot do anything besides turn the phone off and turn it back on again. Also, it successfully sends text messages 40 to 50 percent of the time. The rest of the time, I recieve an error saying that it was unable to send.I do not know if the phone that I recieved was a refurbished model or anything like that (t-mobile is known to do that) but I am currently trying to recieve another phone to see if it will work better. Bottom line, stay away from T-mobile. My friends use VERIZON which has more DEPENDABLE SERVICE and BETTER HARDWARE for the same price.
The phone operates ok in terms of signal and battery.  But, the menu system is completely outdated and non-user friendly (like all MOT phones).  Do their software engineers even look at NOK phones to compare at all before they launch a new handset?  They are light years behind in the interface.  You still can't store several numbers for one person under one name (each has to be a seperate entry).  The phone's green call button is on the right (should be on let like every other phone).  The most annoying thing are the buttons on the side that constantly get pushed in your pocket and change the ring style and volume.  Each time they change, it makes a loud beep.  This phone is not worth getting, especially now (I had mine for a year and am looking for a better phone now as a replacement).  MOT phones in general are to be avoided.
Bought a plan through Amazon, never could get it to work. T-Mobile blamed the handset and Amazon could not replace it, thus cancel and reimbursed me for the HANDSET.  T-MOBILE is charging me $300 for a service I never used: $30 for activation, $200 for cancellation and 2 months of service! After being helpless, they are trying to force me to stay with them by " waving" the the fees! If you buy, just pray everything works, because otherwise T-Mobile will make your life miserable for months.
I signed up w/ T-Mobile on July 28th, 2005.  I purchesed the Motorola V330. BIGGEST MISTAKE!!!!  I had the phone not 2 weeks and the inside display and outside display kept intemittenly going black.  I called TMobile customer service, they sent me a replacement V330, then said there was "physical damgage" to the phone and charged me $70 to my bill, which cause me to go over my "spending limit" which then turned my service off!!!! NOW, I never dropped the phone, never got it wet, yada yada yada, !!! PISSED!!  So, I get the replacement, theres no sound when it powers up or down, no one can hear me talk, and again the LCD's are going black, I call Tmobile again, they send me ANOTHER V330.  I have had this one about 2-3 weeks, now the dang thing will ring from 3-5 minutes, lcd's are black, cannot see who's calling, cannot answer the call, had to remove the battery to make it stop ringing.  Then later that night tried to access Tzones, cant!!!  It says File not recognized!!! I call Tmobile, they are sending me my THIRD V330 and they said I would be qualified for the "multi-exchange program", that's where you've had problems w/ the same phone and they send you a compatible new different phone.  I 'm suppose to recieve the 3rd V330 today and if it doesn't work, I'm to call them and let them know asap.  They did state tho that they DO NOT HAVE any other phone to send me since the V330 is "so new" under that multi-exchange program, I would keep getting a V330!!! I'm TIRED OF GETTING THIS PHONE !!!!!!  Having to have it replaced approximately every 2-4 weeks and then it not working.  There's MAJOR issues with the V330, just NO ONE want to admit it.  I will however, go to management or who ever I need to, to get another DIFFERENT phone COMPATIABLE to the V330, ie:  camera, video, bluetooth...  It's not right for them to take advantage of me when it's not MY FAULT that THEIR PHONE HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS!!!!  They need to get real and fix them and compensate with compatible phones!!!!!!!!  UNREAL!!!!!!  DO NOT BUY THE MOTOROLA V330, NOTHING BUT TROUBLE!!!!!!!!
I recently purchased a Motorola V330 from T-Mobile  and so far it has been a very good phone. It has excellent features like Speakerphone and Bluetooth. The only drawback is the design which looks like the old Motorola V300 phone and is too bulky and heavy. Ocassionally, it will drop calls. Other than that- I am satisfied with this phone! But beware-T-Mobile has the worst customer service!! If you really want a phone like this, I recomend Cingular which carries the Motorola v551.
This is a poorly designed phone.  Battery life even in standby is less than 72 hours.  The menu system is awkward, especially the phonebook menu. The phone is also on the heavy side.  It's a shame that a company like Motorola with years of design experience can not design a decent phone.On top of all this, if your provider is T-Mobile, then good luck!Poor reception and lousy customer service is what you'll get.
Dont ever buy this instrument. I have been putting up with this piece of crap for the past one year just because i was bound by contract.Every 12 minutes into my call the signal gets lost with this phone. Imagine the situation when you are on an important call and the connection gets severed because of the faulty phone.  When i call the customer support people to complain about the signal they remorselessly say its bacause of the phone. Then i wonder why the heck they are offering such a piece to customers. Are they trying to loose customers? The battery life isn't good either - just about 2 hours.
Like most people these days, I use my cell phone for almost everything. And the organizer/addressbook/phonebook/appointment book MUST work. This phone's so called phonebook, is just that. Phone numbers! Oh yes, it does include names, and even email addresses. Big deal! Are we supposed to maintain a separate organizer for street addresses, and various other important notes?That, along with not having the wonderful email functions of my Nokia 3650, has made me decide to return the Motorola 330, after only having had it for less than a week. So much for a second phone line. At least maybe until the new Razor comes out in October.I thought maybe I could live with those "minor" problems, but I guess I'm just too demanding.Aside from that...it's a decent phone. :)
This is a great phone. I hardly use all the features but it looks, feels, and is cool.
I really do not know to whom I can blame for this problem. The phone V330 always in trouble even after getting new equipment (no battery) from T-mobile. The battery looses the charge every 1 hour talk. I never use any extra features in the phone except call receiving and talking. I have reported this issue to T-mobile but the issue is not solved yet. Other problem is, T-Mobile coverage is extremly poor in Orange County area(Sou. CA). This is something I did not know before buying this plan.Finally I decided that, this is my last purchase with Amazon.com
I just got this phone with T-mobile's 600min plan. It turns out they are nothing but piece of crap. Signal was lost averagly every 8 min and no signal at all in my living room. I never gone through a complete call. I don't know which part is the problem, T-mobile or this phone but I would suggest anybody not to buy this phone and T-mobile plan.
I placed an order on July 7th.  The availability was 1 to 2 days at the time of order.  However, after I placed the order, the confirmation stated that the estimated shipping date is July 13.  Today is July 14 and I check my order status.  The estimated shipping date has changed to July 21.  I called Amazon customer service 1-800-201-7575 and certainly it wasn't helpful.  I plan to cancel the order if they further delay the shipment.  Don't order cellphone from Amazon if you are in hurry!
cheaper than other full price service contract phones, but this phone not totally cheap eitherno internet service or downloads or games for tmobile prepaid service OMGwell i am new to this phone, so i will talk about what i do know for sure. this part is more about the service than the phone though. OMG i find out AFTER, i repeat AFTER i get the phone and t-mobile prepaid service that prepaid customers get NO internet service and can't download games on this phone. OMG this is not the neolithic stoneage period ok, this is the year 2005 people!! t-mobile-- get with the program!! that's like telling me i ordered a flat screen tv and can only watch 1 channel, and that i can't get cable or use my remote control with it. i got a cell phone here that has the ability to do some multimedia stuff, but prepaid customers aren't allowed to have internet access, sheesh.well i was on a monthly service for a long time, and there was a month or two i dished out 1000$ total, because i did not realize i went over my minutes and was making local phone calls for 20-35$/per month. i said enough of this crap. then later i hardly used my phone anymore. my plan was 39.99/mo but w/ taxes, surcharges, etc, it became 50$/month. i said enough of this crap. and i went prepaid.but prepaid companies need to get more competitive. they will get more money and customers that way if you provide customers more options and services.only reason i went with tmobiles prepaid service plan is because they don't charge daily access fee, and other places do. perhaps i might just change to another prepaid service, dole out a bit more cash, in order to get internet service..about the phone, i agree w/ most people the handbook sucks. and all these people talking about you have to put multiple entries in for people w/ different phone numbers- IT'S NOT TRUE. i had thought the same thing but then i went and read it wasn't true, and i read my handbook, and fumbled around w/ the phone. you need to click on PRIMARY in order to maintain one entry per person.it is hard trying to rate the phone in isolation of the service.. i am new to this phone and don't know much about the phone.
I've had this phone for 1 1/2 years.  Over the past month I've been fighting getting it to work when flipped open.  Took it to Tmobile for service and told would cost $70 for maintenance or buy another for over $100.Have never dropped this phone!  I would argue that it's poor quality- very disappointed.
v330 sucks, every now and then the phone gets disconnected, poor voice quality, bad signal strength inside the house....I am returning it within the three day of purchase s I am totally pissed of with it.
I've had this for almost a year now and its not upto the expected quality.Its very slow in retrieving numbers from the memory and things like that when compared to Nokia which is much faster. Also not very user friendly.The pictures are not very sharp or good enough and I had to buy a digital camera after I bought this phone.Overall, not very pleased as there are better phones in the market.
This phone is marketed towards youngsters. But it is perfect for older people, such as myself, who don't use a cell phone much, yet want to have one "just in case" or for occasional use. Over the past few weeks I have found it to be reliable, it holds a charge a long time, and has pretty good voice quality. It is quite tiny--no need for a folding ("flip") phone. Virgin has increased the number of services it offers: either 25c/minute, and only spend $15/90 days to keep the service active, or else 35c/day for 10c minutes. No roaming or domestic long distance charges. Very few taxes and no extra fees. The service is not cost-effective if you plan to use the phone heavily, but for light use you will not find a less expensive service.I found a few deficiencies in the phone that keep me from giving it 5 stars. As others have noted, the screen is hard to see when not backlit. Some features are hidden in menus--for example, there is a speakerphone, but just go try to find out how to use it! It isn't described in the manual. (It turns out it is a menu option when you receive or make a call, but if you just look through the menus you won't find it.) The provided ring tones are too funky for me. So I surprised myself by paying for a old-fashioned ring, $2, which actually sounds pretty good.So if you want a small reliable phone that holds a charge well and has good clear sound, the Shorty is worth a look. Just be sure that the Sprint network (which Virgin uses) is available in your area before buying any Virgin phone, as they have no capability of roaming onto other networks.*****Added after several months with the phone*******My phone does indeed have the "auto shut-off" bug. It didn't bite me for several weeks, but it has happened to me several times over the past few months. The phone shuts itself off despite having plenty of power left in the battery. The remedy, as others have reported, is to take the battery out for a second. When reinserted, the phone acts fine again. It doesn't happen to me very often, but it does happen. Since it happens so rarely, perhaps once every few weeks, it doesn't bother me much, but I can see it would be infuriating to some people. It is rather amazing to me that Nokia claims not to be aware of this bug.
I never bought into the hype of colour screens and attached cameras in a cellphone. I just want a cellphone that has long battery power, easy to carry, and does the talking well.One of the nicest thing with this phone is the signal strength indicator: it has seven bars in total, giving a very clear indication of how the signal is, and whether you feel confident having a conversation at the spot you are at.The battery lasts about a week on standby and light talking and turned off at night. It is lithium-ion battery so is very convenient in terms of charging. Charging time is about five hours to full.The display is very large. It has the usual usability of a Nokia phone. It does not have an antenna, and the mic is quite far from the mouth, but I have never needed to repeat myself even in quite noisy environments. The sound is clear, and it includes an integrated loudspeaker.Now, a few issues. The included ringtones are few and fewer still are the "professional/discrete" type. Auto-key-lock failed once so I had to restart the phone. The keys are a bit small and hard so they require some getting used to.Also, on several occasions it refused to be turned off. I had to take the battery out to force it to power down. Not sure why, but it really shouldn't happen.Overall, a very economic functional phone without bells and whistles (except for the integrated flashlight). It works like a telephone.
This is a tiny phone; it fits in a pocket very well. The sound quality is great, and people can hear me well. The "Shorty" is a great little phone (with the exception of the screen--it's difficult to read the time of day display). I particularly like the loudspeaker feature, which enables me to put the phone down next to me while driving and hear and be heard well.  It's easy to navigate through all the features, although it might be more difficult for someone with bigger fingers; I use my thumbnail to push the buttons.  Easy to find out my balance, too.  I just use the phone for making and receiving calls and not for the downloadable features and games, so I haven't tried all those.  The existing ringtones are I suspect aimed at a younger crowd--they sound kind of hip hop.  They also sound kind of tinny.  But, as I said, I'm using it mainly for a low-use phone; so this didn't discourage me.What did discourage me was the one little problem:  My particular phone has a little problem of powering off on its own without warning every few days--even with a full battery charge. So I'm walking around with a phone that is not on thinking I can receive emergency calls when actually I can't, because it has spontaneously turned itself off. Nothing I do gets it to turn back on.  It is just dead. I figured out I just remove the battery and put it back in (which the trouble shooting page on the nokiausa website confirmed), and this enables me to turn it back on. I find this unacceptable in a phone and am returning it. Virgin Mobile customer service was kind and polite and offered to give me a new "Shorty," but I declined, because I found the minutes disappearing too fast with the Virgin Mobile prepaid plan.  I believe, because they start counting off your time the second you push send when you make a call.  So, you are paying for the 15 or 20 seconds it takes your party's voice mail to connect AND the message you leave on his or her voicemail.  This adds up.  Had I not been unimpressed with the Virgin Mobile plan, I probably would have taken them up on the replacement offer, because I really like the phone.
This is a nice, sleek looking phone from a simple pay as you go wireless provider.  Virgin Mobile uses the SPRINT PCS network and charges you as follows...$.025 a minute for the first 10 minutes of the day, then $0.10 a minute after that.  Or, $0.10 a minute plus $0.35 a day.  You pay $0.10 per text message you send and it is free to receive them.  You must top off your account at least $20 every 90 days to keep your account active, but you keep the minutes you have already purchased.  If you don't use your phone a lot your looking at $6.66 a month for a cell phone.  How simple is that?  No other hidden fees involved.The Nokia 2115i is the smallest Nokia I have ever seen.  It stands less than 4" tall, less than 1.5" from side to side and less than 3/4" thick.  There are limited accessories for it at this time because it is new to the market.  You can send and receive text from other phones or email addresses.  There are tons of downloadable stuff from the web site as well.  Other features include a speaker phone, built in flashlight, voice dialing, voice memo recording, games and more.  Anytime your curious about how much money you have left in your account, you can check your balance right on the phone.  It takes about 5 seconds for the account information to be zapped back to you in a text message.  You can also access your account on the web site.If your like me who got tired of spending over $50 a month for cell phone minutes I never used, this is for you.  I like the convenience of having a phone, but do not have a need to have it glued to my ear all day.  Virgin Mobile pay as you go is simple and in my case money saving.  Not to mention this particular phone is about the most stylish Nokia they make.
UPDATE:  VM has struck out!24 Oct 05 - VM is now sending me a THIRD replacement.  They simply refuse to send me a similar (ie ....inexpensive) Kyocero (sp?) phone.  They likely spent more money FEDEXing me replacement Shortys, then I have paid for my VM service.Who knows, maybe the fourth Shorty will work.  I suspect bad software loaded.But even if it does, I doubt I would ever recommend VM.  They have the worst customer service, I have ever experiened.  How many times do they expect their customers to beat their heads against a brick wall?My experience with Virgin Mobile REMAINS most unsatisfactory.  I do not recommend their service or the Nokia Shorty. If VM does remedy this issue, I will edit this review.My original Nokia Shorty phone also turned itself off.  Virgin Mobile sent a replacement with same problem.Today I called VM customer service and requested a different model phone to replace this second defective phone.  The representative said she could only send me the same model.  I asked to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor was unresponsive and condescending, implying the phone was turning off because it was in my pocket and "operator error."  This in spite that the phone turned off once during the night on my dresser; and this was a known issue with the Nokia Shorty.  Also, she could not explain why it was necessary to re-insert the battery to power the phone back on.She repeated VM would only send the same phone in exchange.  She said her supervisor does not take calls, and there was no one in Virgin Mobile she would refer me to.As it stands now, VM is sending me a third Nokia Shorty.  If this second replacement has the same problem, what are my options?  The customer service representatives gave me no options except  to send me another and another replacement and so on.Apparently VM does not give its customer representatives the freedom to make decisions on their own in order to satisfy VM customers.
I have been a Virgin Mobile user for about 2 years and this is my third phone and the best so far.  This is a very small basic phone.  I was a bit apprehensive about the small size but there really does not seem to be any problems due to the size.  The screen is a bit difficult to read w/o the backlighting and I think the speakerphone volume is weak.  But the ring is loud and the voice quality is good.  Reception is very good. The vibrating alert is also on the weak side. The keypad is small but I have no problems with it.
This super compact phone is great!, It is not a sophisticated model, great for people who needs just a phone. Although it's quality is great, and has many features I didn't expect it to have such as the loudspeaker (and more things), which works great! I love the phone, it's compact I can carry it on my pockets, lightweight and doesn't look cheap; also the service at virgin is much better than tracfone, I am glad I switched, cause their phones are crap too.
Unless you're one of those people who has to have a cell phone in their ear 24/7, the Nokia Shorty with Virgin Mobile's Minute-to-Minute, Pay-as-You-Go plan should work for you as well as it does for me.  I only make and receive an occasional call, and I don't need a handheld video game/internet browser/digital camera.  The battery life is impressive and the loudspeaker function works exceptionally well.  I didn't care for the ringtones that came preloaded, but there are plenty that can be downloaded off Virgin Mobile's website.
I just bought this phone for my teenage daughter.  It is quite small (she says it's "cute") and extremely light.  I was suprised at how light it was.  My favorite feature about the phone actually is its price.  Amazon lists it for $29.99 here (claiming 50%) off, but I bought my daughter's at Wal-Mart for $20.00.I think the pay-as-you-go phone is a great invention for teenagers.  We were able to get her hooked up with service within an hour of buying the phone.All in all, not a bad deal at all.
I picked up one of these phones as a temporary vacation replacement while I was waiting for my Treo 650 to arrive from [...] The service from myrateplan.com was so bad (the phone didn't arrive on time which is why I had to get the Shorty to tide me over) and the Shorty was such a good little phone, that I decided to wait until Verizon gets real about the pricing on their data plans for the Treo 650 and I'm just sticking with the Shorty for now. You just can't beat it for the price. It runs on the Sprint PCS network which is generally second only to Verizon in terms of reliability. I have used my Shorty for almost 2 months now and I just experienced the "auto shut off" bug for the first time. For $39 I can live with that occasional annoyance. Oh, and the speakerphone is very screetchy and tinny sounding. But on the plus side, it DOES have a cool little built-in flashlight and who really uses their cellular speakerphone for anything other than waiting on hold? I think I may also be spending slightly more each month for a prepaid phone than I would with a long term contract, but it's worth it just to know I can ditch the phone and the service whenever I feel like it. I will never sign a cellular contract again. Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
I've had my Virgin Mobile Nokia Shorty for several months now.  Unforunately, I cannot recommend it becuase Virgin Mobile customer service is very poor.  The first problem was registering my credit card - neither the Virgin Mobile web page nor a live advisor was able to register it.  And worse, the attempts to register the card triggered a security stop on my credit card.  (I guess a lot of credit card fraud happens through Virgin Mobile USA.)The second big problem was when I tried to purchase a custom ringtone from the VM USA website.  Well, the ringtone "successfully" downloaded, but my phone did not actually play the ringtone at all - just silence.  Virgin Mobile USA refuses to refund my money, since according to their system, the download was successful.I suggest avoiding Virgin Mobile USA due to poor customer service.
This Shorty is so small you could probably fit 2 inside an empty (regular size) cigarette pack. If that sounds just great, the phone itself may be for you. But of course the buttons are also very small, small enough that you'd have to be a constant user to be able to accurately press them without looking. And no, they're not illuminated. More, I had to find out from the manual that it was a no-no to cover the top of the phone with your hand, as that blocks the internal antenna - not easy to do with so small a unit.Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint network. I've found the phone works most places I need it to work, but I was in the mall a couple of days ago and saw others yapping happily on their cells. Deciding to test this, I got no signal. Not sure if this the phone or Sprint.Finally, I bought the phone at Amazon rather than a "brick and mortar" store because only Amazon offered a package deal with a free $20 'top up' card. The order took over 2 weeks to even ship out! Amazon said it was because the card was unavailable during that time. They are usually excellent with shipping, and maybe this is solved by now. But I sure could have used the phone during the time it took to arrive. I bought it mainly to be able to call AAA from the road as my car was stalling out.
I've had the phone a few days and have already been bit by the auto-shutoff others have mentioned.  Had to remove the battery and put it back before i could power on (battery still had full charge).  I'll be returning the phone.  I wish I had heeded other reviews and spent the $10 extra for a different model that would hopefully not malfunction right off the bat.Update: well, i've still got the phone 6 years later, so i guess it's not all bad. Voice quality is good, battery life is good (when it doesn't auto shut off).  Gets the job done in most ways in the simplest way possible.
I don't use the games (which another reviewer lists), and I don't buy ringtones. I do send text messages, which this phone does fairly well (the menus are a bit annoying, but the predictive typing feature works well), and fairly cheaply (ten cents to send, nothing to receive). The flashlight, while weird, comes in handy more often than you might expect. And it works as a phone. Not a lot of frills, but a good, solid, reliable phone.One annoyance for those who talk and drive is that, unlike many phones, this requires a nokia headset, rather than a 2.5mm plug headset. I found it a bit more difficult finding the nokia headset at a reasonable price.
I purchased the Nokia 2115i and before opening the package I searched for reviews of the product (I know that this is backwards, but such is life).  I noticed here of users reporting the auto-shutoff problem that requires the battery to be disconnected.  I searched the nokia site for details and found nothing.  So I called them on a Saturday morning, 9 AM PST.  After 15 minutes, a support person answered.  She put me on hold for about 30 seconds and said that her "tech" said nothing has been reported, there are no service bulletins on this model and that "my phone does not have any problems".I happen to work as a software tester and know all about bugs.  The fact that I got a glib response worries me.  No searching of bug databases, only a quick opinion of one tech who cannot possibly have such expansive knowledge of this model (1 of 100 models Nokia offers).I will return my phone today to avoid the risk.  Thanks to all who took the time to report a problem here.
This phone is a GREAT deal! The quality that went into this phone I'm shocked at the price. The phone can get tons of ringtones, Real Songs! It also has many features that are just fun. The sound is crystal clear and the screen can be easily read. A great starter phone or even upgrade!
This item was very well made by the Virgin Mobile Company. It's Features are amazing, and the sound quality is very good. The screen is very visible and good. Although is is somewhat small, it is still compact and fits almost anywhere. I really enjoy this item. It's one of my favorite Virgin Mobile Phones so far.
I was kinda surprised to see the Shorty at such a low price but it is the holiday season after all. I like this phone because it is so low in price but you can still download ringtones and select wallpapers like a regular phone. It's a good choice for people with a small budget.From Cathy_luvs_dd a Virgin Mobile Insider
This phone is pretty good. For the games it has Snake 2 it has Kart racing and Space impact 2. It has preety good tools. It has a Alarm clock a calendar a voice memo with up to a miniute of recording time. A caculator a stopwatch with up to a 100 hours of time and a countdown timer. It has pretty good features but even for my first cellphone i would still only giveit  4 stars. It also does not have a camera but this phone is okay
I bought this VM Nokia 3 weeks ago.  The automatic keyguard has stopped working and the VM car charger is touchy.  I also thought this was a GSM phone but it's not.  Nokia makes really great phones, the shorty isn't one of them.
this phone is good, it is basic, but ultimately does the job and is easy to understand. the navigation keys are the most simplest there could be. any one could work this phone!
I have tried three of these phones now. All three froze up within or around one month. You must take the battery out and reinstall it to be able to turn the phone back on. I got mine at Best and they said they had alot come back. Try the Kyocera 9 or 10 if you want Virgin Mobile. My wife has had a Kyocera for almost two years with only one problem. The batt would not hold a charge but Best gave her a new one because she had the extended plan. No problems since. She got the extended plan again with the new phone. 8.95 or something close.Update - just called VM to cancel account and add money to wife's account. They cancelled account but said they cannot move balance to new account unless it's an 'emergency'? Maybe I should have told them phone got stolen? Anyways, not my prob anymore.
ive never had this phone, but ive experienced it long enough to review it... thanks to my friend! hahaWell by far, this is a great little device for quick use! Ive never seen a great phone at a great deal of a price anywhere!Features are pretty good, just like a regular old nokia model should own. The keypad is a little confusing at first, but soon enough, you'll get the hang of it.
cheap phone anyone just looking for a phone to use for a low price with great service from virgin mobile.
I have used Nokia cellphones before and this was the worst.I brought it because I needed something for emergencies, had it for four months, topped up and went to make a call the phone was dead.. Waste of money
Phone is excellent for what I wanted it for (emergency/occasional use).  Can't beat VMobile.  Found VMobile service dept. excellent and the plan is inexpensive and predictable.  Only problem has been that auto-shutoff bug.  I have purchased two phones within the last month, and one has already shut down twice: No calls in/out until reset by battery removal/replacement.  Nokia service dept. would not admit to any knowlege of this problem.  I only know one other person who has this phone and this bug bit her, too. Must be a common problem.  Virgin Mobile good, Nokia bad.
This Is A Great Phone. If You Like Small Phones I recomeend U To Get This Phone,
it is very cute gadge. Battery can stand for 7 days. Very good choice for prepaid cellphone user.
i got this phone because my "vox 8610" had been used so much that the battery couldnt even hold a charge. so i got this phone as a replacement tot he 8610... an I LOVE IT! its wayy better than the 8610 because its smaller, LOUDER ringtones and has clear SPEAKERPHONE. yes it has speakerphone... its soo nice, the only thing i dont like about it is its non-colour... but its sill good. i would totatlly recemend this phone instead of paying 90.00 for the 8610 that cant truly hold a charge. i have the 8610 it will be up on E-bay so if you want it, it will be up 8/30/05 at 9:00pm est. so get on for a good deal (35.00) compared to 90.00 but the charge lasts for 3 hours... but i use it daily thats why its not good for me. LOOK OUT!
i dont hav this phone my brother actually does i have a samsung a850. yet i have used the phone that my brother alot recently. if you are just a normal user and like the simple brick cell phones that have color then this is for you. but if you need a nice phone like i do then stay away. of all of the phones with menus that i have seen is the motorola menus, the samsung menus, the lg menus, and the new verizon menus.  the nokias falls in the second to last place with the lg menu in last and the new verizon menus just in front of that.Pros:durablecolorsimplesorta easy to navigatedecent lookingcalls like any normal phonegood sound qualityConsbad reception(vergins fault)not clear colorvery confusing menu if you are used to a nice flip phoneno mobile webonly two direction keysbad color disignvery uglyall the buttons are together so it is hard to feel and textconfusing while textingbuilt in games suckI wanted to give it a 1.75 but i just rounded it up
I bought this phone through Virgin Mobile.  It is small, cute and has great features.After about 3 weeks, it shut itself off. I thought it lost it's charge and tried to charge it but it wouldn't work.  I removed the battery and put it back in and it worked again.  The battery was still half charged.  I leave it on all the time.  This day it was only on about 2 1/2 hours before it turned itself off.  Not good.Plus the voice mail icon won't go away even without any messages.Nokia told me to send it in for repair.  Virgin told me to send it back for a new, same model phone.  I'm thinking about trying to get my money back.Such a shame.  I really liked it.  I may check out AT&T...I; hate them, too!***UPDATE:  Nokia sent me a new one.  Haven't had any problems in over a year.
this phone is good for people who need a cheep phone, but with nice features like polyphonic ringtones and kewl screen savers u can download... but the screen is like a greenish-blue (is ok) but u cant download any backgrounds! u can only put on words as a background. overall i would receemend this phone for a teen/kid who needs 1 for friends,family or emerginces.... its small, slick and makes the ladies turn!
I've been using a black RAZR for 3 months and here are my thoughts:THE GOOD========- FREE!! with a T-Mobile 1-year family plan- Better reception than my previous, 3 yr-old Nokia handset (6610)- Can use the same phone when travelling in Europe, Asia. Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally.- Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable.- It's BLACK.THE OK======- Passable voice quality. (Maybe it's just because it's GSM technology, and coverage is not fantastic in outside of cities.)- Slim profile, though a little heavier than my previous handset- Nice colors in screen. Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays.- Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside.THE BAD=======- Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook.- Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics.  Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.)- Low camera resolution. Other new phones have close to twice that resolution. Pics always kinda dark.- Camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 or radio. Some of the newer Nokia and Sony models are close to iPod Shuffle capacity already.
The Black RAZR V3 is the wireless phone I have always wanted.  It's that simple.Before having bought mine, I would read commentary from people who would cite all of the features the RAZR doesn't have:  "I could buy the (insert model number of cheaper, but still expensive phone which does 100 different things--all of them poorly) and get more for a lot less money."  When I would research a model recommended by these self-proclaimed gadget freaks, I'd find that it's dimensions make keeping it in a pocket an awkward and uncomfortable proposition; I'd find that the pictures it takes are not nearly of comparable quality to those taken by even a modest digital camera; I'd  find that the lo-res video it can shoot serves no practical purpose;  I'd find that web-browsing, game-playing, Instant messaging, streaming television content, all suck up battery-life and ultimately make the device useless for the unlikely purpose of placing and taking phone calls; I'd find that the phone casing is composed of cheap and flimsy plastics which make me wonder how long it wll last; I'd find that little attention had been paid to how the phone's design will contribute to, or detract from, user comfort.  After my investigation, I concluded that for all the money I would save by buying "Phone X" over buying a RAZR, I would still have paid hundreds too much for a filmsy hunk of cutting-edge technojunk.  (Don't take my word for it.  Look around on the Net for comments about the RAZR around the time of its inroduction and see the recommendations from consumers that people choose the Motorola V600 instead.  Then look at the consumer reviews of the V600 on this site.)The RAZR has a camera, a web-browser, Instant messaging capability, and a whole array of other features all of which are listed in the product description.  To the extent that the RAZR does these things adequately I will offer little, if any, comment--mainly because I don't care about them.  That to which I can and will attest is that the RAZR exceeds my expectation on how it serves AS A PHONE.Using my own criteria, a wireless phone should draw and hold a signal; It's earpiece should deliver clear sound at a volume which can compete with background noise; it's mouthpiece should pick up the users voice clearly; it should be compact enough to allow for placement in clothing pockets without creating prominent bulges; it should be solidly built out of durable materials which are not prone to scratching; it should have decent battery life.  And yes, anything for which I pay hundreds of dollars should be designed with aesthetics in mind: there are far too many wireless phones which look like disposable children's toys, or like awkward, all-purpose, button-riddled gadgets.Using the above criteria, the RAZR V3, particularly the Black model, is close to perfect.  The sound from the ear piece could certainly be louder, but I have yet to have a caller's voice drowned out by the noise of busy New York City streets.  The people to whom I'm speaking have reported to have heard my voice loudly and clearly.  Battery life could be longer, but then, the same could be said about many wireless phones which are bulkier and have larger batteries.  I have used the phone on both T-Mobile and Cingular networks and found that it draws a strong signal on both; it has never dropped a call.  I found the speaker phone to be loud and clear despite my expectations to the contrary.  Is the much-lamented Motorola phone book program clunky?  Yes it is.  But the RAZR's voice-dialing works well, making it possible to avoid scrolling through the phone book if one hates it that much.I'll try to boil it down with a somewhat clumsy analogy: Complaining that the RAZR doesn't do enough in the way of tech-gimmicks to justify its price (which is considerably lower that it was when it was introduced) is like complaining that an exotic sports car isn't worth the money because it doesn't have a cup holder, a GPS system, and DVD player like the Minivan you've been looking to buy.  That ridiculousness ignores the engineering that makes the sports car a superior performer on the road, and the attention put toward making it sleek and aesthetically pleasing.  The RAZR's performance has made concern over signal strength a thing of the past. and its design is unmatched--not just for it's ultra-compactness, but for the solidity of it's build.  That makes it worth what I paid for it.  And my inability to speak to the quality of other phones on the market put them out of consideration.Besides, as they say, black is beautiful.That the RAZR cannot serve as a business-card scanner doesn't trouble me.  For those who need to have whichever feature-laden mobile gadget is most desired at the moment, buy a Samsung MM-A800, clip it on you belt (you'll need to), and earn yourself the right to say your phone can do just about everything--poorly.
Prior to buying my phone, i got a lot of really bad feedback - from my husband, sister and friends.  They kept telling me that V3's limited features are not worth my money and that I would be better off sticking to my trusty Nokia phone.  Besides that, they said that a Motorola is not very user-friendly.I conditioned myself to thinking that I will not complain about the limited features of a V3 only because I really wanted to have one so badly (because of its stylish appearance and size). I did buy a V3 despite my husband's objections and was surprised to find that the V3 is more than just a basic phone!! It has some features that I initially did not expect it to have.  You just need to read the manual and tinker with the phone to unlock your phone's potentials.  Another surprise, my black edition V3 is able to CAPTURE, and not just play, videos....Most of V3's functions are a lot similar to my Nokia phone, so I didn't have to make a lot of adjustments getting used to the V3.  You can even tailor the buttons/assign functions to keypads according to your preference.The only thing I think Motorola should've done is to have copied Nokia's technology in terms of browsing the phonebook/directory.  With the V3, you need to go through each person in your phonebook on a per alphabet basis to find a specific number.  With the Nokia, if you want to skip some names that start with the same alphabet letter, you simply key in the next letter in the person's name so you get less names to scan through.Also, it's a pity that my battery's life is so short - it lasts only about 2-3 days with minimal usage.Also, it would've been nice for my phone to have an infrared capability, although with the bluetooth technology, I guess I could live without the infrared.Overall though, my Motorola V3 is such a joy to behold!!
The nice thing about this phone is that it's thin, but it comes with lots of drawbacks.  The phone is rather wide and when using a bluetooth wireless headset you lose your individual ringers so you don't know who's calling.  If there's ever a time you don't want to look at the phone to see who's calling it's when you've got a wireless headset.  My biggest gripe with this phone though is you can't hear it.  Even with the volume turned all the way up it's nowhere near loud enough.  You need to be in a dead quiet room to hear your voicemail, for example.  Lastly they're rather unreliable.  I had to exchange mine twice due to display failures and the one I've got now the outside screen doesn't sit right, it sits down below the metal edge.
I think this is a good phone. I owned a Moto V551 and this is almost the sameexcept it lacks as much memory. This phone has some good skins, themes, features,and a huge screen. It's camera is great considering it's only a VGA. I owned aSony Ericsson T616 and that camera stunk, I'd take this one over my old Sony.It could use more memory but overall it's a pretty good phone, especially whenyou can get one for only $40. If you're interested email me at Gibsoncat320@aol.com,I'd be happy to help you out. There are better phones out there but this wasn'tmeant to be a "Top of the Line" phone. It's an awesome looking all metal phone,get one if you really want one!!!
This is a nice phone and the deal on the unlocked version is good. BUT, it is supposed to come with "European charger with US adapter" After two tries Amazon could not send me one that actually had the US adapter in the box. Pretty hard to use the phone if you can't charge it.
I've been using a black RAZR for 3 months and here are my thoughts:THE GOOD========- FREE!! with a T-Mobile 1-year family plan- Better reception than my previous, 3 yr-old Nokia handset (6610)- Can use the same phone when travelling in Europe, Asia.

I fell in lust with the design of this phone from the first but the price at the beginning threw me off. So I'd just stare at it in the window, drool a little and then mooove on...And then the devil on my shoulder knocked me out, grabbed my wallet and the next thing I knew I had my hands on a beautiful new phone!As far as I'm concerned this phone fits its advertising exactly. It does everything it says it does and is small enough and sturdy enough that cramming it in your back pants pocket is easy. So if you expect it to do only what it advertises then you'll be fine. Just consider exactly what you want from your phone and research accordingly.I have only one problem and it won't be a doozy until further into the season. Yep, the aluminum case that makes it so durable also means that when its cold outside, answering the phone can be a temperature shock (ice cube to the ear anyone??). Good thing I live in the Caribbean, eh?Enjoy!
At first when I got my razr, I almost panicked because I thought it wasn't unlocked and that it couldn't be used for T-Mobile, only for Cingular. Since I have T-Mobile I tried my sim card and it worked. Thank God. It has the Cingular logo, which I wish it didn't have, but thats okay. Its a gift and I hope they enjoy this phone. Its one hot phone that I wish I had for myself. I liked the fast shipping. Thank you Sunshine.
The best phone I have owned yet!I use this phone strictly for calls...I'm not interested in much of the other gimmicks many phones have.  The Razr V3 is small not obtrusive and well designed.  If your someone who needs to have a phone on with you constantly, here is one that is a joy to carry while giving exceptional service with a great deal of style!
I've been a Motorola fan since early 90's (remeber the brick), I've tried for days ericsson ~ nokia and I feel out of place. So I know when I'm talking Moto.There's a phrase that surmises the V3 "It makes me feel all warm inside" Motorola hit a grand slam with this baby...Thin, sleek, functional, wow! I really look forward to newer and better devices in the future.There's still hope for Shaumburg!!!! Way to go Zander & Garriques!!!
The phone that I purchase is great.  It met all of the expectations of the razor phone.  BUT, the product description was misleading.  It said that it was "Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz service provider" To the untrained purchaser(me) I "assumed" (you know what happens when you assume!) that it was good for ANY service provider.  My son tried to use it with his Verizon account and was unable to get it hooked up.  At the very least, I think that the seller should have had a link (Like the one he sent me when I tried to return it!) to explain which providers it was good for.  The seller was very shady in his presentation of the product.  But if you have one of the GSM providers the phone is wonderful!
I bought the phone thru this seller, at that time i got a reply saying that it will be shipped soon. But a couple of hours later, i got the following message.Since you have agreed to accept a different item of lesser value we have processed a credit to your account as requested by the merchant.
My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message "network not available". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.
this is like the worst thing ever. it sucks. you cant even hear the other person talking.  i was trying to find out the features of this phone and it broke in half.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Only one downside: when closed, it looks like a cell-phone that belongs in the 90s. But open it, and you get as close to PC functionality as any palmtop/smartphone-sized device would take you.And the bulk and the weight is there as a price to pay for one essential killer feature: the most usable, reliable and fast QWERTY keyboard in the business. Before buying it, I read some rave reviews about how fantastic the keyboard is, and I was sceptical: I have seen too many lousy little QWERTY keyboards that did not even come close to being a viable typing instrument. I bought it and, before I knew it, I was doing typing on it - sometimes two or three pages - without any noticeable discomfort.The e-mail client is brilliant, with a great balance of complex functionality and bandwidth economy. The web browser, although Opera-based (it has its limitations), is usable, considering the tiny screen for web work. The screen size (very good for e-mails and Word documents) is the true reason why the functions of Excel-compatible spreadsheet and PowerPoint are really just fancy "can-do" features rather than realistic work tools.Even synchronization (for a long time, it was a sad shortcoming of Nokia smartphones) has now been sorted, and the supplied suite works well.A good alternative to Blackberry-type email-only devices in a solid and reliable Finnish build.
I just purchased this phone, and I love it. In regards to the vibrating comment, just hold down the astrick key and it will just go to vibrate mode, again to return back to normal mode. Simple as that. I have had no problems with menus, and correcting errors is easy. Just hit C in between the phone icons. Its is a nice looking phone, nice ringtones, and basic features for those like me who don't need all the bells and whistles. I recommend it. This is my first LG phone (previous Nokia user) and am very pleased. If you have problems using the phone, use the manual.. That is what it is for!
I've had this phone for a few weeks now, and it gets the job done.  It's not a flashy phone for those looking for all the latest features, but it does have a IM capabilities, a couple standard games and decent ringtones.  My one complaint is that the phone drops calls easily when there is only one bar of service; I'd prefer if it just told you that there wasn't enough signal strength to make the call in the first place.  Overall though, the phone is well made and is of good quality and I recommend it to those looking for a basic entry level phone.
The user interface on this phone is pretty nice. It is easy to access the alarm clock and calendar features. As for the reviewer who complained about having to press "Names" and then press 1, I don't know why she doesn't just press the "phone" button (down on the arrow pad)--- it takes you directly to the phonebook. It also keeps a very useful, integrated history of not just outgoing calls but incoming and missed calls as well. However, the battery life on this thing is pretty awful. Strangely, it does not seem to have unreasonably poor talk time during long conversations. But on standby, especially overnight, the thing just dissipates. I think it is because the backlight lights up every few minutes even when it is not being touched at all, e.g. simply sitting on the desk in front of me. If you are ok with turning off your phone each night, you would likely have a more pleasant experience than I do.
It's a cheap phone and you get what you pay for.I bought 3 of these for my kids a week ago.  Within a couple of days I returned 2 of them because they kept recycling.  The third phone is now acting up and one of the 2 replacement phones is also acting up.  That's 4 out of 5 phones exhibiting this flaw.  I'll be swapping these LGs for something more reliable like a Nok or Moto.  No more LGs for me.Some of the others here noted things like the phone making noises and the screen lighting up for no reason.  That's the phone recycling and it does it for no reason.  Next time it does it, look at the display and you will see that your bars go away.  If you happen to be on a call when it does this, it disconnects you.In the last week, I've invested way too much time diagnosing this problem for Cingular.  I can force the phone to recycle just by holding it near my MP3 player, or laptop.I have a Moto V3 Razor and it works flawlessly.
I recently got this phone, and I really hate everything about it.  It has a tiny battery life -- a day or two, even if I don't talk on it at all.  It interferes with my laptop like crazy, even when it's not in use -- I have to keep it at least 10 feet away.  Also, to do almost anything takes way more steps than it rightfully should.  When you go into your "names" section, you can't just type the letter of someone's name.  you have to first hit 1, and if you mess up, and then hit 1 and try to go back, it will highlight "delete all contacts," which I have almost done countless times.  And I have yet to figure out how to edit a word in text messages; I don't think it can be done.  In fact, everything about text-messaging is difficult to use (compared to my old Nokia phone).  I would really, really discourage you from buying this phone.  In fact, I registered with Amazon just to warn people.
I'm sending mine back since the reception/transmission of voice is disrupted by my home wireless LAN, something that never happened with my Nokia 3588i. The battery life is short (about like my the 3588i, but with GSM I was looking for a lot more battery life.) The display is hard to read(I'm 50), a light blue background for wall paper might help.This phone lites up at odd times, jingles when i plug in a ear bud or when i remove the ear bud, it jingles when it powers up, it jingles at other times, for as yet undetermined reasons. I want the phone to be silent when I'm at work. What if you are hiding out and need to call the police to tell them there is an intruder in your home, this phone will lead the intruder to your location.I did like the fact that it has a dedicated side button to control the ringer and call volume, saves you from going to a menu to set the phone on vibrate, or pausing in your conversation to adjust call volume.I was amused to find that there are no pre-set profiles for vibrate only, you can have ring, ring & vibrate, vibrate and then ring. I have not figured out if these profiles can be customized or if I can download a new one to the phone.I am disapointed that it seems that cell phones still do not have a feature that allows me on a day of the week basis to time automatically switching back and forth between two profiles. I would like to go to vibrate at 8 AM and back to ring at 6 PM,Monday through Friday and leave it on ring on Saturday, and back to vibrate for church etc ...I should have read the reviews here first.
I've had the phone for five days so far and I think I'll  return it. It has a short battery life, about one day of life with little use. I'm receiving my voicemails several hours late.  I bought two ringtones which I was charged for but never got the ringtones downloaded to the phone and the cingular operator wasn't able to resolve the issue. Also, the phone wouldn't receive or make calls for part of one day then it just started working again.
I received this phone as a "replacement" for a motorolla V180 less than 24 hours ago.  Several horrible aspects: size, personalization, connections.I think this phone was designed for children under 10.  It is very awkward to hold while talking or dialing numbers.  The buttons are extremely tiny and hard to hit accurately.  Have fun trying navigating through the menu with the 5 key directional button.With the V180 I was allowed to create my own hotkeys and rearrange the menu to my liking.  That feature has been replaced with a preset menu and hotkeys I don't use at all, thanks Cingular.  It has a horrible looking faceplate with an island(??) graphic you can't remove or change.  The selection of graphics and ringtones are pathetic, except the "here comes the bride" ringtone, that one can stay!!.Personalization wouldn't be a problem if it had a USB port like the V180.  There is absolutely no way to add anything to this phone without paying cingular.  No hacking in, no changing anything, you're stuck with LG menus and graphics.Not to hate completely on this phone...it does receive and make calls with adjustable volume.
I recieved the Nokia 6101 (which is essentially the same hardware as the 6102) cell phone from t-mobile a 2 days ago so here are some of my early impressions about the phone:Pros:- The great reception as with most nokia phones: My appt does not recieve a great coverage from my t-mobile and the only phones that work are ones from Nokia. I used a 6610 and a 6230 and there are no problems with the reception of the 6101.- IRDA to sync data: I own an IBM laptop which have IRDA build in. So it is convinent to use the Nokia PC Suite to sync the phone with my outlook.- Supports Mp3 ringtonesCons:- No Bluetooth: Unlike the 6230 the 6101/6102 does not have bluetooth.- Limited memory: I do not understand why Nokia did not include the external memory card slot, and music player compatibility with this phone. If it can play Mp3 ringtones then surely it can play mp3s, and it would have been great to add a 512 MB card to play music on the go.- Size and Weight: The phone is a bit bulky and heavier than other flip phones but not so much that it becomes uncomfortable in to carry around- Different charger: For some reason Nokia has a different charger for this phone. So your chargers for older models of Nokia will not be compatible.Overall I think this is a nice cell for business use. For entertainment and such, I think 6230 is still the Nokia leader.
This is coming from a person that has actually done a lot of research in phones, and is upgrading from a Nokia 3595.  Some people have been raving about the Razr V3, but in all honestly it isn't a very good phone.  The sound quality isn't very great, the phone although skinny, is very wide, and the camera is lack luster.  The keys are bland, and hard to use when not looking, and with the exception of Bluetooth and a 2nd LCD screen, it doesn't really do a whole lot.I consider this phone a great rival.  This phone and the Razr are in great competition for Cingular customers because both have great deals going on for 2-year agreement customers.  I actually got mine for roughtly 90 dollars because I upgraded as I previously mentioned.  I could have gotten a Razr, but this phone is much more practical.This phone has plenty of features:It has video captureCamera feature (which is pretty clear if you can hold the phone steadyA bright vivid LCD screen (2 actually)A sleek designGreat sized keysEasy navigationOverall very simplisticThis is Nokia's first successful flip phone, and they didn't do anything too outrageous.  It does have MP3 playback on ringtones, and full color graphics with available moving screen savers.  Sound quality is excellent, and the phone feels very durable.  Its a great size, and feels good in your hand.  Not only charges quickly, but has a very fair battery life.  I'm not sure about other 6102s, but mine came with NO dead pixels on either screen, so that's a great thing to not have to worry about.  Although this isn't important to a lot of people, it is to me... and this phone DOES not get face grease on it very easily... which is nice... because my friend has the one LG flip phone that you can use for 10 seconds and have the screen covered in face grease.With everything however, this phone does not have all the gadgets you may want.  It doesn't have Bluetooth, so you can't be lame like everyone else and get one of those earsets, at least not the "cool" ones.  The cases for it aren't exciting.  There is no expansion slot, this ISN'T a SmartPhone, so you can't do a lot of PDA functions.  The sound quality on the ringtones aren't too great, but there are a lot to choose from.  Its your call if you can justify spending $2.49 for one.  I personally have The Outsider by A Perfect Circle, and its pretty decent quality.  Unlike the Razr, this isn't meant for those who have hearing aids, but honestly, that feature isn't that great on the phone, the newer Razr phones coming out will better utilize that feature I believe, but they will be a great deal more money.This phone did recognize my Sim Card VERY quickly, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not much configuration involved.  I didn't even have to set up the time or date.  The phone didn't set up my numbers into single name folders like my last phone, but it did default put a number next to it: i.e. Corey had 2 numbers... so now I have Corey and Corey1.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just something I noticed.  The interface is really nicely set up, but the only way to access the camera is to click the button on the right side.  The volume rocker is on the left side, and is very simple to use, and the ringtone can get LOAD, so you might want to make it a lower setting, unless you are hearing impaired.  Sim Card enclosure doesn't seem very durable, and I was nervous when I need to take it out breifly... it was also pretty difficult to open.BOTTOM LINE:  This is a very durable, easy, phone to use for anyone, and will definately last you until the next phone generation arised.  At a great price, with some great deals, this is an ideal phone to suit all your NEEDS, even though it doesn't supply all your WANTS.  This stylish phone is a great addition to the Nokia line, as well as the flip-phone craze.  In my opinion a more balanced phone than the Razr V3, but like everything, it depends on who you are, and what you use it for.SUSPECTED LEARNING CURVE: 30 minutes to 1 hour... very quick considering the number of features...

I have been a Cingular customer for 18 months or so, after switching from Sprint. I have long wanted to switch away from Cingular again due to the poor reception and frequently dropped calls on my original phone. The phone was a Samsung entry-level model, zero cost with 1-year plan. I spoke with a few of my friends in the area and they swore that their Cingular experience has been better than mine. They all have more expensive phones. After some research, I decided to give Cingular a second chance by buying the Nokia 6102 out of pocket (rather than getting an upgrade "deal" with a 2 year contract extension.)It was a good decision. This phone has turned me into a happy Cingular customer, for the most part. The reception is much stronger. My old phone would give 0 bars at my house, this one gives 1-3 bars and holds calls even inside my house. It still drops calls in a few low spots that I drive through, but I figure that's unavoidable.The camera is a cute toy. It takes blurry pictures in poor lighting, but decent shots in good light. I got a USB download cable to retrieve my photos. I have yet to get Cingular's multimedia messaging to work to email the pics to my account. (I suspect that's a Cingular problem, not a phone problem).The wireless web browser is nice, and it's a real convenient way to upload pics and sounds to the phone. The data cable also works well for that, and the free (from the Nokia website) software for the cable includes tools to help construct images and sound clips.Managing my address book took some work. I had all my numbers stored on the card from my old phone. The new phone didn't read the card quite the same way: it kept all the numbers, but lost the flags that told me which number was home, work and cell for each person. Eventually I moved all my numbers to my Windows Address book and use the cable and software to sync the two. That works beautifully.Bottom line: The phone is great. Cingular still has a few quirks that I live with. Toy camera is fun. Data cable is a highly recommended accessory.Followup on Nov 29, 2005:Still love my phone. I've not noticed any problems with pushing buttons by accident when it's closed.My USB cable is *not* the one that Nokia sells for $50. It's an asian unbranded cable that I paid around $15 for. Use Google to find one. Had a bit of fun getting the drivers straight at first, but otherwise works like a charm. Also, I think the IrDA function is supposed to work with the Nokia software as well, if you have an IrDA laptop or similar device.Finally, if you have a website somewhere that you can put files up for download, it's pretty easy to load images and ringtone sound files into the phone using the wireless web browser. Just upload to your website and then download via the phone browser. All you pay for is the airtime to download.
I replaced my sony ericson with Nokia 6102 flip phone, and I found the following differences:Nokia has:1. Better sound quality2. Better reception3. Great speakerphone: clear and loud though sometimes echoes on the other side, depending on my location.4. Camera is nice but the quality is grainy and flash/evening mode is not great at all. Pictures come out real dark and not clear.5. Less talk time (4 hours) and I have to charge battery every evening, as after 2 hours of talking, which is my average daily use, the battery is real low. Compared to my ericson, which I charged once a week, this is a real setback.6. Battery also seems to take longer to charge. My ericson after 15 mins was 2 out of 4 bars up. Nokia takes 30-45 mins for 2 bars.7. It is very hard to find a nicely fitting case for flip phones. If you like a swivel belt clip or a pouch case, you will like it, but if you prefer a sleeve-case you will find it difficult to find something suitable for a reasonable price.8. It's not bluetooth, so you won't be able to use wireless gadgets, but I find speakerphone sufficient for hands-free-conversations. The only problem with the hands-free option is when you receive a call, you have to flip open the phone to push the button for hands-free talk. If you are placing the call, you have to wait till the other party picks up - only then you can use the hands-free button.9. Recently I discovered a voice-call option. Pushing a button on the left activates a voice tag receptor. If you saved someone's number in the address book and assigned voice to it (such as "Home"), saying "home" while the voice receptor is on will dial the number. Very nice when your second hand is full of groceries! But the number of voice tags is limited. I think it is 10 maximum.In overall, I gave it 4 stars because of a comparatively weak battery, but in terms of serving basic phone functions it works very well.
This is by far the coolest and best cell phone I have ever owned. The reception is great everywhere, even at my home where reception is generally poor. The camera and video features are superb, extremely well image quality, the one thing it lacks is bluetooth capapbilties. I used to have a motorola v220 which was a horrible phone, and i also have a sony erricson z500 and an older nokia through cingular, but this tops them all. kudos to nokia, a job well done
What do you look for in a cell phone? Is it battery life, features, design, or call quality? Well, let me tell you, you will find all of those in the Nokia 6102.I have had many phones throughout my 2.5 years of being a Cingular Customer. Many have caught my eye, but none like this one has.The design of this phone is amazing. It is the second flip-style Nokia phone I've owned. The flip itself is very sturdy, and the phone does not feel plasticy at all. The spring in the phone feels much better than any Motorola or Samsung flip phone I've ever had. The buttons are a very nice size, which is a good thing for many people. The color, grey and black is an awesome color scheme.All Nokia phones have the basics, text messaging, picture messaging, wireless internet access, etc. This phone takes all of that a step further with class 6 EDGE, FM radio capability, and it has dual displays. The menus are also much easier to use than other phones, and other Nokias.The battery life on this phone is amazing!!! I've made many calls after receiving the phone a few days ago, and the battery strength indicator has not gone down at all! That's pretty amazing. The battery also charges very quickly. A newly designed Nokia charger is used with this device. It's very unique, and is alot smaller than other Nokia chargers.Nokia phones have always been known for their excellent call quality, and ability to keep calls in very low-signal areas. This Nokia phone is no different. There is no traditional GSM hiss noise with this phone, only crystal-clear calls that stay connected for a very long time even in low-signal areas.My overall opinion of this phone is that it is a very trustworthy phone, that won't let you down, especially when you need it most. It has excellent battery life, call quality, and it has all of the features that you will ever need. I have had many phones in the past, and I would recommend this phone above all others.
I just wanted to quickly clarify and respond to something another reviewer said. It is in fact possible to assign individual ring tones to people. You just have to create a group and then add that person to the group. Once you do that you can assign a ring tone to the "group." Yeah, it's not as simple as my last phone, a Motorola, but it's still pretty quick and easy.Additionally, you can in fact use a photo you took a while ago to attach it to a contact. Click on the entry in your phone book, Click on Options -> Add Detail -> Image, then search through your saved images. Again, a little time consuming, but I just did it under 10 seconds. In the grand scheme of the phone's features, I wouldn't let those things deter me from purchasing the phone.I am having the same issue about accidentally pressing buttons while the phone is closed. It's more a puzzler than an annoyance at this time as it doesn't seem to drain the battery any quicker or cause any problems besides the fact that I have to click out of the feature.Overall I love my phone, and would highly recommend it. I actually like that the phone display and ear piece is larger than some other phones, I find it to be more user-friendly, personally. I bought my phone to use as a phone, and as such I have been very satisfied with its performance.
The latest flip phone by Nokia is what you call a basic phone with added features at a reasonably low price.It has been 1 month since i have owned it and i did come across a few issues which are1) the battery status bar is not accurate.I took the liberty of not charging my phone for about 4 days looking at the bar which showed about 75% ,and on the 5th day it went dead.But thankfully it came alive after i charged it overnight.So i guess it has to be charged daily.2) It supports MP3 ringtones but it has about 4 MB of memory.4mb? it is too minimal for a phone to support media and mp3.3 pics and 2 ringtones ...and the memory is full.I had to get rid of most of the nokia logos and ringtones to accomodate my personal stuff.Anyway the phone is pretty okie but it would do better with a memory card slot.Considering the number of free and reasonably good phones available this is a so-so deal.At least it was better than my earlier phone the siemens flip phone.So i guess 4 **** is the rating i would like to give it.
This is a very good cell phone and Amazon.com gives the best deal. But, you can't transfer your old phone number from different provider to Cingular through Amazon.com. If you transfer your old phone number, you won't get your mail-in rebate. Please read amazon.com mail-in rebate rules carefully!!!You can read about how to transfer your number through this link : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/508597/102-6686881-6992121
This phone is great. It has all kinds of Voice activated things, from dialing to sending messages. For my alarm clock tone, It's my voice saying "WAKE UP!! WAKE UP!!" How cool is that. Oh well it definitely beats my other phone (Motorola v220- "NO hello moto")(^_^)
I bought this phone from amazon and it is worth the price. It has all the nice features I wanted and the cingular coverage is also pretty good in our area. Overall I would give 5 stars.
Nokia's new, compact flip is easy to use and the navigation is what you have come to expect from a leader in mobile devices.  The clarity of the dual screens is optimal and the VGA camera is acceptible.  The volume control is a little on the weak side so don't expect to hear a whole lot in a crowded room.  The speakerphone, however, is exceptional.  The navigation buttons are easy to push - quite possibly too easy particularly if you've got larger fingers.  The alarm clock allows for customizing the snooze :)  Ringtones are okay, the polyphonic tones are a bit tinny but that is probably due to a smaller chord range than most mid-range cellphones.  As with all Nokia's customizing to your liking is a snap!  The backlight turns off on its own which means you could be in the middle of something when it shuts down.  It is an active-flip so its not necessary to press extra buttons to answer or end a call.  The phones come with a PTT button - a feature that isn't yet available. No bluetooth but the infrared is sufficient.  General feel of the phone is that it has a nice fit but it does feel a little on the cheap side.  Reasonably price for a low to mid-range phone.
my uncle got this fone from amazon and saved a lot more money than if he went to buy it at a cingular store that sold it for(...)!

I've only had this phone for 12 hours but I love it so far.  I bought a Razr a few days ago and the recption is not as good as the Nokia 6682 and the Razr sound quality is horrible.  The Nokia sound quality is good even with one bar of reception usually.  I'm in an area hit by hurrican Katrina and the network is still bad with Cingular.I've barely scratched the surface with all the features but I love it so far.  The --INCLUDED-- Nokia software AND USB cable made entering my contacts very painless.  I entered 40 or so in maybe 15 minutes.  Motorola does not include software OR the data cable.The menus take some getting used to but seem fine. overall.  I'm really looking forward to exploring all the software for the Symbian operating system.  I'm using it for internet right now on my desktop and getting file download speeds of 12KB/sec at times, about 100k or so.  I couldn't even get a web page to pull up with the Razr.  You can also view full web pages on the phone, although they are a bit hard to read if they are not formated for phones.The camera is MILES better than the Razr.  The quality is about as good as a cheap digital camera.  The sliding lens cover is great too.  Phone also comes with a screen protector already on that I almost didn't even notice.  I'm going to see if I can buy some more.The biggest problem I've found so far is the buttons small and are a bit hard to press with your thumb, but not so bad after some practice.MP3 player in the phone is really nice too.  They even include headphones, which is good since they have to be Nokia headphones.  No standard headphone jack, sorry.  The 64mb media card is respectable and can be upgraded to 1gb.  *** If you want a smartphone with Bluetooth you MUST consider this one.**Day 3 Update: The battery life is advertised.  MP3 playback is just great though I wish I could use my sony headphones.  Music can also play through speakerphone but quality is lacking this way.  Gotta get a bigger flash card too.  64mb card only holds about 9 songs encoded with lame codec (about 180kbps).  Menus are a bit clunky but it's understandable with such a tremendous amount of functions, some just get lost.  (took me forever to realize you just click on a song to start playing)  Works great with bluetooth headset.**Day 20 Update: Think I should change my rating to 4 stars.  Still like the phone but I'm having stability problems.  It tends to lock up if I make a few menu changes, requiring a power off/on.  The voice dialing seems to suck too.  I'm thinking about sending mine in for a replacement.  I've been using the basic voice dialing instead of the premium version which is only a 7 day trial.  I'd be very happy with the functionality if it would just recognize the names when I say them.
I've had this phone for about a week now and am pretty impressed with it's features. Nokia makes a solid phone and the 6682 is definitly top of their list. It's at a great price now and will be a great phone for people as they wait for the Nokia N91 due out next year.Pros:1. Size, screen and keys. I had a 3650 before, and this phone is about an inch shorter and a bit thinner. That being said it's still bigger than most phones out today. The keys are solid and have a great feel to them and are slightly "tilted" so that they can be felt easily. The screen is amazing! Very bright and smart to boot. It has a light sensor that adjusts the screen and key lighting to be best viewed in your surroundings (great for extending battery life as well).2. I have always liked the 'poor' quality pictures from my 3650. They have a nice 'polariod' feel to them. This phone has a great camera. 1.3 megapixels may be a bit much for a phone, but i'm sure folks will be wondering how they got along without it after a while. The camera also has a flash, which i find isn't very useful past a few feet (but hey, it's a nice feature for a phone). Lastly, the camera has a 6x digital zoom on it which works very well and has been something lacking in picture phones for a while now. bravo!3. Software. The apps installed on this phone definitly set it up as a smart phone. You can view and edit (edit for a fee) most office documents and pdf files (same software as on the treo 650). There are also several other apps that might make people's lives easier, but I find that just having the solid Series 60 Symbian software does it for me. The OS is very solid and provides lots of usable features like Contact management which allows several numbers to be assigned to the same person (motorola doesn't do this).4. PIM software is great. A new 'today' screen has been added called 'active standby' which shows your meetings, todos and any messages you have received.5. The speakerphone and noise cancelling microphones are excellent! I can use this phone in most places and people can hear me loud and clear.6. Removable media slot. Finally! The OS even shuts down apps that use the card so you don't loose any information. Brilliant!Cons:1. RC-MMC card. I'm sure this was chosen because of space limitations, but it would have been nice not to have to buy new storage cards for just this phone. Also, i've read several reports of bad conflicts with upgrading this card to a larger size. It comes with 64Mb, but you really want 512Mb for this phone.2. Headphone jack. There isn't one. You have to use the supplied headphones from Nokia. They are good headphones, but not having the mini-jack prevents users from enjoying the MP3 capabilities on their favorite headphones.3. This phone trumps the Motorola ROKR in all ways except that it doesn't resume the music after you hang up a call (it stops it when the phone rings though). Hopefully Nokia fixes this in a future software release.4. Should have had a simple USB connection
I noticed other reviewers are ordering 1GB memory cards.  At the time of this review, there are no 1GB memory cards available.  This phone uses DVRSMMC (DUAL VOLTAGE REDUCED SIZE MULTIMEDIA CARDS, aka MMCmobile) memory, not RSMMC that's being sold on Amazon.  RSMMC will not work in this phone.This is an incredible phone and Amazon offers a great price for it.3rd party support is well established with plenty of programs and games for purchase or free.The camera suffers from indoor lighting, but is excellent in natural light.  Pictures in the dark with the flash turn out well.
I got the Nokia 6681 (the rest-of-the-world counterpart of 6682) as a gift. It was purchased in India and shipped via fedex. However, I  liked the phone so much that I wanted to share my thoughts.This phone really has all that it talks of. I am using this with T-mobile service and i have not had any complains so far. the usual stuff you expect from a phone works exactly as expected. e.g. voice quality is good, handsfree is alright, address book is better than most other phones. What takes this phone to new heights is all this:1. Awesome email features. I have hooked up this phone to my POP3 email at my personal website and my phone checks for email on its own every 30 minutes. I have had almost no complains with sending receiving emails with attachments etc. I use this for my mobile blog at textamerica dot com.2. Good web browser. The default web browser is very good at its job. However, the Opera browser found as an extra is a killer app. I do not miss any features from a desktop type browser in my opera - except for the ability to play avi videos, flash websites, quicktime videos etc. (This is not the phone's problem though. It is just that quicktime perhaps does not have a mobile phone plugin for playing videos yet. This phone is just too far ahead of time). Opera has ovely keyboard shortcuts for using its features.3. When I thought of using this phone for internet and email, i felt a resistance inside me to use the phone keyboard and I felt that buying a bluetooth keyboard will be an aboslute must. However, after using this phone for a few days, I really have had no issue using the phone keys. They dont even "feel" like they will fall apart with extensive usage - very strong "feel" to the phone keys.4. User interface. The makers of this phone really must have talked to some people like me for a long time before making this phone. I did not have any issues understanding any of the error messages or the menu options or information messages on the phone. The user interface even "guesses" what the user wants to do on various buttons. For example, when I open my mailbox and dont do anything for like a second or two, the phone asks me if i want to connect to the internet and download emails - i just press "yes" and i get what i need. If not, i would have to probably press the right sequence of buttons to download email. An easy phone.5. Camera is very good. I took snaps of my friends - and all of them expressed their surprise (seperately) at the image quality. video is also very good.6. Memory card. Nice! however, the default 64 MB memory card is not good enough if you are going to listen to music on this. I have ordered a 1 gig card from amazon.7. MP3 player is as good as an ipod or other devices - except that there is not desktop software like itunes. The speaker phone can produce loud enough music while nokia earphones are good. I intend to hook this up with my windows media player soon - i dont know how though.8. The only thing i did have trouble with was the fact that this phone has only 8 megs of on board ram. For some reason, my phone has already chewed up 3 or 4 megs with some stuff i have no clue about. I need to figure that one out.
(Update)(Jan 06) Still love the phone, had a issue with the call log dumping after power down. Cingular sent a silent update and all is well. As for the memory card, The 1g Sandisk I ordered, was not DV so back it went. I'm going to buy the 1gb Kingston. The internal memory is very limited, they could have packed in a little more. I bought the plantronics 510 bluetooth, which works great, I hate to talk on my home phone now. I also picked up some "ClearVue" screen protectors and my phone screen looks new again. I sync my nokia via Bluetooth to my Dell 9200 laptop. My pics are transferred automatically when I'm less than 20-30 feet away. I syncronize my enews and ebooks via Mobipocket reader (uses internet on laptop) which saves me data charges. Also I added another program (MDialer)which predicts what phone number or name I'm typing (MS Smartphone has this built in and I liked this feature) for $3.99. I picked up the Sony Ericcson z520a for my wife, the reception is great, but otherwise I hate the phone, the nokia is like Windows XP comapared to DOS. In other words the Nokia is so superior to the z520a.I've had the phone for 4 days now and I love it. Lots of 3rd party software. I gave up my Motorola MPx200 (WM2003rom). I liked my old phone, but no reception. The speakerphone was also very lousy. Comparing it to the MS Smartphone, the Nokia was much easier to use. No more reboots. The phone's quality is excellent, feels a little heavy. but nice. Some people complained about the buttons, I'm 6'2" 225lbs and have pretty big hands and fingers, I have no problems with the buttons. The phone boots up much faster than MS smartphones. The Nokia's speaker phone is plenty loud as compared to the motorola's. I ordered a bluetooth earpiece and 1gb sandisk rs-mmc. I will add more when I recieve them. Battery seems to last a full day. It will probably last longer when I quit playing/installing etc. The only negative so far, I may be wrong, is the games are not as graphically nice like Lynks Golf on the MS Smartphone. Reception is amazing. Finally!
Pros:-Syncs outlook contacts, notes and appointments-Well built, quality-Nice large and bright screen-Opens Word,Execl, Powerpoint or PDF-EDGE fast internet access (I hookup my laptop via bluetooth)-Games, apps, web browsing, emailing is way cool-Video recording is only limited by your memory size.-Extra memory is cheap to buy.Cons:-Camera sucks in doors. You can not get a good picture in bad lighting. Flash is either insufficient or camera screws up white balancing when flash is used. Colors go orangey when flash is used in close distance-Bundeled Headphones are not practical. They are uncomfortable, too long and cord is too stiff.-MP3 organization is not practical. Sorting by album or artist is not supported. Playlists are cumbersome.
Bought this phone through Cingular a few months ago, I love it.  Previously I had a Nokia 6200, which I loved for the size and durability.I couldn't get a 6230 so I went with the 6682.Pros-  The size it a bit bigger than the 6200/6230, but the corners have a good radius so it's easy to shove in a pocket.  Good flexible interface.  You can use the standby mode and  soft keys to set the phone up however you want.  Well done for sure.  Battery life is solid.  If I use the other features (games,  music, video, etc...) the battery will still get me through a  day but not much more.  If it's just the phone it will last  maybe 4-5 days.  Display is quite nice.  Camera works great outdoors, but if it takes pics using the  flash it screws them up pretty bad.  As long as there is  enough light the camera is very useful.  I'm sure there is a  way to tweak the settings and dial it in, but I haven't  screwed with it.  Memory card slot is awesome to have.  I bought a 512 card  when I bought the phone but it wasn't dual voltage and the  phone wouldn't recognize it.  I was pretty upset about that,  but I'll buy the 1gb Kingston card here soon and will be all  set.Cons-  The speak to talk...I like to use it occasionally (I used it  exclusively on my 6200), but I don't know if I need to buy a  license for the VoiceSignal program to use it on the 6682.  Wish it had a normal headphone jack so I wasn't tied to the  Nokia headsets.  I understand that there is an adapter I can  buy, but I'd rather see it on the phone.  I'd like a way to shut off the phone part of the phone so I  can use it as an MP3 player on flights.  My laptop has a nifty switch to shut off the wireless NIC, I believe a similar feature would allow me to use it on planes.  Sometimes the phone will lock up and I'll have to pull the  battery to reset it, don't know if I can have it flashed out  with an update to solve this problem.  It rarely happens, but  when it does you don't notice until you try to use the phone.  Calls get missed etc...All in all it's a solid phone, very pleased with it.  I bought a RAZR for my wife at the same time, I was not impressed with it, especially next to my Nokia.
Lots of nice stuff packed into this compact design. The camera is surprisingly very good.
Wow, way too much negtivity with reviews based on things about this phone that aren't even true.(mostly by kids who don't even own this phone)THIS phone IS AWESOME for children ages 7-12, especially as a FIRST cell phone. It PURPOSLY DOESN'T HAVE a keypad because we all know how kids tend to run up ridiculous text messaging charges with their cell phones.THIS phone is geared towards younger children and not even meant for teens.It doesn't ONLY allow kids to 'call home' either, as some reviewers have stated. There are dedicated buttons for both mom & dad's #'s, one for 911/emergency and space for 22 other numbers in the phone book! I know, that as a mom, my 11 year old daughter doesn't NEED more that the amount of numbers it allows. PLUS, yes, the parents use a pin # and CAN control the numbers their child can call-BUT its not MANDATORY that a parent control the pin #! lol I trust my 11 year old enough, that she KNOWS the number I choose and she can add another phone number if she wants.My daughter just LOVES her phone and its a shame that some 'spoiled' kids nowadays feel they have to have a cellphone with all the bells and whistles-which wind up costing mom and dad a fortune in un-necessary charges. A younger child aged, 7-12 does NOT need anything more than this GREAT lil Phone offers!NOR, has my dughter EVER been laughed at by friends/schoolmates for having her Firefly phone. On the contrary, they have all said how 'cool' it is and a few have even gotten their own already as a result of seeing hers!lol(or plan to in the near future)The minutes are fair and each refill of a $25.00 card gets you 120 minutes which are valid for 90 days. For my child and children in her age group, its the PERFECT PHONE!
The target market for this phone is kids ages 8 to 12, although I recommend it more for the younger half of the group. 6 and 7-year-olds might be able to use it depending on the child.We know how kids are reckless about making and receiving too many phone calls. Firefly lets parents control who they call. The phone comes with a PIN so parents can program the phone and kids can't change it unless they figure out the PIN. The female button is typically the button for calling mom. The other one for calling dad. I programmed it so the female calls home and male calls Dad's cell phone.The address book only shows phone numbers for the people that the parents entered into the phone. The child also can't view his phone number, so it's possible to make it a one-way phone (calling out). I am comfortable with technology and I couldn't figure out how to program it without reading the instructions and this is a rarity for me.But it's easy to do once you get it figured out... a little tedious as there are no numbers on the phone. But that keeps it very lightweight. Besides, once you've entered the acceptable phone numbers -- you won't need to deal with entering phone numbers again except to add someone new.It might be a good phone for my 6.5-year-old because it would let him get in touch with us should anything happen. For my 11-year-old, I far prefer her sidekick since she can type to me (I'm hearing impaired) and besides -- it's better letting her get calls from friends on her own phone so she doesn't take up our phone line.This comes in multiple colors. I read some kid reviews who said it was an ugly phone. I think the male / female icons should be something else. But it's a simple phone -- how can it be ugly? When I was in the paging business, jellybean pagers (similar to the Firefly phone -- oval, different colors) were a hit with kids. So I can't imagine the issues with the looks.It also has a useless, but cute and fun feature where you push a button and it does fireworks -- the phone lights up, makes music, and shows a cartoon in the screen. It will probably get old fast even though there are about five different choices. You can also program the keys to have different colors in the screen. Kids like that stuff.All in all... it's a good starter for the younger set. Nothing fancy. Give it about 3 to 3.5 stars.
I'm here because I'm going to buy this phone for my 7 & 9 year old daughters. Yes, $99 is a lot to spend on a phone. But you know what, right now I don't care. We just moved to a new neighborhood and my 9 year old got off at the wrong bus stop on Friday. The bus was early so I had no idea what happened. She wandered around for a while, scared and upset until a neighbor found her and brought her home. She was blocks away. My daughter has some communication issues but at least she had the good sense to recite her address so someone could help her. Over dinner tonight, my daughter suggested that if she had the Firefly phone she could call me if she got lost. She's absolutely right. I don't care what it looks like. I don't care how "cool" it is. I only care about the fact that she can reach me in an emergency and I can control the phone calls that she makes and receives. She's only 9 (and her sister is 7) and they're both way too young for a "regular" phone. The peace of mind a device like this affords is worth it.
This phone is a great idea for the kids. Yeah it is a bit expensive and you could give your kids a regular cell phone and buy minutes or add them on to your plan for about $10.00 a month extra with most companies BUT they also will have FULL use to call ANYONE, anytime they want! This way they are limited to the numbers you program in (and also 911 access in an emergency-which all kids should know) so you do not have to worry whether or not they have been on the regular cell phone with their friends, for hours, burning up the minutes. Then YOU wind up with a huge bill! This phone is also a bit more rugged than "adult" cell phones. My son is 11 and he LOVES it! ALL his friends think it is cool and want one now too! He has yet to find one kid he knows that thinks it is not cool. I would reccommend this to any parent.
i just got this phone exept i got mine from target stores . i love it. if i were a parent i would buy them one the only thing is 100 dollars but o well i still like it!
This new phone called the "Firefly" is the absolute cutest thing I've seen.  It's small enough to fit just about anywhere from a backpack to a pocket, and it's just the thing I've been looking for.  I have very active kids (as most people these days do) and I'm never quite at ease when they leave my side because that would mean that I'm not there if they need me (which is probably more of a problem for me than it is for them).  This new phone is perfect for the younger kids, 8-12, who just aren't ready for the freedom of a standard cell phone, but they still have the ability to make and receive calls from the people I program into their phone.  All I know is that this is the "comfort zone" I've been needing so that I know my kids can reach me in the event that they might actually need me.  And, with Christmas rapidly approaching, I can tell you what's going to be under a lot of their friend's trees this year.  I'm already getting calls from other parents asking what their kids are all talking about.  I hope they made a ton of these new phones to cover the demand that I'm figuring will ensue this holiday season.
My husband and I gave this to our daughter, and it makes her feel like a "big girl". She adores the lights, and her friends are all jealous! She also likes that she can call me to pick her up from a friends house, without asking if she can use the phone!!The little Firefly phone is giving my "big girl" a little more independence, and me a little more piece of mind!!
I just purchased this phone and think it's a great idea.  What if your kid is at soccer practice and it ends early he/she can call home and say mom/dad pick me up practice ended early.  It allows you to program the phone for easy calls to Mom, Dad and 20 other people you add to the phone book.  You can also set the phone to receive calls only from the people in the address book OR you can set it so it can receive calls from anyone (parents choice).  I think this phone is aimed more at kids around 7-10/11. It also has an emergencies 911 button on the right hand side (you need to hold the button for 3 sec. then press the green phone symbol on the phone to place the call).  I think it's generally a good idea... i.e. if your child stays over a friends house and wants to call home...  your child is on a school bus and the bus gets stuck somewhere he/she can call you and let you know they are ok and theres a problem with the bus... I would recommend to anyone who has a child in that age range
Reception isnt that great and set-up is a little time consuming but I dont have to worry. Prepaid minutes and I dont have to worry who he's talking to.
I've heard about the Firefly on the news. It is a cell phone that parents can give to their kids for emercencies, and it will not not let you do anything else. It is a great way for parents to make sure their kids are safe. You can bring it to school (and leave it in your locker) or if you are going somewhere with your friends, you can take it with you.P.S.- It looks so cute!
firefly mobile is good for kids because kids cant have big phones.!
Ok, I admit, I don't own a Firefly and am sorry to everyone who got the wrong idea from my incorrect data. (it, unfortunatly, came from an unreliable and anonymous source). Sure,I still think that(compared to other prepaid phones) is a rip-off for people under 12. Every one of my friends have phones from Sprint, Nokia, and Nextel. After careful consideration, I have decided that it just depends on how old you are to use it. Once again, sorry for the wrong info.
I previously wrote a review for the Firefly. Just to clean things up a bit I'm going to correct it.  Yes, I still think this phone is ridiculas- especially for 100 dollars. But after talking with my unfortunate 13 year old friend who had (his parents have now gotten him a normal cell phone)the Firefly, I've decided that this phone is alright for kids aged 7-11.  Now parents, PLEASE, save your preteens and teens some angst- buy them a normal cell phone!  I still think that younger kids could use a normal easy to use (such as the the Virgin Mobile K9 (25 bucks)) cell phone. But what ever- do what you want.  But teens will not want this phone!
If I would buy this in the future for my kids, they would be laughed at!!!! My bests friend's over-protective parents bought her this cell phone, now SHE IS THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE SCHOOL!!!!! Ok, Ok this phone is good for ages 5-8 but preteens and teens do not need this, this is an embarassment for them, and to my bff, now they call her "Baby Brat, Baby Brat".  When I was in 4th grade I had a Nokia cell phone, the same phone as my mom!!!!  So please if you are going to buy this for your kid, please, oh PLEASE dont give it to a 13 year-old. Oh I woulnt even give 1 star for it, maybe like a negative 1 million!!!!
My opinion is based on having Verizon service for five years and using several phones (LG and Motorola).  This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.  I noted one user complained about battery life and also noted they seem to be using it a lot in weak signal area.  This is a trimode phone that may flip to analog mode in a weak area.  If that happens, any analog phone will suck the battery dry in no time.  they should configure the phone to prevent flipping to analog mode.I wanted analog because there is a large section of backwoods Texas that has the old GTE analog service still present.  The rest of the time, I am around big cities and strong digital network presence. I travel all of the US in my job and use the phone everywhere.  My previous phone was a VX4400 which had some bugs. This phone is everything the VX4400 should have been, plus it has a very loud ringer, vibrator, and one of the better speakers I've heard on a cell phone.I love the small size and light weight. This phone was acquired on a "new every two" plan.  I originally got the VX6100 and found that it was more cumbersome, had shorter battery life and a tinny sounding speaker.  I had no use for the camera, so traded back for the VX3300. My wife has had the VX3200 for over a year and she loves it.  This is the latest re-incarnation of the VX3200.I purchased the mobile office kit and it works well with this phone. I've used Verizon digital network service with my PC for two years and its been a real boost when I am in the airport and need to do some email without having to pay extra.One of these days I'll have a blackberry or treo when my company will let me hook it into our corporate email system. Until then, this is perfect for what I want.
We had 4 of the 3200 on a family plan, but recently one of them got lost and I had to buy a replacement. Alas, the great 3200 wasn't available anymore, so I got this one instead. Still a good phone, but not nearly as good as the phone it replaces.First, for reasons I don't understand, LG removed the charger jack. You now have to charge the phone through the accessory connector, which means that you probably are going to keep the rubber cover for that connector permanently off the phone or it becomes tedious. This is a real step back.Second, the phone has lots of additional silly ringtones, but far fewer "normal" rings. I assume that they are trying to position the phone specifically as a "kid and teenager" phone and try to discourage adults from buying it. Guess what: I used to have a camera and web-capable phone, but I purposefully downgraded to the 3200 because I wanted a no-frills phone with a built-in speakerphone.If my phone gets lost or breaks, and Verizon doesn't have an adequate phone by then to replace it, I will proably rather change service providers than buy a "kid spec" phone or one of the humungous clunky camera/web/video gizmos that they currently target adults with.
I was a Audiovox/Verizon user from 1997-2001 then I fell into the hype of T-Mobile/Samsung. I liked my Samsung but the srvice sucked, my brothers could make a call standing next to me while my screen said no service. So I an now a Verizon/LG-VX3300 user CNET reveiwed this phone a gave it a 7.3 very good rating which was higher than the Samsung I had. So far service is clear and the phone feels solid. Can not complain though the phones were free and I paid no connection fees (Federal Employee).
This is my first cell phone. I had to decide between the VX 3300 and the VX 6100, so my review is mainly a comparison between these two LG tri-mode phones.Call quality (subjective): Good, though is a bit "tinny" - LG VX 6100 sounds the same.Speakerphone: Loud, works great, no distortion. Speakerphone will not work with phone closed (same for all LG phones), something that other cell phones do provide.Battery Life: Good. With moderate use loses 1 bar in a day, lasts 3 to 4 days without any charging in between. Conforms to specs.Battery definitely lasts longer than the VX 6100 mainly because the latter has a camera that can be activated through side buttons by mistake.Reception: Call quality is good, even within buildings (1 to 2 bars). LG VX 6100 has same reception as this phone, even within buildings.Features:-- This phone comes minus any bells and whistles. No camera.  Less "normal" ringtones (mentioned by other reviewers)than VX 6100.-- Charging Port cover: The small rubber cover for the charging port is something that can be easily misplaced. That said, most phones (Verizon or otherwise) do not cover the charging port so this is not a problem.-- Upgrade from VX 3200: The only difference between this model and the VX 3200 is the 8 MB flash memory upgrade and less normal ringtones. Sturdy construction exactly like other LG phones.-- Voice dial works, though takes some getting used to.-- Can leave voice memos, has calendar, usual scheduling features-- Color Screen: Almost impossible to see in daylight. Gets washed out just like the VX 3200. Color screen on VX 6100 is much better and is visible in daylight (docked 1 star for it).-- VX 6100 has external LCD to tell you who's calling. This would be a nice feature in the VX 3300, but not one that I personally miss. The VX 3300 can be set to answer on the first key pressed, you can see who's calling by opening the phone. Flip side: No LCD to be scratched!Verizon & Amazon.com Customer service: Good. Verizon service works in places where other services do not.Conclusion: This phone works for what it was designed for - making and receiving calls with good call quality and reception.
I just got this phone today. I have had alot of time with it. The picture on the LG is great nice, bright, and easy to read. Comes with cool ringtones to chose from. [I have the Can-Can.] I am 11 years old and it is awesome for a kid my age, you know without the camera an all that "jazzy" stuff in it. If your looking for a basic phone for kids or adults pick this one!!
For a basic no-frills cellphone, this one is hard to beat.
I think this phone is great for what it does... It is a striped down phone that connects to a great network flawlessly.In response to the previous review maybe you should take a look at the Motorola v260 the Kyocera kx1 or the LG vx4650. But it is interesting that your objection to the phone is the ring tones! You say you want a striped down phone but are willing to switch networks to get different ring tones? If you don't want a kid-targeted phone then why would you want a kid-targeted network?
You'd think from the reviews of this phone that it's the best thing since sliced bread. Well, guess what, NOT SO!!!This phone was partly appealing to me because of it's small size and weight and lack of all the stupid techno features that seem to be loaded on to the phones today (do we really need phones that can take 4MP pictures with a 10x freaking zoom lens???). Anyway, considering that it's a barebones phone then, the battery life is pathetic! I don't mean it lasts only 180 minutes during talking instead of the advertised 220, I mean this phone will have a full charge and within 45 minutes of talking to anyone on a brand new battery, it will go to 1 bar of charge or just go flat dead! And of course, on standby it sucks out the battery life just as well. And I must clarify that all this is without even using the "manner mode" (vibrating mode) or screwing around with the speakerphone either.I have had MULTIPLE calls dropped despite the phone showing 1 bar of signal, and it happens randomly. This in spite of having "Can you hear me now?" Verizon as my carrier. It really gets to you after a while that you cannot carry on a decent conversation when your phone shows you have a signal, albeit a weak one.Another annoyance is that if you get a missed call, you get a notification that you had a missed call, and then you have to choose whether to view or to ignore. Now, you can ONLY choose this using the OK button. You can't use what the most logical button for this is, which is the left navigation control. Besides, it only shows the missed call number, it does not give you any information about what time that call was missed. One would think that this is at least somewhat important, especially if you're a professional using this as a primary source of communication.And oh, I must clarify that you should not give the phone a benefit of doubt because I might have just received a damaged or poor quality handset that's leading to the dropped calls or poor battery life, since I had ordered two phones for a family plan and both behave exactly the same.
I've been partial to LG phones for a few years, so I was biased towards this phone to begin with, but its features have exceeded my expectations. This was not an out of the box phone, but a project that takes a bit of time, patience, and a few accessories to get it configured and setup just right.Firstly, the music mp3 player works great, with clear extrenal speakers and a headphone/ microphone jack. It uses a 4 part, not 3 part 2.5mm mini-plug, so this restricts the headphones or adapters you can use with it. I bought the Jabra C220 stereo earbuds, and they work nicely. I also bought two 512 Mb Sandisk mini SD cards to hold music, though I heard the 1 Gb mini SD card also works fine. Make sure you buy mini SD instead of regular SD cards. To load the mp3s on the card from my computer, I bought a  USB card reader that reads SD cards. The first time you put in a mini SD card, the phone puts three folders on the card, one for sounds, one for pictures, and one for mp3s. The phone's mp3 player is somewhat buried, but you can create a shortcut to it: OK button -> right toggle 2 times -> OK button -> down toggle 2 times -> OK button -> 0 -> hit CLR button twiceNow, when you hit the down toggle button, the mp3 player comes right up.Secondly, I knew the video and music player capabilities would take extra battery power, so I went ahead and bought the extended life battery, and it's been a great investment, lasting well through heavy usage. Be aware the battery is larger and makes the phone a little bulkier.You can synchronize and download your phone book, wallpaper, Outlook Calendar and ringtones with the free program BitPim and a n LG VX8100 data cable you can buy on eBay or elsewhere that connects via USB to your computer.I also picked up the Bluetooth Logitech wireless headset, and it works great, but I prefer using the built-in speakerphone on my lap while driving.This phone has all sorts of interesting possible tweaks for those so inclined to tinkering-- at your own risk.The bottom line is that this is the cell phone with the functionality I've always wanted, phone + extended battery + mini SD cards + card reader + Jabra headphones + BitPim + data cable.The only warnings: find documentation online, not from Verizon; slim and petite this phone is not; and don't expect everything ready to roll directly out of the box.
Excellent phone on all fronts. I bought it with the intention of leveraging all features including mp3s and full customization without a connection kit or extra service fee. I've gotten it to do everything I wanted. To get all the features I'd say you need  to be a bit tech savy. But even basic users will enjoy the phone.Standard stuff is excellent - reception, interface, contacts, calendar, talk and standby time, very nice/bright lcd, etc. Also feels much more solid than the 815e.I use bluetooth and opensource pc software to exchange images, and ringers(mp3s). Very easy once learned. I'm a bit techy.I load mp3s (renamed to .mid and <~15 chars) to a miniSD card - very nice player. Stereo speakers work very well. Although cant close lid. Great to listen to audio books or lectures. Does play videos/movies but has to be converted by software, big hassle but its an option.Camera: Very good phone cam - I also have a 7mp canon sd500 camera (awesome camera!) so it doesn't compare. I save pix/video to miniSD card.Speakerphone: ok, but very handy when needed.EV-DO: broadband internet - via bluetooth - very nice - simple and fast, I connected at ~110k on XP laptop. I use it as a backup net connection but not really needed as there are so many ways to connect to the net. Can be a bit tricky to set up on laptop. Not documented. Does cost $15 per month extra (not bad though).Cons:1) Can be a bit difficult to hear other person in ear.2) Some features are hidden - must find settings to enable.3) Manual is lame for advanced users.Overall its a very personalizable phone. With some google searching and about 2 or 3 hours you can get it to do lots of stuff not mentioned in the book or in the store.  Worth it for the mp3 player with miniSD card.
My new VX8100 is an upgrade from VX6000's so I skipped a few models while holding out for bluetooth support. I didn't expect the EV-DO, but it is quite a bonus. If you subscribe to those wifi hotspot networks, you can save your money and take your own hotspot with you. Using bluetooth, I don't even take the phone out of my pocket to get my laptop or pda onto the Internet. I use Verizon's National Access (formerly Express Network) which is about 50kbps even in rural areas. The list of metro areas supporting EV-DO is growing fast, and that will get you something like 500kbps even way out into the burbs for the metro areas fortunate enough to have it already.. If you are considering use of your wireless phone to provide Internet access, that appears to be one area where Verizon has an edge over the other major providers, and this phone is broadband ready.Voice communication is also impressive. I had to get used to the old VX6000's frequency response when I first got them. What those, I would often press it to my ear to hear what somebody was saying, but if the person on the other end uttered the right syllable at the right pitch there was this resonant frequency that would send a sharp pain in the ear and down my spine. (No, King Arthur, it isn't the knights who say NEIGHK but maybe something like that.) The VX8100 seems to have the spectrum smoothed out a bit.Voice command of the VX8100 also works well, although I've not used any other phone with voice command features so I've got nothing to compare it with. Using my bluetooth headset (two year old Jabra model) and without taking the phone out of my pocket, I seem to be able to call anyone, check my voice mail, etc., and there is no need to record voice-dial names onto the contacts as the VX6000 required. So far, it has done a great job at guessing how to pronounce the names just by the spelling, and to recognize them when I say them. I haven't given that a thorough workout, but I'm impressed so far.Buying it right when it hit the stores was a risk. I usually would rather read a few of these reviews before buying, and wait until a firmware update or two has gone out just to see how the hold up. So I guess it was my turn to test the water. After one week of a variety of tests and a lot of airtime, I have found it to be more than I expected in some areas, and have found no reason to be disappointed. If you are a Verizon customer and up for a 2-year update, check the verizonwireless website and see what price you can get. Do that first so you can tell them you saw it for xxx, otherwise you get the price with a bag of items that you're better off buying somewhere else. And most worth of mention, you may want to avoid the hands-free headset they provide with that package deal because you may want to consider a Bluetooth headset. You can finally go wireless without the wires!
I've had this phone for a little while now thanks to my "free every two upgrade" and I love it.  I've almost always had flip phones just because of the durability they usually offer.  Out of all the phones I've had this is the most user friendly phone I have ever seen.  If you know how to press the power button the phone will teach you the rest.I wasn't very impressed with the camera and video functions.  It's useable but not a substitute for a digital camera as they lead you to believe.  I have not had any of the crashing problems that the rest of the users have had.  Maybe I'm just lucky.For me the biggest plus to this phone was its reception.  I live in two places that make reception hell.  My first site is a concrete apartment building on top of a parking garage.  With my old phone I struggled to get 1 bar.  Now I have a full signal all the time.  The second site is 15-20 minutes from the nearest real city with plenty of hills and trees in the way.  Previously, I had no hope of service but now I can actually carry on a conversation and have 1-2 sevice bars.Verizon has definitely improved their product once again.  I would highly recommend this phone.  I can't wait to see what they have available two years from now when I get my next free upgrade.
I was between this phone and the Motorola e815. I was in the store playing with the two phones, and I decided on this. I'm more than happy with the decision. OK, enough history, my review:Pros:-The menu is very familar. Not saying that the Motorola was bad, just this didn't take getting used to. If you've ever had an LG or Samsung (like myself) than the menu will be second nature.-The phone itself has a solid feel to it. I have a VERY bad habit of dropping cell phones, and I trust this one will stand up to quite a few big drops.-Comes with IM software with AIM on it. It costs text messages, but I have plenty of those to burn up, and seeing as how I text more than I talk, this was pretty important feature. It's nice to beable to do the whole AIM thing, through you're phone.-The speakers are incredible. Although I have no intention of using the MP3 player, I plan on loading this thing with ring tones, and I know they are going to sound amazing on this thing.-The speaker phone is great. Because of the speakers, it's no problem at all to hear the party you're talking to.-The MiniSD slot is great if you do intend on using the MP3 player. I do however question the battery life when using it. Granted, I'm only assuming, but I don't see how that wouldn't drain the battery something fierce.-Camera is 1.3mp. Not something you're going to want to take important pictures with, but it's excellent for those moments when you don't have the digital camera on you, and something cool just needs to be captured.-The bluetooth's range is pretty impressive. I can walk around my house (within reason) and leave the phone in my room, and make calls with just the ear piece. I would guess this also relies on the ear piece though.-I had a Samsung a670 before this, and the Mobile Web was crap on it. Maybe it's just ignorance, but I find this phone's internet very fast.-Although it's stupid and ultimately useless, it's fun being able to read text messages on the outside window. Also, the "disco" light on the outside that flashes when you get a call/text, its cool. Some hate it, I like it.and now, the cons:-The Bluetooth is crippled, and I know I sound like a broken record at this point with all the other reviews saying this, but it is a pain. It would be nice to get ring tones and not have to pay $2 a piece for them. Although, this is nothing that the right software can't fix.-While you can hear the party you're talking to find with the speaker phone, you have to hold the phone relativly close to you're face when talking. Which makes me think, why not just go the extra 4 inches, and hold it to you ear. Whatever.-It doesn't bother me, but in a world of nano iPods and Razr cell phones, I can see how people could be taken back by the size and "bulk" of the phone. The speakers make the phone look a little heavy at the hinge.So if you're looking for a phone with a decent camera, speaker phone, bluetooth, and just things to impress people with, this is a great choice.
This phone has many nice features - like the dual LCD screen displays, a nice front MP3 player with front plate control (supposing Verizon did not disable it), loud speaker phone, solid assembly, blue tooth (also disabled greatly by Verizon which disallows you doing file transfers).The biggest problems I experienced with the phone is the lack of the software for you to transfer the phone numbers, customize your ringtones, internet access (if you want to use mobile office kit to access internet, a very weak battery (daily charge is needed), the user interface is also not as intuitive as Motorola 710/720, the font size enlargement only goes half way (only the phone numbers you dial will be enlarged. As a phone for regular use, I find it is light, bright, EV features allowing to access internet/news are great.But to get the phone numbers backup,you have to sign up with Verizon to pay $2/month is really not that appealing. The ring tones customization costs you $2 up per ringtone - I believe you can customize your previous LG phones without these charges.You can get around with the ringtones customization, customized wallpaper through some popular software on the web. However, going throgh this hassle is not something for everyone.Until Verizon makes the phone fully functional by providing all the software, I think that this phone is only worth a 3.0 rating.
First off, the phone looks and feels great.  I love how you can read your text messages without ever opening the phone.  The MP3 player is awesome once you get the version 4 firmware update.  To avoid paying for the expensive ringtones, you can buy a $7 USB cable off ebay and transfer MP3s from your PC.  Ringer volume is nice and loud and MP3s sound great coming out of these speakers.  The screens look great, nice colors and clarity.  You can set the phone up to ring and vibrate and the same time which I love b/c sometimes when I have the phone in my pocket in a loud environment, I can't hear it.  The video recorder is a fun feature though the quality is what you would expect on a cell phone.Some negatives...the speakerphone is nice and loud, but everyone says I sound distorted and they have trouble understanding me.  Also, the earpiece volume doesn't get loud enough.  I have a hard time hearing people in louder enviornments.  The camera does not perfrom well in low light or at nighttime.  The battery life is not the greatest, but I always put mine on the home charger when I go to bed at night anyway, so I'm not sure how long it would really last.So in conclusion...PROS- looks and feels great- miniSD card slot- great MP3 player- excellent speakers, nice and loud- strong vibrate feature- beautiful screen displays- Bluetooth enabled- read text messages without opening phone- good signalCONS- speakerphone sucks for other person- camera is subpar- earpiece volume not loud enoughFor the record, I am very happy with this phone and highly recommend it to others.
First off, I do not use my phone to its full capability since I am not "tech savvy", so I don't know how well the bluetooth, mp3 player, V Cast, EV-DO, etc. perform. I have used the camera, and it's easy to use and works well. The size, shape, weight, and overall design and layout (i.e. buttons) of the phone is all great. Back to size, one reviewer commented on the bulkiness of the phone; I often carry a small hobo bag that features a small cell phone pocket, and the phone fits fine in there. Also, if you have big hands, I'm not sure you'd appreciate the fit of the phone in your hand or the contours of the buttons. If you haven't done so already, venture into a Verizon store and test the phone's fit to your hand.The reception through the ear hole is occasionally not ideal, but it's infrequent, and I can easily adjust the volume to the level I want by pressing a button on the side of the phone. The phone manual provided by Verizon is incomplete & crap. Sounds like you need to get the manual from a different source. Oh, the speaker phone is handy, which took me forever to find, as it doesn't seem to be listed in that crap manual. If anyone else is as non "tech savvy" as I, you activate the speaker phone by pressing & holding down the CLR button.My husband's got the Motorola E815, so if you're also looking at the Motorola E815, you should know that the E815 seems to get better reception through the ear, and that the design and userability is less "elegant" than the LG VX8100. The E815 is possibly more targeted to someone who's more appreciative of functionality and less concerned with aesthetics. The E815 seems a little sturdier and less likely to suffer cosmetically if you're rough with your phone.That's my 2 cents.
This is a great cellphone. Before this one I had an LG VX4400 and I loved it. These are the good things about this one:(1. Very intuitive user interface. The physical buttons as well as the software.(2. Battery efficient (lights turn off totally after a min or so, turn off partially in a few secs).(3. Videocamera/picture quality are very good.(4. Very nice look and feel.(5. Upgrade of software with features such as textboxes for searching, entering addresses is very nice.I haven't used the features like bluetooth and vcast.Cons:. The volume seems to trouble me a bit. Even after being on the highest level, it sometimes isn't loud enough.. Could use more pre-installed ringtones.Verdict: BUY IT.
This is a great phone. I have had it for about two months now, and I must say that the bluetooth is totally awesome. Everywhere I go people ask me, "what kind of phone is that"? This phone has it all, awesome features, bluetooth, an MP3 player with speakers that fool my friends into thinking someone has switched on the radio, a 1.3 megapixel digital camera with flash built in, a space for a memory card, you name it this phone has it!Reception: I have never had a problem with reception with this phone or ever dropped a call in an area that has more than two bars of service. This phone almost always has 4-5 bars, and it doesn't drop calls! I knew I had to get another LG brand phone because my last one was an older model LG, and I broke it to smithereens on countless occasions and it still worked, so LG knows what they're about when it comes to making great phones!Service: I love Verizon wireless. I used to have Sprint (what a HORRIBLE provider) I have had them for over two years now, and I have never had a problem. The customer service is great, not to mention the best possible network when it comes to reception and never dropping calls!Goodies: A++! THis phone has TONS of cool features and goodies. My personal favorite is the acclaimed bluetooth, which is one of those "once you have it you don't know how you ever went without" deals. All I have to do is press a button, give a command and say a name. No voice training, no programming, all you have to do is put the person's name and number in your phone! No more worrying where that stupid headset with the cord is!Sounds/Ringers: The sound on this phone is very clear. So clear in fact that when people hear the "Truetones" ringers (with an actual song by an artist), they wonder "where did you get that phone" because it sounds as good as a radio! The MP3 speakers make the sound quality blow other phones out of the water! I dowload all my ringers from Get It Now. And Verizon Ringback tones are great too.Camera: The camera in this phone is a real 1.3 megapixel digital camera with flash. It takes really good pictures for what it is, and it is always nice to always have a digital camera on hand at all times!Other features: This phone has a color screen on both the front display and main display, is very nice-looking and sturdy, and it has these cool little lights that light up in different colors when the phone rings. It has a schedule, alarm clock, tip calculator, regular calculator, notepad, world clock, e-mail and of course mobile web and text & pix mesaging.I definitely recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone, even though it is one of the pricier models available from VZW, it is WELL worth the cost, and if you are in the market for a new cell phone, bluetooth is definitely the way to go!
*** Updated Jan 26, 2006 to account for v07 firmware update ***If you have an older version of the phone, bring it to a Verizon Wireless store and ask them to update the firmware for you.Basically, the VX8100 (for Verizon) is good phone that's unfortunately held back by a few irritating problems.Camera------Good:The 1.3 megapixel camera takes good pictures as long as there's adequate lighting (otherwise, there'll be a lot of noise in the photo).The camera has a lot of adjustable functions (flash, white balance, color effects, night shooting, etc.).The outside screen can also be used as a viewfinder for taking pictures of yourself, or as a makeshift mirror.Bad:Bad shutter lag.  At the highest resolution, it takes 3-4 seconds to capture an image.  The viewfinder (screen) will appear to take a picture as soon as you press the shutter button, but it actually just freezes the phone while it takes a different picture in the background.  Make sure your subjects stand very still.The camcorder function is limited to 15-second videos, regardless of memory card size.Interface---------Good:For the most part, I like the user interface on this phone.  All the major functions I want are present: the menus are clear, if layered a bit deep; the address book works as expected (multiple #s per entry, per-person ringtones and pictures, groups, up to 99 quick dial numbers); T9 predictive text input is helpful for messaging (but if you do a lot of that, I'd look into the VX9800 instead).Bad:My only real gripe is the lack of customizability for shortcut keys.  You can only customize one button, the down d-pad button, and doing so will replace the caledar.  I'd rather replace the Web Browser, Get It Now, or any of the other buttons that I don't use, but the phone won't allow me to.Applications------------Good:The phone comes with several useful applications/utilities, including a web browser, calendar, an alarm clock, a world clock, a notepad, a calculator, and a tip calculator.Bad:Third-party applications are limited to Verizon programs from GetItNow, as is apparently the case with all Verizon phones.  This means that if you want more functionality out of your phone, you're going to have to pay for it.Data/internet access--------------------Good:EV-DO support means fast connections to the web.  Streaming video (V-Cast) works as expected, and the $15 package includes unlimited web browsing.Bad:The web browser just plain sucks.  There is no way to directly bookmark a page -- or, for that matter, go directly to a URL -- without first going to a special Verizon page.  This means you have to memorize or write down the address you want to go to, navigate to the special Verizon page, and then manually re-enter the address.  I have no idea why they designed it this way, but it's so unuseable that it made me cancel my mobile web service.Sound-----Good:As of firmware version v07, the phone supports V-Cast music downloads.  They can either be downloaded on the phone directly ($1.99 per song) or purchased on a PC and then transferred over a USB cable (99 cents per song).  You must have an active V-Cast plan to download songs on the phone.Sound quality is okay on the speakerphone, but you'd probably want to get a stereo headset if you want to do any real listening.The phone has an equalizer function with settings for Pop, Rock, 3D surround and more.The version 7 firmware mysteriously disables the phone's original MP3 playback capability, but this can be easily restored by entering a hidden menu:  Push the "Menu" button and then enter 000000 when asked for the service code.  Go to item #11 and enable MP3 playback.  Now the phone will be able to play MP3s and WMAs from the memory card again.Bad:Playlists are only supported for V-Cast downloads, not songs on the memory card.The song title is not displayed on the front screen, only the inside.  The front screen displays the current equalizer setting and also a huge and worthless visualization animation.Earlier versions of the phone had a problem with headset volume, but this was fixed with version 7 firmware.  You may need to update your phone if you encounter this problem.The speakerphone quality isn't great.  It works, but sounds bad at louder levels.  I'm not sure how well it'd work with music (but you could always buy special stereo headphones for the phone).Voice Dialing, Voice Command, Text to Speech--------------------------------------------Good:The phone uses an actual speech recognition engine, meaning you can theoretically dial any name or speak any command without prior training.  This works... somewhat.  75% of the time, the phone would do just what I told it to do.Voice command allows you to do more than just dial people in your address book.  You call any telephone number (if you say the numbers clearly enough); check your voicemail; have your missed calls listed; check your text messages; and have the current time and date spoken to you.The "Announce Alert" feature will speak out loud, using the phone's text-to-speech capability, whenever a call or message arrives, e.g. "Incoming call from Bob" or "Incoming message from 123-123-1234".  I personally like this feature, but if you find it annoying, you can turn it off.Bad:Speech recognition is a double-edged sword.  With that many more possible voice commands, 25% of the time the phone will simply get it wrong, especially in noisy environments.A more serious issue is the voice interface itself:  Instead of allowing you to dial a name with just one button push, you have to navigate through the whole menu system every time.  It's like having to talk to those voice menu systems you sometimes get when calling a company.  The procedure goes something like this:Phone: Please say a command.Me: Call someone.Phone; Please say a name.Me: Bob.Phone: Did you say, "Rob"?Me: No.Phone: Please say a name."Me: Bob.Phone: Did you say, "Bob"?Me. Yes.Phone: Call mobile?Me: No.Phone: Call home?Me: No.Phone: Call work?Me: Yes.Phone: Calling.I'd have much preferred being able to just say "Bob", even if I had to first train the phone.Conclusion----------In summary, the phone seems to be a great gadget crippled by flawed software.  If you can live with the annoyances, you may like the phone for its abundance of features.  Personally, I just wish LG and Verizon did more testing and bugfixing before releasing this phone.  It could've been so much better.
I bought this phone the day after Verizon began offering it (July 2005). My primary reason for buying it was the bluetooth capability, and the phone delivers on that front. It pairs easily with my Jabra BT250v headset (it also works with the wired headsets I have laying around, despite the stereo-capable headset jack). With some tinkering I was even able to use it to connect my laptop to the internet using a USB bluetooth adapter.The phone delivers on other fronts as well. It has survived a couple of drops (which is par for the course with my phones) and the charge lasts long enough that I am never surprised by a sudden dead battery. Voice recognition requires no training, and the name announcement, while definitely synthesized, is at least recognizable.I do have a few reasons for withholding a perfect rating (note that I haven't upgraded my software at all, so some of these may no longer apply). The reception on the phone is not as good as it was on my Motorola v120e. The echo cancellation could use some work, especially in speakerphone mode. I have to go through several layers of menus to play my games. There is an annoying delay between when I press the capture button and when the camera actually takes a picture. The voice recognition engine has a problem understanding the word "Yes". And while the handset volume has never been a problem for me, it takes a little practice to figure out where to hold the speaker to your ear--it's not easy to do by feel, and improper placement will drastically reduce the effective volume.If I had the decision to make over again, I would definitely still buy this phone. While I've mentioned more negatives than positives for informational purposes, the phone delivers on so many fronts that the good things about the phone far outweigh the minor problems I've had.
Pros:BluetoothBeautiful screenGreat cameraSolid construction and designAbility to view messages on outer screen.Ability to add more memoryMP3 functionality (Coming Soon!!)Cons:Music on Demand service not available yet.Weird allocation of phone's memory.Inability to load mp3's from SD card as ringtonesI'm a Verizon member from NJ and have been using an LG VX7000 prior to upgrading to the VX8100.The VX8100 is an improvement over the VX7000. The VX8100 now has bluetooth in addition to speakerphone. I purchased a bluetooth headset, paired it and it works great for me.The 8100 also had one minor improvement that was a major improvement for me. The 7000 had no vibrating text alert (other than quiet mode) but the 8100 has a vibrating text alert in normal mode in addition to an audio alert.This phone has a wonderful inside screen that looks amazing.Text messaging is a breeze and I love that I can see my text and pix messages that I received without even having to open the phone.Phone sound and signal seem equal to what I had on the VX7000 so thats a plus for me as I had good signal and service in my area.I can't comment on VCAST because I am not signed up for it but will try it later on. I have used it on other phones and I do enjoy so having it available is a plus.My only concerns are the supposed mp3 player that is not active. I'm told it may go active when Music on Demand starts in 6-8 months. Also, the memory allocation is weird. Original specs stated the phone had 512 MB but I'm not seeing anything near that much available at the moment. Only thing I can think is the numbers were wrong or that Verizon saved that memory for Music on Demand. I also wish I could use mp3's as ringtones without having to resort to hacking the phone.I absolutely love this phone. Remember, I'm coming from the 7000 so to me this phone is a wonderful upgrade and I am glad I upgraded when I did.I recommend this phone to everyone!
For somone who has had the same phone (Nokia 5160) for the last 5 years, this phone blew my mind. The quality of the color screen, the ability to take video... there are so many features on this phone that I won't use right now, but may appreciate in the future. Especially the Bluetooth capability. Most importantly, everyone I've called so far as noticed a 200% improvement on clarity of my voice.The signal has been almost perfect, I like the placement of the buttons and the photo disc feature could come in handy. I would definitely recommend this phone.Only caveat, there aren't too many accessories available as of yet.
This phone is the best Verizon Wireless has to offer. With an array of great features, the phone lives to it's standards. And to all the people who worry about the non-working front buttons, it has been fixed with the update, which you can get at any Verizon Wireless Store (not all areas have the update yet). The phone has a wonderful screen, very bright, and unlike many other phones on the market, the screen is not "washed out". If you use the speakerphone a lot, this phone is for you. The speakers are very load, and the other line hears me fine. All in all, if starting a new plan on Verizon, getting the phone for free after rebates is great. I highly reccomend the LG VX8100!
I got this phone the day it was released July 15 2005 in Valencia, CA.  I found through message boards and online reviews what this phone was able to do.  I use the bluetooth earpiece while driving.  Love the Mp3 function - sounds great with headphones.  I use the mp3 function on my walks or when I'm on vacation for music in the room.  I bought a 1G miniSD card (here) through Amazon with the companion USB mobile flash reader to transfer Mp3 files from my computer to the phone.  Simple.  I've also used the mp3 player on several flights.  Just put the phone in stand-alone mode.  This turns off the phone signal and lets you use the other phone functions.  I also have found out how to convert dvd's or mpeg files to my phone to watch whenever.  Don't use this function much, but last time I was on a flight I watched a movie on my phone.  Also use the LG 8100 for text messaging.  When on vacation, I subscribed to VCAST (with web 2.0)  and cancelled when I got back home.  Cost will be pro-rated on your next bill for the only the days you used.  Do a google search for "LG 8100 forum" to learn all you can do with this phone.  Bottom line - I've turned this phone into an entertainment system - Phones aren't just for calls anymore.  LOVE THIS PHONE!
After 1 one week I exchanged the LG8100 and got a Motorola E815. I was dissatisfied with the LG8100 for several reasons. First, in my house I use to have full signal strength with my older model LG4400. With the new LG8100 the signal strength would bounce between 2 and 3 bars. If the other party was talking and the signal bounced back and forth (which was frequent) their speech would break up. Also, several people complained that I sounded muted on the LG8100 and would ask that I call back from my home phone. Also in other locations where I use to have good signal strength I had no signal with the LG8100.The volume on the LG8100 does not go high enough either. When in the car or a location with a little background noise it is very difficult to hear the other party even with the volume on the highest setting.I also didn't like the design of the phone. When the phone is flipped open you will notice that there is a large gap between the speakers and the hinges stick out far. If you hold the phone too close to your face I found the hard plastic hinges were uncomfortable against my face.I now have the Motorola E815 and love it! Reception is excellent! Single strength has always been high and I even have a good signal when in remote locations. Friends are also glad I got a different phone because they say I now sound clear and normal again.The volume on the E815 is also much better. On the highest setting in the car or in restaurants I can clearly hear callers.Many people complain that the E815 is large. But I think the design is much better than the LG8100. The E815 is longer but it is thinner so it easily slips into a pocket. And there are no large speakers which make the phone look unprofessional.
I was in two minds when I was getting a phone around Nov. Motorola E815 or LG VX8100.I saw that the LG one had a better screen, clearer display, better camera quality, photo display on outside lcd when taking a photo, better UI, stereo speakers, etc. The 815 lacked all this.I went for it. A day later I found that VCAST was not working. I got my piece replaced by another. (thus my 15-day return feature was already utilized).My friend got the E815. We started comparing. When we used to hang out together, I found that my phone always had 2 signal strength bars less than his. I started missing calls; I used to get sudden voicemails without my phone ringing, presumably because it could not get enough signal strength to receive the call. My friends started complaining that they cannot hear me.That was it. Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls. My phone was inferior to the E815 in these very core important issues. I went there to request an exchange, they said I cannot do it, since I have already utilized my 15-day return. I met two people there, who were returning their LG8100. One person was replacing it for the 3rd time, due to manufacturing defects. Other person was replacing it due to some malfunction.It is clear to me now that I made a very wrong decision here --- I should have trusted Motorola more -- my previous phone Motorola 120E (a 3 year old phone) used to have better signal strength than this one!Stay away from this one -- either get the Motorola E815 or the Motoroal RAZR V3C. You have been warned.
I've logged about 4 hours call time so far with no dropped calls. The reception has been great. I traveled through half of Florida this passed weekend and had no problems making or receiving calls. This phone is slighly larger than normal so it fits in my large hands well. Feels as if it is built solid. The camara takes good pictures as far as a cell phone goes. The speakerphone is loud and clear however I did hear an echo. The screen is one of the best I've seen. My dislikes: Verizon disabled the MP3 player but that is something I don't really care to use. The disco lights that like up when you receive a call may annoy some. This phonecomes with the lamest ring tones I have ever heard. Of course, in the menu there are plenty of oppertunities to buy new ring tones. Come on Verizon, don't play your customers as chumps! The Vcast doesn't really impress me. It did come in handy when I was at a resort and the sky turned dark. I was able to check the weather and see that the rain would miss me. Other than that it really is just a way for Verison to peddle there online applications for a fee of course.
I just received this phone in Nov of 2005.  All of the kinks that people had with the phone when it was released have been resolved.  The MP3 player is awesome and the buttons on the front of the phone work, without any special setup.  Downloading songs is very simple.  Put your miniSD card into the phone and select the option to format the card from the phone.  By formatting the card on your phone, it will add the appropriate folders for mp3s, ringtones, etc.  Then remove the card and use a card reader on your computer to paste your songs into the mp3 folder.  To play the songs on your phone, just hold the play button on the front of the phone.  SO SIMPLE and eliminates the need for a separate mp3 player.  The songs sound great, they even have an equalizer on the phone for sound optimization.  You can buy a stereo headset that can be used to make phone calls.  The phone also has a speakerphone, which is activated by holding the CLR button (not in manual).  I tried the Motorola e815 for a couple days, as a former LG user I had some irritating issues.  The alarm clock cannot be set for Monday thru Friday, which means it will go off every morning unless you manually turn it off (silly, but important).  The vibrate on the Motorola is virtually non existent.  You will NOT see/hear the phone vibrate on a table to let you know a call is coming on. This is important for those of us with consideration for others in restaurants.  The motorola does not have the front buttons for the mp3 player, which is a nice addition.  For me the LG wins hands down, especially if you were a previous LG owner.
Got the phone from Verizon as an uprgrade from my old LG phone at the end of my 2-year contract.  Found that sound faded in and out - went back to Verizon the next day and they said that was because of a software problem with the phone.  They updated the software which helped but did not fix the problem.  Otherwise I like LG as I am used to their buttons, camera, and speed dial approach.  I wish there was a strong competitor to Verizon as they are as arrogant as can be (they don't really let you use all the bluetooth features - and their customer service is awful) - but their coverage is excellent in the northeast.
I have always used a Samsung phone they have the Best pictures ever. I got the LG 8100 3 days ago and it is a great phone, all but the camera is not the best or clearest. I love the setup on this phone and the size and weight of it! When you go to take a pic you have to keep it on the item you are taking a picture of or it  will mess up. Overall a good phone
The MP3 Player is very hard to get to, and the buttons on the front don't work for it (officially it's not an available feature from Verizon, but Menu- 0 - service code 000000 - menu9 - menu16  will take you to a menu that includes the media player.Also, 512MB means MegaBITS, not Bytes, only 32MB are available onboard for your media, and only 2MB of that for ringtones.The voice recorder is not fully enabled, either, and also requires a tedious menu-path to get to, instead of the one-touch button on the outside.The LED "flash" works for close-up, but it's more of a flash-light than a "flash", and hard to activate/turn off.
This camera simply put, is outstanding...  Camera pix quality is great, MP3 player is great (includes external speakers!!!).  Battery life is imprerssive as well...  Charged it on a Tuesday (after initial battery charge ran down) and today being a Sunday and the battery still has 2 bars!!!
I received my phone 4 days ago, since amazon didnt activated my phone i could not use it!!! (hassle)phone is not big as it was pictured. speaker phone, bluetooth and big screen is thumb up! movie playback feature is also cool. battery time seems to be kinda short. it last about day or two with EV on. I heard changing to 1x will increase the battery life.(EV is for higher data transfer). I changed to 1x and phone seems to getting better reception and battery life.I heard new firmware(v04) came out which will let you play MP3 files on the outer screen.I dont think this phone is big and bulky. Phone just fits my hand! It's quality and look is much nicer than the picture on the amazon.com.pros: spkrphone, bluetooth, big screen, stereo speaker, mini sd, high quality sound.cons: batterylife, version1 can't play mp3s., interface seems to be complicated(menu is not organized), slow response for camera, bad quality for 1.3mp camera
I "upgraded" from an LG 6000 to the 8100. My experience was the same as others writing reviews concerning the variable volume (even with the updated software),the poor reception & very poor visibility in bright light. Switched to a Motorola 815E and am quite pleased. Be sure if you are going to try the 8100 to use in in a noisy area and in buildings. This is where I had the most problems with variable volume. When I was at home where it was quiet, I did not experience the problem.
I have had the LG VX8100 for about 2 weeks now. This phone is the best phone i have ever bought. I get soooo much better reception and the design is fantastic. I havent been able to use the mp3 player part of the phone because i havent bought the mini SD card or the reader but i can say that the camera and video part of the phone is the best to date. I dont understand why other people are haveing so much trouble with the phone. Maybe they screwed the phone up. Make sure that if you buy the phone you also buy the phone kit that includes a leather case, a car charger, and some headphones for the mp3 player. If you buy the phone and the kit from verizon wireless, you get the kit for $25 instead of paying the full $50. If you dont like the design or the look of this phone you should consider the Samsung SCH-a950 because it looks different but it has the same exact features as the LG VX8100. Just to put it out there, the volume on the phone is perfect. Dont listen to the other people they expect the phone to be perfect and they are just being overcritical. All kts for phones if bought through verizon wireless are $25 instead of the full price of $50 just to let you all know. VERIZON WIRELESS ROCKS!!!!
It might seem like it is expensive, but it is cheap after all the rebates and is worth it ive dropped it but it doesn't show. If you think that it has bad sound it is loud and louder on speaker phone.It has good camera and flash i use as flashlight. The video is perfect with perfect time and the color is great. The phone even has quick use of mp3 you can go anywhere and never be bored with this phone. It has no problems with me and Ive had it for a while now. The first thing you know you have to do is contacts and not only can you do speed dile you can put picture i.d which is helpful to quickly see the person and know who it is so i give it a five star.
great reception, good camera, sleek design, good ringtones, great service(on verizons part), all combine to make this phone perfect. i guess one COULD argue that there should be more "fun" stuff on this phone(pre-loaded games, etc.) but i can't argue-this phone is great!
Like the previous reviewer, I also upgraded to this phone from an older LG model.  I've been impressed with my old LG phone ever since I got it 2 years ago, and I knew I wanted another LG when it came time to upgrade.  I couldn't beat the deal on this one - free is always good!I also got an accessory kit for this phone and I have to admit the hands-free/speakerphone option is great.  And THANK YOU THANK YOU to the previous reviewer who mentioned holding down the CLEAR button to activate the speakerphone!Another reason I chose this phone over another LG speaker/camera phone model was the MP3 player.  I don't own a separate MP3 player but I recently decided it was time to join the 21st century and get one for the treadmill and on the local jogging path.  And it works out nicely, since I always take my phone with me when I run anyway.  I haven't had a chance to test it out since I don't have a mini SD card yet, but the demo in the Verizon store was pretty impressive.Even though I've only had this phone a few days, I have no complaints and would recommend it.
I had to buy this phone at full retail value becouse my old phone broke and I didn't have insurence it costed me 300 Bucks but it is well worth it....It has loud volume rings and a wide varity of True Tones.....The only issues I have with this phone are the camara takes poor quality pictures and ringtones are to expensive but over all I give this phone the highest possible number of 5 but I would give it a 10 if I could...But don't take my word for it go to your near by Verizon store and try it out risk free if you dont like it just swap it but I think you will love it
The phone is great. It's much better than my expectation in many respects. You can even set a moving image as the wall paper. So many great features.The problem I had wasn't about the phone but with Amazon. I got the phone about 10 days after I'd placed the order (The website said it would be shipped in 24 hours but it was shipped a week after). When I got the phone, I couldn't activate the phone because my information wasn't in Verizon's database! Verizon folks told me that I was supposed to be given a temporary number, which was nowhere found. I talked to the Amazon customer service agent on the phone (1-800-201-7575: write it down, this is useful) but he had no idea. I had to spend more than three hours on the phone to finally figure out the solution; the solution, ironicially was a nice woman at Verizon who just went ahead and activate my phone.What a hassle. But I'm glad that I got this nice phone.
First of all, thanks to Amazon for lying and saying this phone has 512MB of memory. The MB that they're talking about is MegaBITS, meaning the phone only has 32 MegaBYTES. So if you want to have any real number of mp3s, pictures or video on this thing you will need to get a MiniSD card for sure. Lame.And speaking of MP3s, there's no way to really play them right or use the mp3 controls on the front of the phone. I read somewhere that Verizon should come out with an update for that soon, but when exactly, no one knows.Other than that I like the phone, it's fairly simple to use and the camera's pretty good. VCast is pretty sweet too, first month is free on Verizon right now.
This phone has great reception and I've only dropped one call since buying it in october 2005.  The camera resolution is terrific and the V-cast video is impressive. The two drawbacks of this phone include a small earpiece which sometimes makes it difficult to hear in noisy situations.  It also seems the battery life isn't that good.  I have to charge this phone everyday.  I had an Audiovox 8900 before this and I only charged it every third day.  Overall it's not a bad phone.
The phone itself is not so bad, the picture quality is good, sound is also very good. vcast streaming is clear as well.  HOWEVER, The volume on the LG8100 is a PROBLEM.  If you are in a moving car or at a location with some noise it is very difficult to hear the other person.  If the person you are talking to have any background noise, forget about it.  You will not hear anything.  I got all the updated software, re-program the phone as instructed by Verizon service people and nothing helped. If you are considering buying this phone, please think twice.  I didn't believe other users who had problems with the volumn control on this phone, and now I wish I did...By the way, I also tried the Samsung SCH-a950, and it's just as bad.  I was surprised by how these phones can perform so poorly since these are the phones Verizon has been advertising so much about. I mean, all the mp3 player, camera, and other features are nice to have on a phone, but how about the basic function of allowing users to "talk" and "hear" other people.I am sure Verizon probably has the best "coverage" area, but I didnt get to try other verizon phones because I decided to go with a different carrier after 2 Verizon phones failed on me.
This is a simply amazing phone.  It has a Camera, MP3 player, Bluetooth connectivity, and other bells and whistles.I had a Sony Ericcson phone for a while, but it had issues with keeping connected while driving.  This phone, so far, had no problems with getting disconnected in NYC/New Jersey Area.Compared to other phones in the market, this is probably the best phone you are going to have.Verizon service was amazing also.  I had it activated today and ported my old cell phone number from cingular within 2 hours.
Went through two of these from Verizon. Tried using three different headsets at highway speeds and could not hear my callers. My previous Kyocera did not not have this problem. Bluetooth range was poor and the connection noisy. My bluetooth headset was not the cause as it is clear on other devices.Not a business tool for sure. Good voice dialing system and command program. Twin speakers goofy looking.Returned both 8100's. Replaced them with a Motorola E815. Clear bluetooth and more than enough volume at highway speeds when using headsets. They've been making cell phones for a long time. LG is a newcomer. Go for Motorola. It simply works.I'm also quite wary as to why Verizon is hawking the 8100's so hard, and downplaying the Motorola, this concerns me.bpAlso..major note here! Once you switch to an E911 type of phone, you can never go back to a non-E911 phone! I found this out when wanting to go back to my older Kyocera and V. would not let me citing FCC rules. Whatever.
I love this phone!  It is so cool!  The camera quality is exceptional, although there is a delay when push the button to capture a pic.  Great phone with all the bells and whistles, plus it was time for my upgrade and I got it FREE!  One note:  Be careful with the volume.  It has stereo quality speakers and if you have the tones set on HIGH, it sounds like the speakers are going to blow.
After all my other 6 phones died and being the victim of been ignored ny my old provider.  Hey, I tolarated their bad customer services for almost a decade.  After some research, I decided to get the VX8100 and Verizon.  On paper sounded fantastic, also the reviewers seemed to be very careful not to trash any bad features on any phone.  Well this was one of those phones.First, I will let everyone know that this phones has pretty slick gimmicks.  Camera, voice recording, MP3 player, records mini movies, plays pre recorded movies, can download games and other non-phone type stuff.  And the part were Verizon makes money not providong any phone service works perfectly.Now about the phone, as a phone this phone is just OK.The speaker phone is half way decent (once you find out on the web how to use it since Verizon payed someone to write over 20 pages on the VCAST stuff but not one line in how to activate the speaker phone (shows what is important to them).You can only program 1 shortcut key which removes the calendar.Although you can access VCAST news in one click, it takes some navigating find out missed calls.The text typing using T9 sucks big time as it has problem if you switch in mid word example you want to type daddy smith well that is 3-2-3-3-9 (oh but I had the t9 off lets turn it on) well you have to start all over again because the stupid phone does not know that you type dadd already, my other phones never had such problems.  Also I could save the prefer state of input.  So if I like typing in T9 I it would be the default, not in the VX8100 you better like having the standard Abc as a default.oice recognition is so-so, but lacks of many commands and choices.  There are hundred of things that could be done and are not.  For one would it be nioce if it told you which phone is dialing before it does let say is asking if you want to dial jimmy at work.  The current choices are yes or no, it would be nice if it had a third that you can say maybe and it just tells the number.  Heck, I could suggest hundred of improvements to the thing that would make it a better PHONE.I could go on about the mediocre phone capabilities but I imagine that most people that are looking at this phone are the ones that most likely waste some money getting ringers, pix, wallpaper, and games, sending and receiveing text messages, pix, and videos.  For those people, I recommend to buy extra batteries as you never know when you may get a CALL and you need to use you PHONE and it may be dead from all the non-phone activity.If you are looking for a phone with lots of gimmicks this may be your phone.  If you actually need a GOOD phone and careless about the gimmicks you may want to look for another as this phone as a phone is not that good try a phone that is designed to eb the best phone out there (not an MP3 player, camera, video, web browser).As for me I most likely be returning it as I need a very good phone that is a good phone not an entertainment center eats money.
UI look and feel is very good. Looks like the same effort was no put in building a stable video streaming client.I've been using verizon's VCAST service on this phone for the past 3 weeks. On some clips, Audio and video go out of sync few seconds after starting the playback. And it is really annoying to watch video clips without Sync.On many video clips, REWIND operation crashes the phone and results in auto-reboot. Sometimes I had to do manual reboot.Doesnt look like a stable video streaming productCamera picture quality is not so good.
I have had nothing but problems from this piece of crap.  Whenever the signal bounces, the voice gets choppy on the other line.  My co-worker who have a motorola phone with verizon as well, have full signal.  This phone, the signal bounces between 1 and 3 bars!  My wife have a cheap phone and it works better than this!Picture quality is good but if you are buying it for this... Go get a digital camera.  It's cheaper!
Man i think this phone is sooo cool i have had it for a couple of weeks.....I think if you know how to work phones this phone will be your best freind
I've never written a review on amazon but I'm so annoyed by this phone and verizon that it seems appropriate.The guy at the store encouraged me to get this phone as it's the hot new model.  I can't believe this is what verizon is pushing.  It's an ugly, heavy, poorly designed piece of junk.  I'm mad.Who cares if it can record videos, receive video, and wash the dishes if it doesn't do it's basic job of being a phone.  Now it works as a phone (not very well mind you, it get's the worst reception of any of the three verizon phones I've had and this is in downtown manhattan.)  But the design is too much.  For something that I use many times everyday, can't verizon have a phone that is beautiful and well designed and functional.It's SO awkward.  Everything from the way it feels in the hand to the way it feels when you open it to trying to find a number.  This phone is the perfect example of bad design.  Everytime I go to use it I find myself frustrated.I chose verizon for it's reliable service but the phones they choose are such junk.-the reception is the worst of the three verizon phones I've had.-it's ugly-it doesn't feel good to hold.-it's heavy-it feels like a heavy piece of junk-it's not pleasing to open.-the menu layout is very unintuitive-it's got something like eight logos on the case.
I read into this and by the reviews, facts, and details it sounds like the phone that I want to get!!  I recommend this for everyone from kids to the older generations!!!
Sony Ericsson K750i is simply a fantastic phone. Great battery life and  tons of features like its 2.0Mgpx camera that is the closest thing to "real" that I have seen on a phone. Great user interface with a wide assortment of settings, mp3 music player, and overall design are just wonderful.I should mention that reception on K750 is much better then on older SonyEricsson handsets. It now works in places where my old T610 struggled for signal or had no reception at all. The only thing that was bothering me at the beggining was a bit low audio quality during calls, but it was fixed after update I downloaded from SonyEricsson's website.At this time, it is one of the best phones available on the market, and there is a lot of good phones out there...
This is a fantastic phone for users who are looking for an all-in-one package, as it can be used as a triband phone, a basic organizer, an mp3 player, a camera and a recorder all in one. It has a very attractive design and will draw plenty of comments.In more detail:1. Triband phoneYou can travel virtually anywhere in the world and still use this phone as it is triband. It has a good speaker which can be used while driving to minimize distractions. The keypad, while a bit small, is very tactile. Battery life is very long, I've waited up to four days before having to fully recharge it.2. Organizer/personal schedulerYou can sync it with Microsoft Outlook to get your Contact list and your Calendar appointments. It has the best phone organizer that I've yet seen on a mobile phone.3. mp3 playerThe mp3 player is excellent considering that it's not the primary function of the handpiece. The only criticisms of the mp3 player are that you can only use proprietary SE earphones with it and that it is inconvenient to scroll through songs once the phone's keylock activates. Obviously you can't use it on the plane!4. 2megapixel cameraThis has the best camera I've seen on a mobile phone. Pictures are clear and large. It's obviously not camera aficionado quality, but perfect for those casual snaps that you may want to make, and the pictures turn out fine either uploaded to an online album or printed in regular size. It also takes video in .3gp format. The photos/video/mp3s are stored in the Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo which comes in sizes from 64MB all the way to 1GB.5. Voice recorderIt has a great quality voice recorder which can be used to record meetings or lectures.All in all a fantastic phone. I really can't find anything wrong with it.
Silver and Black versions both exist, and I must say that I am partial to the silver one - it simply looks more professional.I'd recommend this phone to most people - with deep enough pockets - but most especially to the frequent traveller / businessman. It will play your MP3's (not that we businessmen listen to that!), take astounding pictures (for a phone that is), do reasonably good video clips and you'll actually be able to call someone.Also worthy of not are:1) The 2 LEDs that are a "flash", but which double as a strong flashlight/SOS beacon2) Integrated radio - trafic information on the go!and, very importantly:3) An integrated application called "remote control" enables you to control a presentation, media player or the actuall mouse from your phone! The computer you're using it on will need Bluetooth tho, but this function is astoundingly usefull if you're doing a presentation.
I was so into buying the phone and luckily i managed to get it on offer right when it came out. I couldnt believe how light it was when i held it and how smart it is. Its a great looking phone and i havent had any problems with anything to it. First of all, the camera is great, radio, well i cant stop listening to it:) and  there a video,recorder and quite a lot on it too. It is definately the best phone i have bought in ages, and good also to take photos of a special moment away or something. There is also night light flash on ittoo wth is awesome for taking photos at night. I found it quite easy to use too, a little different tha others,but has more on it and i would certainly reccommend it for anyone that loves phones with everything on and itnt too fiddly and hard to use too, it is great!
its been a while since i found a phone that i can respect and say "oooohhhh " and "ahhhhh" to.  this is THE phone.  great design, great features and cool UI. all the features u can possibly want.  wireless connectivity is excellent.  the music feature is great and the speaker is the loudest i have ever heard on a phone.  the only thing that i have to pick on a little is the earpiece volume.  it could be a little louder but that all depends on how u put it against your ear.  play around with the position and the volume changes dramatically.
If this phone would have better RF and volume, it would be the premiere phone out there for its price point.My main reason for buying this phone was the 2.0 MP camera.  I have been missing too many opportunities of snapping great pictures while I was out and about.  I am in Washington, DC so there are plenty of chances to take a picture of a celebrity or of an event.  I have used the music features of this phone and it is great when you listen with the included headphones.  However, the mp3 player is not why I bought this phone.The camera is good, but I have one quibble.  When taking a pix: you have to press the picture button key, then it has to focus, then the picture is actually taken (with delays between each step).  When dealing with still scenes and static objects, this is ok.  However, when taking shots of kids or animals you get pictures of blurry kids or moving objects. I wish SE would improve the speed of its auto-focus feature.First, I am using this phone in the US on the T-mobile network.  While I would like to give this phone a great review, I can't because it is lacking in two key areas:  reception and call volume.  When I compare this phone to the Moto v3, the SE gets lower bars and more static than the Moto.  This is what is referred to as the RF rating.  This was done using both the phones at the same time/place.  I'm not a fan of Moto's but in terms of price this phone roughly compares to the SE.  Also, since everyone is always dumping on Moto's, I was surprised that they were better in this key area.Another problem with the SE is the call volume.  I found that even when using the phone at its highest call volume, it is very hard to hear the other party.  You can hear when you are in an office, but mobile phones are for use outside. In sometimes-noisy areas, as well.  Think about when a loud truck passes you on the street and you are on your phone.  I found myself having to press really hard on my ear with this phone when this would happen.Another negative is the camera side/camera cover of the phone protrudes too much.  I wish SE had given it a flatter design.  Also, this cover is made of plastic, which doesn't feel too strong.  If the camera cover had been flat, the plastic wouldn't have mattered.  To give you an idea:  if you lay the phone on the camera side, you can spin it like a bottle, that's how round the cover is.Finally, I give great marks to SE for their user interface navigation with their mini joystick button.  The scrolling through contacts, and their info, is also very well done and something I had not seen other phones do.While I would like to recommend this phone, I can't.  SE did not build this phone around the qualities of good RF and call volume.  These came as afterthoughts when they decided to make the camera and music player with high quality in mind and neglected other important areas.
This is a basic phone with the added plus of having a SPEAKERPHONE. Unfortunately though the speakerphone seems rather staticky compared to turning it off (so it is not really a reception thing).Another plus is an external volume control. However, this is on the side of the phone. For me, it is right where I hold the phone, so I seem to be turning the volume up and down a lot unintentionally.There are only two very bad games. There are a couple pictures on the phone. There is a calendar, alarm clock, timer, and voice recorder (which is nice).It is small, but the keys are well placed. It is not hard to use at all.BATTERY CHARGE TIME - FAST! It fully charges in about 2 hours. Unfortunately, after 1 day and 3 calls (all under 5 minutes) it is already showing less than half charged. So, I think the battery life may be less than indicated. But, still better than my ancient Nokia.BUT, POOR, POOR, POOR reception. I am SHOCKED! I thought at first it could be the carrier (T-mobile). To test this, I stuck the SIM card into my old (3 years old) Nokia. Well, on the samsung I had no service to 1 bar but not enough to complete a call - on the Nokia I had 3 bars! I placed a call, and no static! Sheesh! So, no, not the carrier - it is the phone.If you search the CNET reviews for the Samsung X475 you will see it has poor reception as well. I took a gamble and hoped this was updated on the 495. But, I guess not.It is an attractive phone. I like that the time, date, day of the week, battery remaining, and signal strength are all displayed when the phone is closed. But, since I got the phone to actually make/receive CALLS not tell me the time of day, I have to rate it accordingly.I am going to return the phone and maybe try the Motorola V330 or something else with some kind of antenna.
This is my 4th Samsung cell phone with T-Mobile.  S105, E105, X475 and now the X495.  I love T-Mobile because they upgrade phones cheaply as long as you extend your contract 12 months as opposed to other carriers who require 2 years.  I paid 40 dollars but they gave me a 50 dollar rebate. -10 dollars to get a new phone!  Have not had any reception issues as stated by the other reviewer.  I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.  None better.  This phone has a clean and unique look, although slightly feminine with the white plastic insert.Speakerphone is awesome.  I can hear clearly and they can hear me.  Speakerphone plays through the earpiece but has convenient volume control on the side.  Screen is bright but on the compact side.  Phone is a little bulkier than most other samsungs, but not annoyingly so.  No external antennae so it is clean.  Best of all I really enjoy the feel and function of the buttons.  Nice separation and also raised off of the body to ensure accurate dialing.  Great Battery life.  Have had the phone on for 3 days now and one hour of talk time and I am showing 2 bars out of 3 left.  No camera, but I think camera phones are overrated anyway.  Can't go wrong with this one.
After my motorolla v180 acting up on me and freezing all the damn time, I had to get a new one and the samsung x495 doesn't disappoint. The only bad thing about this phone is that I can't access the internet...dunno why. Reception is great, and the battery life is long-it charges in two hours which is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have excellent reception. The speaker phone is superb, not loud and muffly, it is so clear, but you have to use it with the phone openIt is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. It's the perfect girl phone hehe :) If you are looking for a basic phone that actually works, this is the phone you have been waiting for!!!!!!
This is my third Samsung phone with T-Mobile, and I can say that I am very impressed.I have had absolutely no complaints with the reception I get on this phone. Certain coffee shops and academic buildings where I go to college had been very unaccomodating to my other Samsungs (R225 and C225) but this one pulls in at least 4 bars no matter where I go.The interface is well designed and easy to use, especially if you are familiar with Samsung phones. The lack of an option to change your directional button settings was a bit irksome at first, but now they seem very convenient.I didn't get this phone for the games or for ringtones, I just got it so that I could have a good phone. This is easily the best phone I have ever used, much more physically accomodating than any others (flip or non-flip). The speakerphone works great and I have no complaints about how it sounds on my end, nor have I received any complaints from people with whom I have spoken using the speakerphone.
plus points-Nice looking: I love the gray and white, it makes the phone look very professional and neat looking.Keypad: The keypad is lit up very well, you can see every key, and the blue looks pretty cool.Durable: I droped it a few times already, and a few nicks are already on the beauitfuly shinny finish.Speaker Phone: really great!negative points-Reception: This phone does not have good service performanceSpeakerphone: Cant use while flip is closed!!Charging: Does not ever say something like "Charge Complete" its annoying .
What a great little phone this is.  It looks great, the audio is good.  I just wanted a phone, not a video game and not a camera.  This phone delivers.
When my motorola phone died I went to the T-Mobile store and was told Samsung made quality phones, so I picked up the X495.  This phone was attractive because it's compact, inexpensive and has no external antenna to break off.  The problem is that the reception is not nearly as good as my old Motorola and the audio quality is terrible.  When I'm in my apartment, I have to stand next to the front window in order to get decent reception.  My previous phone worked anywhere in the apartment.  The audio is so distorted that I have trouble understanding what people are saying.  The volume level adjustment steps from too quiet to too loud with nothing in between.I find the keypad layout annoying as well.  They put the T-Zones button, which I never use, dead center and raised.  I suspect this is to promote the T-Zones service which costs extra.The earpiece and charger ports are covered by cheap plastic covers which seem as though they're about to fall off.  I have considered pulling them off just to get them out of the way.Next time I'll try a Nokia.
The keyword is _basic_, if you are looking for high end features, look elsewhere: No Bluetooth, domestic triband (no 900), no camera, and no voice dialing.What it does do is _work_. Samsungs quality is always good; this phone is a solid performer with few frills. It does have a speaker phone, and will take voice notes, do hi-fi and voice ring tones, and has sms, mms, and wap abilities.  Great phone for the light user or entry user.
This phone does all it is made to do very well. The screen is excellent and the images are perfect. It can ring very loud, which was a problem with another phone I used (I couldn't hear it). It is a light-weight phone. Talking on the phone is no problem, easy to hear and it is loud and clear. Very simple to use... options are clear and right there in front of you. The reception is very, very good as long as you are in a covered area. I find T9 text messaging to be a good feature, it is very useful and makes things a lot faster. My only complaint is that it does take a few minutes to sign onto Instant Messengers and basically the entire time you are in the messenger the phone lags, but this could be because of the number of people on my buddy list. The silent actually works... I used a phone that beeped when you recieved a text even on silent which was a bad thing at school. The phone does not come with a big selection of wallpapers, and the ones it has are really dumb. There are not a lot of ring tones, either, but you can download pretty much anything you can think of for $1.49 using t-Zones. T-Mobile has a nice coverage area and activating the phone is simple. I did have a problem setting up my voicemail but I eventually got it to work. If you want a picture/camera phone, do not get this phone --- it's that simple. And if you want a phone the quickly browses the internet, this phone is not for you. I use this phone primarily for text messages, and it also does calling and IMing very well.T-Mobile To Go is the cheapest prepaid wireless plan. I have done all the math and it is your best bet.
UPDATE to my review in 2005: phone still working perfectly well after almost 6 years of use! Battery performance maybe 60% of what it was when the phone was new.ORIGINAL review:If you want just a phone and nothing else, this might be the right one. But after even relatively simple V300 this phone seems like a phone for second graders - huge fonts, limited functions, etc.Funny thing - if you have high cheekbones it's rather uncomfortables.
All in all, this phone is great. It has an easily navigatable menu, great ringtones, and rather good reception (at least where I'm from). My only problem is the texting and instant messaging. That's basically all I use my phone for. The text messaging feature is fine, minus the fact that if you make a mistake and hit space, you can't go back and just hit "0" and edit it, you must backspace through the mistake and completely rewrite it. I use AOL Instant Messenger on my phone constantly, and that's the biggest problem I have with this phone. It is VERY slow connecting/disconnecting, and even when typing a message it takes a minute or so for ANY text to show up on the screen. Also, in order for me to see if new buddies have signed on, I have to sign off and back on, rather than just refresh the list (as with my old phone).If you mostly plan on using your phone for calls, then this is a wonderful phone for you. But, if you plan on using the instant messaging feature, expect a few problems.
This phone looks great, it has a neat blue-lit keypad and is a great size.  The speakerphone works great and everything on the phone is VERY easy to use.The only thing I do not like about the phone is that the reception is not as good as it could be, perhaps because there is no antenna?  This doesn't bug me much though because the cell phone I had before this one was a Motorola with an antenna and the phone was HORRIBLE.  After only 2 days use the phone messed up and I could not hear anyone on it.  I will NEVER get a motorola again!Samsung is great if you're looking for a simple yet nice looking phone! :)
I'm not too imporessed. I've had the phone for 5 days now. I had a Nokia 6800 before this that would give good sound (hearing people, people hearing you) even if the signal was weak (one or two bars). When the signal is weak with this phone, I can barely hear people (their voices braak or sound garbled) and they can barely hear me. So this phone is going back.  Note that the phone picks up the signal at the same number of bars when compared to my old phones, its just that it can't handle the sound unless its a strong signal.
After using a Motorola V60 for two years with Verizon, I was tired of the poor performance. Although, Verizon was significantly better than my old AT&T; Nokia phone and plan, the phone seemed lacking(dropped calls, poor reception, etc).I still like Verizon as a provider and when the opportunity came to upgrade phones(every two years for free with Verizon) I jumped on this one because:A. It is a Motorola phoneB. It has a camera(although not the best in the business)and a color displayC. It was free to meImagine my surprise when I found the reception quality far exceeded my expectaions. I don't drop calls anymore, the voice quality is excellent, and I just love the speakerphone function.It is easy to use, program, and works better than I expected. I even recommended it to my girlfriend as her contract is expiring and we are both on the Verizon IN deal. We have a long distance relationship and with two V276 phones, I think our airtime conversations will be greatly improved.As I am not a techno junkie, I stayed away from paying extra for the Motorola E815. Although, the E815 did look and sound pretty cool from the description. But, it would have been money out of my pocket and I just wanted a phone with a camera. So, if you want to spend the extra dough, go with the E815. If you want to go with the lower end, but still high quality phone, buy the V276.
My fiance and I both bought this phone from Verizon Wirless Online. They had a great deal going on, in fact the phones were free with a 2 year contract. We are both very impressed with the phones. The battery life lasts a long while. He left his uncharged and used often for 3 or 4 days. All phones die off eventually. The camera is of good quality compared to my old V220. Neither of us needed a perfect camera. The sound is wonderful and clear. We were both impressed with the speakerphone. It is very clear and understandable. This phone is a wonderful buy and very good for anyone who is not looking for an expensive phone with an awesome camera. And although another reviewer said "You can't change the wallpaper on the intro screen unless it is a picture you take. This is a simple function to include. Shame on Motorola." we both found this to be false. We changed our backgrounds to pictures we did not take.
My mom got this phone several months ago.  I really can't speak to all its bells and whistles because even if they were the easiest in the world, my mom still couldn't figure them out.What I will say - the phone has EXCELLENT reception and voice clarity compared to her old verizon motorola phone.Verizon, despite all their commercials, has pretty limited coverage in some areas, including at my mother's house in SouthEastern Michigan - right smack dab in the middle of a major city with cell phone towers everywhere.  All other verizon phones do not work there either, or drop calls after 30 or 60 seconds.  (Including my old Audiovox verizon phone, and those of many friends and family who have visited.) This one works just fine.My mother's hearing is going, and she can actually understand most of the stuff that is said on it.  So, that is all good.I'm thinking of getting one too, so I can be at her house and still make cell phone calls.  I'm a little wary of the reviews that say other features are hard to use - but most of my phones were hard to figure out at first...All I really want out of a cell phone is one that works really, really well where I can't get the maximum number of bars.  Most phones seem to just really poor in those situations.  So, having "great menu features" seems pretty moot.  These bad phones are like speaking into a bad teleconference phone that drops the first and last sylable of every thing said - and both people can't talk at the same time like on a land line phone.  Once this people figure out how to make phones that don't do that, I'll be happy.  So far, this Motorola V276 seems better than others I've used.
This phone is adequate at best.  I got my wife and my boss this phone and they are ok with it though wife is not impressed.Pro's:The phone is compact and easy to hold in hand.  It works whether you have big hands like I do or small hands like my wife.Ringer volume is really good.Clarity of sound from the earpiece is good.Call reception is acceptable.Con's:The speakerphone function is barely adequate.  Even with all the bars (indicating good reception), the speakerphone is very choppy and hard to understand.  We've even tried using it while on a walk through an open field with no obstructions and it didn't improve.The menus setup is really bad.  We are not slouches when it comes to using cell phones (I use an XV6600 pocket pc as my phone) but finding common functions like wallpaper settings were not easy to find initially.  The contacts menu is not easy to use and entering contacts is more uncomfortable than painful.  You may struggle with navigating the menus until you have owned the phone for a few weeks.The camera is mediocre as best.  Depending on how badly you need a good picture and don't get it one could describe it as terrible.You can't change the wallpaper on the intro screen unless it is a picture you take.  This is a simple function to include.  Shame on Motorola.No bluetooth withouth an adapter.  There are several phones in this price range that come with bluetooth capability.  Again, shame on Motorola.  (Uhh, Hello, Moto.  Can you hear me now?)Recommendation:If you can live with a slightly confusing phone for a few weeks, then this is the phone for you (it does actually work well for placing and receiving calls).  Don't hang your hat on its features, when choosing a phone, as they are good but not great and in some cases the features are not very useful.  If you need a phone that is easier to navigate and makes more sense, move on to something else.  However, it is one of the better "low cost" phones that Verizon currently offers.  I know this because I bought the other major brand of phone that Verizon sells (just look on their website and count the number of phones this other company offers and you'll figure it out) for my staff (8 phones) and returned all but 2 because of quality, ringer, and sound issues.
The phone overall is OK.  Good reception, small, easy to use.  Problems:1.  The battery is TERRIBLE.  If left uncharged overnight, it'll drop from 6 bars to 2, just sitting there.  It barely lasts a day and a half of low usage.2.  The phone book sucks.  Although you can add more than 1 entry per person, the entries are not aggregated when displayed.  So, if you have home/cell/work numbers assigned to a contact, ALL 3 will be displayed no matter what.  That makes scrolling difficult.3. The phone construction is flimsy.  The battery door is the cheapest junk plastic.  It creaks when you press on it lightly.
I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse." I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as "customer abuse"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own.
Of all the reviews here, everyone forgot to mention one key issue...THERE IS NOT A WAY TO GET THE CURRENT DATE TO SHOW ON THE FRONT DISPLAY SCREEN, OR THE INNER SCREEN. This has to be the only phone that does not show the date along with the time. I never would have purchased this phone had I known this. The only way to check the date is to go into the setup menu and view it along with the time. I can't believe this phone was actually designed like this. Other issues, the picture quality is horrible. I wouldn't expect great pictures from a camera phone, but the pictures this thing takes are useless. Also, the volume control on the side of the phone stopped working after two months. You would think with Motorola's name on it the quality of this thing would be much better. With this said, I will never buy a Motorola product again.
This is simply a very well made, high quality phone for a very reasonable price.  I purchased mine this afternoon.  Have already taken a dozen pictures and have downloaded several new ringtones and wallpapers off of the Get It Now! service.  Menu is easy to navigate and, to cap it all off, it gets great reception!Definately a must buy at the price I paid for it ($50 w/ 2 year contract)!
I recently updated(or Should i say downgraded?) to this phone after having an N-gage.I was looking for a camera phone My mother just happen to be getting a family plan So I asked her If they had any camera phones. This one happened to be the cheapest(the other was around $180). When she brought it over I looked over it.First off the phone is not custom friendly. You cant set a wallpaper, unless its a picture you took. Next the ring tone is awful. I'm not sure what the types are called, but the rings sound like Poor midi's.Next Where's bluetooth? It's not here that's for sure. You also cant use MMC or SD memory cards, Nothing to save the pictures to other than the phones small 2MB memory.Last the Camera. The camera is awful. I'm not sure what the mega pixles are but I can tell you that indoor pictures look fuzzy and dark, and I was under light.This phone is awful, if your looking to "trick out" your phone, this one isnt for you. If your looking for a phone that has a camera on it and dont care about quality.....well I still wouldnt recommend it. Theres really no reason to get this phone untill the price drops to $50 or $40.
This is the most ridiculous cell phone I ever had. The instrument totally hangs while saving numbers. I think the problem is with the speed dial option they have.I strongly advise not to buy this phone if they are not in any suicidal mission!!
IVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS NOTHINGS WRONG WITH IT SO FAR AND IVE HAD ABOUT 10 PHONES WHICH EVERYBODY SAYS BROKE IN A MONTH SO DONT BELIEVE THEM IF THEY SAY IT BRAKES EASILLY THEY JUST CANT TAKE CARE OF A PHONE. ITS  REALLY NICE BUT THE CAMERA SUCKS!!!! ID SAY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET A NEW ONE BECAUSE YOU GET BORED OF IT REALLY FAST. ME, MY GIRL FRIEND, FRIENDS ALL ARE REALLY TIRED OF IT BUT IF U JUST WANT A PHONE TO TALK ON AND DONT CARE ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS GO AHEAD AND BUY IT
As per CNET ([...] model V265 has second highest SAR rating in US. I believe this V276 is very close to V265. I am not sure if I will go for this model...
Overall, this phone functions OK.  The reception is good, and voice quality (both ways) is good.  However, this phone is only useful if you set all volume controls to maximum.  Even then, the volume levels are just "adequate".  It's more full-featured than any handset I've ever owned.  Having THREE fully programmable alarm clocks is especially useful.  I also like having multiple phone number fields for each ONE contact, though I don't understand why there are two "mobile" phone fields and only one "home" phone field.  (the opposite would be more useful)  Talk time is about two hours and "standby" is 3-4 days, in actual use.  Both LCD displays are good quality, but it really needs a brightness control, as black shows up as light gray (brightness is too high and can't be adjusted).  It does have a contrast control, but white level is fine, so the contrast control is kind of useless.  The LCD displays themselves seem to be really high quality, so it is disappointing that they are improperly adjusted.  (the image quality COULD be outstanding, if properly adjusted)  I don't like that a whole section of the menu is devoted to "Get It Now", though Verizon probably insisted on those useless money wasters.  (can't fault LG for that)  Other than that, the menu system is pretty easy / less cluttered than some handsets I've used.The camera functions OK.  The quality of pictures is terrible, but about the same as any other camera phone.  If you want pictures, use a digital camera!  I mainly like the camera portion of the phone for emergency use.  For example, it is a good idea to carry a disposable camera in the car for car accidents.  But if you have a camera phone, that's just as good.  (emergency use)  And if you are ONLY going to send photos to other camera phones, the photos will look good.  Forget about using them outside the camera though, as they are low resolution and low quality (just like all camera phones)  One nice thing about this camera is that it has a built-in flash (if you enable it), but it would only be good for really short distances, like 6 feet or less.One major gripe I have about this handset is that there is no external indication that the phone is actually ON.  There is an LED by the antenna, but this only lights up during phone conversations.  (WHY???)  If the little LED was on all the time or blinking, it would not affect battery life at all (that you'd notice, anyway).  You can set the backlight of the front LCD display to "ALWAYS on".  That would give you an external indication that the phone was on.  But if you did that, you'd have to charge the phone about twice a day.  (!)My wife bought these phones (two of them) and we'll probably keep them.  If I'd have known what I know now though, I'd have probably picked something different.  The handset has buttons RIGHT where you hold it on BOTH sides of the phone, making it very difficult to hold.  And if you are left-handed (I'm both), you simply can not hold this phone, as the buttons (which are ACTIVE during phone calls) are right under your thumb.  What a stupid design.  If there's going to be buttons on the side, it should be on the side of the flip-up part, NOT the part that you hold!!!
I have had this phone since September 6th, and I must say it does everything that I bought it for, and more. Both screens are vibrant and easy to see in almost any light. Incredible reception, I haven't had a single dropped call yet. Camera is average (as far as cell phones go). If you're complaining that the camera is bad, then why did you buy a camera phone in the first place?  One problem I noticed with this phone is the speakerphone. You can only use it in a completely silent place. It is even hard to hear the other person on very windy days. Another flaw is the fact that you can't use your recorded sounds as ringtones, and I have heard many owners of this phone complaining about this. Apparantly, Verizon did this so that you would have to buy your ringtones directly from their Get It Now service. Good for them, bad for us.
I'm 14 years old and I got this phone a few days ago.. I love it.The camera quality is great compared to other camera phones that I have used.  You can choose color effects when you're taking a picture including, negative, black and white and sepia.You can access AIM, MSN, or Yahoo IM from the phone too.I love how the screen on the front of the phone is colored, and you can change the wallpaper of it, or take pictures with it.Text messaging is easy, and the messages send quickly.I haven't figured out how to use the speakerphone yet, if there is one.The only thing that I dont like about this phone is... actually, I have no complaints.This is a great phone and I reccomend buying it if you are a teenager looking for your first phone.  The price may seem high but it is worth it.I hope this review helped you with your purchase!
I purchased this phone on September 1st at a nearby Best Buy, and thankfully there was a 30 day return policy--because on the 25th, it completely locked up.  After turning off the phone for about two hours because I wanted to be completely distraction free, I turned it back on--it started up and went to the menu screen, like normal, but any button presses after that did absolutely nothing.  I couldn't even turn it off.  I removed the battery, re-inserted it, and turned it back on, and it wouldn't get past the "Verizon Wireless" startup screen.  I hooked it up to the charger and waited about an hour and tried again, and still no dice.  I had never dropped the phone before or otherwise mistreated it, and in fact right before I turned the phone off I  was using it to browse ringtones, to this was entirely unexpected.  Fortunately Best Buy didn't prove to be overly difficult with their exchange policy, even though I didn't have a receipt, box, manual, or charger.Otherwise, the phone was unremarkable.  The camera was what you'd expect (bad) and hearing other people was somewhat difficult, although it had no problem holding a signal.  Probably an okay middle-range phone, but there are far better options.  I'll be wary of ever buying an LG phone in the future.
(...)The phone itself SHOULD be great, it had a lot of great features and looked really nice. Had a camera phone, voice activation, nice graphics, etc. However, about 75% of the time, I could barely hear the person on the other end. The other 25%, they were blaring through. Plus, every time I used the phone, I could hear these very faint, high pitched beeping noises (like when you go take a hearing test...). It was very distracting and annoying. The main purpose of a cell phone is to be able to talk to other people, so when you can't even do that, it's not worth it. Other than that, I liked it very much. I ended up exchanging it for the LGVX4650, which although is not nearly as pretty, is much, much better in terms of functionality.
When switching to Verizon from another wireless carrier, I initially bought 6 of the VX5200 for my on-call staff.  Within 24 hours, all of them had come to me and complained about their phones.Complaints included:Ring tones that were too soft,Flimsy flip mechanisms in the phone's hinge,The annoying chiming noise the phone makes every time you turn it on or turn it off (and we couldn't find a way to disable it),Cheap feel of the phone,Some of the menus didn't make much sense,Poor reception quality inside the buildingsOverall, they were not happy with the phones and didn't feel comfortable using them so I had to take them back and get the motorola E815.There was not much good about the phones other than the:Ability to take pictures,Decent quality speakerphone,Bright screens,Final Recommendation:The phone bravely offers a lot of features for the dollar and were it not for the poor reception and poor build quality, which are deal breakers for me, I would have made my staff stay with this phone.  Get this phone only if: 1) this phone fits your budget and/or 2) you don't care about the above listed complaints as this phone will work for those who just need to dial the numbers they need to call.
I own four of these phones and experienced a lock up with one after only 4 weeks of ownership. It was replaced by Verizon, but now I wonder about the other three and if they will have problems also.The other issue is the external pix button. The males in my family carry their phones in their pockets. Many times they wind up with unwanted pictures of their  pants pocket.There is no key guard, only a lock/security feature which I/they find inconvenient.Otherwise, it is a nice phone with good features.
I had the same problems as the other reviewer below except that I returned mine for a new one and then had the same lock up problem.  There is obviously something wrong with this phone.
Just got the phone and seems to meet what I need.  The only issue I have found is that, as they make the phones smaller... and "sleeker"... they are much harder to hold on to!  If I had one wish, it would be to have a "skin" replacement with some sort of rough finish... even something out of thin rubber.  I have big hands and have had multiple occasions just recently that I would liken to "trying to keep hold of a sqwirming fish".Any ideas?DJ
I just made the leap into mobile technology with this purchase, so I can't make any comparisons to other products here.  But I prefer to think that will make my review more objective.I've had this phone for exactly a week at this point and I couldn't be happier with it.  It is very compact, yet packed with useful features.  The black and silver casing is stylish and professional looking, as well as the blue backlight.  The buttons are sensibly positioned and easy to use.  The menus are so intuitive I have yet to crack open the instruction book.  My initial charging time was only 90 minutes, not the 12-24 hours the manual promises.  The battery lasted a good 5 days with no attempt at restricting my usage.  The reception is crystal clear, I get 3-4 bars everywhere I go, and not a single dropped call yet.Many reviewers complain about the low speaker volume, and I solved that problem (as other reviewers suggested) by experimenting with the position of the speaker against my ear.  People also complain about the 6101's limited memory, which I haven't come up against yet.  I'm not sure what kind of voluminous data these folks are jamming into their phones.Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I tried out the included earbuds with the FM radio.  This is an excellent feature, but what I love most about it is the earbuds double as a hands-free headset that worked beautifully in the car without worrying about placing a microphone properly near my mouth.  I don't know how Nokia managed this...it must be done through magic.I took away one star because of the camera function.  The pictures look great as long as I don't try to put them on my computer, but as everyone says, if you want a camera, buy a camera, not a phone.  Live and learn.  Also there are only 8 provided ringtones, each one more cheesy sounding than the last.  A little more selection without ponying up extra $$ would have been nice.I really, really wanted a Motorola Razr, but every site I looked at was full of reviews saying the same thing: all form, no function.  What good's a phone that is pretty to look at but doesn't do what it's supposed to?  The 6101 has impressed me suitably to make me a Nokia customer for life (knock on wood).Update:  Had the phone for 2-1/2 weeks now.  I accidentally cracked a tiny part of plastic from the hinge area just from opening it.  This made the silver trim come loose and bend at a right angle upward.  Nokia claims the "limited warranty" doesn't cover this poor workmanship.  Bad form!  They still need a little work on clamshell construction, clearly.  Would take away a half star for this.
OK, the one absolutely great thing about the phone is the weak signal reception. This phone will hold a call with good clarity way better than several Motorolas and Samsungs I've tried with T-Mobile.Now to the stupid stuff.The backlight only stays on for 14 sec. and no way to adjust it. You really can't see the display if the backlight is off. Really annoying when trying to listen to/send voice mails.All the key presses you do stay on the display unless you specifically clear the display. It doesn't clear automatically when you close the flip. This is an ID theft issue if you use you phone to pay credit card bills, mortgage payments etc, and you don't clear the display, and then loose your phone.But the big screwup is the tiny little pinhole opening for the ear speaker! This is why some people complain about the volume. The actual volume is fine, but the pinhole is an opening that's probably only 5-10% the surface area of most phones. Talking with several people who own the phone, how this bothers you apparently depends on the shape of your ear's pinna. That's the outside of your ear. If you don't have the opening positioned directly over your ears canal, you can't hear worth crap. If the opening touches your skin on the outside of your ear, it's like holding your thumb over the speaker, you simply can't hear. I have one of those ears! This was incredibly annoying and caused me to return the phone. Almost all other phones I've seen have several openings over the speaker, and I don't have the problem.
I recieved the Nokia 6101 (which is essentially the same hardware as the 6102) cell phone from t-mobile a 2 days ago so here are some of my early impressions about the phone:Pros:- The great reception as with most nokia phones: My appt does not recieve a great coverage from my t-mobile and the only phones that work are ones from Nokia. I used a 6610 and a 6230 and there are no problems with the reception of the 6101.- IRDA to sync data: I own an IBM laptop which have IRDA build in. So it is convinent to use the Nokia PC Suite to sync the phone with my outlook.- Supports Mp3 ringtonesCons:- No Bluetooth: Unlike the 6230 the 6101/6102 does not have bluetooth.- Limited memory: I do not understand why Nokia did not include the external memory card slot, and music player compatibility with this phone. If it can play Mp3 ringtones then surely it can play mp3s, and it would have been great to add a 512 MB card to play music on the go.- Size and Weight: The phone is a bit bulky and heavier than other flip phones but not so much that it becomes uncomfortable in to carry around- Different charger: For some reason Nokia has a different charger for this phone. So your chargers for older models of Nokia will not be compatible.Overall I think this is a nice cell for business use. For entertainment and such, I think 6230 is still the Nokia leader.
I have always been a fan of Nokia- I  feel it is the best phone company ever. I was thinking of buying a new camera phone, and when I came across this beautiful Nokia flip phone model I just fell for it! I would very higly recommend this phone. It has a beautiful design, is light, has a wonderful camera and video phone and has a bonus feature- FM radio! Great for your workout sessions!!!It doesn't have bluetooth. But whatever - you dont get everything in one phone, do you? I get great reception and enjoy the handsfree headset listening to music or talking when I am driving and thats what I need for a great value for my buck!!!!If you are thinking of buying a phone, buy the Nokia 6101!!!NK
The part at the top where you listen is a little low even with the volume turned all the way up. The radio is actually pretty good it's almost like having a walkman. The camera doesn't take amazing pictures, but they are fine.I just wish that you had more options such as zoom (even though you can do it after the pic, it doesn't stay that way) and things such as flash and a choice of hi med or lo resolution. The video is extremely grainy and pixely so definitely do not expect quality with that it's more for something you really want to record and don't have access to or just don't want to drag out a camcorder. The only other bad thing is that it says it can do mp3, so you can hold the phone's mic up to a speaker and set that as your ringtone. I  tried doing this and I wasn't expecting anything magnificent but it was absolutely  terrible, and screechy and tinny and sounded like a wounded mouse in a pop can. The phone itself looks nice, black and silver.I like the nice external display. It has a infrared port and also EDGE which are pretty good features.
In the past, I have tried other flip phones, and I didn't like them, because the menu was not easy to navigate, and the ringer wasn't loud, and some of the hifi ringers on the older model flip phones just sound awful. This phone is so easy to navigate, you don't even need the intructions, everything is self explanatory, but please do read the instructions to learn how to care of the phone. The hifi ringers sound like you are listening to the song on the radio. Reception is great, and the loud speaker feature, is very clear and crisp sounding. The FM radio sound good too. When taking a photo, even in the daytime, if you don't have enough light in the room, use the night mode on the cammera, and it your photo will come up clearer, with more light. However, I do reccomend, the car kit and all other accessories be purchase from the Nokia website, or authenic Nokia acessories purchased from your service provided. There are cheaper versions out there, but buyer beware, they don't work as well, and the wrong battery may actually damaged your phone. This is a great little phone, I'm having fun with it, I hope you do too. I almost forgot, you need to buy the leather case, make sure it is by Nokia, it covers the entire phone, and it has a clip on it, to wear on your clothes. Remeber the smaller the phone the more delicate they are so you do want to protect it.  T-mobile also has the Nokia case. The Nokia website also authenticates your battery by going to [...] Have fun!
I LOVE THIS PHONE!  I got this phone to replace the Nokia 3220, which I couldn't stand (awful design in using the menu) and it hasn't disappointed me.  The phone isn't too small, nor too big.  The display is easy to read, the keypad numbers are nice and big.  Reception is the usual Nokia best there is to be had (for TMobile anyway).  Speaker phone is great, as is radio, menu + functionability is really user friendly.  My only complaint is that  the volumne is low when using the phone without a headset or speaker phone.  If you move the phone around on your ear, you can hit just the right spot where it's better, but this is a problem I've seen with every Nokia phone I've had and this is my 3rd or 4th.  Overall, I am totally pleased with this phone and much relieved after that awful 3220!

I just purchased this phone one month back. I am Nokia Phone fan. I had last three Nokia phone. This was my First Flip phone and I was excited to find out Nokia came out with Flip Phone. My Excitement died out in one month after I used it extensively. This phone disappointed me from my earlier Nokia 3650 and 3660. If I have choice now I would like to trade this phone with Nokia 3660. Here is the reason1) This phone says it plays mp3 but what's point if it does not have enough storage. This phone comes with 4mb RAM out of which 2.0 MB is already used by default so you are left with 2 MB.2) Searching for contact in phone book is very slow. You might wonder how does it going to affect but believe me if you are driving it does matters a lot. After you press phone book and want to search name with S it does not come up as you keep pressing PQRS. Also it does not show all the name starting with last name and first name with (S) it only shows which start with S. So if you want to search John Watt and if you press W it will not list John Watt you will have to press J which was not problem in 3660.3) Now even if you get your name like John Watt from your contact by pressing J and if you press talk it will automatically dials default number. If this name has multiple numbers like Office, Home, Cell you will not get an option to choose number to dial which I love in 3660 and 3650. You will have to select view and then select number.4) I purchased this phone so that I can hear FM radio in office. Reception of this phone is very poor and there is lot of noise so no point of FM radio.5) No blue Tooth so I can not use blue Tooth Head phone.Here are some plus for this phoneLarge screen, good phone reception that's it.From all of the above most of all feature which this phone claim are useless either due to lack of storage or poor radio performance.This time Nokia disappointed me and Nokia needs to improve a lot in flip phone. Hope Nokia will come with better phone in flip version.
This is the first flip-phone that Nokia has ever produced. Good job for a first effort, but after owning a couple of flip-phones; two Motorolas, and an LG, this one leaves something to be desired. Okay, to me, it seems that Nokia didn't research Motorola or LG before designing one of their own. If they had, this phone would be a lot more user-friendly. As it is, the phone does not offer ringtone assignment for individuals (you have to create a group), a banner, quick voice calling, or an ability to keep the lights on (displays and keys lit up). What it lacks, it makes up for in some areas. Such as, external camera activation and control (flip closed), an FM Radio (though an additional enhancement to operate it must be purchased seperately or it won't work), excellent battery life, talk time and signal reception. Having owned an LGVX6000, I'd  highly recommend it over the 6101, though you can't use it with T-Mobile. This is a good phone and I enjoy using it, though I miss the ease and convenience of the LG. I do recommend this phone as a first flip-phone for anyone looking to switch from the traditional "candy bar" style Nokia has been known for.
I've always had Nokia phones that have worked very well.  So when I was looking for a new phone and saw that Nokia had come out with a flip, I knew I had to try it out.  I am so glad I went ahead and got this phone.  It is absolutely wonderful!  It has a great, stylish, sturdy look to it.  Not cheap looking or feeling at all.  The inside display is nice and bright, and I really like the outside display as well.  The buttons are large and easy to press.  Plus they are very well backlit with a cool blue light.  The reception on this phone is amazing.  I get better reception in certain areas with this phone than I have with any previous phone.  Volume and call clarity are great.  I was worried about the volume due to some reviews I'd read, but have had no problems hearing people at all.  I think these people complaining about volume may not be holding the speaker exactly to their ear, because if you hold it a little off then of course you're not going to hear it as well.  Just hold the phone correctly and you'll have no problems.  People on the other end think I'm calling from a land line because it sounds so clear.  Nokia has put the antenna on the left hand side, unlike almost every phone out there, which is great because it does not get in the way of your hand when you're talking.  The size of the phone is not too big and not too small.  Plus it's really light.  Mine came with a good selection of ring tones, but it is so easy to download new ones if you want more variety.  The menus are extremely intuitive and easy to use.  The camera does the job for me, as all I want to use it for is to put images up as my background on the main and mini displays.  I want my phone to be a good phone first before anything else and this one does the job.  The extra bells and whistles are just bonuses to me and make this phone all the better.  The phone has convenient volume and camera buttons on the sides.  These are small and out of the way enough that I do not accidently press them, unlike other phones where I hear this is a problem.  All around a fantastic phone and I highly recommend it!
Of the several cell phones I've owned over the years, I've always got the best service out of the Nokia brand phones.  Particularly in areas where the signal is low, they always seem to pull the best reception without dropping calls.  The 6101 is no exception.With the flip design, you are able to get the earpiece closer to your ear - which makes it easier to hear the callers voice than a non-flip style phone.  The display is bright and easy to see - even in bright light. The speakerphone seems louder than previous Nokias I've owned.  The camera works well.  All other functions feel identical to the non-flip Nokias.The construction of the phone seems more solid than most flip phones.  So far I have dropped my 6101 on concrete, and a tiled bathroom floor without a crack in the case, or even a scratch.The only thing I find disappointing is the ringer selection with my T-Mobile model.  I would rather have a standard ringer than a "noise" or song, but that doesn't seem to exist on what is pre-installed.
I got the 6101 as my first cell phone and I have to say that it's a pretty cool. The functions of the phone are great, it's easy to use and has plenty of customisable features to play with. The camera is excellent for a cell phone and deals with low light situations easily. The case looks real cool, the buttons work well, and the phone has a strong vibrate feature. The outside screen is nice and big, good for caller ID. Having the ability to put one wallpaper on the main screen and another on the outside screen is also a plus. Overall the phone works well and is nice to have.  There are some major problems to the phone, the ear piece being one. The phone has one tiny hole as the ear piece so you have to keep the phone in one position on your face to hear anybody speaking. The phone slips easily so you have to watch where you put it.  The main problem the phone has is it's durability. Within less than a month, the phone had started to degrade. The battery came loose easily and I would repeatedly find my phone randomly off after being in my pocket. I also noticed that the top part (screen) of the phone had started to wiggle a litte. All these things I put off as little annoyances and decided to keep the phone. I lived peacefully and happily with the 6101 until one day I pulled it out of my pocket to make a phone call and the found that the front screen on the phone had cracked in half with no provocation at all. The next day I took the phone in and upgraded to the V3 Razr and I'm happy to say that the phone is just better. There was a significant loss of camera quality between the Razr and the 6101, but that's a worthy loss to not have your phone fall apart in your pocket.The 6101 is a cool little phone and works well, it just falls apart without reason. Go for the Razr or something else.
This phone suffers from the same defect as any other Nokia mid to high end phone; Raging mediocrity.It does the normal phone functions decently.It the screen is ok.The rings are loud, but the call audio is lower than some other phones.Reception isn't really a problem but i don't recall any other phones from Nokia that had _bad_ reception.The screen is slightly better than similar priced Motorola's, but not as good as the Samsungs.Some high points:Large buttons.Large Screen.Newer menu, but still easy to use.Lows:Domestic tri-band (850/1900 US, and 1800)New, very thin power port that is not the same as most of the Nokia's
I got this phone a few months ago after narrowly escaping being suckered into the super-cool looking but crappy functioning Motorola Razr.  Nokia phones, in my experience, are sturdy, reliable, and simple, and this phone lives up to the brand name.  It's sleek but sturdy, has easy to use and decent quality features like the built-in camera/video, and the sound quality is the best one can expect from a cell phone.  I've already dropped it a couple of times and no problems yet (fingers crossed:)Definitely the ideal flip-phone for someone who just wants a good quality, well-functioning and nice looking phone.
I recently purchsed this phone and it is so much better than the last one I had! The only problem i've had so far is that it froze up once which can be fixed only by putting the battery back in.
There isn't anything that impresses me about this phone. The backlight remains on for less than five seconds, unless you're pressing one of the phone's keys, and there isn't an option to have it remain on for a predetermined amount of seconds.Without the backlight on, both the external and the main display are nearly impossible to read. The phone has eight ring tones preloaded, with all but perhaps two being intolerable. Both the phone's still and video capturing relies largely on lots of light, and yet as expected, it won't replace your stand alone camera or camcorder.Reception has been perfect, rather your opinion is that great reception is accreditation to T-mobile's network or the believe that Nokia phones offer superior reception, my opinion is that of the latter. The FM radio works well, and is a great extra feature. The phone has most of the latest bells and whistles in cell phones, minus Bluetooth and upgradeable memory. While the Nokia 6101 will not end your quest for a perfect cell phone, it will suffice while you continue your never ending quest.
Nokia has always been the "candybar" phonemaker of choice, but their flip phones are nothing to pass over.  I just received my 6101 from T-Mobile and I was quite impressed.  It is very light, has a very well designed and strong hinge, and the materials are very good quality.  The few things I did not like about this phone were the user interface, display and camera.  I feel that Nokia needs to improve these features in order to ramp their phones up to the same standards as other makes like Motorola.  But all in all, still a great choice.===UPDATE===After a week of regular use, the phone froze.  I turned it off and took out the battery, then turned it back on.  This happened 3 times.  It was working again but the ringer was not working.  I was very dissapointed, so I returned this phone to T-Mobile and I am now waiting for my new Motorola v360.  I give this phone 3 stars, T-Mobile has been very helpful and their customer service is fantastic.
Just got this phone for my wife. She is "technically challenged" so this phone is great for her. It has large numbers making it easy for her to call people. The on/off buttons are colored green/red so she can easily figure out how to turn it on/off. The display is clear and bright with simple icons making it easy for her to select the phonebook and pick out the names of people to call. With her previous phone, she could never figure that part out, and typed every number each time she called someone. I only give this phone 4 stars however since the builtin camera and FM radio present major challenges for her and I have serious doubts that she will ever figure out how to use them. Nokia should make a phone that a complete idiot can use, then I would not need to do tech support. Thank god for the Apple iMac and iSync as well, since this allows her to update and sync the phonebook.
I am posting this because I'm not sure if the other reviewers work for Nokia.  After reading the sparkling reviews, I waited with anticipation for the Nokia 6101, only to be COMPLETELY UNDERWHELMED by this phone.  My spouse and I were bored with in an hour.  Keeping in mind that the cell phone immediately preceding this one is a black Motorola Razor and before that, a Motorola V300- the Nokia does not even hold a candle to either of those phones.  The Nokia screen is teeny and blurry, the screen font is sans serif (think Mac computer circa 1989) and the "print quality" photos are a joke.  The reception is fine, but the phone itself is lacking in pizzazz.  It is very basic, which is fine if that is what you're in the market for.  I wouldn't actually pay money for this phone.I am going to give this phone another few days (to give the Nokia reception prowess a chance to impress) but unless it's a huge difference, I will return it to Tmobile for another Razor.  In terms of size is like the old Motorola V60.  The FM radio works fine.Step up, Nokia!---I am revising my review after a few more days of use.  What this phone lacks in looks it makes up for in reception.  There is an area up the hill from my home that never ot ANY reception with my old Motorola V300 or Razor.  The Nokia picks up a signal in that area and the reception is clear as can be.  I would revise it to three 1/2 stars.
I've been looking for a Bluetooth phone for over two years now. I've never bought one before because they were always high-end phones with more features than I would ever care about using. I'd been following the Sony-Ericsson phones, but they were always expensive when new and followed the same pattern of featuritis.I just found this phone last week, and I bought it on the spot. It is exactly what I have been looking for -- a good phone with some very useful features, plus a few gimmicks for the young and hip (or young at heart and hipless). Among the more important features for me, mainly from a practicality / safety standpoint:- Voice-activated dialing (super-easy to set up, and it even recognizes partial commands -- I'd set up my home number as "Call home", but it worked just fine when I only said "Home")- Speakerphone function (a little fuzzy, but serviceable as long as you're not in a moving car)- (Brightly!) Backlit, reasonably large keys- Lightweight- Small, but not too small to hold comfortably (I'm 6' 3" with large hands, and I have no problems holding or dialing)- Caller-specific ring tones to spare me from reading the display (my wedding song's playing? Must be my wife calling)- Very good signal reception (I generally get 4 or 5 bars in my home, where I used to get 1 or 2 with my old Nokia [both on Cingular])- Good sound quality, almost as good as a land lineBut for me, the most important feature in a cell phone has long been Bluetooth. I really think this is the best technology to come to mobile phones, and Cingular (unlike some other cell service providers ::cough::VERIZON::cough::) doesn't cripple or limit what it can do. Without reading the manual, I quickly navigated to the phone's Connectivity menu, turned on Bluetooth, and told it to find local devices. My Apple PowerBook was right there and turned on, and the phone found it almost instantly. It paired up without any hassle (the PowerBook notified me right away when I needed to enter the passcode for a permanent pairing), and a few seconds later I was using iSync to send over my contacts, saving me a good hour of time vs having to manually key them all in. iSync recognized the phone with no issues and configuration of sync options was a breeze.I was also able to send an MP3 file from iTunes via Bluetooth (after first pulling out the bit I wanted to use as the ring tone through QuickTime). The phone took the file without any additional software -- I just used the Bluetooth File Transfer utility that came bundled with the PowerBook. The phone automatically recognized it as a sound file, put in the right place, and made it immediately available as a ring tone.I plan on purchasing the S-E Bluetooth car kit (HCB-700) and possibly the advanced music mute to route the sound through my car's speakers instead of using the kit's speaker. Then I'll have a perfect wireless hands-free setup!
If you travel overseas, you want a quad band phone. However, until recently that pretty much restricted you to Motorola. I've had three Motorola phones, and they all fell apart within a year, so I wasn't about to buy another one. In addition, I find the current Motorola user interface (on the RAZR) ugly and hard to use.So, I was delighted when Sony Ericsson finally released a quad band phone in the USA, and Cingular picked it up. The Z520a is a phone for people who want a phone. It's small, robustly built, and has all the features you could reasonably want for telephony. The flashing lights are a gimmick, but a gimmick that can be useful in noisy environments.If you want to use high speed data services, this phone is not for you, as it lacks EDGE support. If you want to browse the web, this phone is probably not for you--it has a web browser, but the screen is small. If you want to listen to music, get an iPod--this phone only has 17MB free when you get it, and there's no headphone jack. If you want to take 4x6 photos, again, this isn't the phone you want--the 640x480 resolution is good for e-mailing fun web snapshots, but that's about it.But as I say, it's a phone. It's small enough to fit in the pocket of your jeans. It'll pair with a Toyota Prius via Bluetooth for hands free use. It'll pair with a Mac and sync your contacts and calendars via iSync. It'll play your choice of MIDI files or MP3s sent from your computer as ringtones, so you don't have to pay for overpriced downloads. For my phone at least, Cingular didn't lock down the Bluetooth or otherwise cripple the phone's functionality.I had a Sony Ericsson T68i, which was incredibly slow. I'm happy to report that this phone is lightning fast by comparison--no noticable lag in the user interface. Java applications take a while to start up, but run fine once they're up.Why not 5 stars? Well, the inner screen is absurdly easy to scratch--you'll want a screen protector. Also, the arrow keys are a bit fiddly to press; a scroll wheel or joystick would have been very welcome.
This is a very good cell phone and Amazon.com gives the best deal. But, you can't transfer your old phone number from different provider to Cingular through Amazon.com. If you transfer your old phone number, you won't get your mail-in rebate. Please read amazon.com mail-in rebate rules carefully!!!You can read about how to transfer your number through this link : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/508597/102-6686881-6992121
We have THREE of these phones from Cingular.  COmpared it side by side against the Razr.After about 2 weeks of intensive use, we like this phone better than the Razr in everything area except for two things: reception sensitivity and screen size.Pros:Lighter, smaller, slightly more tactile key, and most importantly - more analog sound both in the earpiece and transmitting than the Razr. It simply sounds more natural.  Also, having a synthetic body (some kind of plastic) along with its lightweight, should be more durable than the Razr.  GREAT talk time compared to the razr etc.  Bluetooth with plantronics works just fine. Zero problems there.  Finally, the speaker phone is quite usable and noticeably better on both the transmitting and receiving end compared to the Razr.  Also, very consistent quality - all three of our phones work identically in reception strength and sound quality.  Kudos there.Cons:Razr has better reception. This is a big one.  Our home is in the fringe area of reception in the mountains. Decending to the 'basement', we have very very fringe reception.  Barely 1 bar at times.  Razr takes the call no problem and maintains rock solid connection. The Sony would make the call maybe once out of five times, and then drop it repeatedly after seconds.  Basically not usable in this very fringe environment.  We continue to drop calls with CIngular often even with 3 bars in different environments.  Not sure if it is the phone or Cingular.Also, Razr does have a bigger screen that is just more of a pleasure to see.  This is minor for us.Currently, we are keeping the Z520 but the weaker reception than the Razr and dropped calls on all three Z520 is driving us a bit 'nuts'.  We have 30 days to decide whether to keep it and are still evaluating.Hope this helps.Addendum after 3 weeks:I would not give it 1 or 2 stars if I could.  Called Cingular multiple times to resolve our problems to no avail and received some erroneous information.  With all three phones, we would regularly drop calls even with 3 or 4 bars showing.  Further, just sitting on our desk, the phone would bounce from 1 to 4 bar and back in seconds.  Something is wrong with the internal algorithm.  It is possible that the phone is searching for alternate bands?  Can't set the band manually.  VERY frustrating and poor performance after extensive testing with 3 phones.Final update:We traded all 3 for Razrs and the difference is remarkable.  The Razr exhibited NONE of the problems of the Z520 with the many dropped calls.  Simply blows the Z520 away.  We tried our best to  like the Z520 but am very happy with the Razr.  Also, we racked up a bunch of unintentional charges with the Z520 as you can push many additional $$ services inadvertantly with just ONE button.  THis happened on ALL three Z520s and was very irritating.  We never saw this coming until the bill showed up.  Cingular charge $20 for games which we never intentionally loaded.  They did reverse charges though when we challenged it. In all, one star phone.
I got two of these phones for my wife and I based on all of the features that come in this new model.  I have to say that the contact synchronization and full featured Bluetooth features are awesome.  It's also nice to have an infrared port, and a speakerphone all packaged in such a small form-factor.  However!  Yes, there is a however, all these features don't mean a thing if the phone doesn't work correctly.  First and foremost this is a phone and it should act like one!Right off the bat, we had problems with both phones where without warning, they would cease to ring and would only vibrate.  Just out the blue the ringer would get turned off and no amount of fiddling with the settings could make the ringer come back.  The only solution was to remove the battery and reboot the phone.  Not good!We also experienced problems with the "Theme" setting.  The color-scheme and wallpaper would randomly go back to the default blue.  Again, the only way to remedy that was to remove the battery.One of the phones had a faulty outside LCD screen.  The top area of the screen was so washed out, that it was impossible to see the Voicemail or Message icons as well as the battery status icon.  Changing the screen's brightness made no difference at all.  The other phone made a high pitched noise when charging.  This was so bad that we could only charge the phone in another room at nights, so as to not hear the buzzing it made.  Not good again!Lastly, and probably the most disappointing problem with this phone is that during some calls, we could hear a pattern of clicks every 2 seconds or so.  During the clicks (very faint), the transmission would be interrupted and neither you nor the other person on the line could be hear.  The effect of this is that in sounded like the call was being dropped or like we had bad reception.  We determined that this was not caused by network issues because a person standing next to us (also with a full signal) was able to make and receive crystal clear calls while we experienced these interruptions in the conversation.The saddest part of this is that in my opinion the phone is perfectly fine and the problems ALL stem from Cingular's firmware (software) on the phone.  A good friend of mine has the European version of this phone (z520 - no "a") and he does not experience ANY of these problems even though he too has Cingular's service.Given all of this, it's hard to rate the phone so poorly knowing that the software is the problem, but unless Cingular fixes it soon, this phone is not worth the trouble.  You can find similar experiences all over blogs and review boards.  I hope this helps you in your decision.
I'm having a problem with my Z520a and I was wondering if anyone else has seen this.Every few days or so, I will notice the GUI gets distorted on the phone. The animated wallpaper will turn into a solid color, menu buttons don't look right, and there is a black box behind any highlighted item in the Settings screen.Once I notice this, I can't talk on any calls I receive or make. Only silence on both ends. My ringtone doesn't active either, when I receive a call. The phone just vibrates.The only solution to this is to reboot the phone, which is a real pain.I love this phone, but this problem is really annoying. Does anyone have any insight?
I bought the unlocked version of this phone for using it outside the US and I've been using it for more than a month now and up to now I'm glad with the purchase. Being a Motorola user for the past 2 years, I preferred this phone over the Motorola V3 black since now everybody has the V3. At every corner you see someone using it, whereas the Z520a is not even being sold here in my country... that, and a 60$ difference when I bought it. Also, the fact that the Z520a came with over 17 MB of internal memory and the V3 only has like 6 MB.Now, the Pros: Nice design, sturdy construction, its small, better user interface than Motorolas, 17 MB memory for storing lots of pics, vids, themes, games, and of course, mp3 ringtones. Useful external screen, the battery last almost a week without charging. I like the file manager, it sorts files by type and gives access to the entire flash memory and the address book is very accesible, displays useful information and it's neatly organized. The external speaker plays mp3s loud and clear enough. The option for taking self portraits with the help of the external LCD is great. And the side lights are a nice add-on to show to your friends (look: shiny lights!!).The Cons: Well, first, I would have given 5 stars to this phone if it came with any type of slot for additional storage (My kingdom for a transflash slot!)... second, both LCD screens are hard to see on a sunny day. It's difficult to open the phone with one hand (something I could do easily with my old V-551). The speakerphone is not so loud when you are in a conversation even if the volume is all the way up. Finally, I have a Motorola HS-820 bluetooth headset that I used with my last phone, but it seems the Z520a doesn't likes this headset. I cannot voice dial and if you make a call using the phone's keypad you have to keep the phone open, or it will hang the call, which is not very pleasant. Maybe its a configuration setting I'm not making but who knows. On the other hand, the wired hands-free that comes with the phone is very nice. It has great sound and you can use it as a one-ear headphone for mp3's since it has better sound than a lot of other cheap headphones.In the overall, I think its a great phone except for those problems I mentioned. I recommend it.
After migrating from former AT&T; Wireless to Cingular with hassles on 12/4/2005, I got the new Sony Ericsson Z520a, which is really beautiful and well-designed, then noticed there were some cut-outs that randomly made a few letters or words "blurred" and not understandable when listening to the Cingular Statements in dealer office. The next morning I tried in my cubicle, where Z520a had 4 signal bars! (My old Nokia only said 1 bar so I had to walk to the window side.) But there always were those annoying cut-outs that made me randomly ask my friends repeat their words. :(  Then tried listening to some computer-generated voice message systems, sometimes "customer" became "chi-stomer", "technology" became "tech-piu-gy", or phone number "1234567890" became "1234-kee-67890", I could't even go through a menu because a few menu items were "pronounced" to be not understandable! That's really unacceptable.Then in the evening of 12/5/2005 I visited the dealer office and showed them the cut-outs. In their office I tried another Z520a, to my surprise, the 2nd one was even worse with much more cut-outs, more than that, it could't even end a call maybe because its software/firmware was hanging somewhere and refused to respond. :(Well, I had to say bye-bye to the beautiful and cute Z520a although it's quad-band. I picked the tri-band Nokia 6102 due to Nokia's solid reception (it says also 3-4 bars in my cubicle) and clear voice quality without any confused voice. The most basic function I need from a cell phone is to call, listen, understand, and talk.
I just got this phone from Cingular yesterday and I absolutely love it! I ordered it as a replacement for my Motorola V551. I especially enjoy the Music DJ and also how the contacts in the phone book are organized.I've noticed that others complain about the side buttons. I have not had the problems others are describing. I have accidentally pressed them a couple of times, especially the camera button, but nothing has happened. In fact, if you just press the camera button, it doesn't do anything. In order to use the camera button, you must press and hold it. The volume button don't seem to get in the way. Of course, my Motorola phone had side buttons as well, so perhaps I'm just use to it.Signal on this phone is great. It stays at full strength in areas where the Motorola V551 would go up and down. Voice quality is excellent. I am able to hear people great and vice versa. The speaker phone is exceptional. I can switch to the speaker phone in the middle of the conversation, and the person I'm talking to hardly notices. It's much better than the speaker phone on the Motorola V551.I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good camera phone with bluetooth capabilities.
I bought 5 of these phones this past week for my family plan. The phone has everything we wanted, quad band, blue tooth and a camera. My biggest problem is the continual inactive smart chip errors that occur. I need to reboot the phone several times a day. Neither Cingular nor Sony knows what is going on. My second problem, which others have noted, is the poor location of the camra button. The software needs to be changed, so that the camera can only work after activation through the menu. (This is an easy firmware fix for Sony, if enough people complain about it. )
I've had this phone for about a week now.  Previously I've had the Audiovox SMT5600 phone which was lost or stolen.  I evaluated my real need from a cellphone and determined I needed:1. Good reliable phone service2. The ability to have complete street addresses listed with contacts3. That the phone can synch up with my computer contacts (Outlook)This phone accomplishes all this and a bit more.  I set up a bluetooth dongle on my computer and synch wireless with my computer.  Both incoming and outgoing voice quality is very good.  I get consistant good reception as I have moved around in Colorado Springs and Denver.  I have been able to easily setup my own MP3 ringtone and setup voice dialing.  The OS is quick and easy to learn and navigation is very user friendly.  Although I would have liked the newest smartphone out (Cingular 2125) I wanted a clamshell design and really found that I don't need all the bells and whistles of a smartphone, plus I didn't have an extra $300.00 laying around to spend on a phone but instead I got the Z520a for free with the rebate.  My only complaint is that by incorporating a Mini SD Memory chip would have been a nice feature to have had.  I recommend that this phone is worth comparing to other phones and depending on your needs and expectations...this phone is worth considering and buying depending on ...your needs and expectations.
Okay, so I purchased 15 of these Sony flip phones for my business and gave them to 15 different workers.  The phone is very nice size with plenty of good features and very good reception.However, after the first week of use EVERY single person complained about the same thing.  There are two side buttons, one for the camera and one for the volume, and these buttons cannot be deactivated!!!  It is nearly impossible to open the phone, or use the phone without hitting these buttons consistently.  It is highly annoying and I must now exchange all of these phones for something else.  My professional employees would not use them because of this.Now, all of you who are stuck with these phones must do their best to get Sony Ericcson to fix this problem.  (...) Do not settle with the bottom level of support, ask for their supervisors, etc.  They admit this problem and say there is no plans to fix it!  Can you believe that Sony would do this?!?!?  Now I ask you, if Sony puts their name on this phone and doesn't catch this in their QC department aren't you skeptical of all of their products???  I am, and opted to buy an HDTV other than Sony.  Do yourself a favor, do not get this phone unless you want to experience this problem....or if you are stuck with this phone lodge your complaint and maybe some engineer will put a fix on their web site.  All we need a downloadable patch to deactivate these two side buttons.  Is this that hard?!?!?!??!?!  After spending 15 hours on the phone with Cingular to get these phones (as anyone who had to migrate from the At&T; side with Cingular will be verbally raped by their service, but this is another story) I now have to return all of these phones and again deal with their dehumanizing support.  Wohhh, is me, and thanks for nothing Sony :(  (...) I tried to pluck the side camera button off with a screwdriver but that did not seem to work :(  Please, someone out there give me a hack to solve this heck of a problem!!!Sincerely,Mr. HIGHLY-ANNOYED
i chose this cute little phone because it had alot of extras BUT this phone just couldn't keep a strong signal. I would be sitting in my living room and the singal strenght would jump all over the place without me even moving around. that was a big pain! Plus the screen is really small, smaller than a normal flip phone. this phone is more for a teenage girl. alot of the wallpaper that comes with the phone is tagreted for someone 14-18.  it's got little cartoons and girly pink themes. so i gave my little cute phone up for the moto back razor which is a better phone all around. it keeps a stong signal in the small town that i live. im glad i gave the sony Z520a up i don't think i could have lived 2yrs with it good grief!
First Review : December 13,2005 I bought this phone for my wife only 2 weeks ago and she is having problems with this Z520a.All of a sudden, this phone locks up. The animated wallpaper will turn into still solid weared screen. After it locks up, it does not ring for incoming calls. She cannot make calls either. The only option is to turn off the phone, but it does not turn back on until she removes the battery which is really a pain.I have contacted Cingular but so far dissapointed with customer service as the person answers the phone takes all the information and then promises a call back. I missed call back and now I am running in circle.Update: 12-19-2005 Finally Cingular sent her a new phone. Let's see how it goes with this new replacement phone.
I chose this phone with my wireless service upgrade and returned it the next day.  Very poor design, weird antenna style, menus hard to navigate, not practical at all.  The phone opens up with an effort and it takes more than 3 seconds to see the screen.  It tends to lock up.
I'm a Cingular customer, and I've just exchanged this for something else.  I'm really bummed out that this phone isn't what it's all cracked up to be.  It's really really cool...but it doesn't work.The first thing you should do if you want this phone is to visit the Cingular forums and read all the posts about this phone - you'll be glad you did.  I thought initially that my problems might only be with my specific phone...looks like my problems are wide spread, and several other users had the same issues:The phone turns itself off unexpectedlyThe screen/wallpaper goes blackYou need to remove and replace the battery sometimes after the unit has crashed/frozen upMISSED CALLS, MISSED CALLS, MISSED CALLSPhone is not ready for prime time.  I'd stay away at all costs.  yes, it's a really neat little phone but for me, I'd rather have something dependable.
Good lightwight phone for less money!!- Good speakerphone (but needs phone open)- Good camera- lightweight- not problems with reception so far- great connectivity with computer via infrared and bluetooth- Smaller as compared to RAZR or z500
Great reception. Works where no previous phones have worked before.Probably because it can use 4 frequency bands.Camera button is poorly located.Battery lasts 4 to 5 days in standby which is excellent.
I loved my T616 for years and was looking forward to the upgrade, but the Z520a is not the phone to get.  The problem is the stupid camera button the left side near the hinge is just to easy to activate (pressed for more than a second) with the phone open or closed.  I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift, but I will be returning it for a RAZR.  At least the RAZR opens much easier and the buttons are on the side of the screen and not the keypad so you don't haved to worry about where your fingers are while opening the phone or during the call.  You also can't change the menu layout on the Z520a so all the Cingular pay services are only one click away ($'s).  The RAZR at least lets you view menu in list form and change the order so useful and free items are first like calendar and contacts.  Like on the S/E W600i, Cingular only gives you useless demo games.  Signing up for a 2yr contact is not good enogh for a free game I guess from Cingular.
This phone has been nothing but trouble since I purchased it. Straight out of the box it looks like a nice enough phone. The major problem for me is in the camera button. It is located on the side of the phone which isn't a problem if it weren't so sensitive.Walking with this phone in your pocket is not an option. If it gets the slightest brush against the camera button, it goes into camera mode. Sometimes it even gets stuck in camera mode where pushing the RETURN TO MENU button just keeps taking more photos. It is extremely annoying having to delete 20 random pictures that your phone took throughout the day.I called Sony-Ericsson support number and they said there was no fix to this problem and no camera lock. This is a HUGE oversight on the part of Sony-Ericsson.In addition, the signal on this phone is sketchy. You cannot seem to lock into a signal and calls end up dropping out. It's really annoying.I am returning the phone tonight and getting something else.This is the worst phone I have ever owned.
The first test that I gave this phone was to take it to work with me to the bakery department in the supermarket, {where I work} and inside the walkin freezer with the door closed, I had no problem getting my voice mail. I called a friend {no problem } who also called me back. Great reception and a great little phone by Sony.Very easy setup, and easy activation by Cingular. The keypad has a great feel to it and it is nicely backlighted in a deep blue color I think this phone is just super . Go for it!
I bought 3 Sony Ericson 520a phones from amazon and had them for 2 days. In 2 days I had enough problems with them that I had to return.I had lot of connectivity problems with the phone...The phone rings and I see the phone number of the caller but I cant talk or hear nothing, only silence on both ends (even though call reamains connected).It happened 5 times in a single day, even though the phone was showing  good signal strength. It was the same with all the phones.The camera button cant be deactivated and it turns on with out your knowledge even when it is in a purse or a pocket or even while you are talking to some one. At one point it shot and stored 15 photos while it was in my pocket. I was hearing faint sound of camera clicking, but i dint realize it was my phones camera.And added to all this there is little flexibility or choice it offers. Not many ring tones, most of the buttons have fixed functions and little room to change or set things to our preference.
I've had this phone since about two months before its market debut. It has been plagued with problems since the beginning. Pictures have dissapeared, the speaker has gone dead, and the phone has randomly shut down. Hopefully these problems were just because i had a pre-production version of this phone, but if not i would not recommend this phone for anyoned.
I got this phone as a early christmas present and lets just say it's the best phone i have ever had! At first i was scared of getting it because of some of the reviews on here, i did not want my to freeze and stuff like some others. But it has been working fine! i get great reception everywhere, and i really like the picture phone quality!
The phone is good but connecting it to the computer is another matter. The software from Sony is too Buggy and their helpdesk is totally helpless. Poor guys its not their fault.Just my 2 cents

It is an excellent phone and it has millions of pros. There is easy accessing to multiple features and it comes with tons of memory. The opportunities with the phone are endless. It also works great with the bluetooth wireless system. There is however one con.... the camera button is located on the side of the phone and many times I have accidently pushed it and it takes a snapshot of something random. Then I must go back and delete it. But besides this everything about the phone is fantastic. Including the ability to change the faceplate to whatever color you want. I always thought that having a NOKIA non-flip phone would be the only way to get cool faceplates, but this phone has changeable faceplates in many colors and designs.
I've had this phone for only two days now, but I have really notice a lot great features about this phone that you do not get from other brands in this price range. Everything advertised about this phone has been true so far.
I have been using this phone for past 20 days. I have no complains to record. It is a small phone loaded with tons of features.
ive only had my phone for 2 days now but i love it. i get great reception with all my friends and the camera is awsome. i would recomend this phone to anyone who wants a cool phone that works great
This Is A Perfect Phone For Anyone Who Wants A Good Camera Phone At A Good Price, It Has A Lot of Options To Customize Your Phone In Any Way ! Add Pictues To Your Contacts, Ringtones ( the two i use the most )And Much More... Buy This Phone And See For Yourself !
This cell phone is on of the coolest things that i could have ever had. I like to text alot so this cell phone was the right one for the job. I think anyone who likes to have fun and enjoy texting should like this phone!!
I am not going to write about options this phone has - that you can read from official Nokia web site, but...This phone is unusual, beautiful, stylish and has a very good reception, works with bluetooth. The only minus I can point is that if you have to dial a lot of phone numbers - that's not the phone for you. It has a rotator and to dial you have to rotate to each and every number. Though if you can program numbers in to the memory and use it from there - that's another thing: you can use bluetooth or infrared or GPRS to transfer numbers from your current phone, it is convenient and fast!I have this phone since it was released in Europe and I still have it as my favorite, I am going to use it as long as it works and Nokia's phones work a looooong time.
This phone is amazingly wonderfull... Best Style in the world.When I want to impress someone, I leave my Sony Ericsson P910 at home (who would imagine that!) and change to my new 7280;The "dial" system amazes everyone (altough it's not something you get used to it easyly...).It's small, it's the most beautifull, it has so many other features... bluetooth, infrared, and more and more...I would like a belt house for it... when I find it, I will give a 5.Sami
My LG c1300 is a really small, clamshell phone with a part that looks like a mirror on top. It includes most basic features including text messaging, multimedia messaging, media mall, and everything you need to download wallpaper, games, ringtones, and applications straight from cingular. It has an awesome battery life, but you can't always trust the battery monitor...sometimes it will display one bar left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call quality has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have bad reception...but that is the network, not the phone. Overall, I love my LG c1300 although now I wish I might have had a cameraphone, but this phone is awesome for all the features and the minimal price involved.
The RAZR is a very durable and reliable phone.  Contrary to other reviews I have dropped my phone several times and it keeps on tickin'!  My wife has the pink RAZR and I have the black RAZR and both of us are extremely pleased.  This is by far the best phone on the market.  It separates itself from all the other plastic and cheap phones.
Normally I'd only rate this phone about a 4/5, because some things (like the internal 5mb of memory) could be alot better. Nonetheless, a couple people have rated the phone really low because of errors on their part! Either way, the phone's amazing. I get ok (40%) reception with it even in the subway system of Toronto, that's good considering it's the first phone to sense any network. It's sleek, sexy, has great battery life and uses USB mini jack for accessories, great for cheap DIY projects (led lights, laser pointers, headphones, chargers, battery packs etc.)If you can get this for a great deal (99 dollars w/ a 3 yr plan from Rogers) then go for the phone, but don't buy it alone, the pricetag just doesn't match the features.
This phone is the perfect union of form and function. It's absolutely tiny, the screens are very clear, the camera works as well as any flashless VGA camera does, and the Bluetooth features are super useful.Some things that make it so cool:- The phonebook and calendar synch wirelessly with the addressbook and calendar on my laptop (a Mac!).- I don't pay to download fancy ringtones; I just transfer MP3s straight to my phone and use them instead.- It's got a mini-USB port for charging, hands-free wired headsets, and wired data transfer (not some proprietary connector like other phones).- It's super light.- It's pink.
This phone is really awesome to look at, but just ok after that.  There are still a lot of glitches in it.  Some of the problems that I've had with it is it being very temperature tempermental and if it is left in a car to charge during the day while I run into a store or if I'm at home, it will not work for about 3 days.  Granted I live in AZ and it can get pretty hot in a locked vehicle.  I found that out the hard way.  There are times that the phone won't ring at all...and a call will go straight to voicemail (I could possibly blame that on Cingulair).  Also, there have been many times where I have plugged it in to charge, and the phone won't register that it's plugged in.  After 10 (overnight) hours of being plugged in to charge the phone will still register as dead battery.  There have also been times when the phone is not plugged in at all...but it will say 'charging battery' on the screen.  Those are not user errors!!!  I do really like the large color screen on the inside.  It does get dirty really easily though.  I am constantly cleaning both the screen and the numbers cause my makeup will rub onto it and it really holds onto fingerprints.  I live the camera feature.  Not the best quality of pictures, but still fun to have as an option.Also...I've dropped this phone several different times.  I really didn't expect it to work anymore after the first fall, especially after reading all the warnings about how fragile it is....but after taking the battery out and putting it back in, it worked just fine.  It's actually a little tougher than it looks.  It looks hot in pink, but I wouldn't buy it again!!
firstly i should point out that i live and work in the UK so am amazed at the price you have to pay for this phone and yes i have taken the exchange rate into account. also i work for europes largest independant mobile phone retailer and so feel i have some valid insights. the company i work for is also the only company to sell the pink v3 in europe. we also supply amazon in europe.granted our networks are further ahed in there sophistication than your own so we get stuff a little quiker than the US and  i understand the phones popularity with it being a quad band phone and therefor its abilty to work across the country.i feel i should set the record straight about the v3. i agree it can make calls and is great at being pink but thats it. it is a poor phone. the camera quality is extremly poor and lack of video capture is a real let down. i have read that motorola are correcting this as part of a software fix that can be added later if your phone requires fixing. which leads me to my next fault. the phone is very unreliable but this is due to the massive volumes motorola is producing. i alsop find motorola's menu infuriating and very unfriendly compared to Nokia or Sony Ericsson which are far easier to pick up.the new version of the phone, the v3i is still not as good as other brands leading handsets such as the incredible sony ericsson w800i, the nokia n70 or the samsung d600. all with 2.0 million pixel camera's, expandable memory and amazing other features. the nearest motorola has come to making the V3 respectable is the new V3X the 3G version.in summary i am amazed at the popularity of this phone in the US as sale's of the phone are driven by its looks alone and not fatures. however if you really love it and want to get something for the man in your life look out for the light blue version that goes on sale this week in the UK and will probably be out soon in the US.
It can break like any other phone. It's thinner & lighter than any other phone. Obviously it won't be able to withstand what a bulkier phone can. If you treat it with care then you'll be fine. If you're not willing to do that, then don't buy the phone.
Drop it once... and its a done for
I give this phone 5 stars...because it is so pretty!  I am a girly girl...so I love that Motorola has made a PINK one.  I dropped in once...and the front screen cracked.  I wasn't being very careful!  I am such a klutz.  I got a case for it so that it is protected in my cute little Louis Vuitton purse.  I really enjoy this phone because it is nice and compact...and has a big screen.  I recommend this phone for all the fashionistas out there.  If you are like the girls from Sex and the City...then this phone is for you.
It's alright. I dropped it the day i bought it and it broke. luckily they gave me another phone for free.
I bought this phone on Feb.'05 for 439 USD on ebay. It came with 1 64MB rsMMC and another 256 MB one.At the beginning, I thought the phone was great, it took to me almost 1 month to choose this phone among other nokia's(6630 and 6670).But the time passed and I discovered the phone had an operative system called Symbias OS, uncovering an unexpected expansion possibility of the phone so that I started downloading hundreds of Symbian applications and 3D games. I have been able to view Word, Excel, Powerpoint, PDF and text documents, e-books, e-news and more after downloading the appropiate apps.The Fun Area is the biggest one on this phone: There are hundreds of 3D-non-sucky- Symbian games, java games, N-GAGE games, NES, SNES and Game Boy games(after installing the emulators).Theres a app called SmartMovie that lets you convert your movies to DivX(MPEG-4) format and play them directly in your phone at full screen,including subs.Of course you can also play and listen to MP3,AAC,WAV and many other audio formats directly on the speaker or with the hands-freeThe Connecticity trhu Bluetooth and USB cable lets you share with other phones virtually all of your media(some times you need to change the file extensions to something non-commercial like .mid to .nid, .sis to .sij, or .jar to .jak, in order for the phone to let you send the file to other phones via BT) comparing to the annoying copyright protections added for free to all Motorolas, Sony-Ericsson and even Samsung'sYou can also download enhancements for the camera: camera games, lens-deforming apps for funnier faces, movie editors, MPEG recorders. The possibilities are endless.The bad part is that Nokia's motto is to leave you wanting more.This phone lacks a couple things I would have loved to have, like:-Internet access via Bluetooth connection with PC(older nokia models like 6600 were able to do this)-EDGE(a High Speed data transfer protocol)-FM Radio-Stereo playback-Push To Talk-Flash for the camera-Secondary VGA camera (for video calling)-WLAN for Wi-Fi Internet Access(the coming soon Nokia N80 will have it)
WOW, from the first time I saw it, I'm fall in love with it!It's Shape (like a leaf) is very very nice! It's fashion shape is very eye catching! Once I buy it, I can see that the application inside is quite good, and I like it's camera and the bluetooth. But, the price is quickly down! Now, it's almost half price than when I bought it last year. Score 9.5
I just updated to the 7610 from my Nokia 3650. Some of the applications were similar, so it didn't take long to get use the new phone. The 7610 seems to have everything that the 3650 had, and  more. For one, instead of a maximum of 9 second video clips, I get a FULL 10 minutes of video. The picture quality is a hell of a lot better to. On the other side, the megapixel does look better then VGA camera, but not as good as a real digital camera. But apart from that, the internet was one of the biggest sellling points for me. Not only does this phone have support for WAP, and xhtml, but also for HTML. You can view web pages on the phone the same way view them on your PC. The only real downside of this, is that Cingular charges $0.03 per kb sent and received. And some pages use up 64kb or more. And just to get unlimited internet use you'd have to pay $25 a month. After paying so much for this phone, one could start to regret having to pay so much just to use it. Another downside of this phone is it's reception and clarity. While the 3650 had decent clarity while calling someone,  this phone lacks that. And the volume of the call is always to quite, but I just turn on the speaker phone. Overall, I'd say this is more thena  decent phone, and it seems that every time I show it off to people they always be impressed.
The phone works well, but there is lacking of intergration with macintosh and palm systems, so if u use one of those, doesn't matter what it says on the isync page that this phone is supported, its not true.  I use isync 2.1, and I keep getting the msg of "this device is not supported", other that that, it rocks
yes (...) and your wondering why i have this phone. no i am not spoiled, it was my mom's old phone that she doesnt' use anymore and decided to give it to me, so anyways lets get down to the review. this phone is great but if you are purchasing this phone for video recording your basically done for becuase the video recording is not good. it is very pixelated blocky and jerky becuase of the low refolutoin settings at only 176 by something, i forgot what it was. if you want a phone for video recording try a docomo handset, becahse phones in japan don't use vga for video recording. they use its megapixel camera. the phone that i also have is the p900iV, has perfect video recording with resolutoin of 320 by 240. much greater quality then this phone, recording at 2 megapixel and the images are not blocky nor jerky and moves smoothly, even when your not. or for higher quality video recording you could try the d901is which offers 4.1 megapixel video recording.if your purchasnig this phone for camera then prepare for high quaity. what i think about nokia phones is that they always lacked colors. this phone has 65,000 colors, so when taking pictures even with a megapixel camera the images are not as colorful as you would want it to be, on the other hand a docomo handset "the new ones" offer a max of 16.7 million colors, and to watch and record live tv from your mobile phone, but these phones cant be purchased or used in america. the camera on the 7610 is not colorful but takes very nice, clear, high quality images, if your buying a phone for good camera go ahead and pick this one.the only bad thing i have to say about this phone is that it has bad quality video recording with a low resolutoin, i mean how could you av out onto teh tv or put it on dvd and watch it like that, and that taking the mmc card is hard, they didnt make a slot to pull it out, they made it under the battery and you bascially have to have nails and yank it out, and include no instructions how to take out the mmc. the first time i spent 4 hours trying to yank it out and it is very inconvident because i have to turn off the phone, take the battery out and yank the memory card out everytime i want to transfer some images to my computer using its memory card reader.
