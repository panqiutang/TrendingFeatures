I tend to be abusive to my cell phones and I must say that this Sanyo 8100 has seen the worst. It has been dropped in the mud, skidded across asphalt parking lots I don't know how many times, been subjected to rain.....you get the idea.  I was at film school when I first purchased it and it is still wokring great 3 years later.  I did buy an additional battiery up front, so they have been swapped on and off as I needed more talk time.  The screen is still bright and clear, I love being able to set ringtones for certain callers, and I won't ever get another phone that doesn't have the photo caller ID on the outside.  This is great because I can just glance at a photo and see who's calling.I have the Sprint Vision plan and while I don't access the internet on a daily basis, it works well when needed.  I like being able to subscribe to the Weather Channal and looking up weather radar when out in the woods.  Gaming is okay for those moments when you're stuck waiting.  My only gripe is that to retrieve SMS messages (called Short Mail) it s a two step process, rather than them just showing up on your screen.All in all, I have been very happy with my Sanyo phone and will likely stick with Sanyo in the future.  And Sprint has been reasonably good to work with.  They have service in remote areas and I rarely have dropped calls which seem to plague my T-Mobile friends.  Just be sure to check the latest plans from time to time.  I've been paying too much for what I get and need to switch.  Just remember they reset your contract when you do so, but that isn't a problem with me because I like their service.A happy Sanyo user.
Excellent Phone - Sprint tried to get me to get a new phone but this one was awesome. I loved that little phone, too bad Sprint was getting too costly for my mobile needs.Great durable phone (i actually have 2 of those)
I've had this phone for three years. It is basic--no frills (other reviews list the features)--but never irritating. What a delight to own one device that fulfills its intended function.My calls don't drop, and the menu navigation is intuitive. The backlighting is excellent--I can always read the screen. Every month or so I drop the phone on concrete, tile, or some other hard surface, with the only result being scars on the casing. I've dropped it in a sink filled with dirty dishwater and, um, down a toilet--soaped it up after the latter adventure and it was a little funny-acting for 12 hours until the battery contacts dried, but then everything was back to normal. Amazing.A year ago I noticed that the hinge action was not as tight as it used to be, so thinking it was on its way out, I was going to upgrade my phone. For silly reasons I missed the upgrade boat when I re-upped my T-Mobile contract. However, the hinge loosening turned out not to be an issue--it hasn't gotten worse. The phone has outlasted three chargers and several friendships. Pretty great for a planned obsolecence product.I gather battery life of newer cell models is generally two hours longer than the e105 (up from 3 to 5), and I bet the memory cards are bigger--I'm a text-message pack-rat and don't get to store as many as I'd like. I never set it to view pic messages--don't even know if it can. These are nominal downsides given how I use it. And, I dunno, I feel sort of attached to it at this point.
This phones is excellent. I got this phone the summer befor I entered higschool and im on my Sophmore year and its still going strong.Pros+//__- Easy side Silencer- I use this as my alram clock for school and at night I just reach over and check the time by holding the side button for several seconds.- Boy you dont know how many times I have droped this phone. The first time it dropped I caught a heart attack. Several months and several scratches later you dont mind. Now I just throw it around for fun... play hot potatoCons+//__- Phone takes a while to load after star up- Aim sometimes hangs during its start up- I really dont understand the picture messenging...- The fact that we cant use vioce mails as ringtones... for polyphonic can suck at times and the ones that come with that are really cheesy, Imagen if "Samba Party" went off on you on the bus.. dude thats not cool.- The flip part of the phone shoud have hinges ore levels before closing ther were times when by accident I closed the phone while I had a call.. there went that call... Like there not much pressure that needs to be forced on the phone befor it closes.It seems like there are more cons than pro.. because I cant think of anymore. But this is a good phone and is definatly a keeper. Enjoy it.
Throughout my ownership of 2 different handsets, both model i730 (t), I would constantly be aggravated by the slow response of the phone. Everything from making phone calls, to sending a text message, to checking the sports scores or weather, is run from a Java program. This means that sending of commands from the buttons to the application is extremely delayed. This delay only gets worse as the day goes on, and I am usually forced to restart the phone 2 or 3 times a day.The phone constantly freezes when I am writing a text message or email, and the only way to fix this is to pull the battery out. I have tried all of the master reset and browser restart processes, and I have even had my SIM card changed out from Nextel. Still I have trouble just switching between two calls, because of the delay of the buttons.At least 3 times a day, a call is mysteriously canceled by my phone. Normally when a call is dropped I will get a randomly generated error message, i.e. A56 try again, C885 call failed, R23 Service unavailable. However, on the mysterious canceled calls, my phone just returns to the status screen as if I had terminated the call. This happens with calls to other Nextel customers, many other cellular carriers, and land line calls. The phone does not lose service, as I have watched the service status remain constant at 3/5 bars when a call is canceled by the phone.There are 3 different types of i730 handset, which can be seen on [...] The t model that I have does not have any available updates for the firmware or software of the phone. The software my phone is running is dated back in January of 2002. So there have been no updates or improvements for the phone from the first day they manufactured it.The problems I have had with this phone occur indoors and outdoors, with full signal or less than half signal. There is no geographical constant, as I have had every one of these problems at home, at work, at friends houses, or on the road. Other users I know on the Nextel network chose this phone and have had similar problems with dropped calls and the phone freezing when using the web utilities.The only good feature about this phone is I can plug it into my computer and create my own ring tones from any audio file I have. Other than that, it is just a constant disappointment. Enough so that I will not use a Motorola device or Nextel/Sprint service again.
I have had the i730 for over three years and could not be more pleased with it.  I am constantly dropping the phone onto the pavement when I get out of the car because it's in my lap.  What a sturdy phone!  A few dents but it doesn't crack and break like the plastic phones!
LISTEN, I HAVE THE I530 THE BLACK AND GOLD PHONE AFTER TRYING THE I730 IM NOW SELLING MY I530. I LIKE BOTH PHONES BUT THE I730 COMES WITH MORE FEATURES! ITS LIKE COMPARING A JAG TO A BENZ WHICH I HAD BENZ IS MORE STATUS JAG IS MORE FOR SHOW. SAME WITH THE I730. WENT IN THE STORE AT 5:30 CAME OUT AT 7:30 WITH THE I730. THIS IS A NO BRAINER.
I'm not sure if this phone will ever be available again as it is a bit dated - I've had mine for almost 2 years - but I had to write this after the experience I had this past weekend.Before leaving for a weekend out of town, I lost this phone.  I was in a hurry to leave, so I left without it.When I got home on Sunday, I searched the last place I'd had the phone - a soccer field on Thursday.  Amazingly, the phone was still there, lying on the wet ground. It had rained over the weekend and the phone was dead and very wet.  Well, after drying the phone out and charging it up, it now works fine!  Three days of rain, mud, and cold did not effect it at all. This phone is pretty much indestructible.  I guess it will be awhile before I get a new camera phone.
I've had this phone for over a year and a half and I've really never had a problem with it.  The reception varies but it's generally pretty reliable.  My whole family uses it for work because of the walkie-talkie feature.I personally don't like the phone because I'm not a fan of the walkie-talkie feature (I think it's obnoxious most of the time) and it's simply a pretty big phone, like a lot of Nextel phones.It's a good phone and well-priced, but for me some things about it are really inconvenient.
I had the Nextel i730 for 8 months then i just couldnt take it anymore. To be honest the phone is a easy phone to get attached to. But recently i upgrade to the i850 and iam very very happy i did. The i730 is a phone / radio. The color screen is on par with all other free phones that are usually FREE. So basicly the screen is not impressive at all. The phone comes with features, but to be honest it took me about 2 months to figure out how to use all of them on,( NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL) and by that time i had lost faith in the phone itself. It's heavy, very heavy, and thick. On the good side, it' sorta stylish and its very durable, this is what i loved about it. I dropped the phone so many times and it has very little exterior damage. I look at this phone like, a army tank, versus my newer i850 which i just upgraded to, and thats more like a convertable BMW. The i850 is a phone that you just have to have a leather case on it, because it looks so good, that you dont wanna risk it gettings scratched, this on the other hand, there's no need to case it, because the exterior is that solid. I'm a 23 year old male out of atlanta ga. As far as reception, the calls on the i730 are very clear, the speaker phone is awesome, you can almost set the phone in one room and talk at a leisure tone on the other side of the room and the caller will hear you fine, which is cool. But to be honest i can only say this phone would fit someone who is not looking for alot bells and whistles, Not a person between the ages of 16-21, bad idea. This phone is for people who want a phone that can handle just about anything, ie construction worker. Another good thing about this phone is it'is nearly impossible to lose, due to its weight. When you have the i730 on the hip swivle thing, it feels like you've got a gun on ur hip, or a flash light, its that heavy. Plus with it being 2006 and all, this phone is getting very dated, by the end of the year this phone is going to be classified as a dinosaur. If you can get it for free, go for it, but if your paying money, trust me, dish out a few extra bucks and go with the i850, the i850 is the honest to god best cell phone ive ever owned, and ive had 15+ cells.
This is a great phone.  The battery life is pretty good, mine always has excellent reception, and the call quality usually mimics that of a land-line.  I love the color screen and the external display.  I've never had a problem with this phone and have owned it for years.  It's pretty sturdy as well.  I would definitely recommend this phone to any Nextel user.
I am so disappointed with this phone.  I fought hard to convince my wife I needed this more expensive model so that I could get the speaker version for work calls, while she got a plain vanilla model (Nokia I think).  Well, the speaker phone works ok, but little did I realize until the warranty wore off is the volume of the regular press-to-ear mode fades terribly.  If you are not in the quietest environments, don't expect to hear anyone.  It's very embarrassing to call someone while driving and have to tell them you cannot talk because you can't hear them over your car (I have an '02 Subaru, so it's not exactly a monster truck show SUNDAY-SUNDAY-SUNDAY level of volume).  Cingular wouldn't do anything for me.  I had even bought the insurance for it and asked if I could get the much cheaper, plain vanilla model my wife has.  Absolutely not, have to get the same model phone (a refurbished one).  But Ms. Cingular representative, this other phone is much cheaper and you can actually hear = SORRY, HAS TO BE EXACT SAME PHONE.  Argh!
The buttons on the side frequently sounds when some object touchs them in pocket. It is hard to open the flipper and loose many calls by not being able to open it on time. Too heavy!!!
I got this phone off of Ebay and had really poor reception with the normal antenna - so I bought a booster and that has helped tremendously.  Some of the menus are kind of annoying because you need to press what seems like hundreds of buttons to get where you want.  I guess I'm being nit-picky...overall I am pleased with it but I am excited to upgrade this spring.
I bought this phone for speakerphone and it was free (in 2004). The quality of speakerphone is satisfactory (definately better than sanyo)The battery life is very very low. It may be about one call of 40 minutes. It also doesn't give few minutes before one can notice that battery is draining because it draines within 5-8 mins once you notice 4 bars (max is 5 bars)Camera is totaly worthless as it has very blurry/grainy picture.The phone also works very slowly.In case if it's on eg. if you hit menu button by mistake it will stay on untill you exit after hours. There is no settings that can change this property and it ultimately drains batery even more quickly. And the same thing is bothersome as if you turn the alarm on but the phone turns on then the alarm will not work!!!!!!In short I would never buy a NOKIA again.
I've had this phone for about a year and I haven't had the slightest of problems with it.  I've just read several reviews about it and I was shocked to see that a couple people said they couldn't hear during their conversations.  For me it's quite the opposite.The ear volume is very high and the speakerphone is almost deafening.  Also the durability of this phone is terrific, so far anyway.  I've made a habit of dropping this phone on the concrete after getting out of the car with it on my lap, but no problems at all so far.This is a great phone in my experiences, great features, speakerphone, easy internet use, downloading, and great reception. The only downside I see in this phone is Sprint's "taxes, surcharges, and fees," which can add up pretty fast(I have no idea how), but I think every phone company finds extra ways to charge you.  As far as the phone goes, Excellent!
I purchased my Sanyo 8200, and Qwest service, 13 months ago.  Over the last few weeks I've experienced these SAME issues others mention here (I came online to find a replacement phone and then I began reading the reviews).  How it never keeps a charge, the beeping when the charging pin is in as if it is being plugged and unplugged, starting a call with a "full" batterly then the phone dieing after 20 minutes because the battery is dead.  I was baffled and called for service, and they said perhaps it was exposed to humidity (I live in the desert) or perhaps I carried it too close to my body and it was exposed to  moisture (huh?).My warranty was up 3 weeks before I called, so they wont replace it, I have to buy another at retail.  I had my last phone, a Kyocera, for over 5 years and NEVER had a problem.For such an expensive phone, you would think it could last more than a year.A big thumbs down.
The Sanyo 8200 has multiple known issues. Including extraordinarily poor sound quality, charging issues, and hinge breakage.I bought two for my wife and I nine months ago (from Sprint). The hinge broke on my wifes phone after about 5 months and she had it replaced at an independant cell dealer. Then she started having the infamous charging problem and took the phone into Sprint to have it checked out. When the tech flipped the phone open, the hinge broke AGAIN. This should have been great evidence for a warranty replacement right? Wrong. The tech still refused to repair the phone and apologized for breaking it. for the charging problen, he said the 8200 has defective connections for the round charger receptacle and suggested buying a flat type charger, which she did. This has apparently addressed the charging issue.In the last week or so now my phone is not working. At first the "Back" button didn't work. The next day none of the buttons on the right side of the phone worked. Now NONE of the buttons work.This phone has serious quality issues that Sprint refuses to address or even officially acknowledge.Sprint does have great calling plans with the free roaming, even on other networks (you have to sign up for it), I just have a major problem with the Sanyo phones and repair customer service.These are our 6th and 7th phones and while these are the first flip phones for us, we have NEVER had a phone break before.
I have had this phone for about 9 months.  I never really had any problems with the phone such as reception or battery life.  Actually, I was sort of surprised at how long I could go without charging.  Speakerphone always sounded clear on my end, but occasionally the other person was unable to hear me clearly.  The camera is fairly easy to use.  My problems with the phone have just recently begun.  The first thing to happen was that the END button stopped working completely and I could not end calls, a big problem when you weren't planning to leave a voicemail!  The only other option was to close the phone to end calls.  Shortly after that, the phone couldn't recognize it was closed.  It thought it was always OPEN!  I couldn't see who was calling from the external screen and at times, the phone would answer itself.  More recently, my TALK button has been shorting out, as well as the OK button.  Sprint is willing to offer a replacement phone for $35 or a new keypad for about the same.  I am stuck with this phone until I'm eligible for a free phone or I can switch carriers altogether.  Choose wisely!
I have had this phone for almost a year now, and although the signal reception is great, the sound quality on this phone is HORRIBLE!  I have to ask the person calling me to repeat themselves at least once every call because the voice quality is so muddy.  My wife has a different (and cheaper) phone and it sounds MUCH better.  The only reason I have put up with it this long is I do not use my phone very often.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone.  This phone sounds worse than any other phone I have owned.  Stay away from this phone!!!
Well, I was very happy with the phone when i first bought in about a year back. Not anymore.. I bought 2 of these for myself and another for my family. I even recommended this phone to a couple of my friends, but now everyone of us face the same issues. But neither Sprint or Sanyo wants to acknowledge that there is a problem with the phone.- the pin type charger does not work - the battery charge indicator is one BIG lie - just after 2 minutes the battery indicators shows full charge but in about 5 mins the LOW battery alert is up.Whenever i try to charge, i hear beeps as if i am plugging and unpluging the charger.. But the phone does not charge(although the battery indicator shows full charge).
Had this phone a little over a year, same problem as everyone else. Won't charge. Shows charged, but then make one call and it is dead.
I have had my 8200 for a little more than a year, and generally I liked it, but after owning it for about 6 months, I started having problems keeping it charged.  The charge wouldn't hold at all, and the phone would say the charging was complete when it couldn't even power up.  I went to Sprint for help, but after three hours of diagnostic testing, the store manager gave it back to me and said there was nothing wrong with it!  She said I was to go buy a ANOTHER charger (to the tune of $50) and that would solve the problem.  It did for a while, but after another couple of months it is happening again.  I will be heading to the Sprint store this morning on the off chance that they will care.  I went last night, but I discovered when I got there that they now close at 6:00 pm instead of 8:00 pm.  Thanks for the  @*%#$!+ support, Sprint!
I bought 2 of these phones over a year ago at CostcoSame problem as everyone else.It won't hold a charge and the pin charger won't make a good connection!!  And suprise suprise the problems started at the same exact time!I haven't even called Sprint yet and now I am completely discouraged after reading a few reviews here.It sounds like we are all stuck with these lame phones that obviously all have the same problem with charging.
When my wife and I first got the phones on a promotional deal that sprint was offering I was very impressed.  The phone looked good, was very easy to use and had a wide variety of functions.  Due to all this I was willing to overlook the fact that sometimes it was a little hard to hear people you were talking to and that the battery got really hot when you were talking.Everything was going great for about the first year, then my wife calls me at work telling me that her phone was acting funny.  She tells me that its like her phone is automaticaly unplugging itself at the rate of about a billion times a second.  I thought that was wierd so we went down to Sprint.  They told us it was a common problem and that all we had to do was buy a flat charger.  In my quiet subtle manor (yeah right) i persuaded the guy behind the desk trade us the charger that didn't work for one that would.  He agreed.  That solved all the problems for a while until mine started doing the same thing.  Since I didn't think the guy at the Sprint store would be pleased to see me again my wife and I have just been sharing a charger.  After the case on my wifes phone cracked after a fall onto linolium from about three feet she finally had enough and went and bought a new phone.  I'm hanging in there with mine just to see how far I can milk life out of it.  So far the End and Back button have stopped working, it wont charge (even though it will tell you its full after only being on he charger for a second) the antenna wont extend anymore, it usually sends text messages three or four times in a row, to the joy of anyone receiving a text from me, the camera has stopped working, and the paint is coming off in many places.Ive had the phone 14 months.
I've had this phone for just a little over a year.  First problem i've had was the charger input going bad on the phone.  I took it to the sprint store and the manager told me this was a known "defect" with this phone.. so why are they still selling it?? so they replaced my charger with the different style.. great.. but that didn't help that fact that I had a 30 dollar car charger that was now useless that they wouldn't replace2nd issue, which has just gotten worse as of today. the hinge is almost completely broke, its now broke on both sides. therefore my phone thinks its open when its not allowing my backlight to come on and draining my battery, furthermore.. when it is open, it goes back way to far and makes it uncomfortable to use.. now.. i've read a bunch of other reviews on the internet about other people having the same problem with this phone. but not only that, my coworker had the same phone and had to replace his due  to the fact that his was so bad his phone thought it was always open, also one of my best friends who lives on the other side of the country and HIS friend have the SAME problem.. there is something wrong with the design and sanyo should be replacing these.. DONT BUY THIS PHONE. what a waste of money!!!!
I've had my phone for a little over a year.  It gradually stopped taking charge from the pin charger that came with the phone, and would say it was full when the battery was completely empty!  It would beep to charge and then uncharge and at first it was ok, but it got so bad that it stopped charging at all!  I also have problems with redialing and calls being forwarded straight to voicemail and way too many lost calls.  The phone gets hot when talking on it for more than 20 minutes and it takes 2 minutes to open text messages and another few minutes to send them.  Half the time my friends don't even get the text messages I send, esp. if it is a reply message!  I have been to the Sprint Store only to be told that the phone is not defective if the other charging port works!  They tried to sell me the other type of charger, instead of using insurance exchange program...  Very disappointed with phone and service!!!
At first this was my dads phone till he got the treo650How got this phone is my old one was stoling I had a vi2300 it was okeyBut den I got this phone and I dient even miss my old one and the call r perfect speaker and normalI have camara so I can see my friends picheres when they call and I have over 1200 ringtones and I use one 4 each friendGET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My battery will not hold more than one bar(if lucky) unless I spend half my day plugging and fiddling with wire.  Problem onset was at about 13th month.  Now i need a new phone but would rather remedy the issue if possible.  I'll keep looking but man its easy to tell which are Sprint reps and which are phone users.
I recently bought an unlocked version of this phone off eBay to replace a Moto Razr phone and an older Palm PDA.  It was a pain lugging both of them around and I wanted a device that had both a PDA and phone in one plus e-mail and web browsing capabilities like a Blackberry.  A tall order but this phone nearly pulls it off.Palm users will have no trouble using the familiar PalmOS apps that we've all come to know and love such as Calendar, To-Do List, and Memo Pad.  The 4-way navigation button makes it faster and easier to navigate than using the touchscreen although I do find myself whipping out the stylus every now and then.  There is no graffiti input on this PDA instead you must use either the qwerty keyboard or touchscreen which have their own inherent difficulties.  The tiny keyboard buttons are hard to press and often results in typos.  Its slower than using the touchscreen keyboard and definately not ideal for writing long e-mails and such.  The touchscreen on this phone is not as forgiving as the one on my old Handspring Visor.  You have to be extremely gentle when weilding the stylus because even a small amount of pressure can cause yellow spots to form on the LCD screen.  I use the touchscreen occassionally with great care and with a protective cover on the screen and yet I still got a faint yellow spot on the LCD within days.  For me this is the most dissappointing thing about this phone.As a phone the Treo 600's performance is mediocre to average at best.  It gets horrible reception indoors.  People often complain about static when I'm inside buildings.  Poor reception is also accompanied by a loud, annoying buzzing noise that both people on the line can hear.  I looked it up on the web and discovered through  user reviews that this was an all-too-common problem amongst many Treo 600 users.  When it does get good reception, however, the call quality is superb even better than my Moto Razr.  The speakerphone is nice and loud although it can be hissy sometimes.But my favorite feature by far is the ability to send and receive e-mail.  Using the Snappermail app (the built-in mail app isn't very good), I can seamlessly link up to my Gmail account and use push e-mail just like on a Blackberry.  Plus, its a lot cheaper to use T-zones for e-mail and Internet access on a Treo than the Internet/E-mail plans offered by T-mobile for Blackberrys.All in all, this is a phone I can live with for the time being although I am ever so-concerned about the LCD screen going bad with use.  The fragile screen, hard to use keypad, and subpar phone are the only real drawbacks of this phone but they are serious enough that anyone thinking of getting this phone should give it a good, hard second look.  I've heard the Treo 650 has fixed some of these problems and if that's true I would definately consider it over the 600.  I do plan to upgrade to another smartphone in a few months when my contract expires such as T-Mobile MDA or Treo 650.
This was the second Treo 600 that I got from Amazon.com three weeks later some fonctions on the keyboard stop working. When I contacted Palm they told the warranty does not cover keyboard failure then I called T-mobile who advised me to backup the data and do a hard reset. Still didn't work. I called back on satuday 02/04/2006, Palm told me that I have to send them the unit for repaire or pay $25 to get a "premium exchange option" and that I would get the unit in 2 to 3 business day. I called back on the following Wednesday palm said to wait untill Friday.Called On Friday they said that it could be shipped on Monday. I asked to be refunded my $25 because they lied on the terms, the operator said that she could not.
I had such faith in this phone when I first bought it.  Now that I am 7 treo phones later and it only being a year and a half....I have to say that this is the worst high end purchase I have ever gotten.  In the beginning all of the reviews were wonderful from consumer reports and gadget blogs and electronic magazine reviews.  However none of these publications seems to have let consumers know the truth about the horrible quality of these phones.  As a pda they function fairly well but as a phone...the signal is always dropping (that is if there is a signal). Friends and family claim it is hard to hear what I was saying when using the phone and that it sounded like  I was in a tunnel. Hearing what other people were saying was difficult.  i would have to go outside to try to get a better signal just to hear what was being said.  I purchased my phone through Amazon to use with Sprint.  I invested in the monthly warranty to replace the phone.  This seemed like a good plan until I realized that they were replacing my phone with refurbished phones that had the same problems as the handset that I had just given them.  When my final sixth phone was replaced by Sprint I made a call to a friend from the parking lot to ensure that it worked before I left the store (I had learned by this point).  Five minutes later yelling into the phone and trying to call back 3 times with no success (and no...the mute was not on).  Realizing that I had yet another dud on my hands I went back into the Sprint store to take out the poor 16 year old clerk that had the misfortune of replacing my handset five minutes prior.  Apparently he had a panicked look on his face since he was waiting on customers who had just decided to get...you got it, a Treo 600.  Well he quickly summoned his manager who decided to give me a brand-new never been opened treo 650 free.  So yes I did get an upgrade free for all of my trouble.  It is not much better than the treo 600.  The signal is weak and it is hard to hear on both ends and when on vibrate mode the calls get sent straight to voicemail.  Convenient for emergencies I would say.  I live in Arizona but I sure do wish that I lived in California since there is currently a class-action suit against palm-one and the various cell phone carriers of the treo 600 and 650 for the poor quality of the product and replacing handsets with equally poor treos.  At this point since the treo 700 just was released, it probably is not on the class action suit.  However the treo 700 does run on a  windows operating system which will make your palm os software from your treo 600/650 obsolete. It will also make it morevulnerable to viruses and lets not forget that little trick of being able to erase a bluetooth devices address book when someone has bluetooth enabled, Also there is the ability to tap into peoples' conversations that they are having with their wireless blue-tooth headset.  (not that I do it but I'm sure that some people are actually enjoying rush hour much more due to this security flaw).  Overall I would say that palm-one as a company has gone downhill in terms of quailty and customer service and that both the treo 600 and 650 are phones that I would not waste your time or money on.
I've been a Palm fanatic for over 10 years.  I've always been an early adopter and bought the latest gadget when it first came out.  I agree with many of these reviewers that the Treo 600 was a breakthrough product and has great functionality, etc.  But it is completely unreliable.  I'm currently on my 3rd 600.  Each one died a hideous death after about 6 months.  First the normal phone speaker died.  So Handspring replaced it for free.  Six months later the monster buzzing in my ear made using the phone impossible (in addition it had a nasty problem of doing a hard reset all on its own about once a week - often when I was traveling.)  So again handspring replaced it.  About 4 months into my 3rd device the monster screeching buzzing returned.  This time when I called for a new one I was informed by Palm that, "We don't replace phones for free any more.  It will cost you $200 to get a replacement."  So basically Palm's business model is:  we sell you a product that consistenly doesn't work and then we demand that you pay us as much to replace it (with another one that doesn't work) as you would have to spend to get a blackberry.  It's unbelieveable.  So I thought I'd suck it up and buy the 650 (even though two different friends bought it and both had already swapped it out for the same unreliability).  But Palm told me to get a 650 would cost me $700 !  I said, "Wait a minute, Handspring used to give me the new phone each time at a discount if I'd send my old one back."  But I was informed that Palm doesn't reward loyalty in any way anymore.  What a joke.So I wrote a letter to the CEO of Palm to complain.  That was 5 months ago.  No response or acknowledgement.  What a disappointing company  - in every aspect of it.I now use a Motorola Razor.  Palm is a joke.  No serious business person can rely on the Palm products or the company any more.  Shame.
Great concept, I've had a palm pda since the first palm pilot personal then professional then a 7 and then the i version for internet with palm.net.  I love the palm apps calendar and contacts, but this phone that cost $500 started to give me problems right after the year warranty time period.  (which just so happened to coinside with the Katrina catastrophe when our phones weren't working anyway due to service problems).  The problem still continues with the same as the other reviewer mentions with this loud buzzing on the receiver side of the phone call.  It's terrible and not usable this way.  I'm afraid to send it for repair based on what another reviewer said that he got a refurbised model that was in worse shape than his and then after a few months had serious problems.  The repaired phones are only warranted for 90 days, not long enough for these problems to show up.  Palm should be ashamed of themselves for not providing better support for such expensive phones!!!  I bought mine unlocked directly from Palm as well.
This phone works everywhere in the world,  (anywhere there is GSM service)  Being unlocked, you can use local Simm cards in each country, or purchase an international simm card.  The Simm card slot is very easily accessible, too (no need to pull out batteries, ect.)  The Palm pilot is great, and very useful for travelers with many currency conversion, language softwares available for it.  Texting from a Treo is way easier than typical mobile phones, because you have a full keyboard.  International SMS (text) messages are typically very affordable, too, and a great way to keep in touch while abroad without spending alot on airtime..i highly recommend this treo for overseas travellers.  If you're staying in the states, this phone will work well with Cingular or T mobile too.Price is reasonable because the the treo 650 and 700 are now out.  the 650 adds bluetooth, and a removable battery.  the 700 uses microsoft software instead of palm software.  (i am a huge fan of the palm software for organizing my life..)But unlocked versions of these newer models are at least $200-300 more in price, and the 600 works great.  Battery life is fine because its a GSM phone.
I have to start with by saying that I am indeed a very happy user of T600 for almost two years. IIts user friendliness and sheer wealth of applications and uses still keeps me excited.  The device can be used for phone calls, calendars, web browsing, email, IM (ICQ, AOL, etc .. ),  internet radio stations, document editing, games, modem for the laptop... and that is just the beginning.So why only two stars?? and why poor execution?  Very poor voice call quality, reported by many and totally unacceptable!!!  Luckily for me and some others; one of the internet enthusiast came up with the solution -- open up the unit and isolating the mic wire with the foil.  It worked, but it should never had to be necessary.Also screens are week.  Drop on the hard service will break it.  Luckily for
I've owned my Treo 600, bought via Amazon, for about 4 months now and I am really enjoying it. I had previously owned an old Palm V, and then an HP Jornada, but found, lacking a utility belt, carrying a PDA in addition to a cell phone annoying to the point that I eventually abandoned PDA use. The Treo has brought me back.As a writer, I've been able to work on manuscripts (via QuickOffice) any time, any place (indeed, I probably did 25% of the editing for my latest novel on my Treo) which in invaluable. The phone functions clearly, and the camera lets me take photos (albeit low-res) on the go, which is handy to capture family moments and work diagrams equally well.With the free CoreMedia player, DVD/AVI conversion software, and a 1G card, I've even been able to take my favorite movies with me on the go, and watch martial arts instructionals any time.Only downsides are the lack of higher screen resolution and the inability to preserve data when fully discharged. I understand these are both fixed on the Treo 650, so perhaps I'll look into upgrading in a year or two.Definately my favorite gadget to date!
Picture quality sucks for the price. Colors are way freaky. The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. Viewing pictures on this is terrible. Keyboard is ackward at first. The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$.
I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now????
The price is high considering that there are newer models.
The Treo600 has all the functions I needed -- phone, calendar, camera, etc.  Two shortcomings:1) the screen is not good for viewing pictures, but that's what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo6502) the phone failed to dial two times in two months.  I had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem.
Hi,Before buying this phone from Amazon, I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new. I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the T-Mobile network.I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase. I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support, they asked me to read out my serial number. It starts with a HAGA which, they indicate, means that it has to be on the AT&T; Wireless Network. According to them, I am in violation of the warranty since I am using it on the T-Mobile network. How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase? If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone, obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network.Palm is taking the easy way out - they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon. Amazon, itself, does not provide any warranty.If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions - please let me know.Thanks
I've used the treo 270 (flip up top) and the treo 600. I really like the 600 with all the palm features and programs that can be downloaded to the phone.With the 270, the flip up top broke off when it dropped from the kitchen counter to the floor. And now my 600 dropped from my hand to the floor(about 3 feet)and won't work any more. For such an expensive phone, it should be manufactured to be more durable.
Guys,Do not take this sheet piece for GOD sake. I am repenting on it :( please take my advice. Thanks.
It's a very nice phone!!!!!!!
I don't need my cell phone to take pictures, play music, access the internet, or do my taxes for me. I just want it to work. I just want to be able to hear the person I'm talking to and function as a phone. That's it. This phone fails even that basic test. Stay away from it. It will turn your hair gray.
I would not even give this phone to my 4 year old.  My daughter was recently hospitalized out of town, and for convenience sake I had to use my cell phone instead of long distance.  I moved around, went outside (under a clear sky) and had absolutly horrible reception.  The entire time you are on the phone with someone, you expect them to disappear, because his phone is terrible.  Pick something else.
This is a good phone for someone starting out with PDA Phones. There are not of upgrades or new programs that you can get for it.
I have really tried with this phone, I honestly have, but it's become a lost cause with time. Sure Windows Mobile is uber cool and tons of fun to use, let alone the ease, but the MPx200 fails at the one thing that is supposed to do best, being a phone. I purchased this phone unlocked on eBay in June '05 for about $117 with shipping. I also bought a 1.0 GB SD card for $60 around the same time ready to load it up and enjoy my new Windows Mobile phone. I was shocked at how much better the phone looked in person. It's seriously the most beautiful layout I've ever seen. The black and blue layout are simply beautiful. Many of my friends and coworkers thought it was a Nextel. It sure is as durable as a Nextel. There is no way in hell this phone could break. You can drop it from a 50 story building and it would probably just have a scratch. It's amazing the build quality that Motorola put into this phone, but it goes downhill when discussing the phone as a functional device. As a phone, it falls very short, especially in the area of battery life. When I initially received the phone, I only charged it for 12 hours due to overexcitment, so I blame myself for not getting through the day without having to charge the phone, but after I bought my second battery and charged it the full term, I was surprised when the battery life didn't improve much. Granted this is just using the phone as a phone, with the Infrared "Beam" feature turned off and all the other features either off or at the bare minimum, such as the backlight. I honestly believe that I got much better battery life using the phone as a Video iPod than as a phone. The battery sipped away during use of Windows Media Player, with excellent sound quality I might add. On a normal phone call, I got an hour tops, before the battery was on its last bar, far short of the rated 4.25 hours. Standby time is barely 24 hours. Good luck trying to use call waiting, sometimes the phone just freezes up. This is where the 200 MHz processor is shows its colors. Sometimes when the phone rings, you can hear the delay and the processor loading the rest of the ringtone. Call quality was flawless, has always been, seeing that I'm with T-Mobile. No complaints there. I even got the T-Zones to work on my phone, after doing some research online and locating the settings. This isn't for the tech juvenile. It can be tedious if you're not patient. I really love my phone, but it is just not practical. The other day I left my phone to charge seeing that the battery was on the last bar. When I woke up the phone was dead on the charger. This has happened to me a lot in the past few weeks, and I only charge my phone when the battery is completely dead so I don't know what's going on. I got so fed up with it that I took out the SIM card and put it back in my Motorola V60, which is in my opinion one of the best phones made, period. I just ordered another V60 seeing that I broke the antenna off the other one. It's so sad that all these new phones have all the bells and whistles you could ever want but don't carry out their primary function. I feel bad for the people who bought this phone through AT&T;/Cingular because the phone was dual band for them and Cingular runs on the 850/1900 frequency. My version was the triband 900/1800/1900, and worked fine with T-Mobile. I will still use it as my entertainment seeing that it synced with Windows Media Player on the PC flawlessly and the quality is great. I have compressed loads of videos to WMV format and enjoy them on a regular basis on my phone, but I will keep my V60 in my other pocket when the battery on my MPx200 dies.
The phone is a basic stripped cell. Great screen color and easy usability. The coverage was not as good as my husband's nokia (cingular) or his nextel. I felt like I was deaf. since i couldn't hear unless I was in complete silence. A fine generic phone withh average features.
This is an okay phone if you don't want a fancy flip phone or you have never had a cell phone. It is easy to use, compact and light. There is a dark side to all this. The phone is fragile. It doesn't take to being dropped very well. The ringtones are stupid and not very loud. If you would like to download ringtones that can run you from $2.49 to $2.99. At T-Mobile I can get them for a dollar less. The reception for Cingular is truly pathetic. I couldn't get reception anywhere and that bothered me. I was dropping calls all the time.
this cell phone is the very  best I have ever used,  It is easy to operate and the screen is very easy to see.  The battery life is unreal I usually do not have to recharge it but every 2 or 3 days.  It holds a charge very well.  I would recommend this cell phone to anyone.
I have had this phone for 11 months and it was my first cell phone purchase. Now I am renewing my contract and upgrading my phone. I would not be upgrading my phone if it wasn't for the simple fact that:My Samsung E317 does NOT have speakerphone!It is one feature that this phone does not have that would be the most useful for multitasking while conversating.Everything you ever need to know about the phone is listed in above reiews and the product description. I just wanted to point out the fact that there is no speakerphone as I didn't pay attention to that fact until I realized I needed it. I have purchased a Nokia 6102 for the speakerphone and reception quality well known for Nokia phones (as I was told by a Cingular representative).Quick note: I believe that Cingular is the best service, just based on personal experience. Never dropped a call. =)
This was my first cell phone...and I love it! It's a very cute and compact cell phone! I also love the mini display in the front. I have gotten 3 new cell phones, and all of them have been this one. I just love it!!
Buying this card from Amazon is not a bad option, but there are better ones.  Phoneshark.com sells the $100 t-mobile card for $97.50 (without any taxes) and it is delivered instantly via email.  Also, cheapphonecards.com sells the card for $97.00 and if you use the code "refill5" you get an extra five dollars off, which makes the total cost $92.00 (also without any taxes)...this is also delivered instantly via email.
I was leery of purchasing this card due to the review that claimed it expires in 90 days.  I verified it via Amazon.com before making my purchase of it, and made the purchase.  When the card arrived (only 3 days to arrive), it stated on it minutes expire in 90 days.  I telephoned T-Mobile To Go before activating the card, and confirmed that with any existing minutes on the phone before activating this card, the existing minutes roll over with the new 1000 minutes for the card, and don't expire for one year.  Another positive on this card is that once you exceed $100.00 minutes purchase, you become a premier status, and your calls are reduced from 25 cents per minute to 10 cents per minute.  I'm thrilled with this card now that I know the facts about it.  I was told by the T-Mobile rep that the 90 day reference on the card is for those who have no existing time on their phone, and also to prompt the customer to activate the card in a timely manner.  I hope this clears it up for other prospective buyers.  I'm new to cell phone useage, and only got one for emergency or urgent situation use.
T-Mobile has different coverages for post-paid and prepaid services.  You need to check out the "prepaid coverage" map on the t-mobile website to be sure you will have the coverage for your toGo service.  Strangely, in much of Madison, WI, where t-mobile has no coverage for prepaid service, the incoming calls can go through, as well as text messaging (both in and out).
I've used this for over a year, with no problems. 1000 minutes which don't expire for a year, and roll over if you renew. No other company comes close to such a fantastic deal. One caveat: make sure that you renew one day before the annual expiration date, or you lose the rollover minutes.
I like the T-Mobile prepaid plan and this card provides the best value. I have previously purchased this product from Amazon.com and used it immediately. However, my last purchased card took about 10 days to become valid with T-Mobile. Bottom line: Don't buy from Amazon if you need to recharge immediately. You can call T-Mobile and recharge with your credit card. However, if you can wait, Amazon.com provides good value for me in CA - I save the sales tax.
This is an excellent deal for pre-paid phone service.  It's equivalent to about 1000 minutes (I actually got more.  You'll have to ask a T-mobile rep to explain that.) The minutes are good for a year, and by purchasing $100 worth of minutes you are enrolled in T-mobile's rewards program.  The main benefit of this for me is that future purchases of minutes in any amount are also good for a year.  Additionally, if you purchase minutes of any amount before your minutes expire the remaining balance rolls over.
After I refill the $100 T-Mobile TOGO PIN,In addition to my original remaining minutes,I receive 1058 minutes (for 1 year). I don't know why theygave me the additional 58 minutes, maybe it is promotionor bonus.BTW, I saw the review from previous reviewer "M. ONeil"and accept his suggestion, and it works !!
Original review January 2006 - The $100 T-Mobile Prepaid refill card is a great deal. I just added my 1,000 minutes and I have a full year to use them. The phone came with $15/60 minutes and the initial balance also rolls over to 10 cents a minute. Plus I didn't have to pay sales tax or shipping with Amazon and it arrived in three days. T-Mobile customer service is very helpful and even gave me a tip to save minutes: use a land line to check voicemail.January 6, 2007 update - I tried to order a refill card and after placing the order found out that the $50 card is on backorder...since I needed the card right away to renew my minutes, I cancelled the Amazon order and shopped around a little more. You can find these cards online for even less than face value and receive the pin right away. Since I am a T-Mobile Gold Member (have previously purchased a $100 card) the $50 card is also good for a year and calls are still .10/min. No matter whom you buy it from, I think T-Mobile is great...if you start out with the $100/1yr card the price is only $8.33/mo for 83 minutes.
Good buy for the person that doesn't have a cell phone growing out of their ear..  You get a year to use up the time on the card, before it expires..this is a good plan for someone that uses their cell phone fairly infrequently.
This was a  good deal at 10% off.  Puts you in gold status.
ok, fast delivery. Would be better if the refill code can be access online or refill online without waitting for the crad from the mail.
I ran into problems when trying to call Tmobile to activate. They told me the number on this card don't even exist. I purchased this on Feb 2nd, I called Tmobile and Amazon twice but did not work out. But today Feb 12, after arguing with a guy from Amazon.com, I call to activate again and it work. So I think, you might need to wait a few day. It's just like you buy one from retail store like Walmart, I remember I saw something like you won't be able to activate it after purchase. Maybe info from card need to be transfer to Tmobile, that's why you'll see on the back "void if not activated 90 days from purchase" because they know when you purchase it.Phew! I feel relieve now!
My refill card did not work. I called T-Mobile and they said the refill card did not released properly and asked me to call Amazon.  Amazon asked me to return the card. The complete round time 4 weeks until then your money stuck with Amazon. It is really frustrating.  Amazon sucks....
T-Mobile has the worst customer service ever. They do not stand behind their products and with pre paid cards they already have your money so what do they care about your service. I went with them because of the 100 minutes that were good for a year, now I'm sitting here with a phone that doesn't work and a 1 year warrenty that they won't honner.
Overall: Good phone; SOLID build; reasonable battery life: 2.5-3 days with an hour's talk time + some PDA-work (and cheap spares), good QWERTY keyboard for SMS/e-mail, syncs well with Outlook (appointments, contacts).  Decent documentation.Phone pros: good/decent signal, good/decent call quality.  Good external numeric keypad.  Predictable battery life (2.5-3 days, though I talk maybe 1 hour in that time).  Got a spare battery off an online auction site for cheap.  Can use .wav files as ring tones (MP3 -> .wav via Audacity?  I haven't tried).  SOLID build.Phone cons: somewhat large (candy-bar with a big screen!), have to get used to the earpiece position (can't rest the phone on my ear)... And once, though the keypad was locked, the phone (slipped into my pant pocket) called up my friend.  Weird.  But that hasn't happened again.  Ringtones could be louder.PDA - I can sync my contacts with Outlook and keep track of my appointments, which is all I really want.  Have also managed to use Gmail via POP3; the VoqMail application does not support POP3.(For POP3, you have to enter the server IP address and port completely (pop.gmail.com:995, smtp.gmail.com:465), I had some trouble with that.  Internet connection via GPRS also has somewhat of a weird work-around - look up the cingular.com FAQ for setting up the Audiovox SMT5600 SmartPhone, nice screenshots.)PDA pros: QWERTY flip-out keypad good for notes, contacts, appointments.  My fingers are not slim, but not fat either - so I can enter data/SMS at a good pace.  SD expansion slot.  Windows Mobile 2003 SE actually, FWIW.  "Flight" mode - but I still turn it off in the plane!PDA cons: Has frozen (only!) a couple times in 3 months, can't find a reset pinhole, so took out the battery... (momentary flashback of my last PDA - a Toshiba e310).Have had the Sierra Voq for over three months now, happy camper.  Way better than the Motorola v180 (which it replaced) or the e310.  Now, if only I could get a decent non-leather cover for it... Too bad Sierra stopped production, but if they hadn't, I wouldn't be able to own this wonderful phone!  One man's poison....
I bought this phone to replace my old one, which was getting old and [...].  This is possibly the best cell phone I've ever had.  I get good, strong signals in places where before I got nothing.  The reception is crystal clear and the sound is loud enough to hear in noisy environments.  The display is clear and easy to read, even in the sun.Pros:Solid buildOutstanding receiptionLarge display (for a phone) which is sunlight readableQWERTY keyboard which is very pleasent to use, compared to a number padLoaded with softwarePlays movies and musicSpeaker in the phone is loud and clear, better than most laptop speakersBattery lasts long enough to get you through the dayPlays MP3's for ringtonesVibrates AND Rings at the same time, if you so chooseExternal antenna connection (still looking for adapter...quite sure I'll find one soon)Comes with high quality handsfree earbud/micSincs easily with Outlook for contacts, calender, and tasksVoice dial by name or number (works great)IRDA and cable (included) connection to computer for sincNo Bluetooth (no worries about hackers stealing your data)Cons:Sometimes it takes a while to complete a task when running through a bunch of programsAlarm and installed ringtones are patheticDoesn't come with car charger (it should, considering the battery life)Battery life is shortNo Bluetooth (toys are restricted to the cabled and IRDA variety)Last Sierra Wireless phone, which means eventually they'll stop even having a web site for supportI've seen a bunch of folks complaining about the battery life.  The way I see it, if the battery lasts until I plug it in at night, with a little to spare, that's good enough.  I can see if they are flying all the time, but who is so lazy that plugging in their phone every night, as opposed to every three or so nights, is a big sleep-loosing issue?  I've ordered a car charger on Ebay, just in case, since at a moments notice I may find myself driving or flying cross-country.  As soon as I find a spare battery, I'll buy it, for the same reason.The phone is big, compared to my last phone, which wasn't a smartphone, didn't have a QWERTY keyboard, had a tiny screen, and didn't do anything other than place calls.  However, compared to other smartphones, it's about the right size, and feels good in the hand as well.  It's also much smaller than a PDA phone, or a PDA/cell phone/MP3 player/movie player cluster of devices that all need their own batteries, chargers, add-ons and doodads.  Frankly, nobody should be whining about the size, since the dimensions are clearly stated.  Doesn't anybody own a ruler?It is somewhat a pain to configure this phone for internet access.  According to Cingular, all their phones have some top-secret software installed that magically allows them to access the net.  Since their programmers didn't have a chance to work their voodoo on this phone, there's absolutely no chance that it'll work with their internet service.  Well, after a bit of fiddling with the settings, much trial and error, and looking at the settings of their other phones (available on their web site) it worked just fine.  I managed to view most web sites, except those with Shockwave animation, which seems to shut down the browser (same as my PocketPC).  CAUTION! I racked up [...] in internet charges with just a few minutes of browsing.  After you get it working, I strongly suggest you enroll in a data plan.As for some of the other issues folks complain about, there are three things to keep in mind:1) This phone is bought from a third party, and was never offered by any US service provider.  That means it is up to YOU to set everything up, or have that nerdy kid down the street do it for you.  It wasn't overly complex for me, and though I have some experience with networking, I am by no means a pro.2) There is a firmware update for this phone.  You much check out their web site for downloads and instructions.  As it is, my phone had the latest firmware, which was a very nice touch.3) This phone was the first Sierra Wireless made, as well as the last.  Unlike Sony, Nokia, Motorola, and others, they didn't have years and years to polish their design, work out kinks, respond to customer feedback, and so forth.  They boldly tried to make phones, did an incredible job for a first try, found the phone business to be filled with too many lawsuits and much drama, and quietly bowed out.  This means you aren't going to get a perfect phone, and support for this phone will eventually dry up altogether.  Be prepared for this.I don't think this (or any) phone was ever worth [...] mainly because of the limitations of Windows Mobile and a device that must be around the size of a cell phone.  It is certainly a bargain [...], with no contract, unlocked, brand new, and a fairly complete software package.  It's also not a huge loss if it gets stolen or broken.Kudos to Sierra Wireless for a great phone.  I only wish they had time to build more refined models.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update 9/20/06First of all, this phone DOES work with the new SIM cards from Cingular.  I turned it on, placed a call, and received a call, all without problems.  I also got full bars in my living room, which even my brand new phone doesn't get.Unfortunately, I was unable to find an external antenna adapter.  According to one source, the connector was designed for a car kit adapter, sort of a quick-connect type thing.  I did buy the car kit, however, the antenna connector barely touches the contacts, so it's unlikely you'll get a solid, reliable connection that's suitable for data, although it probably works very well with voice.I stand behind by review (except for the spelling mistakes...oops)I went through three phones, all brand new with oodles of modern goodies and fancy bling, before I found one to replace the VOQ, and even then I was disappointed with the OS, which is Windows Mobile 5.  There is a lot more software out there for WM 2003se than WM 5.In fact, I haven't decided yet if my current phone is The One.If you can find the car kit (found mine on Ebay) it might be a worthy investment.  The VOQ slides right in, and the kit can either be installed in one car, or moved from vehicle to vehicle.  It comes with the parts to do both.  The only bad thing is the antenna, which is lame, but you can buy a Wilson antenna and hook it right up to the connector.The performance is very good.  I've played several games on the VOQ, and it performed flawlessly, with no slowdowns.  Other apps did slow down at times, but it never locked up.The mono headset is the best wired headset I've used.  The stereo headset is good for music, but not good at all for calls.I've been using a 2 gig SD card with no problems, although I've heard the max capacity is 512 mb.  There's something to be said for a standard size SD card, which is very rare with phones today.  No silly adapters for mini or micro SD cards, inexpensive, and easily removed without having to shut down, remove the battery and SIM, and all that nonsense which seems to be the standard with today's phones.The phone felt solid when I first got it, and after a few months of using it I can say it is very solid.If this had bluetooth, heck, if it just had a good external antenna adapter, I'd keep it.  I even considered digging around in there and soldering a good connector, but after having tried a bluetooth headset, I can't see going back to wired.I still haven't decided whether to put the VOQ on Ebay.  Should something happen to my current phone, which is too expensive to quickly replace and which Cingular refuses to insure, again because it's too expensive, I'd have a real hard time going back to a cheap normal phone.  I'm even having a hard time giving up my QWERTY keyboard.  Anyway, I'd hate to see this great phone sit around for nothing while the battery ages, so I'll probably send this up after the return period is over for my new phone.Did I mention this phone works with the new SIM cards from Cingular?  Outstanding!CS
To make this a very brief review, it is all that the other reviews say, but to me the most salient points are:1) Even set at the highest volume the ringtone is almost inaudible. If you are in a restaurant or the street you probably won't hear it at all. If the phone is in the next room, you won't hear it ring. There is a vibrate mode, but it will only vibrate one time, and again you may miss it.2) The alarm clock mode will not work unless the phone is turned on. So you can't turn it off at bedtime and use it as an alarm clock.2) The keyboard is good and it is useful for instant messaging.3) The phone is solidly constructed.4) The phone has good reception and transmission in areas of weak signals.5) Being unlocked, you can use it with different SIM cards when traveling overseas.
I just want to say, this is the phone which has everything I need. I don't use phone to take picture, and talking with bluetooth earphone seems very stupid for me..So this phone, without bluetooth and camera, just fine for me.For those people who complain about battery life, you can setup your GPRS as "manually" connect with Internet, so that the phone will not keep connecting with internet for checking email, then battery life is just as good as other phones. Typically, I use this phone everyday for talking about total 1 hour, and for listening music about 2 hours (walk on the way to work and on the way back home), before I go to bed to recharge it, it usually has 2 bars of battery left.I am using 2GB SD card and it works fine. SD card is the cheapest memory card nowadays. And who does not have one SD card? So you don't have to spend extra money for memory card. I saved a lot of music and picture on it. Some important files, I also copy them in the phone as I can check on the go.The best part of this phone is, it integrates a lot of softwares, makes it able to read Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files with no problem, those softwares you must pay to have register code in any other smart phone. It also has a file manager, picture view software, and it can play pictures as slide show in full screen. I used Audiovox SMT5600 before, it even does not have a file manager.Furthermore, it can be used as a modem if you have dial-up internet available, so connecting with your laptop can let you go online at anywhere without expensive phone data plan. Or you can use dial-up directly on the phone, to use internet explore for checking your email on the phone. But be aware of that Cingular blocks data transfer if you don't use their internet sevice. So if you are using T-mobile, it will be no problem to use this phone's dial-up for online, sepcially at weekend and evening, you get free internet service because your call is free during these time.Like other smartphone, it can syncs with your computer for all your contacts and calender, and even playlist in Windows media player.If you go online to search, you can find a lot of games and home screen themes available for free. The only thing I want complain is, everytime I restart the phone, it loses the home screen themes which I personalized with my son's picture, and I have to copy them into the phone again.Over all, this is a wonderful phone for those people who understand how to use a smartphone.--------------------------------------------------Update on December 29, 2006Recently I installed an Asian Language Pack, so now the phone can show my music file's name in original language which comes with songs... Also, I installed a software called TMPMP which can let my phone play MP4 and 3GPP movies, so my phone now is really SUPER powerful. Of course this progarm also can play MP3 and wma, and acc files.
Lots of phone for the price.  The Windows software is super intuitive to work with.  Flip out QWERTY works great. Using it on the Cingular network and the signal & sound quality have been superb.  I'm old fashioned; I hold phones up to my ear to talk (no bluetooth on this thing) and I have a digital SLR to take pictures.
So, this phone is straight out of the excorcist.  About 3 weeks after I bought it, I was at work and the phone randomly started dialing numbers.  I turned it off and then back on, but the phone just started doing the same thing.  It stopped after about 15-20 minutes but hass happened twice since then.  Also, while it has a lot of cool features, you can barely hear the ring itself and the battery has to be charged EVERY night.  I definitely would not buy this again.
Overall- Exactly what I was looking for to check email, surf (little) while on road, airports without luggin my laptop. Works great w/ T-mobile ($5.99) plan. Syncs w/ Outlook and can view Office files & PDF attachments in emails. Have stored music & pics on the SD card.Battery life could be longer and screen scratches VERY easily - get the case FIRST!
I've had this phone for several months now and it's actually quite good.  I originally bought it because I needed a business phone that didn't have a camera-kind of a big deal in many office environments these days.Some of the complaints against this phone have more to do with how Windows Mobile / Pocket PCs work than with this phone in particular.  Example:  it does take a lot of menu hopping to jump around, but that's typical of any WM device.  Use the smart myVoq feature instead.If you leave "receiving incoming beams" on, you'll have to recharge twice a day as your phone constantly looks for infrared input that probably isn't there.  Turn it off and you'll find a much better battery life.  Heavy talk times might mean once a day recharging; I average once every other day.If it sometimes wakes up on its own, that's Windows Mobile for you.  If I remember correctly, that particular version of WM had to start up to handle scheduled events (it's the same for Pocket PCs from around the same period).  It's only up for a second, it won't kill you.The phone is on the largish side for a phone, but not for a Blackberry or Smartphone device.  If you want extra functionality expect extra bulk, that's all there is to it.  The way you're supposed to look at these things is to consider that now you don't have to carry phone + PDA, phone + laptop, etc.  Don't buy this phone if you wish your RAZR had a keyboard, the size will break your heart.It comes with more ringtones than your average phone, but if you don't like the offerings bring your own, it'll use MP3s among others.The fold-out keyboard is quite good, in fact out of all the thumb board styled keyboards I've used it's probably the one I personally find  I type the quickest and type with the fewest mistakes, which is probably due to the nice intuitive QWERTY layout.The screen is very bright and crisp, and along with the keypad is pretty functional even in the dark.  I wouldn't want to write my thesis on it, but if you just need to check a Word attachment from an email this phone is perfect.Compared to Palm there isn't as much software for Windows-based Smartphones available (at least of the free variety), but the Voq also has a Java client installed.  Works great with Opera mini.  Don't forget it'll also run some Pocket PC apps-I use Pocket PuTTY to SSH from the Voq and it works great (love that QWERTY keyboard!) with every site I've tried.All in all you really can't beat a new, unlocked Smartphone for this price.  It has its quirks, and it does look kind of big on your belt, but I really think it's an excellent product.
Great Phone.  Had it for a little over a month. I got a great deal for $90.  PDA function is awesome, not to mention the Windows Media Player for those boring commutes.  You can play music and watch video as long as you have enough memory on the SD slot.  Works great with T-mobile Web Plan for $5.99.  The only downside is the start-up time, but I rarely turn off my phone so that doesn't matter.  And yes the battery time is kinda short, but I play games and listen to music all the time on the phone so I end up charging when I goto sleep anyway... so no loss there either...  Great phone, esp since now you can get it for around $100 instead of $400.  Definite BUY!

What can I say? This is the best darn phone Ive ever had. You can have all the functionality with the 5.99 T-Zones plan from T-Mobile. Its a pain to set up, but once going its real nice.With this phone I can check my email, log onto & post on the secure company forum, watch movies from the sd card, mp3 player on speakerphone,  games, maps and directions, sync with outlook, calendars, a simple voice recorder, etc..It is also very intuitive & easy to use once it gets up and going. The qwerty pad makes all the difference in the world.All for around 100$ and 6 a month - no sh*t - cant beat that.This has been the best purchase Ive made in a long time...I travel occasionally and I love to have all these distractions in one little box, even if its a little larger than most other phones.Thanks Sierra for your Board Members to disown this product and allow it to become as inexpensive as it is.- One Happy Camper -
Been using this for 5 mths now and its been a boon NOT to have to carry two devices - my cell phone plus PDA - separatly. Had a problem syncing my Notes with Outlook, but Smartphonenotes fixed that.Overall, the Voq is well worth the reduced price so long as you're willing to figure out usability for yourself (as I assume there is little tech support available from Sierra Wireless)
To this day, Scrubs is still one of those shows that is not totally appreciated by the network that airs it, doesn't get huge ratings, but still has a fantastic fan base that truly cares about the show.In the second season, viewers got to know a lot about the personal lives of the characters, which helped to make them more real and eventually inspired people to really invest in them, which is what makes the fan base so devoted.Scubs is not like any other sitcom, at least any that I watch. It's odd fantasy sequences are quite unique and the no-studio audience format is quite interesting. There is no laugh track, which leaves you laughing on your own.And, watching Season two, there were plenty of chances to laugh.As J.D. (Zach Braff), Elliot (Sarah Chalke) and Turk (Donald Faison) enter their second year at Sacred Heart Hospital, they are certainly bound to take a step up. Instead of being interns, they are now residents, left with more decisions and more responsibility.John (J.D.) Dorian is the center of the show and the episodes, for the most part, are written from his point of view. He provides the narration for almost all the episodes and the fantasies are usually spawned from his brain. In season two, he wrestles with his feelings for fellow resident Elliot Reed, battles with chief resident Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), sees his best friend Turk get engaged and has numerous romantic entanglements. I will say, that JD gets tons of beautiful women. In this season alone, guest stars that went on dates with him include Amy Smart as the Tasty Coma Wife (A great episode) and Sarah Lancaster as the gift shop girl. But truly, JD is lonely, especially in comparison to his best friend Turk. One highlight of the season is a visit from J.D.'s brother (Tom Cavanaugh). The pair actually look a  lot alike.Turk, in season one, met nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes) and in season two, the pair become engaged. It is revealed in commentaries by the show's creator, that Turk and Carla are a couple they plan on keeping together for the length of the show and they have to work out many problems to get to that point. In season two, Turk's engagement ring gets swallowed by a young patient, Carla's mother dies, Turk's brother (guest star D.L.  Hughley) creates havoc on their relationship and they have the typical arguments that come with being newly engaged.Elliot has problems of her own, ranging from battling her feelings for JD to exploring other relationships, mainly with nurse Paul (guest star Rick Schroder). She finds herself cut off from her father's money, forced to live in a truck for a while and then crashes on Turk and JD's couch. She is a nervous wreck for the most part, but at the same time she is a competent doctor, who just needs to get her personal life in check.As Dr. Cox, McGinley is superb.  His long rants and diatribes are hilarious to listen to and the way he chooses a different girls' name to call JD every time he speaks, is pretty funny as well. In this season, he reunites with his ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller), who is pregnant and eventually delivers, his baby. A highlight of the season was the episode where Cox narrates, taking over from JD's usual role. It is insightful to hear from someone else every now and then. He also has a relationship with a pharmaceutical rep, played to perfection by Heather Locklear.Ken Jenkins adds a bit of meanness as Chief of Staff Bob Kelso. He constantly berates Dr. Cox and is always looking for a resident or intern to pick on, often settling on Elliot or JD. His pompous attitude creates a lot of friction between himself and other members of the staff, but that leads to a lot of great comedic moments.Neil Flynn is added to the regular cast as the nameless janitor. According to commentaries with the show's creator, Flynn ad libs most of his lines. His incessant picking on JD is quite funny and really, I find the janitor to be the funniest character on the show. I love it when he pretends to be a doctor, or just finds inane ways to pick on JD.As far as extras go, this set is great. There are a number of commentary tracks with creator Bill Lawrence and various cast members. There are a number of featurrettes, one dealing with guest stars, another with music. There are deleted scenes and outtakes and a one-on-one interview with John C. McGinley, which is quite interesting. I found the commentaries to be quite informative and a very welcome addition to the set.All in all, a great set of a show that has yet to be truly appreciated by the networks and even by some television fans. This is quality comedic television.
Scrubs is just a heck of a lot of fun.  Each episode is crammed as full as possible of jokes, commentary on humanity and talented comedians doing fresh bits and shenanigans.  For your time and money you can bet no better value.  Scrubs' writing is superiour--each story interweaves several other stories and brings all together in the end in comedic and occaisionally touching manner.Once of the best things about Scrubs is that despite the fact that everyone gets made fun of, no-one is ridiculed.  An example of this is when Turk starts pointing out who is sleeping with whom, ending up with two men who are sleeping together, rather than have that be the punch line--which would have been a cheap shot--his buddy JD thinks about that a moment and then says sweetly--"Oh, good--Ernesto found someone!"Overall just have a great time with a wonderful series.
I'm surprised this show hasn't reached Seinfeld level of acceptance. It's funnier than Seinfeld. The humor's fast, somewhat random and very constant. Can't recommend this enough.
This season is just one more reminder of how great this show is, how inventive, interesting, anything but run-of-the-mill.  It also increases my bitterness at how shabbily NBC has treated this show - shifting the schedule constantly, not airing this season until 2006, and just generally treating it like a second-class show.  Maybe that's why they are losing viewership.  Can't tell a gem when they have one.  Scrubs, unlike many shows, is incredibly watchable, even a second, third, fourth time.  A show definitely worth the DVD commitment.
The second season of Scrubs is every bit as good as the first. The set hits the ground rolling with all the same wit, humor, and directorial prowess as the entire crew continues to push the bounds of what can be done for this relatively small series on a budget.The truly observant will note that some of the more quirky aspects of the first season have been eliminated or toned down - notably the sound effects, which are used much more sparingly. The change works, though, as the basic feel of the series remains the same while not having to rely on that comedic crutch.In the second season, our frightened new doctors, fresh out of college in the first season, manage to find their feet a bit. The show takes the opportunity to explore their feelings and relationships while they gain their confidence, but takes care to affirm that they're still only learning.The focus of season two is still the mostly-lovable but self-centered and oblivious JD, but there is plenty of room for growth of the other characters. Almost all of the focus characters are rounded out and grow, right down to the JD's janitorial nemesis.As for the DVD release, special features abound. What's more, though, is that they are features that are actually worth watching. The show's cast and creators open a window to what goes into creating a sitcom, from the difficulties of shooting in a real hospital to casting, scriptwriting, and dealing with unlikely success. The episode commentaries are also a wonderful glimpse at the level of involvement and dedication that goes into making a hit series. Recorded years after the making of the episodes in question, it is amazing what little details those involved manage to recall.As fast-paced comedy goes, it is difficult to beat Scrubs. Between the out-and-out hilarious writing and masterful way that the pacing is used to direct the viewers' emotional highs and lows, Scrubs' second season is definitely a set to own.
There are few changes in the second season of Scrubs versus the first season, mainly because the formula works so well. As the season opens, J.D., Turk, and Elliot have just finished their internships and are entering their medical residency years. Also, Jordan, Cox's caustic ex-wife, has set the cat among the pigeons by outing her ex's crush on Carla (and Turk's knowledge of it), Elliot's crush on JD, Kelso's manipulation of Cox, and the fact that she has slept with JD - and it was "go-ood". The gang can barely look at one another - Turk and JD are forced to bunk together, Carla is huffing, Elliot is hiding under tables to avoid JD, and Cox is blowing steam through his nose everytime he sees Kelso.In "My Nightingale", Dr. Cox tries to convince Jordan that they should reunite, and that he is not the same self-sabotaging person he was when they were married. However, Jordan leaves after she hears what is supposed to be an introductory speech praising evil Dr. Kelso that Cox turns into a roast. Fortunately for Cox, though, the audience misconstrues his remarks as sarcastic and humorous. The funniest part of this episode is the appearance of hospital lawyer Ted (Sam Lloyd) and his real-life acapella group spending an entire night-shift singing TV theme tunes, including upbeat renditions of The Six Million Dollar Man and Charles in Charge. You see, TV theme songs are their specialty. From that point forward, "The Blanks" are frequently featured in the show."My Fruit Cups" is a realistic episode about financial pressures that medical students face as Turk and J.D. periodically fill their trunk with hospital food - specifically fruit cups and pudding - to help make ends meet. The janitor is making J.D. sweat over this issue since he tells him he is investigating a number of thefts at the hospital. Only later do we find out he is investigating the theft of drugs, not food. Elliot, who up to now has had no financial problems since her father has been footing the entire bill, finds out that his generosity comes with a price - Her dad believes he has purchased the right to tell her what medical specialty to enter into. Meanwhile, Jordan has returned, obviously pregnant, but who is the father?The J.D/Elliot relationship resurfaces when Elliot begins to feel alone and financially pressured for the first time in her life after her dad withdraws his support. On top of everything, she is being sued by a patient whom she wrongly diagnosed as having eight months to live when he winds up living longer than that. So she begins to have sex with JD in order to relax, until at some point they become sex buddies. JD begins to really like this no-strings set up until  Turk tells him that at some point Elliot is going to search for sex sometime when her emotions are normalized and then J.D. will be back where he was with her last year. This leaves JD seeking a way to break up with her again."His Story" is probably my favorite episode of the season because it features the snarky Dr. Cox and has just the right amount of comedy and drama. First off, J.D. says for the first time, that he has no story to tell and Dr. Cox takes over the narration for a change. Thus the episode reveals a lot about the character of Dr Cox, with scenes such as his therapist telling him he'll end up all alone, the party that nobody turns up to with all that money spent on pizza, and Cox's reaction to JD leaving him. Combine this with such insanely random humor as Pancake Man and Johnny the tackling Alzheimer's patient and you have a nearly perfect episode.Later in the season, J.D. finds himself attracted to Jamie, the T.C.W. (tasty coma wife), a woman whose husband has been in a coma for the past two years. He fights the attraction, but later the husband dies, and J.D. begins a relationship with her. Unfortunately, she gets bored easily, and J.D. finds out Jamie is a "drama queen" - in order to keep her interested he has to stir up some kind of trouble. However, when he runs out of ideas and tells her that he and Elliot are getting back together he realizes things have gone too far.In summary, if you enjoyed Season One of Scrubs, you'll enjoy Season Two just as much or more.
..........so I do consider myself somewhat of an expert in the clinical arena.  I have watched them all,  Marcus Welby right on through ER.  Scrubs is the most realistic, albiet tongue-in-cheek representation of our professions.  You cannot take everything seriously,  but,  if you believe an emergency room can function like ER 24/7 and still have people standing,  you're out of touch w/ reality as well.
I decided to rent season 1 from Blockbuster and I fell in love with this crazy group of doctors. I then preordered season 2 and when I was done I loved it even more. This is not your generic comedy, for one thing it has no laugh track which makes it better and they can do just about anything, there have been heads melting, limbs cut off, talking babies (all in fantasies of course). Zach Braff as Dr. JD Dorian is a comic genius, just about everything he says makes you wanna roll off your couch. My favorite is the janitor, played by Neil Flynn who improves nearly every line and when he shows up you know something good is coming. There are also tender and sad moments, which occasionally give it some depth.Now to the season itself. As of this moment I have seen 1,2, and 5 so I don't know how it compares to the others but this has some of best moments in the show's history. The special features are great, with deleted scenes, outtakes, and interivews. And I urge EVERYONE to watch the audio commentaries by Bill Lawrence, the creator, and the actors, it's so entertaining to learn about the small things, like they ramble on for a few minutes about the background doctors.Season 5 is my favorite right now, but if you are a Scrubs fan, this is a must-own and even if you are new, you will fall in love right away.
Scrubs the Complete First Season set the benchmark for TV program season DVD sets with its high quality and quantity of extras. The Complete Second Season has even more.  Like with season one there are again deleted scenes and alternative lines which are sensational.  Added for season two is stunt casting, where celebrity appearances and cameo appearances are shown and commented upon. Imagination Gone Wild where the actors and crew commentate on the fantasy scenes and we also get to see most of these fantasies together in the one clip while they do this is also sensational.  Other great new features include Secrets and Lies where crew and actors make fun of each other, JD's Mojo where Zach Braff and others analyse JD's sex life as well as Johnny Keeps Talking where Johnny C. (Dr. Cox) tells us all about getting the part, how he turned it down three times, how he developed the character and his first impression of the other actors.  Musical stylings highlights the importance of music selection for Scrubs success and either in this or one of the other extras Zach Braff explains how he discovered Lazlo Bane's song Superman and convinced the creators to use it as the Scrubs theme song.The only thing I didn't like about the season two DVDs was that with a lot of the audio commentaries the director seems to have forgotten to turn his microphone on so you have to turn up the volume really loud to hear what he is saying, meanwhile whichever actor is co-commentating who does has their microphone on is really loud.  This is the case on the Australian version anyway, which means you can't really watch these commentaries late at night but need to find a time when your neighbours aren't home.Of course you also get all 22 hilarious episodes of season two which alone make this a much own DVD but the extras as well show other TV programs what can be achieved when you actually care about your fans and want to give them value for money.  If you haven't already done so also buy the masterpiece Scrubs the Complete First Season as well.
The first three seasons of Scrubs were the funniest ones for me, and of those, this one is my favorite. The characters are nicely established, each with their own quirks and foibles, yet are still fresh and exciting, while the setting and the characters' predicaments are still different and interesting with enough scope for outlandish antics. Later seasons got a little tired as the characters/jokes didn't seem to have that many new places to go. For example, how long can it be funny for Dr. Cox to call JD Joanna? Originally that was funny and you were just dying to see what name he'd come up with next and what novel way he'd think of to emasculate JD - now... well, we've pretty much heard it all before.This season is so funny though, with sharp dialogue, still fresh characters and situations, and off-the-wall humor to throw you into fits of laughter when you least expect it. Okay, you might say that when watching a TV comedy you do 'expect' to laugh, but do you? Do you really 'expect' to? I don't. Not with most of the garbage that's thrown at us these days. So to find something that legitimately makes me laugh is a very pleasant surprise and a wonderful treat.My favorite characters are JD, Dr. Cox (of course), the janitor, and a much underrated bit-part player - Ted, the abused lawyer. All the other characters have their moments, but you'll find the best humor comes from the interplay of these guys.If you want an idea of what it's like - think of the friendships of Friends mixed with the squabbling of Frazier (with Niles) set in a hospital run in a Faulty Towers fashion, with Terry Gilliam's stop-motion animation replaced by the live action of the characters' daydreaming. Yep, that's Scrubs for you!If you've never seen Scrubs, it might take a little getting used to - such an odd group of dysfunctional individuals with such 'life and death' responsibilities - but once you get the hang of what's going on, I defy you to not laugh. And every so often they do throw you a curve ball and add a little sensitivity - the odd patient does die, and not in a funny way. But those serious asides add to its allure.Scrubs is a modern day classic - cleverly written, with endearing characters, and sharp wit. Go on, treat yourself!
I had all but given up on TV as a viable form of entertainment when a couple of years ago (it seems) my wife and I stumbled upon a premier of a show called Father of the Pride, and another zany show called Scrubs immediately afterward. We fell in love with both shows, but only one would survive to a sophomore season.  The advantage Scrubs had is multi-fold; it featured edgy writing, a great cast, colorful and loveable characters and physical comedy that is rarely seen in sitcoms. It also did away with the annoying canned laughter that most sitcoms incorporate almost as instructions for the audience on when to laugh. The biggest advantage Scrubs had over Father of the Pride was it's low budget, but would you believe that the show's low budget would hardly be noticed? There are many moments that his show pulls off high quality stunts, and special effects that are quite nice! The best part of it is that the show is hilarious, and completely off the wall.  I like how the main character of the show (JD) has countless memorable day dreams which are often as random and completely absurd as what most of us imagine, but never vocalize. This presents a wonderfully human quality to this otherwise over the top show, and it's this element, which puts it over the top as well, which adds to the fun.  Though the show doesn't quite reach the high quality standards set by the likes of Third Rock from the Sun Scrubs does come pretty close. What holds it back is that unlike 3rd Rock this show is not family friendly and features a great deal of sexual content which may not be appropriate for younger viewers. There isn't anything that would make it R rated, but the show certainly does push the limits of what is acceptable on Prime Time TV. Thankfully the show compensates by keeping the vulgar language to a minimum. All in all I highly recommend this show to comedy fans, but with the warning to parents that some of the subject matter may be inappropriate for younger audiences, funny show that it is, I certainly would not let any young children watch it.  Not every show is airing in wide screen, it's a real shame because this show would benefit from it greatly as the picture is crystal clear, and extremely sharp, but is limited to a 1:33:1 aspect ratio, which means watching it in an awkward stretched ratio, or with reversed letter boxes for wide screen TVs. It would have been nice to have this show filmed with Wide screen in mind, as the clear picture does reveal HD may have been. Usually HD and Wide screen go hand in hand, but not in this case. I realize that DVDs are limited to 480p, but you can definitely tell if a show was shot for HD or not. The transfer is really clean here, I mean REALLY clean, its just a shame that it wasn't shot in 16x9. If they're using a DV cameras like I think they are a simple press of a button could solve that problem.  The sound for the first couple episodes were great but for some reason the volume dropped suddenly in the middle of disk one and never really came back up until I adjusted the volume. However, this is a show with few crashes, explosions, or anything that would require Dolby Digital 5.1, so the fact that it is included is a nice bonus. The sound is decent, but not exceptional.  It's not often I find a TV show that can make me laugh, but this is definitely over the top enough to pull it off, but not with the same element of class as, say 3rd Rock. Its not something you can watch with the whole family, because of its content, but it's still a highly enjoyable experience for the adults in the home, and has an excellent collection of special features which are worth watching as well.
Its looks cheap and the battery runs out after 30 mins of talking. Its has to be charged twice every day!!
I have discovered that television has dramatically changed over the years.  It isn't about original programming any more; it is simply about how many advertisements you can jam into a half-hour time slot.  It has become depressing.  Where has all the original programs like Alf, Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters, and Golden Girls gone?  Instead, we are forced to watch prefabricated sit-coms that involve no reality (aka no money, fabulous house, amazing bodies) and are full of more commercialism than you can wag a stick at.  So, I have done my part to stop this "forced" television by cutting my cable all together.  I told the company that deals with our neighborhood that they were no better than the "big tobacco companies" and that I needed to stop "cold turkey" if I were to release from their cold dark hand.  So, with a huge gasp of air, I did.  Now, when I need my television fix, I buy a television series or rent one and enjoy the laughter without commercialism.  It is the only way to watch television anymore.  With all of this said, I finally had a chance to catch up on one of the most original television programs out there right now, Scrubs.  Its amazing blend of imagination, slapstick intelligent humor, and quirky characters keep the show fresh, appealing, and highly entertaining throughout its second season.Scrubs is not your typical show.  While it is a purely fictional program, I find that it deals with some of the most "real" problems facing us today.  What makes this show amazing is that it combines the realities of life with hysterical flashbacks and mind-challenging music.  The show is helmed by one of the greatest, and most comical, cast in television.  Zach Braff, amazing in Garden State, proves that he can play the "every man" better than anyone else in television.  His emotion, humor, and situations can somehow relate to true experiences in life, ones that we have all been through and laughed at afterwards.  His best pal Turk, who is struggling with the leaving bachelor lifestyle to marry his hospital girlfriend Carla, flanks him.  Together they have both imaginative adventures and dramatic encounters.  The "third-wheel" is Elliot, who cannot seem to pull herself out of a constant barrage of ruts, but always has her friends next to her.  These three are surrounded by some of the funniest, and human, doctors on television.  There is "headmaster" Bob Kelso and the hysterically funny John C. McGinley playing Braff's sarcastic mentor, Dr. Perry Cox.  With so much talent in a singular show, it is saddening to know that its peers have not awarded this show anything.  Studios would rather boast about the newest episode of Friends than reward a program that actually thinks about its comedy!I think what makes this program spectacular is how well the development team is able to combine both a comical, yet dramatic, element to each episode.  Not only do we laugh at these characters, but we also feel for them.  I do believe this is crucial in establishing a successful television show.  Audiences need to feel as if the characters are human, that they are (and can) go through experiences just like everyone else.  That is exactly what the team creating Scrubs has done.  What is great about the show is that they take these very small instances in our lives, blow them up, and surround them with humor, emotion, and quite a bit of great music.  Oh, the music.  That is definitely an element that sets this series apart from everything else cluttering our television sets.  The BEST Scrubs episode has to be the one where Colin Hay opens with his classic "Men at Work" song as he follows Braff throughout his day.  This will remain in your mind as a new television classic long after this series is dead.  Also, just the way the producers somehow pick some of the most beautiful songs to transition from comedy to drama in an instant, it is nearly like a third character.  The music is huge in Scrubs and I do not think it would be as successful without it.Scrubs also works because of the people involved with the show.  Everyone from Braff, to McGinley, to even the infamous Jan Itor (HA!) contribute 100% for each episode.  Each time I watch them interact together they make me laugh, they make me smile, and actually appreciate the creativity on television.  They are a smart group of actors that actually embrace comedy.  It is obvious that it is not forced, that they are not struggling with their characters, or seeking approval by any audience.  Scrubs is a show that you will either hate, or love.  It took me a couple of episodes to get fully developed into the show, but now, I cannot wait to witness J.D. fall into one of his mind "escapes" and take me into a very silly world remenicient of Monty Python or Seinfeld or even Family Guy.Overall, this second season is a phenomenal jump for this series.  There are some great twists, some amazing turns, while all the time keeping what we love about each of our characters in tact.  We see stronger relationships form while continuing that ER like emotion.  I cannot wait to watch the third season and revisit these old friends that make me smile each time I turn them on!  Scrubs is the perfect example of what television is like when you correctly combine intelligence, originality, and powerful actors!  Bravo!Grade: ***** out of *****
Scrubs is absolutely one of the most underrated and unappreciated sitcoms on TV today (2006).  The fact that NBC waited until the middle of the season to even begin it in 2006 shows this to be true.  This DVD shows why Scrubs it differnt: Scrubs is funny, witty, intelligent, wacky and yet often very moving.  Every episode has great music and is chock full of unique characters to the point that it is hard to pick a favorite.  Shot with a single camera and with no laugh track (though many sound effects), it is not your typical yuk-yuk sitcom; it's a cut above, requiring you to actually think about what is funny.This DVD is a must-have for those who like intelligent comedy.  It not only contains one of the freshest and funniest seasons of Scrubs, it also has many great extra features and commentary that make it worth the price.  Heck, even the packaging is clever.  This is a great addition to your TV DVD collection.
I'm assuming if you are looking at this you already like Scrubs. All I have to say is at this price you gotta buy it. I got it and I am so happy with it. It came with a great bunch of extras, more than I have had on other TV shows. Also I don't know if you bought the first season but the case on the first season stinks and they improved it greatly for the second season.
From character development to the evolution of the trademark style of the program, this season compilation is fantastic.  Plus the behind the scenes extras and the cast/crew commentaries (HILARIOUS) add so much to the experience that the network broadcasts can't even touch this set (which might be a downside to the collection).  I only wish they'd do more (but that's like asking for five pints of Ben and Jerry's instead of four).Ultimately, I watch this more than I should, but that's only because Season 3 isn't out yet.  I also bought Season 1 last November, which is just as good and just as addictive.
This was an awesome DVD collection and I can't wait to get season 3!!  The DVD extras were terrific!
i have already watched season two three times.  just as wonderful as season one!!  now i'm just waiting to pre-order season three!
Season 2 of Scrubs was great! I originally bought it for my boyfriend and ended up watching it. It was definitely worth the money and I would recommend it to any Scrubs fan or even anyone who just enjoys having a good laugh.
Scrubs is hilarious. I just started watching it last year by accident (the TV was just sitting on that channel) and now I look forward to Tuesday nights when this show is on. I bought the first few seasons to see what I missed and am glad I did. I love it! This hospital comedy makes you laugh, yet almost every show has touching moments that will cause a lump in your throat.
There's really no reason for the lack of attention for this show - it's probably one of the most original on television today. It's a medical show, yes, and there are serious moments with real heart, but it's still down right hilarious. Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, John C. McGinley and Donald Faison have a great report, and they make even the craziest scenes work. I can't wait for season 3!
I'm a big fan of this show, so of course I was very pleased w/ the 2nd season DVD.  If you're looking for non-stop laughing, this is it.  I just picked up the 1st season too.
Great addition to season 1! Any true Scrubs fan must have this set. Just plain funny.
I don't really want to take the time to write an in-depth review here, but I love this freakin' show.  There are only 5 shows currently on television that I watch religiously, and Scrubs is one of them.  The others are Family Guy, The Simpsons, My Name is Earl, and The Office.  This listing should offer a window into my comedic tastes.  If you've never seen Scrubs, or if you've started watching the show recently, you really owe it to youself to get season 1 and watch from the beginning.  Understanding the characters and watching them develop is crucial to really enjoying the show.  Plus the story arc follows each episode after the other, giving the story a continuity that is difficult to just pick up on in the middle of a season or the series.
This is funny, I bought the 1st season, then the 2nd season and I cant wait for the 3rd season... I cant do this all on my own... Am no superman, guys this is a must have for everyone who love perfection and laughter..
This show is so funny.  It's not your typical sitcom with the same old jokes.  Plus, there are TONS of cool special features.  I've never seen such great special features.
living in the middle of nowhere, with minimal access to English speaking TV programs I got a copy of an episode of Scrubs from a friend.The rest is history>  Season 2 came out just as I was finishing Season 1.  I can only hope for the same with Season 3.Funny, clever, poignant and irreverant.  Scares me a bit sometimes with how close it resembles my life, but hilarious at the same time.
There are only a few TV shows I watch, and Scrubs is one of them.  I recommend it to any people who aren't big fans of sitcoms b/c this isn't one of them.
The season starts off where the first ended. Everyone isn't getting along after Dr. Cox's ex-wife started trouble between them all. Eventually they work things out of course. Then later on Dr. Cox's wife shows up pregnant and is lieing about it being someone elses. He then has to choose between her or Heather Locklier. Tough choice since both are hot lol. Also everyone starts making fun of the fact that Elliot is dating  a male nurse played by Rick Schroder. While Turk has to figure out how to ask Carla to marry him. I don't remember much about J.D this season, other than he has another short fling with Elliot.  As always the acting is brilliant with everyone having their moments when they are either funny and whacky or giving heart-felt performances. John C. McGinley probably should've won a 100 awards already as Dr. Cox but I don't think he was even nominated. He'll probably even have less of a chance now. I mean now Hugh Laurie is getting rave reviews as....a sarcastic Doctor that is a mentor to a lot of other doctors. Sound familiar ? Hugh Laurie is great but I can't help but think his character is just a little bit of a Dr. Cox rip-off. Zach Braff is brilliant too but I can't see why he gets nominated when McGinley constantly gets ignored. I mean to me, Zach Braff is just his side-kick and that McGinley is the main star. At least it seems  that way every time they are on screen together. Neil Flynn also steals the show each season as the janitor who has it out for J.D for absolutely no reason at all. Anyway this season is a little more whacky with less drama but it's still not a bad season at all. Season 3 however is probably the best one I saw so far.
Scrubs makes me LAUGH VERY HARD at least twice a show. Sometimes more and I ain't easy either. Now I need the 3rd season. I already have the DVD season 1&2 of which I recommend one highly as well. Scrubs is perhaps the funniest show on television today. I have been watching the new season on iTunes and the show just gets better as it rolls along. It kinda reminds me of Northern Exposure but I don't recall laughing that much then. So as strange as NX but more funny ?Also on a totally unrelated note WHY do all the great shows live in constant danger or just plain get canceled ?  Is it because the networks are run by IDIOTS ? Is it that the American public has no taste [or bad] ?BOSTON LEGAL got jerked around by ABC and Arrested Development is in danger or HAS been canceled. They are the BEST SHOWS EVER. And the networks are killing them, I don't get it.  DENNY CRANE
This show is so funny and well written. The music is also really great on it.
Simply put, one of greatest comides to be on television in the last 10 years. The staff at Sacred Heart will make you laugh inside and out.
I love Scrubs!!  The Second Season is freak'n hilarious and a would recommend it to everyone.  I can't wait 'til the third season comes out!!
I got this PDA for one week and became extremely disappointed. I had used Palm Treo 300. By far, it could not come close to Palm in term of easy to use, stable, intuitive. You have to navigate many times to get you want. This probably is not important for you.I intended to use the PDA to read ebooks and listening to MP3. Unfortunately, it fails in both areas miserably. First, there are not many quality programs for smartphone. I tried Orneta reader and ClearVue PDF reader. cleareVue pdf reader just could not open any pdf file (internal error). With Orneta Reader, it always displays a turning symbol blocking a big area on the center of screen and you cannot move it or scroll it. What a horrible program!Well, you can blame other vendors for failing to deliver good software. What about the phone? I have a 512 MB SD card. 95% of time, the phone just doesn't recognize the card. Device not ready / available! Try it many times, ocassionally, it decides to recognize the card, and you cannot put file on to it!How about battery? The first time I got it, I followed instruction to charge the battery, more than 20 hours. Yes, I charged it continuously more than 20 hours. And in next half day, all of charge was gone and I didn't spend time on the phone!Some people might get a good one. For me, this PDA is just a terrible experience. It should be rated negatively for wasting so much of my time and money. Stay away from it.
I have had this phone for three years, well, actually this is my third phone that they have sent me after the first 2 broke. The first phone whould not charge, not on the home charger, not on a different home charger, not on a car charger, and died. I called customer service and they said "Oh ya, dont wory about it one is being fedexed to you right now". This happens a lot I guess. So the new phone comes, works "fine" for about 2 months then everyone starts getting static from my calls. When people start saying can you repete that I cant hear you, bang it on the table 2 or 3 times and it will work fine. This problem got so bad that I called Verizon again and again they said "Oh ya, dont wory about it one is being fedexed to you right now". So now I am on phone 3 in about 2 and a half years, this one will not charge unless I bite my tough, and hold is with one leg in the air if you catch my drift.Now I am on a business plan, I have 8 of these phones on the plan, and all of them have different problems, screan to dim, earpiece not working, static static static, no charging, the list goes on. Just like everyone else, stay away from this phone.
The title says it all. The cell phone industry is pretty much hit or miss nowadays, and the V265 is a BIG miss. My cousin got one, and she loved it for a few months, until things went bad (my phone went bad after about 4 months). The battery life slowly fell off, my V265 gets about 20 minutes of talk time until the battery cries dead, but it will last for about 2-3 days if not talked on, which dosen't happen much. The hardware is oudated too, the screen is too small, but the camera is of decent quality. I believe that the V265 is the largest produced phone in Motorolas history, and it seems that they value quantity over quality. My sisters V265 has had to be sent in for service TWICE, once because the battery wouldn't charge, and once because the speaker died (she couldn't hear out of her phone).Some advice? The V265 was a hip machine when it came out, but now it's old news, and a downright bad phone. Put your money elsewhere, Samsung has great phones, as does Keocerya. I used to buy Motorolas because they were an American company. I'm not sure if I'll buy another one though...
I used to have an LG VX4400 and thought that phone had issues and then I bought this piece of crap. It shuts off on its own, doesn't hold a battery charge (even after charging for 12 hours) and on top of that you have to mess with the battery charger for a good 5 minutes or more just to get the stupid thing to start charging. It has these random glitches where I won't receive incoming calls, it just sends them to voicemail (no, it is not the service) and it has erased items that it was never told to. This was the biggest waste of time and money I have ever spent with a cell. Don't bother with this one and learn from my mistake.
so i definately do not like this phone. It deserves a zero star but there isn't one. There are random power-outs where it just turns off. but if i hit the power button, it turns back on. but othertimes, it will turn it off. it drops calls, the battery charge spazzes out. but the thing that irritates me the most. is the fact that it drops my contacts. it still remembers them when they call, but if i try to find their number, it wont be listed in the contacts....anybody know to fix this cuz i dont wanna spend money on a new phone/contract.
Ok so im not gonna lie. the phone served the purpose. It was good to me untill recently. It says i have full bars yet no one can hear me. People say they have called me and i get no calls, people say they text me yet i get nothing. Now i have this phone on a wareentee.....NOTE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A WARENTEE!!!!!I took the phone into my local verizon store and told them the issue. granted yes the phone has been dropped maybe 2 times out of the 10 months of owning it. so the sales person asked me if i dropped it recently....uh no. ok well i dunno what to tell you...ok i told him i had a warentee and he said i couldnt get a new phone until they determined if it was my fault or the phones....ok so your gonna take my phone from me for god knows how long and expect me to pay a bill when i dont use it? NO...needless to say i have purchase a new phone. That works 10 times better and even the pictures come out so much better its amazing.If your only goin on a 1 year contract you may like the phone...but a 2 year forget it...complete waste of time
This is the worst phone I've ever had. I've had three. One the first one, the screen went black and never came back. On the second, the earpiece died. Now, on my third, the battery will no longer charge.Pay money for another phone if you need to, this one is trash.
Poor quality by Motorola after a little more than one year usage.  But for listening using a wired headset, the audio microphone and speaker of the cell phone are now at such a low level as to be unusable.  There are better choices for quality.  There are many features to this phone - the voice recognition dialing is a nice feature.
No need to write a long, drawn out review.  In short, I have had this phone for exactly one year so far and it has been babied.  It can no longer hold a charge, the ability to store multiple numebrs a a single name doesn't exist, and the useability is fairly lame.
This is an absolutely horrible phone!  The first one I bought quit working after about 3 months.  The ear-piece quit putting sound out and the only way I could talk to someone was with the speakerphone.  Then, I got a new phone, and it worked pretty well for about 4 months, but now, it will randomly power off, it will hold a charge for a good 12 hours (without using it), and barely charges when I plug it in.  Apart from that, sometimes it won't send text messages, and it's not the service.  The screen is so small that it's hard to see things.  The camera takes decent pictures, but nothing to write home about, and unless you send it to your computer you can barely tell what it is because of the small screen.  My advice, buy some other phone, this one will just cause you problems.
I got this phone 15 months ago, and magically, exactly 1 year after I bought it (and after the warranty ran out), this phone really started having many problems... battery life, speaker going bad, calls dropping, static on the other end, everything you read about in these reviews  is true.  I went to the Verizon store, and they acted like they knew this was an issue with the phone, that they had been receiving many complaints.  A couple of the Verizon retailers also told me they would advise people to stay away from the phone, and I would do the same... get any other phone except this one...
I got my unit and on the second day the speaker stopped putting out sound. The only way to hear now is to put it on speaker phone. I gave it a 1 star rating becuase of the other reviews even though I havnt experienced the same numberous problems.
The motorola v265 is a very good phone. But there are a few things that you cannot do or aren't as good as they could be on it. The camera is blury and in txt messaging there is no T9Word. Other than that and a couple of other small things, it is a good phone.
I had this phone for over 2 years, the phone worked great until it died recently. However, I used a belt holster and although it did get dropped a few times, it wasn't very often. I thought the camera worked great, the address book had over 500 numbers in it when I last backed it up. I couldn't ask that it did much more. I presume the others that rated it poorly had more rugged use of the phone, but I used it every day for business. The talk time was very long compared to most of the newer phones. I would talk on average 2-3 hours per day on the phone, and I only charged it every other day or so. It is small and lightweight and fits nicely in the hand whether you are a man or a woman.
I payed extra money for this phone when I got a new plan, and I've been regrettig it ever since.First and foremost, the reception is lack-luster at best.  I'm in the Los Angeles area and this phone drops calls left and right.  I will be standing next to someone with the same service, and they'll have 2 more bars than I do.Also, I take good enough care of my phones, the occassional drop, but I do treat them well.  After a year, my camera stopped working for no apparent reason.  No drop or major trauma induced this.  Now, and 1.5 years, my screen is glitching or turning off and it is a constant annoyance.  and I'm not the only one.  of the handful of friends that also have this same phone, they *all* complain of the same problems.I dislike giving harsh reviews, but I am just so dissatisfied with this phone that I hate thinking that other people would still buy it.  There are better phones at better prices.  Do not waste your money on this one.
To put it plainly, this phone is junk.  3 Members of my family all got it with our family plan, and within a year all 3 phones screens stopped working, rendering the phone almost useless.  Of the 4 friends I have that also have this phone, 2 of theirs did the same thing.  Don't waste your money.  If you really want a phone with a screen that is destined to stop working within a year, go right ahead and forget about viewing your pictures, missed calls, phonebook, games, text messages...etc.COMPLETE JUNK!
In the beginning, I was just happy to have a camera phone. I've had this phone for about 10 months now and here is what I've gotten.- Often I will be speaking with someone and they will complain about a "buzzing" or something that I would not hear. I usually thought it was a radio or computer interfering with the signal, but looking at some reviews I can say that it was probably the phone itself.- The pictures taken with it aren't to die for. It's something but not the greatest.- While in my pocket, my keys or other things will push the buttons on the sides of my phone, causing it to chirp in the middle of class or maybe stop my phone from ringing when someone calls, making me miss the call.- The phonebook isn't that great but if you have the patience it's not that big of a deal. Everytime I put a e-mail, cell number and house number, I would get a seperate entry for it with the same name, making it confusing. Also, you cannot type in the entire name. You must type in the first letter then scroll through all the names with that first letter. Big pain if you have a lot of contacts.- The sound was good. Usually I could hear the phone ringing. One thing I think happens way too often is, when it is in my pocket it may rest on some paper, cutting down on the vibration when on that setting, making me not notice it.-Recently it has been saying that the battery is dying right in the middle of the day after I fully charged it, and if you don't notice at first you hear that annoying beep (which can be awkward when you're trying to be quiet).- Also, it has been having a delay when I open it between when the screen comes on and when I had actually flipped it open. This is actually why I may be getting a new phone, if I can't get it fixed. The screen has gone completely black except for the backlight. I can make calls, recieve calls and all that good stuff but can't see a dang thing.Overall, it's a okay phone. Nothing outstanding. You can probably find something better for about the same price so I suggest you shop around before you make your decision.
I bought 2 of these phones @ the same time. My son abused his while I took very good care of mine. In less than one year neither would work unless it was on speaker phone, I was told by someone @the phone store that this was a common problem.Nearly impossible to see display in sunlight. On the plus side,I found this phone very easy to use ,including using it for text messaging.
I had this phone for about 6 months and the screen went black, so I couldn't use it anymore. I got a new one free... 3 months later I start hearing static all the time even when I have fine service... two weeks later the screen goes black again. I get a new one, it's just now now starting to break. When I open it up it takes the screen a long time before it will come up and then it flicks off and comes up again. Motorola should send me a new phone that works.DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!
I purchased this phone with the notation that it was NEW in box Excellent condition.  After receiving it, the first thing I noticed was the "Motorola" name was upside down in the view pane on the front cover.  The phone never worked correctly. It would get stuck when dialing certain numbers on the keypad. It would cut its self off while dialing or in the middle of a conversation. I changed batteries and experienced the same problems. I had a very difficult time finding the seller's contact information. When I finally obtained it (from my credit card company's investigation) I was told that the 30 day warranty was over. There was nothing they could do for me. I am stuck with a phone that cost $85.00 and can't use it.
The best feature of this phone is that the voice quality(that you the phone owner hears) is excellent.  It is so clear that my 85 year old mother who has  extremely poor hearing  can hear the caller well when it is in speaker mode.  In contrast, she hears much less using a conventional phone with a boost mode or than when  using 2 other nokia models on speaker mode.Downside is that in sunlight you can't see what is on the screen at all.The ringtone is not loud enough to be heard when it is in my purse.  I have it on the highest setting and I am not hearing impaired. Never had this problem before with a cell phone.  The users manual is written very poorly as opposed to the manuals I have had for Ericssons and Nokias.  Also, the menu items are not always self explanatory so some features of the phone are not easily figured out intuitively.I bought this phone unlocked  so that I could use my att SIM card here and foreign SIM cards abroad without having to pay high international rates. This Triband works 800-850/900/1900. Doesn't work with 1800. Also with the unlocked phone we could stay with our original ATT service contract which is far cheaper than current Cingular plans.  In three months, I have recouped the price of the phone with differential in plans.
Got this phone with a Cingular plan about 8 months ago.  Liked it initally and after about 2 weeks, phone started to mess up.  Had full reception but got the "call failed" message everytime I tried to make a call.  People calling me got my voice mail as if my phone was off.  Couldn't text message or anything.  Took it back to Cingular and they replaced it.  Since then, i've had no problems with it.  The camera isn't very impressive if you aren't in a bright room, forget about getting a decent photo and even in a room with good light, the photo is very substandard.  To be honest, I wouldn't buy this phone again.  It was free with my plan so that's what I got.
I bought this and it has been extremely useful to my daughter
I've used, and enjoyed, the normal form-factor BBs, and at upgrade time I was torn between the 8700 and the 7100g.  While the email capabililty is a must, I'd grown tired of talking into what appeared to be a calculator.  Besides the bulky ergonomics, I couldn't get past the idea that my voice just couldn't reach the microphone with the older form-factor (7290, etc...).Choice made, and I couldn't be happier.  This phone is excellent for me.  No coverage problems (not that that's normally a hardware problem, anyway), and no difficulties with the hardware switch from old to new.Pros:1) Screen is phenomenal.  While the 8700 is better, this one is excellent.2) Form-factor is perfect for people who want to treat their BBs as phones.3) Home screen layout is preferred.  Where the older models are a massive grid of oft-unused icons, the 7100's default is to put the moneymakers up front.  You want memos and tasks, head to a sub menu.  You want messages, phone, calendar, and browser - one click's all it takes.4) Browser is getting better, but its still got some maturing to do.5) The backlight is gold.  7290?  Not gold.  Pyrite, even.  This one?  Greatness.  First time I turned it on I was delighted, and that was at the factory default 60% brightness.  I've since turned it down to 50%, but its gold I tell you...6) Dedicated send and end buttons.  So trivial, but so perfect.Cons:1) Sure would love bluetooth file transfer, too.2) Doesn't wash dishes.3) Ringtones are the suck.  Games are the suck.  Perhaps its that I'm on a corporate account, but I get no love from the various ringtone and games download sites.4) The LED, it keeps blinking.  Why, LED, why?!  I have all the secondary notices set to none, and you still blink, LED!  Why?!?!
The phone part works well and coverage is good.  I don't care for the flywheel-based OS, though that is personal taste.  I also don't like the halfway keyboard solution --  not full QWERTY, not standard 12-key.  The autotyping is flawed, editing text messages is difficult, and there is an annoying delay between depressing a button and the response.This is all small potatoes compared to my big problem, however.  Suddenly, after a several months, when I was linking to my computer, I got an error message.  When I rebooted and reconnected, the software DELETED ALL MY CONTACTS AND APPOINTMENTS FROM THE PHONE.  The software would then crash my computer when I tried to start it.  I uninstalled and re-installed the software from the CD more than a dozen times, made other tweaks, and still the software refuses to do other than crash when it begins synching.  Cingular told me to go to Blackberry and I can't find any fix or any way to get through to live customer help.  So my "cellphone/PDA" is just a phone that will hold no information, contacts, calendar or anything else requiring synching.  If I wanted to continue using it, I would have to get a separate PDA.  I need a new phone/PDA, so this is a total loss.  Lesson for me: avoid Blackberry products.
I've used the Blackberry 7100g as my company communication device for about 2 months, and overall, it's been pretty good.  It's great for those urgent email messages, but as a phone, it does not rate highly in my opinion.  Unless I'm using the earbud, the parties are hard to hear without the volume being raised to a very high setting.  The reception is suspect, and I've had a few dropped calls in the short period of ownership.  Additionally, I've had to remove the battery and SIM card a couple of times because the unit was not responding.Yes it's functional and handy, but my expectations of this device are higher than what I have experienced to this point.
Like the previous customer, It's great for those urgent email messages. However I don't have a problem with the phone component. I love the keypad. I haven't had any problems with the reception. Might be area specific. Dropped calls rarely have anything to do with the phone, but rather the carrier.I have had one problem with the sim card. This was due to the fact that with the blackberry I had to change the sim card so that I would be on the cingular network and not the AT&T; network.I am enjoying the blackberry and I love the fact that I can set it up to turn off and on automatically.I hear the 8700 is better on the web browsing, but I like the sexiness of this phone.
Reception is horrible... Very hard to hear a conversation unless you have the bluetooth...People never hear me as well so the mic must be bad as well..Switched it 3 times and still the same... Drops calls and very bad reception.Not recommended...
Consistently dropped called, extermely poor reception (in areas where other blackberries work perfectly fine), horrendous ear-and-mouth-piece for both listening and speaking into, flawed flawed flawed performance...I mean I can't even use call waiting without dropping both lines. The half-QWERTY keypad is alright but you might want to go for the full keypad...otherwise it beats the purpose of having a blackberry. Address book maintence is poorer than a standard cell phone. I can't short-cut add a number into my addressbook without copying/pasting the number into my address book explictly. Overall...stay away from this piece of junk, wait a couple of months and shell some money for the Motorola Q (the RazorBerry).
It's a decent phone, and I've found T-Mobile service in NYC and Oakland/SF to be pretty decent, apart from the rare-but-annoying echo effect.The good: it's small, it's easy to look at, calls are clear, it's pretty simple to use, it gets good reception, it charges quickly and gets great battery life, the text-messaging autocomplete works well and makes SMS much easier on the thumbs.The bad: the phonebook is hard to use (only indexed by first letter), I find the outside surfaces scratch very easily, and it has only lasted me a couple of years under pretty light use.Now, I have dropped it - twice - on hard surfaces. I'm not saying it should live through that very often. But generally I keep it in my backpack in its own little compartment, and I don't use it very heavily - one or two calls a day, usually no more than 10 minutes. I open and close it gently and I don't drop things on it. It generally has a good life.Lately it has started to flicker on and off when I open it - meaning that if someone is calling, the call gets dropped. My expectations have been lowered enough regarding consumer electronics that I'm not totally outraged that a $200 device is dying after 2 years. But I do wish it would live a little longer.
I've enjoyed my 330!  It has performed as I have expected it to - equal to or better than ANY cellphone my friends, family or I have had (Moto, Nokia, Samsung).  It could be improved upon (not many couldn't), but it's been just what I wanted: speakerphone, good & clear voice quality, good screen color & legibility, good (not great, but good) software - and sturdy, too! Throw in the adequate camera and bluetooth, and after 8 months, my 330 & I are doin' just fine....
I dropped this phone from my 2nd floor apartment, it hit the concrete on my balcony, and then it fell onto the concrete sidewalk 15 ft. below and still worked! Nuff said
I've had phones with three companies now, and the two phones that I've owned from Motorola (V300 & V330) have been pretty poor experiences.  With the upgraded technology, I figured any bugs from the 300 would have faded away, but instead, I've found those bugs plus a couple of others.Someone mentioned charging problems.  This is definitely the case.  I have to sit there and fiddle with the phone for five minutes just to get it to charge.  I'll get "Unable to Charge" over and over and finally I'll hit that sweet spot.  It is at that point when I must set the phone down very softly so as not to disrupt the fragile nature of the phone.The other problem I've had has been the bars disappearing.  I'll be walking to my car and all of the sudden they'll just evaporate.  I won't have a clue what happened.  I'm not in a dead zone because I've talked to someone in the exact same spot before.I haven't been extremely happy with the phone.
This is the worst phone ever made.  It's side buttons are unlockable.  You can't set the ring style without making a sound.  It is hard to charge.  And it breaks.  The backlight on my first one broke, so I couldn't see the screen.  When I got the warranty replacement, it worked fine for a while until the ear speaker started cutting out.  I am still stuck with this phone until I can get a new one (which will not be a Motorola), but until then I have to deal with not being able to hear people.  It is so embarrasing to answer the phone and have to say,  "Hello?  Hello?  ...  Hello?" and wiggle it around until I can hear them.
Tmobile has replaced this phone 3 times.  same problem: frozen phone & dropped calls.  Tmobiles answer was to sell me (1) new phone (2) more services or (3) same phone again.  I just want them to fix the problem.
Well I got this phone in June05, and for about 4 months everything worked great. The Bluetooth connected perfectly, no dropped calls, etc. Then, things started going downhill. First, my Bluetooth became flaky - sometimes the person I was talking to would not hear me so I hung up and called without it. Not a big deal, but annoying. Then the battery life got bad. OK, I bought a new battery - fixed. Then, the kicker - the phone would magically just "lose" the network despite not moving the phone. Then, my signal was not as good at my house despite being perfect months earlier. So, I bought an aftermarket antenna - I got a small improvement. To this day, the phone still loses the network and drops calls like crazy; sometimes when showing 4 bars! This is my first time back to Moto since the old startacs and I probably won't be back. I just ordered an unlocked Sony Z520a and I'm sure it will not suck as bad as this phone.
Well other than the phone randomly turning off all the time with the battery being full I guess you could say it was a good phone.I have had two different motorola v330's and they have both had this problem from the day I got them.It turns off suddenly when your not  using the phone, it does it when your on calls and even when your sending text messages. When it turns off it lasts for about 10 to 20 seconds and as random as it turns off by it self it turns  back on also so if this wouldn't bother you I would say this is the phone for you
I bought two of these phones for my wife and myself.  She was the smarter of the two of us and went back to her old Nokia phone after a few weeks.  I had to prove I didn't make a mistake so I kept using it, much to my frustration.It constantly needs to be rebooted to access the network, especially after being plugged in to the car charger.  If it's plugged in, no one can reach me as it goes immediately to voicemail, and will not notify until after rebooting.I wish I had followed my wife's lead and given up on this POS earlier.
I really like this phone.  I bought it in May 2005 as an upgrade to a four-year-old Nokia.  I have personalized it with downloaded ringtones and I have used photos taken with the phone's camera as wallpaper.  Plus you can purchase cool color covers to change the phone as your mood dictates.  Of course they're not Motorola-sanctioned products, but they can be fun!So far I have had no problems with it, not even with the charger, which several reviewers seem to have issues with.  The sound is great, the phone book is adequate (I solve the multiple phone number problem by assigning different names, like "Lori home," Lori work" and "Lori cell" for a friend with three phone numbers) and it's easy to access the internet.  I even use it as a backup/travel alarm clock!!  The camera is not the greatest, but it is what it is, which is a cell phone camera.  I'm not big on text messaging or games, so the performance of those aspects of the phone are of no real concern for me.I do have two gripes, though.  The first is with the cheap ear piece/headset that comes with it - the little foam cover keeps coming off and it doesn't fit my ear very well so it is constantly falling out of my ear.  I got a Bluetooth headset when I purchased the phone, so I usually use that.  Plus it's nice to have the phone in your pocket or handbag and not have a wire/cord in your way.  Which leads me to my second gripe - it is a little "thick" when closed and kind of bulky when in a pocket.  But these are minor gripes and don't change my overall opinion of the phone.
this phone is ok as a phone.  it has no mp3, the pictures stink, and sometimes the bars disappear.  but i've dropped it so many times i've lost count, and it still works great (despite the multiple scratches).  if you're looking to get it solely for communication purposes and are a klutz like me, i would highly recommend this phone.  otherwise, get something else.
The phone was great - I got a blue tooth card for my computer and am copying photos and making custom ring tones.  That is really cool.  The battery charge time is great.  The camera is a cell phone camera - I guess you cannot expect too much.  I ported my phone number over and this may have caused problems with my rebate, but after 6 months I expect to get my rebate.  T-mobile network coverage is not as good as Verizon in my part of California.
I have this phone for just six months. I had charging problemafter using it for only four months. Today, this phone is deadbecause it can NOT be charged. The MOTO customer support askedme to send it back for a repair. How can you say this is aworkable solution? Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
Have never before  had such a poor experience with a single piece of electronic equipment. Returned the first one after 6 months as screen went dead. The replacement phone from T-mobile the screen failed again  after two months, and the 2nd replacement refused to charge after about a month. I threw in the towel and accepted a replacement of a different model phone.I'm going back to Nokia with whom I've had far better experience in the last 10 years. No more Motorola for me.
I had the V300 and it had decent features but had software bugs and the charger was the worst I have ever seen.  And the V330 did not improve on them at all.  This phone is horrible!!  Reboots constantly and you still gotta mess with the charger for an hour to get it to charge.  I doubt I will ever buy a Motorola product again.  STAY AWAY FROM THE V330!!
I would have liked to gvie this 2.5 stars.  I bought this phone in June '05.  This phone has many good features and almost all the same as the current razr v3 phone.  Its packed with a decent camera video recording and bluetooth.  My first problem with this phone was an issue with the charger.  The connecting cables are very very week and flimsy I have replaced the charger three times now.  The second problem I had was with the network.  The phone would have full service close to 5 bars and I wouldn't move the phone and then the service would go completely out or down to 1 bar.  It began to drop calls a lot around January and hasn't got any better.  The phone is extremely durable though 2 days ago June 12 06' I dropped the phone accidently from a four story building.  I thought for sure the phone was dead but I when I found it the phone was still working but the front screen broke.  Everything esle still works.  The last and final problem I had with this phone was Text Messaging I am a big Texter and this phone fails sending texts a lot.  You look in the outbox and it says cannot be sent when you have like 4 bars.  All and all pretty decent phone but many defects
I have had this phone since August, 2005. This is probably one of the worst phones I have ever purchased! Motorola puts out some the worst products. This is my third Motorola, all three being disapointing. This phone has a very clumsy feeling to it, and the screen part of the phone is not sturdy at all, it bends way back making the phone straight, instead of having a curve to it, like it should. Motorola has not updated the software in-beded into the phone. Beware, these Moto's like to glitch and turn themselves off, along with sending out-of-the-blue messages to other people's phones. My next phone will not be a Motorola! I will be looking into Samsung or LG. As for the service, I have been with T-mobile for three years now, but as each year passes, they seem to be getting worse. And, with rumors flying around that they're going to be bought out in the near future, I will be considering switching to Sprint. Sprint has the best phone selection out of all the carriers and carries the best phone maker I have come accross yet. Sanyo is known for it's quality products, and if I had my choice I would buy one, in a heart-beat! For all you I/M fanatics out there (like myself) the Motorola V330 still proves to have the best AIM software. As for my last phone (Samsung E315) I can't recommend that one to you. Thank you for your time, Brennen
This phone has all the specs for a nice phone with all of its features.The camera phone with 4 times zoom in,the internet browser,the display,and all the other features.Those other people saying that they have problems is probably because he bought it pre-owned.I buy stuff fresh out of the box.(exept video games)My parents wont let me get a cell phone but i looked at the features of this phone to the RAZR and there exactly the same.My dad has a RAZR and its ultra thin and all but i liked the v330 better.
I have had a cell phone since the early 1980's and had always bought Nokia Phones. I love this Motorola and will never buy another Nokia. I've had this phone over a year and love it. I can take a picture and send it to my t-mobile online album or send in a message. This phone does everything I need and more. I love it. I just bought a Motorola Razr V3 Magenta and hope it works as well as the V300!
I've had, under warranty, 4 V330 phones since switching to T-Mobile in July '05.  There is a software glitch that shuts down the phone at random.  After replacing the 5th one with a RAZR, my voice mail is not working.  I cancelled my contract with T-Mobile and will return to Cingular.
Note:  this review is for the V300, which is the predecessor for the V330.If you're looking for a phone that checks all of the boxes in a feature comparison grid, then look no further.  This phone does just about anything you could want it to do, which is the reason I bought it.  The problem is that it doesn't do any of those things particularly well.  One glaring example is the speakerphone:  it's a very nice feature to have, but you can't use it to dial a number or answer a call.  Your call has to be connected for a few seconds before the speakerphone can be used, which makes it pretty worthless if you intend for it to be a hands-free device.Functionally, I haven't had too many problems making the phone do what I want it to do, but the user interface can be counter-intuitive at times, and I've had several scenarios arise that make it clear that this phone underwent little to no usability testing.  For example, if you miss a call or receive a message while you're on the phone with someone else, the soft-key functions change.  That makes the phone behave unexpectedly if you're not looking at the screen, like the other day when, instead of turning on the speakerphone, the phone put my wife on hold and called my voicemail.Perhaps my biggest gripe about this phone is the charger design.  The connector for the charger is a small, delicate piece of plastic with multiple pins that have to make contact before it will work.  It's extremely susceptible to damage, and any debris whatsoever (such as dust, dirt, or hair) will disrupt the connection enough to prevent it from charging.  Why they won't use a simple pin connector (like Nokia, Sony/Errickson, Kyocera, Samsung, and others) is beyond me.All-in-all, this phone has too many issues for me to recommend it to anyone but the most patient of users.  Trying to get it to charge can be a maddening experience, and after a year of use, the user interface still baffles me from time to time.  I still can't decide if I'm going to use my "Customer-since-1998" status to get a new phone, or if I'm just going to dig my old Nokia 3390 out of the closet, but I do know that either choice will be better than continuing to use this phone.
I have used tons of motorola phones over the years from the v120 to the v330.  The v330 does have a couple problems with it well at least for me it did. After a couple months I had problems using the chargers.  I switched out 4 chargers, and each one would work good for a couple weeks, then you would have to fiddle with them to charge the phone.One thing they didn't mention the review though, is the ability to listen to the radio on the phone.  Thing is you need to buy a special headset, I haven't got the headset myself t-mobile wanted $50 for it.  But my overall review of the phone is if you have the chance pass on this one.  There's alot more models out, and ones that have less bugs then this phone has.
I got it for my son, the price seemed good. He complains that the battery life is poor and it takes 6 hours to charge the phone. The phone quality is not that great either. He dropped it and had to replace it and buy a really good case. The camera is just o.k. If I had the choice again I would spend more and get something better.
I have owned this phone for about a year and am going to switch to a new phone once my contract expires.  One week after I received my phone it would not turn on.  I returned it and got another new phone but a few weeks later I started having audio problems.  If I talk on the phone for more than 15 minutes the call usually gets dropped and there is horrible static on the line.  I talked to T-mobile about this audio problem and they sent me another new phone.  This is the 3rd new phone and I am still having the same audio problems and dropped calls.  I gave up trying to report my problem to T-mobile (since they insist that this phone is perfectly fine) and am just waiting to switch to a new phone once my plan ends.
I bought this phone in June 2006 with a 150$ rebate, but I still did not receive the rebate by Nov 7, 2006, called them tons of times, The reply is "Please wait another 6-8 weeks to get the rebate", so be cautious about the rebate when oreder a 1 cent cell phone.
1. phone: the phone is very cute. this was my very first cell phone and for the first few weeks i loved it. but then i noticed that the pictures were fuzzy and i said "no big, i don't have to take pictures." but then i started making calls on it and on it's loudest volume (7) i couldn't even hear what the person was saying. i had to put it on speaker phone. also i found it really hard to charge.2. T-Mobile service plan: the first year i had this phone everything was ok but then i got hooked on im-ing people on it. so my mom up my text messages to unlimited. a few months after i never had a problem but 3 months before my plan was over i got a bill for over $600 for im-ing people. i was grounded and my phone got taken away and my mom refused to pay the bill. my mom  called t-mobile and they gave me some BS lie about signing on aim on my phone to IM people costed money, so i didn't use my phone for a month. the next bill came and it said i had to pay the last bill. my mom called t-mobile and started screaming. it turns out, they lied saying that it costed money to IM people on my cell phone, when online it says it's a text message. so they gave us credit but my mom was angry at them soo much she cancelled my plan.Over all i hated my cell phone because it got me in trouble, so i am never gonna use T-Mobile phones ever again.
This is the worst phone i ever used till now. If you need to delete any contact information, you will not get a second chance to recover for what you thought a second ago. Software used is very annonying.
Good points: It just plain works. Nothing more, nothing less. I've yet to drop all call in my area, but your mileage may vary since it depends on the Sprint network. Activation was rather quick and painless. It was on within 5 minutes of my call to VM.Medium points:  I'm a light user who already has a home phone, so I don't really mind the rates. I barely even spent five dollars on minutes this month. I usually end up making a few extra calls I wouldn't do otherwise just to burn up some minutes before top-up time. However, if you don't already have a home phone, you'd be better off with a regular monthly plan from another carrier. No stars added or taken away because of this point, since your mileage may vary.The flashlight is a nice added bonus, which comes in handy since I work nights and it gives enough light to unlock my door, but not much more. This point is kinda trivial, so it doesn't add or cost any stars from me.Bad points: Several reviewers have mentioned the spontaneous shutoff, which I find trivial, but enough to cost a star. Pop the battery out and put it back, it's just fine for a couple of weeks or so.Also, the regular speaker is not as loud as I would like, so every time I make or get a call, I have to press the loudspeaker button. Maybe this should not have any bearing on the review since my hearing has been damaged by years of loud rock'n'roll, but there goes another star anyway.Overview: It just works. If you're a tightwad like me, get it, but if you're willing to spend a bit more because of the bad points I mentioned, do it.
I got this phone for only $10 after thanksgiving last year, and i think i got my money outta it! It works very nice! Here are teh pros and cons for this phone.Pros:-flashlight-small-amazing battery life-great storage-good games-great menu-and a lot more!cons:-the buttons are hard to press, because they are all in a line-like many other people said, it does turn off about once a month, and all you have to do is take out the battery, then put it back in. The phone is good as new.-there is no camera, but thats not to bad- its a black and white screen, not colorBut overall, I think this phone is very nice. There are a few problems, but nothing really big that should prevent someone from buying this phone.This year after thanksgiving, a store has the Kyocera Oystr for $10, so I'm getting that. I've read reviews on it and there have been a few problems with battery life, but I'll see when I get it. And I can always return it if its really bad and go back to the shorty. I would stay with the shorty, but i really want a flip phone and color.The Virgin mobile service is great too, I love it. My dad reccomended it to me last year when I got the phone. $20 every 3 months? It doesn't get much better than that! I'll follow up with what happens with the shorty and he oystr after I get it!
This phone works great and sounds great. We got it as a replacement for a mostly emergency cell phone, but it sounded much better than the one it replaced and was cheaper too.  We now may get another for the grandparents.The one problem we have found is that the power button on top can become stuck underneath the plastic housing if it is pushed too hard and not pushed straight down.  This can be easily fixed with a small screwdriver, but is annoying nonetheless.All in all, a good buy with Virgin mobile's current deal.
I don't use a cell phone much.  This phone is great for light users.  The phone is cheap but functional.  The Virgin prepaid plan allows light users to pay essentially $20 every three months, less than $7.00 per month.  Every now and then you can find a sale on prepaid cards and get them below face value.If you're shopping for this phone on sale, look for deals with free airtime.  You can usually find a deal.I've had no problems with the Virgin service area.  I'm told they use the Sprint network.  My family had Sprint for years, and we found their coverage area was good.  For light users, Virgin is cheaper.I don't use the features very much.  I have used the built-in light a few times.  There is a silent mode. There is a key guard.  It's not perfect, but it's better than my previous phone.  I'm a guy, and I often carry the phone in my pants pocket.  For those occasions, the recessed antenna is a plus.  Some places you just don't want to get poked.
With a fully charged battery, the Nokia Shorty dies about once a week. I have to open up the battery cover, take out the battery for just a second, and then replace it, at which point the phone will power back on. I actually returned the phone once to get it replaced because I thought I just had a bum one. Then my replacement kept doing it and I realized there's just some sort of general problem with this type of phone. I searched the internet and have found many other people saying the same thing about it suddenly dying. I'm not a big chatter and use this phone solely for receiving important emergency-like calls from family members. And in saying that, it's very frustrating to know while you're walking around with the shorty in your pocket, the phone might be dead at that very moment.Besides that, it's a really cheap seeming phone. It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is. When you call customer support you are greeted with a recording that's all "hey what's up!" instead of just a regular professional environment. And the phone doesn't offer any free 'normal' ring-tones. There's only a couple crunked out ghetto ones. I just keep the phone on vibrate anyway but it'd definitely be nice if they could have the decency to throw in a normal ring-tone for free rather then only low-rider crunky music.It's a good phone if you're dirt poor like I am. If I had any money I'd get rid of it in a heart-beat.Oh, I have one more complaint. There's no volume scroll thing or anything, so you have to press the keypad during conversation to turn up the phone. But if you've been dialing numbers (like if you're calling your bank "press 1 for checking account" etc, then because you've entered numbers into the phone, you have to clear them all out before you can turn up or down the volume. So if you've just pressed 9 different digits, you have to sit there and hold clear for ten seconds before you can utilize the volume control. It's super stupid.
The Shorty is perfect. This phone is uncomplicated and does not bother you with useless options. I recommend the shorty to anyone that loves simplicity.
I only had this phone for 3 weeks, but those 3 weeks were very good with this phone.Its so small and portable, but I was offered the Snapper, which I did switch to. I like the flashlight, its useful and a unique idea. The phone gets a good signal in most places, and only had 1-2 dropped calls. This phone is very reliable and easy to use.
I'm an adult, infrequent user.Pros:Small, no antenna, don't have to flip open, sunlight viewable, voice activated dialer, speakerphone, automatic keyguard, calendar, easy texting modes, good value plan at $5/month with carry forward balance, voice clarity and communication is good.Cons:Doesn't show who left a voice message, dropped out and had to remove battery twice to reboot over the past year, sometimes shows a weak but operating signal but won't actually connect.So, it works for me, I'm happy with it.  Set up my Mom and father-in-law with this phone also.
I have had only one cell-phone model in the past, so I may not be the perfect judge.  My previous cell was the Mobile Timeport p8767, with Verizon service. I had all the extras: mutiple antennaes, cases, indoor and auto chargers, PC link and software, link to palmtop computer, extra batteries etc.The Nokia Shorty 2115i is really great. Cost $25 and FREE FEDEX shipping and $25 of call credit was provided. One only needs to TOP UP every 90 days, so it is esentially $7 a month with tax. This $7 can apply to the $0.18 minutes.The features are convenient and intuitive once you run through them a few times.  The RADIATION is about 1/2 of what the TimePort produced from a Govt website.
As a 45 year old Virgin Mobile customer, I get teased all the time.  A few years back I needed a cell phone so I could leave the house and not miss a call from my boss for work assignments.  I liked the idea of pay as you go even though I have excellent credit.  Also had 2 teenagers on the go and wanted to test out the service.  Bought the big Party Animal.  Actually loved it and bought 3 more for the family. After a couple years we thought we'd try the Audiovox.  My phone didn't work right from day one.  My family kept theirs. I waited for the Shorty.  Just an inexpensive phone with an inexpensive plan.  Works great.  I text a lot more than make calls.  I enlarge the text so I don't need glasses, and select loudspeaker and hear just fine.  Yeah, it could be considered boring, but if you simply need a phone - it works great.  I haven't had a shut off problem I've read about - I never turn mine off. No external antenae is a plus.I have all the latest gadgets so I'm looking for a decent phone only.My fiance on the other hand...Can't stuff enough stuff into a phone for his taste!
As reported by others, this phone does turn itself off spontaneously even when the battery is well charged, necessitating removal and replacement of the battery before it can be turned back on.  This has happened four times in the last two months, but otherwise the phone has performed well.  It's small, light, and reasonably easy to use.My only other complaint (minor) is that the phone doesn't come with a "generic ring" ringtone.  It has a selection of techno-hip ringtones (with names like EvilPizz and KrunkTone) that I fear are entirely too hip for me, but I can't bring myself to pay extra for a normal ring.
I use it with Virgin Mobile. They use Sprints digital network, so service in only as good a Sprints digital network (minimal digital service in rural areas). At least once a week I have to remove and then reinsert the battery as the phone goes dead.
When I dwindled with the idea of purchasing this item, I DID do the math CORRECTLY and saw it was a great deal to get for emergency calls or the like. I never considered it as an ACTUAL phone with monthly plan though. I've had this phone for some time already, and I have to say the service is incredible. And about the person who said about the access fees....I gotta give it to ya....you liar. I have yet to recieve any of those on my account....guess they probably just wanted to rip YOU off. As my phone is only for any emergencies out on the road, I have gone these three past months with only the purchase of ONE $20 top-up card. So I have seen how NO access fee have been applied to my account.I am overall content with this service and product and I would recommend it to anyone who would need a phone, especially someone  that isn't a big talker.
I bought it after Thanksgiving 2005 and have been using it daily without any problems.
This phone has gret service, and doesn't break easily. (Trust me, I'd know I've dropped it too many times to count!!!) It has long lasting battery power. I've left it on for an entire weekend without neeeding to charge it. It's the perfect size: Not too small that you can't text, but not too big that it sticks out of your pocket.  The only downside to it would be that there is no camera or color. So if your not into a phone for style, just service, then this is an awesome phone for you!!! If you want style, but good quality I suggest a different VirginMobile phone. If your just into looks and nothing else then you might want to try a razr.
I set this up for my little sister. It has very few features (compared to the cameras coming out). It works as a phone very well which is what it should do.Another thing to note is it uses the same software as a lot of the other "brick" nokia phones (Nokia 3588i and 6016i). I was able to figure it out right away.It's very small. Good young children or adults that want to put it in their pockets without feeling the weight in their pockets.Virgin Mobile was easy to setup. It took me 15 minutes to fill everything up and get it going. The website said it would take over a day to activate but an e-mail appeared in my inbox in ten minutes with my phone number.If I didn't care about my phone number and already get stuck with another 2-year contract with Sprint, I would definitely go this route. I highly recommend it for the casual cell phone user or in my mom's case an emergency phone for my little sister.
This is not about the Nokia Shorty. This is about Virgin MobileWhatever you do, DON'T buy Virgin Mobile "Top-up" cards from retailers. They expire in 3 months and if you don't top up, they refuse to credit your account for the amount of the card. My daughter was given 2 Top-up cards for Christmas. She used one in February, but when she went to Top-up again in late Mar. they told her the card had expired. There was no "fine print" anywhere on the card stating they expire. I spent an hour on the phone with customer service and they resolutely refused to credit the account. So we were out $50!!!
The phone works great thanks to Sprint but the Virgin customer service is horrible. The web site is inaccurate and the phone reps are poorly trained. I have nothing but problems topping-up my account. I am switching.
To comment on the VirginMobile:It's a great service to have for the inbetween time or in case of emergencies. I bought a Shorty when I was inbetween switching wireless service providers and couldn't afford to be disconnected from my work. It served the purpose... but I quickly learned that $20 doesn't get you far on this thing- after a week of making two-minute calls per day, I had to top up twice. $40 per week IS a little expensive- Nextel would give you 300 free incoming minutes for that amount.The service really IS a rip off and it is E-X-P-E-N-S-I-V-E!!!But then, you have to understand that the service is target towards teens, hence the name Shorty. Also, calling the customer support center is pretty difficult because they address you as if you are calling from your 3rd period math class. The conversation becomes all giddy and full of phrases such as "We'll hook you up..." Not really what you want to deal with if you're older than 15.But back on track- its targeted to teens with the idea that teens will run up all of their minutes within a day and leave their parents trying to foot another $20 "top-up".
i love this phone at sometimes but it so dull and boring make it colorful instead of black and white
I should not even give it one starI will give it no star.Bad Things-can not hear when you are talking to someone-batterie dies SO fast-The bottons are wayyyy to small-the screen is really smallI could go on all dayGood Things-ohh i forgot there is noneBottom line DO NOT GET THIS PHONE
Ordered 2 phones with 'pay as you go' service.No one was home to accept the package so it was sent back to the local FedEx office.Called FedEx to have the package re-routed since I work during the day.  FedEx said a 'Re-route' could only be done by the shipper.Called Virgin Mobile customer service to have the package re-routed.  I was rudely informed that it can't be done and was basically told if I didn't like it, I should just return the phones.I refused the delivery from FedEx and was told I would recieve a refund.Months have passed.  I've called Virgin Mobile's customer service many times to discuss my refund.  I've filed complaints with BBB and FCC.STILL no refund.
Hey LyndaI think that you should read it this review again. I should point out that some of the plans contains hidden fees like the minute 2 minute plan. They charge you 25 cents for the first 10 minutes before you can get 10cents a minute after that. If you use ony 10 minutes its $2.50. 20 minutes will be $3.50 and so on.If you think about it's almost just like a $1.50 access fee which is included in the first ten minutes. Also When I was doing the math, I was making an assumption that the average number of minutes of usage per month was 300 minutes at an average of 10 minutes per day for 30 days straight which is roughly the normal amount for people who don't use their cell phones often. It is only an estimate. I'm just trying to point out the fact that even if you don't use your phone every day, and if you add up all the days that you actually use you phone along with the cost that was assess that day, you will realize that it is not really worth it.
Don't expect this phone to work any better than a Motorola V551. I wrongly thought with the price as high as it was that I'd have perfect reception and no dropped calls. Nothing has changed.Don't get me wrong, this matte black phone is slim and sexy and lightweight fun and easy to slip into a pocket. But those are it's biggest draws.Some other cons include:-The large square screen and key pad get dirty easily from holding the phone up to your face. I don't wear make-up, but if I did, I can imagine that I'd always be taking a toothpick to all of those little crevices between the keys on the flat keypad all the time. As it is now, I'm constantly wiping the screen and keys.-The battery life is not long and if you're going anywhere overnight, remember to bring your charger.-The operating system is the same as other newer model Motorola phones, so don't expect a big upgrade there either.If Cingular is your provider, the sim card from your current phone will work in this unlocked version nicely. However, make sure you've saved all of your numbers and info on the card and not on the old phone before you take the sim card out of the old phone, because it doesn't slip into this phone very easily. Once it's in, it is difficult to remove.If you have some extra money to spend on a new phone and you don't mind the same reception problems as cheaper phones, then this is the phone for you.
I purchased this phone from Amazon last week.  I have tried several chargers and this will not charge.  I called Motorola and they say this is not a U.S. issued phone and therefore they will provide no warranty on it at all.
The RAZR is a nice phone, but this review isn't about that, instead it is about the people selling it which is just as important.  If you haven't dealt with Tiger Direct lately or at all, then you should be aware that they sell refurbs and open box items and have changed from a decent seller to completely clueless.  Their customer support is non-existant and if the item is not in stock, then they won't bother letting you know.  You will sit around wondering why your package never arrived because you won't get a live person on the phone and they don't answer email until a month later.  It is better to check [...] or any other price comparison site using the keywords "Unlocked RAZR" where you will get it cheaper and can be assured that the product is coming from a reputable seller.  Tiger Direct is probably the worst electronics dealer on the net because they are so big and feel they don't have to care about their customers.  Hopefully, you go somewhere else and save yourself a headache.  These people just don't care.
If you are even slightly rough on cell phones than this is NOT the phone for you! I dropped mine less than two feet (about knee high) and now everytime I flip it shut it turns off and the screen goes blank (white) everytime I try to turn it back on. There are alot of people (at least 4) that I know that have the same exact problem with this phone!!!
This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone. I've owned a Timeport, v66, and v600. The Timeport was simply terrible. The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable. It's nice not having to carry around an extra charger when I'm already lugging around my laptop and its power supply.
First of all let me say that I did not purchase my RAZR from Amazon. I purchased my phone from my local Cingular store. I have wanted one of these phones since they first came out. Here is a breakdown of my opinion of the phone:PROS:*Thin, elegent looking phone. When the phone is opened it really is amazing how thin it is.*Suprisingly durable. Despite the fact that it is so thin, it is relatively hardy. I thought it would be easy to break (especially when open) but it is a sturdy little phone.*Large, vivid screen. The inside screen is quite large and images, menus, colors, etc. show up very well. (As with all cell phones, it is harder to see in bright daylight though.) Outside screen convenient.*Speaker phone is better than on other phones I've had (mostly I've had Samsung).*It is a desired phone, and every time I get my phone out someone makes a comment about it.*Some other reviews have mentioned problems with the volume of calls, and that menus are clumsy. I disagree with this. I have not had any problems with either of these. As a matter of fact, I like that you can rearrange pretty much any of the menus you want to. Placing what you use most at the top of the page and what you use least at the bottom. I have also not had problems with dropped calls.CONS:*Outside screen does not display time in such a manner that is easy to see when the phone is not in use (you must push one of the side buttons or open the phone to light up the outside screen).*As mentioned in other reviews, the phone collects fingerprints and oils from your skin very easily. I have to wipe off the screen and buttons every single time I use it. Especially if I have on makeup when I use it.*Twice since I have had the phone (I've had it close to a year) it has just shut down on me. The so-called "white screen of death" I suppose. Luckily a cold restart (taking out the battery for 10 seconds and then turning the phone back on) solved the problem.THE ONE REAL PROBLEM:The only thing that was frustrating to me about this phone is that within a few weeks of getting the phone I started to notice sone dust collecting under the main inside screen. Over time more and more collected. Within 3 months, the whole bottom right corner was just covered in dust and it was maddening. And there was nothing you could do about it since it was underneath the screen. Luckily my phone was under warranty, so Cingular replaced it for me. Would you believe the new one they sent me did the SAME THING! Actually it collected dust faster then the first one I'd had. Feeling quite frustrated, I called customer service again, and the sent me ANOTHER phone. Luckily this time no dust collected under the screen. I've had this last replacement now for 8-9 months and haven't had the problem again.Overall, I really have loved my RAZR. Once I got the dust problem resolved, I have had no other complaints. I would recommend that if you purchase this phone, make sure you also get a warranty, and watch closely for dust accumulation. If you don't experience that problem, I hope you enjoy this phone as much as I have.
It is both stylish and functional. Black by far is the best color. Great reception and worth the price. The only problem with the phone is it is a fingerprint magnet but you can clean it. It is pretty durable i have dropped it three times and no scratches though i would recomened buying a case. Also beware of the bluetooth eats up your battery. The video quality is pretty good it can record up to a minute if ajusted. I recomend getting the Usb data cable and software for the phone so you can put your emails,data, etc. on your phone. In concluesion worth the buy.
Phone works fine in general.  Two issues I have are:1) European edition phone means:  charger is European and includes a US adapter (cumbersome), Time is in 24 hr format and can't be changed to 12 hr format, Date is in YY/MM/DD format and can't be changed to MM/DD/YY format2) Volume is too low
I read the other reviews, heard about the dreaded "white screen" and figured it couldn't happen to me.It did.  Now I will be without this POS until Motorola can fix what apparently is a design flaw.  There is a problem with the flip design as, like others, my phone shuts off when I close it, or it will shut off during a call, or it will cycle off at any time-with no warning.Of course it is 6 days past the return point for Amazon.I really used to like this phone-but I need reliable.
Reading the previous reviews I was worried I would get stuck with a phone without the US adapter.Good news, I got the US adapter. Bad news, all the documentation including the manual was in Spanish. I had to go online to read the US manual. Also no leather carrying case as advertised.On the plus side. I received a USB cable along with PC software to link my outlook address book and pics/videos easily to the phone.The phone is very cool.
I got my Black Razor with a new Cingular contract about a year ago, and have been happy with it in every way.  Easy to use, and seemed to be very well constructed.  I had dropped it on hard surfaces a few times with no problem, but it wasn't until last week that I found out how truly tough this phone is.  I accidentally left it in the pocket of my pants.  It went into the wash, 40 minutes underwater with agitator and even a second rinse cycle.  Then it went into the dryer undetected, and spent about an hour and twenty minutes banging around on high heat.  When I pulled the pants out of the dryer and felt the phone in the pocket, I groaned and figured I was out a phone.  Being optimistic, I removed the battery and left the case open until I returned from work.  The battery, of course, was shot; but when I put the battery from my wife's Razor in it and pressed the ON button, it acted like nothing had ever happened.  Worked perfectly, even with water still behind the LCD screen.  The water eventually dried out, and I'm still using the phone with no problem.  I can't believe an electronic device could survive this.  INCREDIBLE!
Well, I can think of only two good reasons to buy this phone.  The first is that you actually need a phone (and who doesn't these days?).  Finally, the looks.  That's about it.Pros:-Thin and sleek-Decent battery life (with proper battery care and charging routine)-Decent speakerphoneCons:-Many are known for accumulating dust under the LCD protective screen-Low earpiece volume-Very weak vibrate-Slow user interface, a pain when sending text messages (if you're an avid texter like I am) or when using phone tools and features-Beauty fades as smudges and fingerprints begin to show.  I am continuously wiping mine and washing my hands (hey, aesthetics are an issue for some people)-5mb of storage space only-Camera quality is 0.3 Megapixels!  That is far less than half of what you find on most camera phones today (1.0, 1.3, and up)-Device has been notorious for dropping callsBuy this phone only to use it as a phone (phone calls, texts, etc.).  If you don't go overboard with the features, everything should be okay.
When I got the V3, I was very disappointed. Their was a buzzing sound in the backgroud (I've heard a lot of complaints about this...).  The sound is too low, which makes it hard to hear people when you're talking to them. Only supports MP3's that are of very low quality for ringtones. There isn't an MicroSD support, so no removeable storage for pictures.I would go with the V3i, V3x (If you have Cingular, don't get the V3x, it doesn't support the 850 GSM Band that Cingular uses.), or the MING (A1200).NOTE: These phones can not be washed in the washing machine, you can ask my friend Kaia...what a ditz heh.
Beyond making and receiving calls, I don't use many of the features this phone offers.  The phone is solidly built and very stylish.  My only problem with it is that the menus are cumbersome to navigate for doing, what I consider, rather mundane things.
One of the other reviewers complained about the "Next Call Only" for Caller ID. This is how the Caller ID feature works:You can either have Caller ID turned on all the time and then use the "Next Call Only" feature on your phone to turn it off for just the next call.ORYou can have Caller ID turned off all the time and then use the "Next Call Only" feature on your phone to turn it on for just the next call.That reviewer must have it set to the second option. This person needs to call their cell phone service provider and ask them to switch it so that Caller ID is turned on all the time.Here is an excerpt from their review:"I've not even had the phone for twelve hours, and the main problem I have with it is that I cannot seem to get the "Next Call Only" caller ID to change to something like "All Calls," if possible. What is the point in having only your next call show your caller ID? I don't see the point in that because, more often than not, private calls are disregarded by those who receive them. I almost didn't get a hold of two of my friends within a few hours of each other because my ID didn't show up."
We have gone through 3 of these phones if you just breath on it the sticker under the battery goes red = Wet.And Tada your warenty is worth nothing
Everything I received was in tiptop shape. I even received software for downloading pictures, creating ringtones, syncing with Outlook, etc. It was easy to install and works with ALL Motorola phones. My friends with a RAZR didn't get the software!Keep in mind this is the EUROPEAN version of the RAZR. This means that "personalize" is spelled "personalise", "center" is spelled "centre", and call fowarding is called "call divert."(Considering I saved $100 I don't mind putting up with British spelling!)I popped in my sim card and I was using it instantly. I'm not found of the vertical phone holder because it bunches up and pinches. So, I bought the sideload leather pouch (about $10) and I am extremely pleased.
You can get this phone much cheaper with a US adapter. Buy it from Cingular as a go-phone for 219 with tax. It is immediately ready for use with your pre-existing cingular plan or go to motox.us to unlock the phone and add features like the video camera if it isnt inculded.
Got the phone a week ago and immediately hit the road with it on a trip to Malaysia.  Works great.  Only problems i have are with the discription of this listing.  Same problems others have mentioned that need to be corrected.1.  Phone comes preped for Spanish language (changeable after a while of fumbling through espanol menus)2.  Only comes with Spanish manual/Warranty info3.  No leather caseLike I said, good phone but the package is not what is advertised.  Be warned.-nh
I am very happy with this unlocked phone I purchased from Amazon. Purchase & delivery was fast/easy. I can use this phone in US & overseas with international phone compnies. I am glad I went with Amazon.
The phone works fine.  It had some bizzare things about it when received - it came with a European plug on the charger and a US plug adapter that didn't work.  I bought a new plug adapter and the charger then worked.  Also there were all sorts of strange photos already loaded on the supposively new telephone... but the phone works fine so I can't really complain.
I have found that although it is fairly easy to use, it drops a LOT of calls and also seems to "lock up" quite often.  There have been several times that I have tried to use it and it will shut down or freeze and take up to a minute to become usable again.  I've also had many calls I didn't receive, but almost immediately had a message indicated.  It doesn't ring, even though I show that I have good signal.  I think my next purchase will be another NOKIA.  I've had quite a few and they have never given me these kinds of problems.
I bought a black unlocked RAZR through Amazon, which was shipped from Tiger Direct. It works fine, but it was a European version. The AC charger plug was European with a US adapter. In the menu Personalize is spelled the English way "Personalise." I hope there are no other differences in the software.
I've had my V3 for a year now so I can comfortably say the followingProsI never thought my V3's strongest asset would be its damage resistance, but thanks to the high quality metal parts, this phone is a rock. I never use a cover, or protection but after a year this phone is still looking pretty sweet.What I once considered a flimsy novelty, I truly now see as a durable phone that I'll have for as long as any other phone.ConsThere are features that will drive you nuts. The BEEPING when the phone is low on batteries is torture. I have smahsed this phone on the ground because it drove me so nuts. ANd to my knowledge you cant turn off this feature.... its beeping right now aswell... aaaargh!Volume level is questionable.This phone is not your feature packed device. If your looking for a pda phone, leave this alone. If your looking for a slim, fashionable phone with simple features... this one is perfect.
after reading the other previous reviews about this phone i was hesitant but there was no need to be. i got my phone the very next day when i paid for that so shipping was amazing and so is the phone. it was brand new, out of the original box and all. yes it is european but i turned it on and it was already english and the manual was as well. no problems whatso ever even the adapter was in there so everything was exactly as advertised
Well after my free phone from cingular broke I was stuck, they were not able to offer me any kind of deal until my 2 year contract was up.  I really wanted a razr so I went looking.  This was the cheapest one I could find so I went for it.  It came with the euro charger, but it had a small adpater that made it fit the american outlets.
I love my unlocked motorola phone.  I took it to Italy and Portugal and was able to buy the local sim card there - and used it to call back home for half the price of what my carrier would have charged me to use their service - the phone worked great - and i dropped it -oooops several times and it still worked perfectly!!!! No regrets and I'm looking forward to using it more internationally - it worked great in Mexico as well - AMazon was perfect - no complaints!
This review is unfortunately NOT for the phone but for the service Amazon provides! I had placed an order for the phone and Amazon took a long time shipping it..I didnt get the phone when I needed it and I ended up cancelling the order. I was told the package was on a truck and apparently the truck never left I guess!
My son purchased his Razr at a HIGH dollar price. It does have GREAT features but he only had it a little more than a month and the whole screen went white !!! For the price and "high technise" of this phone you would think the screen would be Higher quality.If you purchase one be very careful.Dont just carry it in your pocket.
The razer is ok but i think it might be a referbished piece since i am having with the volume of the phone. the volume is very low and its hard to hear people clearly. amazon took lot of time for shipment. overall it was not a great experiance at amazon.
I received the phone, which was brand new, as far as I could tell, but everything else inside the package looked used, the manual was dogeared, and some of the internal packaging itself showed significant wear and tear.  Phone seems to work fine, bbut nowhere in the advertisement did it say anything about refurbished or used products.  I was a little surprised, and disappointed...
I bought this cell phone for my brother who does not live in the US, when he set the phone on charge first, it wasn't getting charged at all, showed it at a Motorola Showroom and found out the battery was dead. He had to replace the battery. I would not repeat buying similar products again.
I use this phone daily with Cingular service in Northern California. (Sacramento, San Fran, Monterey) I have no complaints about the phone. The screen is large and clear. The keypad is large and easy to read. Some people complain that this phone isn't very loud. Mine does does not have this problem.My one complaint is the power cord is proprietary. I hate anything designed to force me to give a company repeat business. If Motorola wants repeat business, they need to earn it. If you use a USB connector on your phone it should accept chargers for devices with the same connector that have the same electrical specs. Motorola purposely broke it. That will cause me to be hesitant about buying their products in the future.
IT'S VERY CHEAP AND I USE MY CELLPHONE IN PANAMÁ AND COSTA RICA WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. THE PHONE HAVE A GOOD CAMERA WITH RESOLUTIÓN ACCEPTABLE, GOOD.
I purchased the product because of its features and yes its great, but it had some issues and Amazon could guarrantee me the same exact one i had when they replace it. this is got me very angry and am not to this very day satisfied. I wanted to buy a big screen LCD TV from here but i put it off due to this issue. and I do not think i will buy another electronic form here again. i will stick with books and maybe CD's.
I have been with nextel for nearly a year now I started out this time last year with the Motorola i205 and just upgraded to the i265 it is one of the best phones I have ever had the service is the best I have ever had I have no problems making or reciving calls. If you are considering nextel give it a shot they are in my opinion the best cell company out there.
I just got it and have to say its easy to use, i can hear the person talking just fine and i have had no problems dealing with nextel.
if you get rid of the stupid connotation that a cell phone has to be so small you have to hold it with tweezers. You're gonna love being able to browse the web on it, watch movies you took of your kid, write sms and take care of business or fun while in boring 4-hour meetings, its calendar which reminds you of all important dates and dates of your life, you're gonna love the fact that when you spot coppers you just have to opent it, put it on your lap and you can continue your convo inconspicuously on speakerphone until darned police is out of your hair. I'm a chick and when I see huge huys handling miniature phones I CHOKE WITH LAUGHTER. This phone can fit in my pants pocket, and when/if I dont have a pocket to stick it in, I've been known to carry it in my boot, bra, and stuck in my pants on my back. And it it fits into a chick's boot/bra, then its not too big for what it offers. I've owned communicators for 5 years now and I will NEVER EVER be without one. Nuff said.
I bought this phone last year as a business phone, integrating its capabilities with my work and business life.Wireless conectivity is a big plus connecting to wireless networks its great i use it home and outside, music is available as an mp3 player, all office products available also camera and a cool keyboard for typing.Try ti get third party programs such i use as power safe and PDF and other stuff, one big thing from my experience, the phone doesnt recognize my home wireless network while blue tooth is switched on, when i turn it off it doscoveres the network so wireless doesnt work with blutooth at the same time!!i coudnt find till now a connection to car audio with this phone, so i cant listen to music on my car audio, i coudnt find a separate phone stand also for it.the package includes the desk stand with charger and head phones only.As i said its a  business phone, i have another phone motorola Razr v3i for daily use because the Nokia 9500 is big i use only for meetings and business life.THanks,;)
This phone is designed to keep you in contact from where ever you are.  Cell, WiFi, bluetooth, etc.  All work as advertised.By most standards, it is large and heavy but, it is the best phone that I have ever used.With T-mobile in my area, the 9500 has the best signal of any phone that I've ever had.  I also like that I can place the phone on a flat surface and use it similar to a laptop computer.  Placing calls in my car, searching for contacts, phone numbers, speakerphone, etc. is very convenient using this method.Outstanding product by Nokia.
Just got the phone today, and after a short test I am returning the phone today.What a disappointment. I am currently a Nokia 6820 owner and I was I was expecting a slick phone with a lot of ease of use, and instead all I got was a brick of a phone with minimal features.Cons:- This phone is huge!  It looks like you took a cordless phone and were carrying that around as your cell phone. To give you an image you could hold up a croissant to your ear and it would be smaller than this phone, and look less silly!:)- Speakerphone only works when the clamshell is open.  When I am driving down the road, I like to put my phone into speaker mode.  In order to do that you have to open up the clamshell which is a real drag, since it will only waste battery power to display the screen to run the speaker.- No thumb joystick.  On the 6820, one of the best things about the phone is the ability to quickly navigate with the thumb joystick.  That has been eliminated on this phone.- Keyboard is ok, but I type faster on the 6820. Given the large size of the 9500 you need to balance the phone more to type.  If you are a hunt and peck typer this may be ok for you, but if you are used to typing up a quick reply in less than 10 seconds this is not the phone for you.- Can't check email from the main display. Once again in order to look at email you have to open the clamshell.  You should be able to look at emails from the outside of the phone.- No easy PDF viewer.Pros-+ 128MB Memory Card+ Word, Excel, Powerpoint viewer, but it doesn't have the pdf capability that I could find.+ Sound quality of the phone and the speaker phone are up to Nokia standards.I had high hopes for this phone, but it does not deserve the Nokia name.Soren
I'm a civil engineer and i was looking for a PDA which could help mainly as an agenda and for keeping notes during the meetings.I have used three windows-os based PDA's but I found that the operating system was not fully reliable and software was sometimes complicated to use.It happened to me with the I-mate JASJAR ( generally a quite good machine ) to loose one important meeting because the alarm didn't ring and twice the software crashed while I was writing extremely important notes.I moved to the nokia communicator 9500 and I loved the software that perfectly suits my requirements ( agenda, short notes, some calculations, good alarm, some small use of e-mail and web ).If compared to the I-MATE JASJAR the Nokia is well built but a little bulky ( a little bit too long and thick for my pocket ), the screen has only 8 lines while working with word ( compared with about 12 of the I-mate ) and processor is slower ( particularly if you open large files ).However the software is so reliable and easy to use that I could never go back to windows OS any more.
This is a professional business phone. Apart from the routine stuff in the mobile phones , 9500 has fax/ data feature this is the best thing I like about this phone. You can send & receive faxes. Now that makes you real mobile.Although it is bulky but I think one gets used to it pretty soon.Excel, Word, Power point documents can be viewed & edited.The screen size is wide (112mm wide) so browsing email is cool.Everything you can think of is there in nokia 9500. Without the stupid softwares like calorie counting, shopping list, etc etc which I don't think people use.However with blackberry & treo 650 coming this phone was loosing charm BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOKIA IS COMNG UP WITH A NEW Software "Business Centre. Which will be compatible with all the 9500 & 9300 . This software has push in email like treo & blackberry.
We bought 2 phones on a family plan last October.  We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed.  Our major use was to communicate between each other.  We were happy for for about 5 months.  Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned.  Our phones were replaced during April. One sim card was replaced during June. Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone.  Another replacement phone is on the way to us.  The major problems have included "service not available" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, "unable to read", "insert card", and of course dropped calls.  Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call.  At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution.  I can not depend on it.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
I just received 4 LG C1500 from Cingular and activated them on Jan 2, 2006.I am having problems with all the phones.  Like beeping and lighting when it is not being used.  I believe this is called "recycling".  When it does recycle, the signal bar along with the Cingular logo disappears.  And when this occurs when you are on a call, it gets disconnected.  Then when you press the call button to call the same person, it displays a message saying it is reading the smart card (sim card).  Pressing the call button will display the same message for several minutes or until you give up.Yesterday, Jan 6, 2006, I tried making 7 phone calls and I got disconnected every time.I've called Cingular numerous times for a total of about 5 hours to try and correct the problem.  I finally spoke to a Resolution representative from Cingular and he suggested going to a Cingular and try another phone.  I tried two of my SIM card on two lower end Nokia 6061 and had no problems at all.Bottom line.  Stay away from this phone.
As for the positive reviews for this phone, those people have positive reviews for this phone because they were one of the few lucky ones that actually got a working phone.  Don't get this phone.  Its a total gamble whether you get one that works properly or not.  I received two of these phones on a shared plan and both do this "recycle" or whatever thing.  whether your talking to your best friend or employer, in the middle of the call the phone will just end the call for you, instantly cutting you off.  If you press the green phone button to access your phone history and call the person you just lost, the phone says "reading smart chip" and it will do this for the next five minutes.  I normally take the battery out and put it back in so I dont have to wait the five minutes or so.  Both phones do this.  I once had it disconnect me three times in a row from the same person I that I was calling repeatedly. Absolutely unacceptable, terrible phones.  Get something else, dont get LG.  They make great CD and DVDROMs but definitely not phones.
This has to be the worst phone I've ever owned.  I thought Motorola StarTac (my very first phone) was bad, wait till use this phone.  I have 4 LG C1500 phones in my family plan.  2 works ok but the other two, where do I begin.  First, it keeps complaining to insert sim card although it's inserted properly.  Went to Cingular store got the new sim card, works ok for a day.  Next day, same thing.  Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones.  Now one of the two doesn't complain about the sim card but occationally it says it's not in the network although it shows full bars.  The other one still have problem with sim card.  I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but can't talk more than a minute.  It just drops a call in the middle of conversation.  I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it.  I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go, what a nightmare....
this is the worst cell phone i have ever used. i echo other reviewers who mention this phone if very fickle. seems like it has a good connection bc it shows full bars, but inexplicably will go down to zero and drop the call. very random behaviors. i would get messages saying something to the effect of "unable to read smart chip" or "service not available" which is frustrating, bc i have another phone under the same family plan in my other hand which is functional and proves that service is in fact available. so the lg lied. turning the phone off and back on to reboot it doesn't seem to work. the only way i would get it to work after such a malfunction would be to take the battery out and put it back in and then turn the phone back on, then it would search a while for a signal before finally working again. i tried hard to keep it but in the end, had to take it back to the store and exchange it for an infinitely better replacement in every aspect, samsung x497.
My wife and I got two of these phones for "free" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration.
I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine..
I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.  They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't.  The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly.  Don't buy this phone!
I already have a PDA so I don't want much from my cell-phone except making calls.  I don't care for a camera, don't need tons of games, and don't want something big or expensive, so this phone seemed to fit the bill pretty well.The user interface on this is efficient, but not particularly easy to learn, and sometimes awkward.  The shortcuts that make the interface reasonably fast are non-obvious (you push the "dial" button to access call history?).  Also, the address book makes terrible use of screen real-estate: You must choose between either viewing only two entries at a time or being unable to see which number you are calling.  Other than that the sound quality is usually acceptable but not great, battery life seems a bit less than claimed but still not bad, and of course it's tiny and light enough to fit in the same pocket as my wallet.The major problem I have with this phone and/or network is reliability.  I have had frequent mysterious problems such as being unable to make calls despite good signal.  I also find that the backlight mysteriously turns on even when I have not touched the phone, and the external display goes blank for no reason.  So far they have been fixed by power cycling and removing the battery, or at worst reseating the SIM card, but they've been getting more frequent lately.  I've especially had recent problems with people calling my phone and it sending them to voicemail without ringing, despite the fact that my phone is on and has good signal.Other than the reliability problems this would be a perfect phone for me: minimal, small and light, efficient interface, nifty enough, and best of all cheap.If you're stuck using this phone here are a few suggestions:*Reboot it frequently to mitigate reliability problems.*Learn T9 if you ever want to do any text messaging at all.  The manual doesn't explain it particularly well but I figured it out after a few minutes of fiddling.*Experiment with it to find all the shortcuts and hot keys that make the phone faster to use.*Instead of paying exorbitant prices for ring tones and wallpapers you can download PNG/GIF/JPG images and MIDI files onto the phone just by typing in a URL, which only costs a penny per Kilobyte for transfer charges.*Get a $30 USB transfer cable for backup and MP3 transfer.
Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT&T; service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic.
I consider many one-star cell phone reviews to be unfairly harsh because reviewers who switched brands seemed to blame the manufacturer just for having a different way of doing things, but having owned Nokia and Motorola phones I was appalled at the poor usability of this phone.  I gave it every chance because I got it brand spanking new from Cingular for $65 as a replacement.  The volume (of the person on the other end) could not be made loud enough, and the display is comparatively grainy and small.  The instruction manual is lacking.  I really disliked this phone.  I sent it back within 30 days and paid nearly $270 cash for a Motorola V557, and have no regrets; its display looks like a TV compared to this thing.
Bought this from a local Cingular store. Took it home and wasted one evening trying the decipher the WORLD'S WORST (in my opinion) instruction manual. Couldn't even enter my address book. It gets returned tomorrow. It looks to me as if the instruction manual was translated by software directly from the Korean. In contrast, my old Motorola Star Tac manual was complex but logical and reasonably intuitive.
This is my first cell phone and I wanted a basic phone with no extras. It still is capable of things like text messaging and connecting to the internet (which is an annoying, centrally located button that is often easily pushed so you inadvertantly connect when you don't want to) but is not a camera phone. The main pro for this phone is the size. I can fit it easily into a purse or pocket. For an occassional cell phone user like me, it serves its function, but we've had many problems...Problems I've had:- 3 months after I bought the phone the smart chip had to be replaced because it read "insert card" and I couldn't use the phone- had to have the smart chip replaced a second time a month later!- on occassion when I got to dial or check messages it says "Reading Smart Chip" and doesn't let me do anything. if I come back to the phone a few minutes later its usually back to normal- sometimes the message icon is still there even though I have no messages in my voice mail and I can't get rid of it until I get another message and then erase it- it will sometimes go from 5 bars to none even when I haven't moved- my husband's phone (the same one) has a problem where the display light is almost always on- he also often doesn't get his messages until much later.In summary, if you are getting it for free. Then its free.. you can't complain. If you are paying for it, I'd look elsewhere.
If you want a good basic, flip phone, I think this is a good one.  It does not have all the "extras" touted by some but it has good sound quality and performs well.
I unforntunately have had this phone for a year now and have hated just about every moment of it.  My phone drops calls at least once a day, even if I have a full set of bars at the top.  It also constantly says "emergency only" and won't let me get a call out.  And most everyday, I can have four whole bars and it won't let me get a call out or receive a call.  Could be my cingular service which I'm not fond of either, or the phone.  Either way, spend a little more money and buy a better phone than this.
It's a phone! Basic not technical junk. I had mine for about two months and I love it. Crystal clear calls. Better then my Nokia.It's classy looking as well. I hate the hi tech look of most cell phones.I use my phone for emergancy use only. I don't need it to have five hour long conversations with someone while shopping in a mall. Like most use them for.Ohh, and for the person making the comment "I can't use it in my car" Your not suppose to talk and drive!!
I got my phone as a free upgrade through Cingular in November 2005 and have had absolutely no problems.  I don't know what happened for the other reviewers (maybe there was a bad batch) but my phone has been great.  It's easy to use, NEVER drops a call and has great extra features.  If I have one complaint it is that the case is very slick.  I've dropped my phone a few times (and still don't have any problems) so I am going to have to get a cover before I destroy it!
Yes, I would say this is the worst phone I ever had. Every problem mentioned has occurred while I attempted to use this phone. It constantly dropped calls and had to search for the sim card. Some of the most important and basic concepts of a cell phone have been overlooked on this product. It should have never been put on the market. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE JUST BECAUSE IT IS FREE WITH A PLAN. You will regret it if you do. I'm going back to a Nokia.
With this phone, you take about 200 steps backward in technology.  This phone drops calls ALL THE TIME and then says something about the SIM Card;  it cycles for minutes while it tries to get back into a mode where you can use the phone.  I will have 5 bars and then it drops.  During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.  I NEVER experienced this with my last phone!! I can't use this phone at either of my homes or offices in CA or NV and can't use it when I'm driving, so what good is it?!?!  I think Cingular made a mistake bringing this phone in the first place.  Why can't you make a phone that doesn't drop calls, or has a longer battery life?  I think we would ALL prefer these features over having a feature like a camera in our phones.  Remember, it is a CELL phone, not a CAMERA phone.  So how about putting some more R&D; into a phone that works and not worrying about the small percentage of people who want to take pictures with their phones!!  Oh.....and on the minor irritation side, the battery life is poor, the standard ring tones are WAY too few to choose from, calls often go into voicemail without the phone rining, it is hard to hear the phone ring even on the highest setting, etc.  HEY CINGULAR, IF THIS WAS MY FIRST PHONE WITH YOU, I WOULD ASSUME IT WAS YOUR SERVICE AND SWITCH TO SPRINT OR T-MOBILE!!  YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM!!!
If you want an inexpensive phone that will do VERY little other than make/receive calls, this phone is adequate.  If you like to do "complicated" things with your phone, like (gasp!) change your ring tone from time to time, don't bother with this phone.I paid $18 for this phone.  That was about the upper limit of its value.
i just got this cell phone 2 days ago and i totally love it! its my second flip phone but this is my favorite one. my old cell phone was a nokia the nokias are ok but there keypads and non flip totally sucks. the good thing about this phone is that it'so easy to text. You just have to go to the text and theres a c button to clear it. The only down thing about it is the battery life.
I like how the phone works. It has great text messaging which is easy to use and receives and sends messages instantly. My dad got me a game for it. It plays games really well. I can call easy to everyone really well. A cell tower is 1/4 of  mile from my house. Only con is the battery life.
A recent move forced me to change service providers because my new home (in a major metropolitan area) is in a dead spot. "Can you hear me?'  No, I can't!  So I took advantage of Cingular's 30 day return policy hoping I could make a call and not lose my signal.  After a week I can honestly say this phone lives up to and beyond my expectations!  I have great reception, no dropped calls and am very pleased with my purchase.To me, the slickest thing about this phone is the infrared port.  One less cable to keep track of!  I beamed my Outlook address book on my PDA into my phone in seconds.Although I didn't need a camera, it is a nice addition.  In fact, it is capable of taking a photo in low light without a flash.  The documentation on it's' use is poor, so I would advise you to play with the camera options key to get the most use out of it.A lot of reviewers have complained about low volume, and I did too until I repositioned the phone lower on my ear.  My natural tendency to hold the phone almost against my lips caused the very small speaker to be above the opening of my ear. Try it, and I bet you will notice a marked increase in volume also.I have not used the radio yet and contrary to one review here, a mini headphone jack is too big for the jack on the phone.  I guess this is my only disappointment and I can live with it.After reading many website reviews I think that most negative reviews are from people who did not tale the time to READ THE OWNERS MANUAL.  Now I admit the documentation can be overwhelming, and trying to find out how to use a specific  feature is time consuming, but here's a tip.  Download the PDF owners manual file, (a link is on this page) and use Adobe's search function to find the answer to your questions.Well, thanks for letting me share my opinions and I hope they help your decision.
I got my first Nokia 6102 in October 2005. I got my second Nokia 6102 in March 2006. It is now April 2006 and I'm looking for a replacement. Here's how the story goes:When I first got this model, I really liked it a lot. I had no complaints whatsoever except that later wished it had Bluetooth capabilities. That is no biggy for me since I'm not one to carry around a cell phone every where I go. It stays in my car when I'm at home and it usually stays on my desk at work. If I'm out of the office for a few minutes, I'll bring it along with me. Cell phones are nice to have, but..... I'm getting off track with my story.Like I said, I really liked the phone. Occasionally, I'll use Yahoo Instant Messenger at work to communicate with a couple of others while in meetings. For five months, my daily routine of using this phone worked flawless. The suddenly one day, it reset itself when I was attempting to access Messenger. I lost some settings and the "G" vanished from my main screen. Normally, when I used Messenger, it would time-out after a few minutes and the phone would switch back to the main screen. I would get a pop-up if a message was received, and I could go back into Messenger and be connected.After this reset occurred, if Messenger times-out and goes back to the main screen, my connection is lost. After the error, when I attempt to connect to Messenger or the Internet, it asks me if I want to allow network access.Anyhow, after going through three layers of Cingular support, they first decided that there was nothing they could do and gave me the impression that they wanted to end the conversation. I eventually had to get a little ugly by telling them the problem is your problem; either the phone you gave me, or your network, and I want it fixed. They sent me a new phone overnight.The new phone worked flawless for almost two weeks. One day, I was in Messenger and decided I needed to exit out and place my ringer on silent, so I did. When I attempted to call up Messenger again (it runs in the background), I get this Java error and some error codes. Then the phone resets itself. Lo and behold, I back with the very same problems I had with the first phone.As I'm writing this, I have an email out to Nokia looking for a suggestion. I like the phone and I don't see any other current Cingular compatible models which I think I would like any better. If Nokia doesn't have a clue, I'll have to call Cingular for another replacement, and I may go with a different make and model.For this to happen twice, I'm beginning to think this may be a software bug. Anyhow, if you don't plan on using the Yahoo Messenger application which comes with the phone, you should be very satisfied with this phone.
I am a vey particular consumer. I do tons of reseach about an item before I purchase it, I compare it to other items. I read website reviews and everything. I was rather hesitant about ordering this phone after reading many negative reviews. But,I took a chance and ordered it any way (I got it for a really good price) and was plesantly surprised to find out that it was actually a really good phone.I found that it is a bit difficult to navigate the menu when you begin to use it, but after a while you are able to find what you need pretty quickly. I thought the picture quality was good. (I mean you're probably not going to take professional headshots with a phone camera so...)I was pleased with the quality of the video. The sound was fine, as was reception. I was very plesantly surprised by the quality of the phone itself. It is sturdy, has a very strong flip. and though several parts are plastic it does not feel light and flimsy as many other reviews stated. I would suggest ordering a case, the shiny black outershell just seems like it may scratch easily. This phone has a lot of features including a FM radio, the headphones needed to listen to the radio are not included. (Another service provider who sells the same model includes the headset with their phone...tsk,tsk Cingular)however, I found that an inexpensive earbud will work just as well.(I purchased one from a dollar store)All in all I think this phone is a good choice for someone looking to purchase a multi function phone without all the frills and unneeded extras.
I have read all the reviews about the 6102 and felt I had a few things to add.  I do agree the phone could use more memory, but if you download Nokia's PC suite(off the Nokia website), you can use their media player to change MP3 files to a true tone file format which takes up far less space and sounds the same on the phone. I would suggest a program like Goldwave to create Mp3 file clips.I have about 10 tones assigned to groups and plenty of space left over! Also the FM radio is a great feature!  I bought a headset off of ebay and use them when I go for a walk. The phone will automatically pick up the call and then return to the radio when the caller hangs up. I never move a finger! The camera is basic, but that's all I needed from a phone. I have a digital camera. I don't find it flimsy at all.  I am very pleased with the coverage of the phone. So far the sound quality has been excellent and the speaker phone works from my belt clip! I just flip open the phone and press a quick button and talk, hands free.  The battery life is excellent.  Overall, this phone has met my expectations and beyond.
I have always had Nokia phones, which I love, but I was getting envious of all the flip-phones out there. When it came time for me to upgrade my phone from a lower model Nokia, I was so excited to find that Nokia had come out with a great new flip-phone. And while I didn't think I would care about having a camera or video capability, I quickly learned to love both. This phone also has the ability to record an audio message which can be sent to someone or used as a ringtone. The design is sleek, and best of all, the Nokia features and menus that I'm used to are simply updated in an even smarter version for this phone. This made if very easy for me to learn to use all the menus and technological features that the phone has to offer.
I bought this phone about two months ago. and, i was realy pleased with the phone, features. and, one day i was just looking through the(not many) features and, the phone shut itself off! of course, it came back on. but, then a few days later. i was on my way to cingular store for accessories for this phone. and, i walked in and it shut itself off again. it made me angry, i screamed. then it came back on but, all my contacts, ringtones and other personal things on it were somehow deleted. so, i consulted a cingular worker! i told them about the situation. all they said was "sorry, thats not our problem. but, we can send you a new one! for free!" i said sure. the next day, i got this new "free" phone. i went through the whole setup process. i was indeed happy. then, when i was done. i put it on my table. and then, the light went on and, then it went off on me continuasly(can't spell) i called cingular. they said the same thing. so, the next day. i turned my phone on, started adding some contacts. it said "please insert a sim card" i was dumbfounded! i calld cingular (again) told them. all they said was. "what exactly are you doing when that happens" i told them. and, they sent me another phone! did the same thing!! i was fed up. so, went online and bought an "untaged" model. it did the same thing! so, in conclusion! i would not recommend this phone to anyone!  Pros:camera is not badGood games(demo's)like the features.good reception.  Cons:Graphics, they suck! camera in bad place.colume button * camera buttons are in the worse place.dropped calls * calls interrupted.video quality is not good at all.cannot hear. voices get low then loud vise-versa.calls go mute  overall i give this phone a 3. just because of the good reception! and the easyness to open.
I've had the 6102 since December, and I've had absolutely no problems with it at all. There are some who complain about the speaker quality, but mine was pretty decent and I didn't have many problems with it at all. I should disclaim I use the headset most of the time though so this review may not be a good barometer when it comes to the speaker issue. I have no problems with the navigation with this phone, adding tones and pics with a data cable worked perfectly with it, and text messaging is intuitive and speedy with the 6102, the T9 system on it is one of the best I've used. I also enjoy the FM radio, which has a good range and does get distant stations well. The headset is the antenna, and that makes sense since it's how most regular Walkmans and equivalents have worked since the creation of the portable stereo.However, the downside of the phone is because of the large color front mini-screen, you definitely want a soft case for it. I learned that the hard way after a nasty meeting of the screen with a seatbelt buckle that left the inside plastic cracked and a nice big purple battery-sucking bruise on the LCD. Unfortunately I went with a $2 plastic holster that left no protection for the phone, and that turned into a $115 error as I had to pay full price for a new phone to replace the cracked screen as Cingular considered it cosmetic non-warranty damage. I stomached the loss of the money and got a new 6102, and shortly thereafter got a case that offered plenty of protection (and I intent to pick up their extended coverage). It's a cool looking phone and does everything well, but with all that comes extra complicated electronics, so before you buy this, make your second purchase a good-quality soft case so you don't end up six months later with a cracked phone because you went with the cheapest method of carrying you could get.
Great phone.  Nothing super fancy.  FM radio has good sound and can be heard though any ear bud or headphones.  Have to have the head phones to hear the FM radio.  I guess thats Nokias way of getting you to buy accessories.  I suggest downloading the free Nokia Sync software (...).  I charge it one time a week, but then again I don't use the phone a ton either but my old Motorola 720, which was a piece of crap, had to be charged every 1.5 days.Highly recommend this phone.
I live in the mountains, and recently got suckered into cingular's renew your plan for two years and get a fresh new phone deal.  The phone arrived and could not be activated from my home.with the limited time I spent with the phone last night, The features are complicated and anti-intuitive.seems like with all the progress over the last four years, the camera, speakerphone, etc, that the antenna does not work as well as my four year old Nokia Candy bar (can't remember the number) which looks like it has been dragged behind a truck for several miles at highway speed and then picked up by a dog and  carried home.If you live in an area with spotty reception, forget about this phone and the cool upgrade offer.I expect to spend several hours on customer service trying to sort out this flashy new phone.
After months of searching, I bought the Nokia 6102 to replace the 3590.Wow - Nokia always make such remarkable, solidly-built phones!!!Here are the features I like and dislike.1. Large outside color display on which I can show date and time and photos2. Inside color display is a bit small, but is large enough to show my calendar, and is needed to give the phone its compact size. If you have a big hand, this phone is not for you.3. Excellent voice quality. Also has speaker phone capability that I sometimes find handy. I can walk and talk with the phone cover closed!4. Basic camera keeps me entertained, though I did not initially buy the phone because of this capability. This is so simple to use that anyone can learn to use in an instant.5. Using infrared port, receive (and send) data files such as midi and mp3 music to keep me entertained and set up my ring tones. There is no need for a data cable!!! Be advised that due to limited memory, you can't store much mp3 files. Also, not all midi files are playable. I find the infrared port to work with an older Windows computer, but not a newer one.6. Battery needs recharging every 3-4 days, depending on usage. The charger is small, portable.7. Like my previous mobile, set up unique ring tones for each group in my contacts list. This capability is provided under "Group Details".8. Basic voice recorder - though do not expect to record quality live music using this.9. FM radio, though I did not buy this phone for this capability. You will need to buy a headset accessory to use this feature.
I just switched to this Nokia flip after being completely dissatisfied with a Motorola V551.  Anything that could go wrong with a cell phone went from with the Motorola, and it was time for a change. I go through Cingular, and did not hesitate at all when a free Nokia 6102 was offered, as I have had only great experiences with Nokias in the past. In fact, since my Moto had gotten so bad, I popped my sim card into an older nokia i have (3 yrs) and it worked like a charm.Pros of the phone include:-generous outside display - bigger than any other phones I have seen, but the megapixels are not as good as the inside screen, but can't win them all and it definitely works well-Sleek, black outside, so refreshing that it is not standard cell phone silver which is way too played out.-Menus are easy to navigate, but I fing a 2 second delay when pulling up the main menu, but definitely something I can live with.-camera is very good, considering this is not a phone you would buy specifically for the camera.-Construction is sturdy - those who said that nokia flips have a "cheap" feel are way off - this one is substantial, dense, but not too big or too heavy.the only cons are that I sometimes the earpiece volume is not that great. even in quieter settings I sometimes struggle to hear the person on the other end, even when the vol. is at the max. Also, this may be a function of the area, but I also hear static in the background at times, but like I said, may be the other person's phone or the area I am in. Also, the wallpapers and images that are included are few, and they are not the best. I believe there are only 5 different wallpapers and 3 themes, just wish there was more of a choice.I am still within a 30 day return period, but I am almost sure that this phone is a keeper - unless I have many more issues with call volume. This is a great all-around phone, with good camera capabilities, easy menus, and a vibrant screen.
Overall, a very good phone. I am an avid fan of nokia phones and have been using since a decade, but, this being my first nokia flip phone, i'm not at all dissappointed. The phone has great reception, it also sustain calls through some dead zones where my earlier nokia phones just went blank ! Battery life seems to be alright with about 2-4 days of charging cycle and all the other features like menus & IRDA are euqivalent to that of the previous models. Personally, I really dont dig the flip phone part, but otherwise, a highly recommended phone with basic concrete functionality of a cell phone minus the bling bling of other similar motorola models.
I tried this phone with a new Cingular connection this month and found it wanting. The primary difficulty was the volume. Although I kept turning the volume up, the sound did not improve, and I could barely hear my conversations. Thinking the problem might have been an inadequately charged battery, I charged the unit overnight. But the sound level was still poor the next morning.When I returned to the Cingular store the next day, the clerk said that my complaint about this unit was a common one. Be warned.There was in this case a happy ending: I returned the phone for an even exchange and am happy with the Samsung model I obtained as a replacement.
This phone is good as a free upgrade; it's just not great. It has good reception with very few dropped calls, a nice display, and is easy to navigate. I have a cover on mine and have dropped it a few times without incident.The good features:  FM radio (surprisingly good but nokia headphone is required), speakerphone (not bad for as small as it is), and overall quality. Easy-to-use camera for rare photo use, but picture quality is average.The bad:  Difficult to see display outdoors (cover display should be monochrome so one could read it), limited ringtone options, and backlight goes off way too soon.If you're getting a free upgrade, this will suffice for a couple of years as long as its primary use is as a cell phone. As such, it does fine; some of the added features are nice as well.
This is a nice small phone and it doesn't take up your whole face when you're talking. the picture quality is great and all this different customizing options are cool. i'm 15 and got this phone for my birthday so it's a good gift for teenagers and people of all ages.****UPDATE****When this phone breaks down...the phone breaks. It doesn't hold well when dropped. After a couple of months, I had two pieces of one whole phone.
I'll admit that this is not the worst phone I've ever owned, but it's really not that great. I wish that I had actually played with it some before I bought it, but I only purchased it because I needed something cheap and temporary. I guess I got what I paid for.Before I go into the annoyances, I will say a couple of good things about this phone.  First of all, the speaker is very loud, especially if you have an mp3-type ringer.  I also think the camcorder feature is pretty cool, even if it's not very high quality, just because it's not a feature you generally see on this type of phone.  I also like that it's compact without being overly fragile.  And it looks a lot better than most of the Nokia flip-phones I've seen.Now the bad stuff.  My main problem with this phone is the menu system.  It's not that much different than other Nokia phones except that there's even more there to confuse you.  To put this into perspective, I SELL cell phones for a living.  I play with phones all day long and I usually know how to do just about everything on any given phone within a few days.  Yet I have had this phone personally for five months and I still have trouble navigating the menu.  First of all, the names of the various menus are confusing and oftentimes misleading; for example, under "Tools" on most phones is where you would find the calculator, calender, etc. On this phone it's where they hide the camera, radio, and voice recorder.  The camcorder, however, is not in this menu.  The only way to get to the camcorder is to open up the camera first and then go to the "options" menu.  There is a menu for "profiles" which I have also seen on other Nokia phones but I have yet to figure out its relevence.  I'm thinking it might be a way to make your ringer louder or quieter, but it would be a great deal simpler if you could just do that through the volume control.  The address book is about halfway down the menu page instead of right up front where it should rightfully be.  But really the worst thing about the menus is just the fact that you usually have to go through so many different little submenus to get to just about any actual function, and which options you choose are not always obvious.Now some of the less important things that bug me.  The camera is really bad.  I don't necessarily think that a camera is an essential function for a phone to have, but if it's going to have one it should at least be able to take something that resembles an actual picture.  The biggest problem is that if you move even the slightest bit while you're trying to take the picture it will turn out very blurry. Should you manage to take a picture worth saving, you may notice that you can zoom in on it.  But only AFTER you've already taken a picture, not before.  Furthermore, you can't save a picture in its zoomed-in state.You also can't set different ringers to different phone numbers, which is a feature that I had really come to take for granted in a cell phone and it frustrates me to no end that I can't do it with this one.  You can set a different ringer for your messages than what you have for your voice calls (although you can't distinguish voicemail from text) but it took me ages to figure out how to set my message ringer to something that I had downloaded rather than one of the default ones.Overall, I think this phone would be fine for someone who only planned to use it for voice calls and nothing else.  For anyone else, do yourself a favor and spend 10 or 20 bucks more and get something better; there are plenty of options.
Frankly, I wish I had the free Nokia brick phone I had before this one back. Call volume horrid. Many times I can barely hear the person to whom I'm speaking, and many times that person can hear the background noise better than they can hear me. Lots of dropped calls. The OS can be slow and a pain to navagate.If a Cingular salesperson steers you toward this one, find something else.
I upgraded to this Nokia 6102 phone after my other Nokia fell in a toilet on accident (which is a little intact but kept dying on me randomly). I always hated flip phones because they are easy to break and snap in half if you accidentally drop it with the lid popped up. I used to have a Samsung flip phone and after time the lid become lose and eventually broke. This Nokia phone, however, has only been with me for a month and the antenna black piece popped off. It looks like it was held on my glue (NO SCREWS!!). The quality of it is not as good as I thought it would be. When I flip open the phone the joints that open the phone seem lose and it has only been a month. Also, the basic speaker is not great--I have a hard time hearing someone in the car or when there's a little noise around. The speakerphone is actually more powerful than the normal speaker! I am definitely going back to a Nokia 3595...This is a great basic phone and you don't have to worry about it breaking! Cingular has offered to replace it and send me a new Nokia 6102, but I refuse to own another.To summarize everything:PROS:-Camera (don't care for one since I have a new camera that takes better quality pics than cameraphones)-Speakerphone (loud and clear, more convienent when driving!-easy to read screen-double-screened-good battery life-Easy to handle (not too small, not to bulky)-Radio (can't use unless I buy headphones though)-Video (never really use it, don't care to have it)-Voice recording (you can make your own ring tones from it if you want)CONS:-Volume level is too LOW on the basic speaker-Not enough default themes/backgrounds to choose from. Older phones had more choices.-When scrolling through Contact List, or anything in that matter, it seems delayed no matter how quickly you press buttons.-ANTENNA PIECE IS A MAJOR DEFECT IN PHONE! It falls off after gentle use (never dropped)I generally don't have good experiences with flip phones, which is why I am going back to a basic one without all those unneccessary features. Plus they're more durable, reliable, and better quality for the price.-
After reading all reviews from this site and many other sites. I thought the Nokia 6102 is the good one. However, it turned out a pretty bad phone. I'm very disappointed.I signed up 2 year contract - Family plan with Cingular, a month and one week ago. Grabbed 3 phones.My phone:Pros: just because I frustrated and experienced all the bad things so my mind went blank with the pros. Well, actually there are some things such camera, PC connectivity, speakerphone, dual screen, games but I'm not a fancy type of guys so I don't need to features much.Cons:+ No setting for the backlight, dim out after 15 seconds. Only be able to set permanent ON when CHARGING, that's ridiculous.+ There is delay after pressing Menu key+ Low memory+ Very few ringtones, themes (but I need only 3)+ Background noises, static is way over the exceptable level.+ Poor reception+ Connection drops frequentlyThe top 4 of the cons, I don't care much, I can deal with it while the last 3 are killing me. Anytime I use the phone, I just want to smash it with my hammer.And how can I conclude it was bad?I borrowed the 2-year old Nokia 6200 alike (not a flipfone) from my coworker, swapped the simcard, this old phone performed 10x or even 20x better than my 6102.I've lived in Andover, MA - Nashua, NH areaI tested while on the Seales Rd, the 6102 showed no network coverage, while the old phone worked with no problem.Background noise (static) occurs everytime on the 6102 while the old one is just fine (I tested on every street).In some places, the 6102 shows no reception while the old one indicates 2 or 3 bar.I've tried my other phones (same model 6102), it works a little better but still far behind the old Nokia.First, I thought it was my 6102 problem, it could be a defective unit but tried twice, now I think it is the whole Nokia 6102 series problem. While a lot of people have graded it with very high star, I am very disappointed.I'm thinking buying a Motorola RAZR V3 or even buy back the old Nokia that I tested with from my cowoker. Just can't stand with that little crappy for 2 years. My concern right now is the RAZR is better than the old Nokia or not? Sign!
I bought 4 of these phones when I switched my family plan from AT&T; to Cingular. The salesman said they got great reception but could break if they are dropped. Just 4 days after the 30-day return policy expired, a small plastic piece covering half the antenna and the top of the phone fell off on 2 of the 4 phones -- even though they weren't dropped. On my son's phone, he just noticed one day that the piece was gone. On my phone, it came off when I took the phone out of my back pocket. The Cingular store couldn't exchange it, because it was after the 30-day free exchange period, and they told me to call the Warrantee Center. They wouldn't replace the phone because a broken piece counts as "physical damage," which voids the warrantee, unless Nokia has issued an advisory about problems with the piece breaking off (which the Cingular salesman said they had gotten several complaints about). Nokia said they aren't authorized to send a replacement phone either, because first I'd have to send the two phones back so they can assess whether the problem was created by "physical or liquid damage," so even it is the fault of poor manufacturing, I may end up having to pay to repair the phones. After spending several hours on the phone with both Nokia and Cingular, I am still trying to get them to send replacement phones.
This review is long and rambling because the phone (to me) does so much that to describe it in any rational order would just be too much like work.So the bottom line at the top: A great phone for the money, does a lot of stuff perfectly adequately and serves as a good training device for someone wanting to know what to look for the next time they buy a higher-end phone. I give it five stars because, "What did you expect for a twenty-dollar phone?" I got this phone reluctantly, only after my old-fashioned Nokia brick was stolen. I asked simply for the cheapest phone with a camera, and I couldn't be more pleased. Well, actually, I could, but only after picking nits. So here we go:My first issue was with downloading photos, I shoot a lot and at twenty-five cents a piece to email them to myself a cable seemed like a reasonable solution. I wanted to avoid spending $50.00 on an OEM, so I tried one from Ebay. Then another. Then another. I called Nokia for tech support, and was surprised to talk to someone who was both knowledgeable and had no accent.There are a few separate issues here, the first being the necessity of downloading Nokia's "PC Suite" to facilitate connectivity. The version touted for Windows 98 was erratic and is no longer offered or supported, but before this happened I finally got a tech email admitting it was a known problem. And with regard to the non-original cables having some sort of DRM capabilities, the tech just sort of chuckled and said, "I really can't comment on that". Not only did they not work, I had to uninstall and reinstall the app after each failed attempt. How amusing.Realizing the cost of the cable would be paid back very soon I ordered one from Nokia and had it almost immediately. From then there was no problem, although I could only use it with XP.The file transfer protocol is a bit odd, but works OK. The synchronization with Outlook seemed flawless and works in both directions. The new automatic picture transfer will completely empty all the images in the camera, including graphics, wallpaper and screensavers, which seems like a mistake not present in the earlier version.Removing the SIM chip to another phone will save the bare basic info, but so thoroughly scramble to formatting you'd be better off doing it by cable. You can't save games or photos to the chip, either, I don't know if other phones enable this.Oh, games: No Tetris, but I found my favorite and most addictive one, "Zuma". The screen is far to small for a pleasant experience, but it's a novelty for me and helps pass the time in waiting rooms.All the other features of the phone work adequately and are quite useful- stopwatch, countdown recorder, calendar, notepad, alarm clock, etc. I did have to spend a few days with the manual to get an understanding of the software but it made sense fairly quickly. One unbilled feature is that the display is bright enough to use for a flashlight or nightlight when stumbling around in a strange hotel room or parking lot, it gives off enough of a glow to see well.The phone features? Oh yeah, I hardly ever get calls, but from what use I have had, the service is OK. You do need to hold the speaker right next to your ear to get the best volume, I picked up a no-name headset/mike for $8.00 and it does just fine.I live in a rural area that is a canyon, and Cingular consistently has the best signal here. The hot spots around the house are different between phone service and messaging, which is slightly irritating in that I will get a missed call message right after the phone doesn't ring. The camera works OK for what it is- great for catching rare moments in still or video. Same for the audio recorder, I use it for notes and catching info from the car radio. A speaker phone seems to work OK, but playing music is pretty much a waste of time.Not unlike writing a review for an obsolete phone on Amazon.
I've read several reviews reporting insufficient volume on this phone.  I decided to throw caution to the wind, and order it anyway.  When it arrived and I made my first phone call, the volume was a *little* soft.  I asked the other party to hold a sec, mashed the Up button on the side of the phone a few times while watching the volume meter increase on the display, and resumed my conversation.  The next time the person I called spoke, I couldn't believe it.  It was not only clearly audible, it was slightly alarming.  Perhaps the other reviewers forgot to peel the protective shipping plastic off?Anyway, the phone is great.  It's tiny -- neither as long nor as wide as the Razr (although it is thicker).  It doesn't have Bluetooth, which gives me a little bit of comfort.  After all, the more Bluetooth gains popularity in wireless devices, the greater the likelihood that bad people will find and exploit vulnerabilities in said devices.  If you don't believe me, perform a Google search for "bluetooth exploit," "bluejacking," or "bluesnarfing."  But I digress.  Call clarity is great, signal reception is better than any other cell phone I've ever used, and it's sexy.My only complaint about the phone is that there are a few menu items in the phone that link you to Nokia's "MEdia Mall," an online store to shop for new ringtones, themes, etc.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to delete those links.  If you aren't careful, you could find yourself increasing your phone bill by $.10 every time you activate the wrong menu item.  I would've given the phone 4 stars because of this, but the overall average user rating is too low.
I got the phone 5 days ago from Cingular. I hasitated for a while and finally decided to return it for exchange to other phone.The main problem is the earpiece is too small with which you cannot hear the other party's voice clearly, unless you put the hole right above your ear, which is very difficult to locate. Each time, I have to try several times before I can place it correctly. I think other things are good for this phone.I had Nokia phone previously with very good experince. But why this phone was designed so stupidly?! The earpiece is a small thing, but also the biggest one for a phone.
Major improvement from my Sprint phone. Lots of features I'm still figuring out. Nice size. This is only the 3rd cell phone I've ever owned so I'm no expert, but it has worked well. Some reception problems, but hard to complain when it works at least 2x places as my last phone.
I had read all of the reviews after buying this phone.  When I got it I was pleasantly surprised.  I have had NO volume issues.  In fact, the ringer is so loud that when it rings while I am teaching my class, my students beg me to answer the phone.  I can also get reception in my school building with this phone, which I have never been able to do before.  As for bluetooth capability, I've never used the infrared feature before.On a good note..... I was able to video tape my daughter skating, and then showed it to my friends.  It was incredible.  I've enjoyed having this phone and am glad to have it.One bad thing though is that you can't choose a different ring tone for each caller.  But you can group your callers and assign a different ringtone for each group.Again, a great phone for the cost.
This is a GREAT phone EXCEPT for the power connector. The pin inside the phone is so small and fragile that it can accidentally be really easily bent or broken off. This cost me $115 because Nokia classified the problem as "Physical damage" and the warranty does not cover physical damage. This is ridiculous. It is an obvious design problem.
There are dozens of reasons to buy this cell phone.1)  Phone has a VGA camera, a stereo FM radio, a speakerphone, EDGE high-speed data, dual color displays and support for mobile e-mail and more.2) LCD has 128 x 160 resolution and support for 65,000 colors. The outside cover of the handset features a 96 x 65, 4,000-color display that can display picture IDs, time, call information, battery and signal strength.3)  The standard jack accepts universal hands-free headsets, as well as USB and infrared ports for transferring data to and from the handset.4)  This phone has polyphonic ringtones, MP3-, MIDI-, AMR-, and True Tones.  You can also assign pictures to your most common callers.5)  There's a vibrate ringer mode. Voice-activated dialing system and the phone book keeps track of all your contacts.  Address book capacity is only limited to a big 3.5 MB of built-in memory.6)  There's an integrated speakerphone for talking hands-free.7)  You can mobile messaging and integrate with the Internet.8)  You can send picture, video, and text messages.9)  You can manage and synchronize contacts, calendars, and other data with your PC with the Suite application.10)  There is an integrated FM radio makes to tune in your favorite stations. The gaming system is powerful Java-based games. Lots of games are downloadable via the Cingular Media service.11)  The lithium-ion battery is rated at up to 4 hours of digital talk time and up to 350 hours of digital standby time.12)  It just looks cool too!The price is right too.  I got mine for free when subscribing to Cingular for two years!
love this cell phone..i had to get this as a replacement  i had a razer(those phones are pure crap  the same with the slivr)  i was very surprised with this phone  its  very durable,stylish.. and it has excellent reception (ive called overseas with this phone..and had crystal clear calls..take that motorola!)  a cell phone is just that a phone..(not a ohhh its soo thin im afraid to pick it up and actually make a call with it)  back to the nokia 6102  this phone you, customize your screens and ringtones..link it to your computer for information  retreival  you get 2 color screen that have vivid colors..also a nice built in digital camera that has great pixel resoloution for quick  pic snaps(i would not use for my vacation pics  but to have it for quick snaps..this is a nice feature thats  included)  they keys are easy to negotiate with..as well as the on screen menues.its also  very small so you can tuck it in your pocket undetected.. in summerypros.. small compact size great reception/crystal clear calls(even clear voicemail)  dual screens/  comfortable to hold and use  from nokia  so the quality is outstanding  excellent price point  text messaging/picture sendingcons..none that i can find..this phone rocks!if your one of those "oh i gotta cram my whole life onto my sexy phome  which will be obsolete next year anyway' then this is not for you...(hmm since when did cell phones become "sexy" anyway LOL)  but if you are educated consumer and know what you want in a high quality cell phone  then by all means check out the nokia 6102..you'll be glad  you didalso, id like to add... its just crazy to pay 299 and up for a cell phone(but people will pay it because theres a sucker born every minute)..a cell phone  DOES NOT make you cool or popular as some people seem to think(those are the  shallow people to say the least im in my 30s and some people my age act like this  and thats very sad)..its a communication device  nuff said  thats what they were designed for.. its crazy to see people spend crazy amounts on a phone because they are so desperate to be cool and thats pathetic..  what makes a person cool..is  the actions that define you as a that person...
Recently got my first flip phone, which is this Nokia 6102.  Having been a Nokia user (and FAN) since 2000 when I first signed on with Cingular, I definitely had high hopes and expectations for the 6102.  I had no reason to be disappointed since the Nokia brand has served me well.  I loved their candy-bar style 5190 so much, that I even got my second upgrade phone from Cingular for the same model in 2002 before Nokia discontinued it.  To this date, I hear Nokia's biggest seller is still the 5190.So imagine my disappointment and surprise when I finally plugged the 6102 into play.  First and foremost, reception is average at best.  I know my comments will draw the ire of other users here who have raved about this 6102's reception.  80% of the time, I have to move the earpiece and reposition it over my ear several times over the course of a conversation.  The old 5190 NEVER had this problem.  Again, I hope this problem is due to a sample defect.  Even at that, one rarely hears of quality control issues with Nokia.  It is supposed to be second to NONE in the cell phone industry.  Also, battery life isn't great.  I have to recharge the phone every 3 days and I don't even use the phone all that much, maybe up to 1 hour ++ each day.This underwhelming performance from the 6102 comes as a shock.  I have since returned the phone back to Cingular's eStore for a replacement.  I have declined a replacement for the same model.  While I ponder my next selection, perhaps the Motorola V557 is a good alternate choice, though I was shocked to hear from Cingular reps that the V-557 actually PALES in comparison to the Nokia 6102.  But the reviews here on Amazon for the V-557 are VG, but then so were reviews for the 6102.Already I miss my Nokia 5190.....perhaps I will never give it up again if the Motorola V-557 fails to perform as well.
This is a great phone. It has a lot if cool features. If you love to listen to hte radio this is perfect for you. This phone has fm radio.
I have owned this phone for about 2 months and the exterior LCD cracked.  I did not drop it but simply placed it in my pocket and sat on a couch.  It is just not durable and Cingular refused to replace it.Pros:  battery life, MP3 ringtonesCons: The phone is not durable,  you cannot configure it to display the date on the outer LCD, the games that come with it are terrible.
Have had this phone for 4 days and am going to return it, despite the fact that it's an attractive phone with a good form factor.  Main reasons for returning are (1) poor audio volume even when set to max; (2) menus are not intuitive; (3) display info is in vanishingly small fonts and icons, and (4) I don't like the "flat" phone book entries [that is, each name only has one number associated with it.  In contrast, my former mobile phone (Sanyo) could store multiple numbers (work, home, mobile, ...) with one name].  Sorry to have to change phones, since I like Nokia, generally.
I've gone through 5 of these phones in less than a year. The first one had echos so bad it didn't even recognize the voice tags and people said I sounded like I was talking under water.  The 2nd one just plain died one day and wouldn't even take a charge or turn on.  The 3rd one drained the battery from a full charge to almost nothing in a couple of days without even using it or having it turned on.  The 4th one I just got yesterday worked for a day and now turns on but none of the buttons work and I can't even access my address book.  Cingular has finally offered me a different brand, which I have checked out on Amazon's site hoping to get one with a good review.  Now I have to negotiate with them to get the matching accessories.....Steer away from Nokia 6102.....
I got this phone back in January. I must admit, I do like the phone, but I've already bought a replacement. The sound quality of the phone is not very clear... ear piece volume is kind of low and I find myself using speakerphone all the time. Has infared, which is really nice when your laptop has infared also (I've made TONS of my own mp3 ringtones, saved all my pictures on my PC). I had my first one replaced in March because the side buttons (the volume and camera) would no longer work. The camera's okay (it's a phone) - video quality is horrid. No Bluetooth, which my girls friends have 'dubbed' a hassle, because there are many times they want to Bluetooth me sound clips and pictures from their Razrs. It doesn't have much memory capacity (only about 3 MB), so you can't save much. That's ultimately why I bought the Motorola MPX 220 to replace it. Many people I know who have bought the phone have taken it back, or delcare the ones they still own have some WILD problems. It also doesn't pick up signal as good as my mom's Motorola V551.
I have used this phone for a week, and I'm returning it.Pros:1.  Cool-looking phone - black, red and chrome.2.  Color screen is good.3.  Very compact.Cons:1.  Audio volume is very low, even when set to highest setting.  Conversations were often hard to hear in the car with the windows up and the stereo off.2.  Lack of side keys for settings makes even the most basic changes - ring volume, call volume, etc. - difficult.I will grant that it's a quality phone and that the phone is well-made and has no defects.  It would be a great entry level phone for the average person who doesn't change settings - and has above average hearing.
I am not hard to please when it comes to cell phones, as long as it has a camera and it rings and I can talk to people it will do.  My old Kyocera model is better than this. (This is after a basketball hit it two or three times.) The phone for some strange reason shorts out on me.  It goes off randomly and doesn't come back on and this has happened to me three times this year.  The first time it happened it was at the worst moment possible: A snowstorm at 2 AM is not an ideal setting for your phone to short out.  The sencond time it happend randomly and the third time it did the same thing.I am a bit surprised because Nokia is very good at making phones and this is a disappointment.  I plan on getting a new phone soon and probably a different model most likely.  All I can say is if you choose this phone be aware, it does some crazy things.
I am a big fan of nokia and all my previous mobiles were nokia..But this one is a big disappointment..I am surprise to find that there is a bug in their s/w.If you change the profile from Normal to Silent and then backagain to Normal, the incoming phones are having not so consistent ringtones. Sometimes it will ring and sometimes it wont, just the light will be flashed.Currently I removed the battery and restarted and its working fine. But dont know how long it will work.I think Moto Razr is much better than this phone for the same price range.
Nokia 6102 FLIMSY phone!  I had this phone for 3 days, and in that time, the screen froze, the key pad froze and the flip part felt like it was going to break in half.  AND, the volume is horribly low and if your ear isn't just in the right spot you wont hear anything at all!  Horrible ring tone options and no GPRS connection at all so there was NO way to order more ring tones.I returned this phone before it even had a chance to run out of batteries.
If you always wanted a Nokia but didn't want to get a candy-bar style this one is for you.  Great battery life, Reception and nice style. For international calls try [...] don't waste your money on the carrier international rates.
These new generation phones are so gentle and break very easily. Our two motorola's phones V180 and V550 broke after just a year of used. The common problem is leaking screan if you drop the phone, so your screan goes blind. Go for some other brand ....
i've had my Nokia 6102 phone for about 2 1/2 months now. When i firsy got it it was great, everything worked i didnt have any problems. Then after i started using more often i realised that when you are sending or recieving a text message or recieving a phone call, and ur watchin TV or listening to the radio, you will here this weird noise come from the TV or radio's speakers. It's really weird. And another thing, i recently had some problems with my phone just shutting off n me even with full battery. The good thing about this phone is that u can take pictures and record things.
I LOVE THIS PHONE,,,,LOOKED AT RAZR TO CHEAP FEELIN GOT THS ONE LOVE IT
I recently had a 6102 Nokia Phone. Unfortunitly my joy came to a sudden end when i accidently dropped it in a sink full of water, and it never turned on again. This is to ANY ONE who has a Nokia 6102, and DOES NOT like it. If you are willing to give it away, i WILL TAKE IT!!! DO NOT THROW IT AWAY!!!! If you are one of these people please e-mail me at maryhannah08@yahoo.com and I will talk to you. I really want this phone. I loved it. Please please please don't let me down!!!!Thank you!
Being a diehard Nokia fan, I had made my mind to buy my third nokia. Esp after this incident:My earlier nokia 6610 spent 45 minutes with me in a pool, before I realized its presence in my pocket. Well, I dried it in sunlight and then with a hair-dryer, cleaned the copper connectors (to remove the oxidation products) with after-shave and it works w/o any problem. Kudos to Nokia..!!Coming back to 6682, I have this phone for about 5 days now and have explored most of its features by now. Here are my views:Looks: Impressive and very smooth.Size: Not too big. Comparable to other phones with similar features available now. Foam/leather cover with belt clip is a good option to have (Caution: Dont buy the plastic clip from Amazon, its terrible). You would certainly love to show this kool phone to others :)Basic Features: Signal strength, battery life- really good  Display - Awesomely brilliant. Includes LED to detect the surrounding light and adjust the display.  Speakerphone - Very good, Mic can catch my voice from across the room.  Menu - Easy to explore. Might take a day or two to get used to.Kool Features:Camera - 1.3 MP, good quality. Flash-OK. Camera options include self timer for 10,20, 30 seconds, high-speed sequence mode, night mode and brightness, color, contrast adjustments. (thats a sure +)Editing: Photo n video editing....wowSpeakerphone - Excellent volume n quality to play mp3s n videos mp4, rm.Documents - Can view word, excel, powerpoint n pdfs. Can edit them if you buy authorization code for the QuickOffice software online for $15.OS: Sometimes goes slow depending on the applications running. Otherwise Ok for general use.Internet: Good quality (I m using the basic one )Recorder: Excellent audio recorder and voice commands. Dont know the video recording capability nowConnectivity: Bluetooth - standard  Cable - With included USB cable connects to PC and then you can simply copy-paste the documents, images, songs etc.Memory - RS MMC, (1 GB card is abt $30 on amazon..pretty ok)COST- IT IS FREE (r u kidding me..???)Thoughts: If you are really really used to small phone, then it might feel very big initially.I cant comment on the internet download speed etc as I do not have a high speed data plan. Normal Media/Browser runs OK.Update after 10 weeks: 1. Pictures with flash in a low light place like restaurant might come out a bit grainy.2. RS-MMC memory is hard to find except at Amazon, that too occassionally.3. You cannot assign tones to different callers.Update after 7 months:1. You can assign separate tones for callers alongwith their pictures.2. You can record video with sound.3. Once Synched with Outlook (even w/o data plan), this phone is great to keep your emails and calendar updated!
I'm a long-time Nokia user, and I'll continue to buy Nokia. This is my fifth Nokia after the 2160, 6160, 3360, and 7210.1. The phones in the initial release from Cingular were buggy. I understand that this was due to an incompatibility with Cingular's SIM. Problems I discovered due to this problem include the power button powering off the phone after a brief tap. Nokia says you should hold the power button down for three seconds before the phone powers off. If you hold the phone with your thumb over the side (on the power button), it's easy to power off the phone while you're in the middle of a conversation.2. The slide cover on the camera is nice, as is the flash. The pictures are very large in (file) size and very grainy. Pictures averaged about 400kb, and I've seen much better pictures from my friends' Trios. I'd still rather have the 6682.3. The case on the phone is PLASTIC and it can be slippery to hold onto if you have sweaty hands. I've dropped this phone a few times, and the plastic case held up ok, but it was easily scratched (not cracked, though). A rubbery grip cover would help in this area (see eBay).4. The Symbian OS is MUCH better than the standard Java Crap OS that Nokia makes for many of their phones (including my previous 7210). Switching through menus is much faster, but the phone still hangs every now and again. My phone has been frozen for hours before I realized I wasn't receiving any calls. A simple power-down/reset was required to return the phone to normal functionality. It IS a bit frustrating if you need to use the phone while you're driving, though.5. This phone IS MAC COMPATIBLE!!! Yes, the software suite is for the PC, you can do so much more on the Mac. iSync recognizes this phone via a Bluetooth connection. You can sync calendar (iCal) and contacts (Address Book) data. Also, Salling Clicker (google it) is an INCREDIBLE application that allows you to remotely control your Mac using your 6682 via Bluetooth. Ignore the guy that says this phone isn't Mac compatible (and he returned his phone). He returned his phone before he actually checked out HOW to make it work with his Mac. Sorry for him.6. If you don't already have a card reader, GET one to transfer data to a large RS-MMC for this phone. I currently have a 1 Gig card, and I transfer AAC files to it all the time for a temporary iPod. MP3 files are better, because you can use the ID3 tags to see the artist information and song details. Sound through the included stereo headset is GREAT! You can even play music through a Bluetooth headset! Beware: When you start to fill up a large card such as a 1 Gig card, some of the menus will slow down quite considerably. For example, I have over 500 MB of songs, and this slows down the menu to select ring tones. You may think your phone has locked up, but it's just VERY slow! Be patient!In all, this is a GREAT phone! If you CAN wait, hold out for the Nokia N80. The N80 has an updated OS, a larger screen size, a better camera (even though it has no cover), and more on-board memory (64MB - the 6682 includes 8MB, not including the RS-MMC).If you want a phone that can be your portable computer, then check the 6682 out. If you can hold out (and want to pay more money on the initial release), then wait for the N80.
In the past month I've used 4 different phones from Cingular.  (RAZR, SLVR, LGCU500, and the 6682)  At first glance I didn't want this phone, it was big and a little bulky so I went with the other phones because they were smaller and more sleek.  To stay on topic the 6682 was my forth phone within my 30 day trial plan.  The rep kept trying to get me to use this phone all along.  Every complaint I had with the others, this phone could handle.  Looking back I'm very happy that I had made the switch...First let me address some concerns that others have posted.  You can put this phone in airplane mode, it is Mac compatible, you don't have to go through 500 menus to get to the text messaging  (The 4 Way and the 2 navagation buttons can be customized to ANY program), and if you don't like to use Nokia's headphones, then you can use your own with a dongle converter.Reception - is top notch.  I can hear people on the headset driving with the windows down.Bluetooth - Devices connect just fine, and I can connect to the internet with my laptop by using a bluetooth dongle.Apps - It's a Symbian OS phone - has tons of apps to customize your phone any way you want.Camera - a 1.3MP and the camera is rich with optionsMP3 Player - Comes with Realplayer and you can listen to MP3s while working on other programs.Overall - Sure I would have liked this to be a little slimmer, but for what this phone can do it makes up for the size.  Besides I see RAZRs all over the place being used now, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a phone that will stick out.  My friend just got one, only because its a "Flip-Phone".  I'm glad I didn't choose this book by its cover.
Pretty good phone.  Potential buyers should be warned that this phone is much larger than regular clam-shell phones.  It is even larger than the razor.  Here are the pros and the cons.Pros:- Nokia is a very considerate cell phone manufacture. (either that or I'm too used very low standards?)  The phone comes packaged with a 64mb miniSD card to play around with the phone. It further comes with a stereo headset that attaches to the phone so you can listen to music.  On top of that, it comes with a link cable to hook up the phone to your computer.  Compared to motorola (specifically, the razr and the slvr) which does not package their phone with a link cable, the nokia does a great job of giving the consumer everything they need right out of the box.  The samsung d807, by the way, does not come with anything besides the phone either (namely, it comes without headsets or datalink).  The link software is also included while the motorola razr requires you to buy a link software which never made any sense to me.- the camera is amazingly good.  The quality is good and it's got the best zoom out of all the camera phones I've ever seen.- it is very easy to download and install apps.- the phone looks pretty cool.  Especially when you are outside at night.  It is hard to describe it in words but the backlight seems more tastefull than the other manufactures.- The sound quality is GREAT.  I've had razr for 6 month and I reget buying that phone everyday for its utterly attrocious sound quality.  The nokia 6682 also gets much better reception than the motorola.  As a side note, the nokia gets better reception than the samsung d807 as well.- video seems pretty good.Cons:- this phone is pretty heavy.  It is larger than most phones out now-a-days. (I'm not including organizer-phones like blackberry or equivalent keyboard-type phones here although the nokia does a pretty good job as a powerful 3g phone).  If cute and small is your thing, DON'T GET THIS PHONE. Try the samsung d807 which is excellent in sound quality and performance.  I would not recommend a motorola razr for the reason of poor sound quality as described above.- the battery life is not so good. I got about 2 1/2 days of life out of this thing before recharge. (keep in mind that I did a lot of heavy calling and playing-around etc.)- the design seems a little clunky. (I kind of like it but others may find it too boxy or something so I put this in the con section)- the phone does lag a bit during heavy usage although I've never experienced a "lock-up" that others are refering to.Conclusion:All in all, pretty good phone.  My personal rating is 4.4 because of its size, weight and the battery life.  This phone has the best camera capability out of any phones out there in the US. (excluding the over-priced helio phones of course). I would recommend this phone to people who like taking pictures a lot and maybe some video for those "kodak-moments". Bloggers will probably get a kick out of this phone. If you want a smaller and slicker phone with good camera and video, go with the samsung d807.
I purchased this phone around the 1st of July 2006. After three weeks of use I can definitely say it is great deal. No money out for the phone and 550 minutes with Cingular at 60 bucks for 2 years sounds pretty reasonable to me.The sound quality of the phone is great.The sync software that comes with the phone and data cable worked flawlessly. I use outlook and sync with it on a weekly basis.The camera is good for must have shots - even if they are a bit lacking in quality.I have played with the recorder and probably could be useful.The phone screen is first rate and the phone construction is all quality - with the exception of the thin plastic cover for the camera lens.The only downside is the MMC dual voltage memory card is only 64 meg and it is hard to find a replacement card at best buy, office depot, etc...I have read other posts about this phone having to be rebooted and I have yet to experience that - thankfully.I highly recommend this phone.My wife got the pink Motorola Razor phone for free and it is okay - but not near the quality of this phone.
I won't attend to reviewing Cingular or Amazon here. I'd simply been through my second razr and asked if Cingular warranty services could send me a different phone that would actually last. They offered this as a replacement.In regards to the razrs: I finally realized the phone is form over function. The first lost most or all reception - its replacement had a problem with the buttons (a common problem I've read - the metal template for the buttons is great at first but 'sticks' or malfunctions eventually).Within an hour of getting this phone in the mail, I had the SIM card installed, and it asked me if I'd like to transfer all the contact information to the new phone. Well, yes, thanks for asking! How simple is that... Also had the phone connected to my computer via bluetooth and transferred all my Outlook contacts to the phone. Took a few test pictures, a test video (with sound!), transferred files between computer and phone... including MP3 songs that will play via speakerphone (not so great) or included headphones (w/ jack to use only on this phone). Within that hour I was convinced I made a great choice, and 3 days later I'm still a happy camper.I've not yet tried my bluetooth hands-free with this phone yet.This isn't the smartest of smartphones, but I don't need something as complicated as a treo or blackberry. The 6682 comes with a program to view office documents, web browser (Opera), and more. If the browser and email program work as well as everything else, those that use the programs will be more than satisfied. I personally won't need this connected to the internet.Reception seems better than anything else I've owned. Phone is  very well-built (like most Nokia's, I've heard).I'm very satisfied thus far. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.
Got this phone off Amazon.com for an irresistable deal - and man is it worth it! First thing that I noticed when I got this phone was that the size was slightly larger than my older flip LG VX6000 but the bigger LCD screen made it worth it.From what I saw of the phone, Nokia has put in a lot of thought into the placement of keys - they are comfortable to use - I was suprised as the ease of typing text using this keypad. The 6682 has a 5-way center button that I heard is susceptible to wear-and-tear (read need to replace) but thats about a year or two into using it.  The UI is clean and completely customizable.Software included is pretty good - The real advantage of this phone is accessing the web - simple and straight forward. I installed google local and it was smooth and works well for me. I am still trying to figure out how to get the pre-installed files on the included-64MB MMC card to the new 1 GB card that I have ordered - will updated this review once I have that.By far the most useful feature for me is the Sync feature with Lotus notes and Outlook. I wish Activesync made it easier on people like Nokia has done - IT is bliss to sync up my calendar and its vital for my job function because I have a lot of meetings to go to.I read someone else's review who said that he could not turn off the phone feature so that it could be used as a player alone on the plane - this can be done (its in the user manual guys!:) ) and its sweet because the MP3 player is very good - and is clear as hell. The only downside to the MP3 feature is that we need to use the custom headphones that Nokia provides which sucks because  there are so many better headphones out there that we could use. The phone takes in all kinds of formats - midi, mp3, acc - which is sweet because all you need to do to get your own ring tone is download your favorite tune and set it as your ring tone and you are set to go.I havent completely checked out the photo feature (it was not a priority for me when I bought it) but with the couple of photos that I took, it was good and Nokia provides some nifty software for editing and other fancy alterations.To summarize:Top features that I just absolutely DIG!1. Seamless Lotus/Outlook calendar sync2. Active Standby - this is what justifies calling it a Smartphone3. Support for multiple audio formats and a player that is not under control by the service provider (verizon made it compulsory to have their software to transfer anything - in this case, go to nokia.com and you can download the whole thing for free!)4. Complete CustomizationThings I wish were better1. Common Headphone adapter2. SD card instead of MMC (especially reduced voltage!!)3. A case with a belt holder (as you can see, its not a small phone!) == and I still havent found one here - am ordering this from Amazon - but its a pity that such a good phone does not have that facilityOverall - Awesome phone, great PIM (close enough to a PDA to get essential work done), Superb MP3 player!If you want a phone, get this - you will not regret it!
a good and honest review doesent just give the pro`s or the cons..but gives both, So here it isPro`s1)Nice fone, clear calls, speakerphone much much better than razr, good reception.2)Good camera, more so with the 6X zoom that can be used after taking the snap, can adjust brightness, has a flash, timer, night Mode, can also take snaps in a sequence.3) Can Sync calender and notes, address book..etc..with outlook with provided cable or over bluetooth.4) Converter(Currency/Pressure/weight/etc) works pretty good.5) have a 1 gb card with over 700 mb of mp3/images/videos/apps, works fine..no lags..6) Mp3 player is pretty good, sound through attached headset is awesome.7) got a nice secure wallet app.8) can write and deploy your own java app..easily..or a game( which i did)Cons:-1) accesing multiple apps ..can make the phone hang at times.2) Installing apps like google maps on fone or memory card...really eats the battery..from 3-4 days to 1 or 1.5 days.3) photographs..call the first one abc..rest by default get named abc1, abc2..so on.4) Adding a password to protect the SIm/fone if fone is lost..adds about 2 mts to the startup time.5) Nokia doesent give any free apps..like for word and excel free with the fone have to buy and install it ..99.99..additional.6) Only uses " dv " rs mmc(Dual voltage(1.8/3.3) Reduced size mmc)7) Can only schedule one alarm..multiple alarms..needs software available for 19.99(separately)8) doesent have infrared:- for those who wonder why does he want it...if present then can install a software to turn the fone into a remote for ur tv/vcr etc..
I bought this phone when my Nokia 6230 bit the dust. I'll be returning the phone this week. My review is biased in the sense that I am an AVID cell phone user and I use my phone primarily for text messaging, calendar, alarm clock, camera, and music. Here's the scoop:Pros: works with third party software such as MobiTV and MobiRadio.Large screen.Camera has a high resolution and a protective cover.Reception has been good.Cons: small keys, need to click through too many menus to send a text message. The phone is just too slow! Clicking on a menu takes about 2-3 seconds to load each page - I guess I was spoiled with the Nokia 6230. Bulky handset - too heavy and big. Third party software is expensive with Cingular: I needed to pay 20 bucks a month for unlimited internet and then 10.00 per month for MobiTv, 10 more for MobiRadio. Alarm clock doesn't have the option to set the alarm for multiple days. The headset that ships with the phone has two earbuds and doesn't stay in my ears. Intermittent "out of memory errors" even after upgrading the memory card to 512 MB. Camera cover slips open often while holding the phone. If you miss a call and the person leaves a voicemail, you see a message saying "new voicemail" but only after you click ok, do you see the "missed call". I think that the order should be reversed "missed call, then new voice mail" OR a small voice mail indicator. The backspace or "clear" button is too small and awkward.Hope this helps!
I got this phone yesterday after a long search for a good phone with the features am looking for. I got instant liking to this phone and this is the best phone I ever had. MP3 player is fantastic. Comes with 64MB RSMMC card, which is insufficient for the features this phone is having. Atleast 512MB card is required. Camera and Video features are great and are above average which is more than sufficient for a cell phone. Though looks little bit bulky, the features it is having makes you forget that. Transfered some files thru bluetooth capability of my laptop into RSMMC, and connection is good without any interruptions. Amazon promptly shipped the phone once they got go ahead from Cingular. Cingular took 5-7 days to approve the connection. Signal reception is very good and till now didn't experience any dropped calls. There are so many features to explore in this phone. Overall this is a great phone to have at a steal away deal Amazon is offering.
I bought this a month back.  This phone is having pretty much everything you wanted including the MP3 player, camera, video, and lot more custom applications.Pros:- This is pretty good in all aspect and reception is great- Battery life is above average- Having all the features in it that you like to have- PC synchronization is very easy once you install the given software- Bigger display with 256K colorCons:- Somewhat bigger- Once the camera cover opens, it starts the camera application even when the keypad is locked.  Thank GOD after a while, the camera goes to standby (may prevent the rapid battery discharge a little)Over all it is great phone to have in the Nokia brand!
The american cell phone market has little variety when it comes to GSM  phones, and most phones offered by providers are older technology, stuff that came out years ago in other countries. However, cingular has finally brought in a phone worth calling home about.The Nokia 6682 is easily one of the best phones for the money availiable now. Cingular released it some time ago, but customers reported multiple software issues. Months later, the phone was re-released, and it looks great.Body, form factor: Sits comfortably in your hand. It looks bulky, but is not really that heavy. You'll know when it falls out of your pocket, but it won't break your thigh if you're wearing tight jeans. The buttons are easy enough to press, from the way you'd hold it and the camera shutter is accessible. The shutter looks amazing, but is sightly rickety. I keep worrying about breaking it. It's a sturdy phone, and looks classy, and business like.Call quality: Great, even on one bar of signal. This is limited onlyby cingular's network, which is supposed to be all over, but hey, I lose reception walking into a building.Battery Life: I have to recharge every night. I listen to music on the phone a lot, around 2 hours a day, at least, and especially when I run, and I lose about 2 bars of battery at the end of the day. I don't make too many calls, but I do play a few symbian games. I'd suggest getting a better battery if nokia relesaes one here.Screen: The screen adapts to light, going darker when you're in a low light region and turning off the key lights, and going brighter in sunlight. This is a great battery saving feature.Memory Card: The phone comes with a standard 64MB Dual Volt RS MMC cardn which can hold, well , almost nothing. I bought a 1GB card forabout 20 dollars, and I love it. The little slot is so sleek, and easy to use.Music:The inbuilt music player is good, but it sorely needs a keylock feature. I downloaded a free player (.ogg player) and I use it when I need to lock the phone, but it's just not as good as the inbuilt player. the speakerphone allows you to play music, but don't expect it to make a party happenning. The headohones nokia gives you are sweet, but only when it comes to audio quality, but more on tha later. The phone can play .aac, .mp3, .mp4, .m4a, .ogg, but not .wma files. If the phone came with a slot for headphones, it would have been close to perfect. I bought a kittle headphone adapter, and I use that with my regular headphones.Camera: Great Camera, in daylight and when it's dark, but try taking pictures in yellow light or low light and they look really bad. In the dark, you'd have to use the flash in conjunction with the night mode, or else, the picutres  won't be that good. The digital zoom is okay, not worth praising or criticizing. I only wish it had a dedicated camera button, like most bar phones. The camera is covered by a slightly rickety slider, which looks really nice. The video camera is sketchy, but you can use  the regular camera as a replacement for your digital camera.Data features: This phone features great connectivity. The in built browser is good, but the Opera (which you will have to  pay for) is seriusly awesome. The phone uses EDGE, class 10 GPRS, and is possibly better than any phone on the US market. I accessed my email easily enough, and looked at a couple of mobile sites, but don't use this feautre unless you're willing to shell out cash for Media Net.Messaging: The keypad is easy enough to use, but still won't threaten the benchmark set by the Nokia 3310 (3390 in the US). The keys could have been a little bigger, but these are still great to use.Software: there is a reason why Symbian is so awesome, and one use of the phone will show you how. If I started talking about it, I wouldn't stop, so I'm not going to start. I will tell you that Cingular's modifications of the phone are just not that hot.Fun Stuff: You can use mp3s as ringtones (I'd reccommend "Show me how to live"-Audioslave, it sounds so impressive). You can also install and run a lot of Java games with impressive graphics, as well as other applications that work with Symbian. You can also watch videos in 3GP, you can get the converter free online (Ithing, I haven't looked yet). The media gallery is nice, but what takes the cake is the image manager, which shows pictures in a ring, with the ones closest to you magnified more than the ones behind.Connectivity: Great Bluetooth, no infrared. EDGE.Other things worth noting: Freezes up sometimes, and gives a low memory warning when you open ceterin programs or games.Accesories: Nokia provides you with a stereo handsfree/headset that will not stay in your ears unless you glue them in. However, the audio quality is excellent, better than a lot of headphones I've used. I bought a nokia activity headset, HS-8, but it sucked, and had the worst audio quality I've ever had to endure (Looks so pretty though).The charger is sleek, and easy to carry when you travel. The data cable is good, but if you're trying to transfer 700MB of music, you can either leave it overnight or use an SD card reader (I bought mine for a buck on amazon).The verdict: Great phone, for anyone tech savvy. Can serve as a replacement for a digital camera (for casual images) and an mp3 player. Better than most other phones on the market. Snap it up. You won't see too many phones this good in the US. If you still want something better, try Europe.
I purchased 2, and both of them are still performing good..no problems so far..Pros:>good reception, conversations loud and clear on both ends>expandable memory>easy to useCons:>port connector for headphone will loosen in time as it did with my last 2 nokia phones.. will get bluetooth headset this time..>supplied headset very awkward to use, no adjustment mentioned in manual, I do not think many will like the design..mine will just stay in  the box.>somewhat big but still fit in my pocket>camera cover slide open to easy..increases battery comsumption if unaware its open, happened to me more than 3 times>average battery lifeall in all I am still happy with this phone...
I bought this phone couple of months back and till date I am extremely happy with it. It's a bit bulky but somehow I do not like the sleek ones. I do feel good about it's weight. It has a wonderful camera @1.3 MP with a slot for memory stick. A 8MB stick also comes with the original box. So if you are photo freak then you can consider a bigger stick. But for casual photography the stick is sufficient.Being a Nokia, there is no doubt about navigation and ease of use. The software is good and does most the task with ease. I did have some problem installing the software but when installed, there was no problem at all. I do use it only occasionally.Just a reminder for those people who try to compare this with PDAs....this is not a PDA...its a smart phone.With holux GPS receiver and software you can actually make this phone a full fledged navigation system with voice, if you want.
I recieved this phone from Cingular's lock-line insurance.  I had Siemens S66, which was defective and the most comparable available phone to the S66 was the Nokia 6682.  Man, am I glad the S66 wasn't available!  This phone was an absolute steal for the $50 deductible.When I first recieved this phone I actually thought IT was defective because when I'd press the keys they wouldn't light up.  Come to find out, they only light up when the surrounding environment is dark.  How cool is that!Anyways on with the review.  This phone does everything from web browse to text to games to photo and video with ease.  The photo and video is good quality, not great.  It doesn't exactly focus all to well, but it does well in poorly lighted areas as it has a good flash.You can really download some super cool games from gameloft.com for this phone.  The center scroll does well to control your games.  Beautiful, large color screen.This phone also works well as a music player.  You can easily transfer songs from any cd onto Nokia PC suite then onto the phone.  The memory card supplied with the phone is 64mb which is enough to hold a good amount of info, no mater what you want.In conclusion, I would say you should definately get this phone.  It will conform to all your smartphone needs as well as be your companion when your bored.
I got the phone for almost a month now. It should be between 4 and 5 stars. I had a bulky Nokia 3650. It is a very good phone but it is too big and the dial pad is not easy to be used. I tried Sony T610 and Razr. I think the Nokia 6682 is the one I like the most (now I have a backup battery).Somebody said they wish they could turn off the phone to listen to mp3 files on the plane. Actually, you can do that. If you pick the "Offline" profile, it will turn off the phone. Somebody complaint the quality of picture they took at night. I got the same problem. However, I got much better picture after I changed the setting to night mode. It has self timer too (not very useful to me though)Pro:1. Much cheaper than Treo but it is smaller than most PDA phones.2. Good signal and battery life.3. The whole package includes many goodies: the phone, a separate charger, memory card (loaded with softwares), CD-ROM with softwares, USB cable, headphones.4. There are many free and trail softwares. I can read WORD, EXECL, Powerpoint (not so good), and PDF files. Some games are better than I expected. I didn't know the phone can watch TV (there's a MobiTV application) !5. The phone/PC sychn-up software is good.6. I still like bluebooth.7. Photo editing and video editing are nice.8. The camera cover is nice.9. The phone is understatement - good - won't attact too much attention.10. I can set up many short keys.Con (minor things to me):1. Not as thin as the Razr.2. The camera cover can be opened easily (I like to put the phone in my pany pocket). If you have the phone locked, you can still activate the camera by opening the cover.3. I wish the headphone is in better quality (it's ok) or I can use other headphones.4. I wish other carriers have this phone.5. I guess I can only buy additional memory card from Nokia or the carrier.6. The PC suite could be better.With the rebate, it is a steal.
Nokia phones are the best for the very simple reason that they have the best reception of any other phone manufacturer on the market.  Yes, I know that reception in large part depends on your service provider, but reception does vary by phone manufacturer and Nokia is the best in this department.Pro's- Excellent reception (I even get full bars underground in a subway station).  I have Cingular service in Hoboken, New Jersey- Very good camera phone- Nice, big screen with excellent resolution- Very easy to use, good functionality- Keypad is easy to use because keys are raised.  Good for text messaging.Con's- Its a bit bulky and heavy- The Blue tooth capability does not work the Hands Free Link in my car (2006 Acura TSX).Overall a great phone and highly recommended, but don't get this phone if you have Hands Free Link system in your Acura.  [...]
I got my 6682 as an insurance replacement after my other phone went sliding down the highway at 75 mph.... :(  The increase in size took a while to get used to, but now I like the solid feel of a palm size phone.  The screen is very high resolution and the 1 meg pics look good once they are on the computer.  As long as you have a newer computer and good internet, loading the drivers and synching software - while tedious - works well.  This phone has replaced my Palm Tungsten for all practical purposes... it is my alarm, date/appointment minder and throw down picture taker.The web based stuff is slow, but adequate for getting information on a cell phone... news, weather, e-mail in an emergency.I have not tried blackberry products, but on what phone knowledge, I do have, I recommend this product.  If you are a music buff, I would recommend a higher capacity card.  If the card is loaded to the gills, the phone tends to hang and all the good things I just said go out the window... :)All the best,Jay
Before I Buy ANYTHING, I always do my research and read EVERY review. I knew this was the phone I was going to get and when I got it, it was MUCH better than I expected.First I Like that its big and bulky. People seem to forget that TOO SMALL and THIN means easy to lose and fragile. I like that I can feel this phone at all times but its not so big that it protrudes. EVERYONE loves this phone.It is AMAZINGLY customizable, I can upload MP3s after installing the easy to use software it runs just like a Digital Camera. I can use MP3s as ringers change phone themes, Camera works really well, sounds great, bluetooth is nice if you have a good headset, and MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL RECEPTION IS AMAZING. I Went from VERIZON to CINGULAR in the NYC area and I can barely tell the difference which Im sure there is but its hard to tell.Razr is a good phone too but If you want to be a little different from everyone else, go with this.
This phone is AWESOME!!!  After two and a half months of research, I settled on this phone, and I am very happy that I did.  It's way more than a phone first of all.  Despite that however, its still a damn good phone.  So if all you want is a phone, this phone will do it, but it would be a waist, because it can do so much more.  So far my phone is a DVD player (with Finding Nemo, Anchorman, and Coming to America ON THE PHONE), it's an mp3 player (280+ songs) it's an NES with super Mario 1, 2, 3, and Zelda, and 30+ more games, it's got a bible on the phone, its got a kamasutra in it, its got Microsoft word and Excel.  It's got a program in which I can put my class schedule, and the phone goes to silent during class, and back to normal between classes.  The 6682's camera is nice, but it does have memory issues.  That's the main problem many people run into.  When doing too much at once, sometimes the phone asks you to close other apps.  For example, about 1 out of 4 pictures I take, WHILE listening to the mp3 player, the phone wants me to close the mp3 player, the phone can't save the pic unless I do.  Pictures are very nice, if you don't use the zoom.  Voice clarity is good.  Some fun things to know.  You can play mp3s for 7-9hrs and watch dvds 4-6hrs, estimated.  I've never done them all the way to empty, so I can't say exactly.
This phone has everything the business professional needs (and some things they don't).  The Symbian OS makes the perfect base for expandability without the limitations of Palm's PDA-centric design decisions.Pros:-expandability with free and commercial software-the Active Standby screen is great-excellent battery life-easy to access memory card-easy desktop syncing with INCLUDED cableCons:-camera cover is cheap and too easy to open-headset connector is non-standard-memory cards are very hard to findAll in all, this is a great phone for the budget-minded professional.  It won't cost you the $300-400 that a similarly powered Windows Mobile or Palm phone would cost.
This is a very well featured phone having a multitude of features and capabilities. However, the only aspect that I want to rate it on is the signal quality. This is by far one of the best phones for getting a good reception. I know that I will only use Nokia phones in the future.
This is my first cell phone. (Seriously... I'm not a caveman.)Pros:-Great battery life. Usually lasts a few days for me, especially if I turn down the backlight. Battery indicator is very misleading, as it will show full until it has about 35% left.-Bluetooth works great.-Survived conversations during rainstorms.-Ergonomically satisfying size/weight.-Compatible with m4a, mp4, mp3, and other sound formats.-Intuitive interface, for the most part.Cons:-Weak vibrate mode.-Voice dial doesn't work well.-Lag when opening the 'Gallery'-- photos and music. This is only really a problem when you've hit the button accidentally.-Interface isn't as customizable as I'd like.-Sliding camera door is rather flimsy.-Incompatible for synching with Macs below system 10.4, and Nokia has nothing to say about this.-Memory card is RS-MMC, which means that you can get a better card about nowhere.If I had to say one thing that I really don't like about this phone, it's the sliding camera door. In addition to always feeling compelled to fiddle with it (it's spring-loaded...), it feels rather flimsy, and my instinct is to press against this part of the phone when holding it up to my ear. I suppose this isn't a big deal, but it's certainly bothersome.UPDATE:Still working great after two months. One in maybe fifty calls I'll get a bad connection where there's this weird feedback from the microphone. I've dropped it a few times, too, although I'm not sure I'd like to drop it any more than I absolutely have to. Also, the vibrate mode isn't very good-- I've missed calls when the phone was in my jacket pocket, etc. But ultimately, it's still five stars. =)
I bought this phone because I needed something that could be used as a phone and a pda in one and you can never go wrong with a Nokia. The sound was surprisingly good and the photos were crisp and clear. The video quality is not so great. The applications that come with this phone include real player, opera, adobe acrobat and a mobile version of office. For me however, the 64MB card is not big enough and I do plan on buying a larger one. At first I thought that the phone was too big but now I look at other phones and laugh at their tiny screens and they all seem so inadequate now!
I have been using Nokia for past 4 days. This is an awesome phone,perhaps the best phone so far .It has tons of features,very easy to use ,big and bright screen, great Camera,speaker and voice dialing capability..It is very much as per my expectations
I have bought many things off of Amazon but this is my first review.I have researched the cell phone reviews on CNET and other sites to come up with the perfect cell phone.  I am always disappointed because all the phones are reviewed as is they must be the best of everything, camera, MP3 player, organizer, toy, etc.  I just wanted a phone that is good for calling and receiving calls.  That's it.Oh I also wanted Bluetooth so I could call handsfree when driving.  And have good vmail, an alarm clock, a place to do business, and to keep track of friends.Yes it has all the other features including spreadsheeting and word processing but I will never really know how good these are because I will take pictures with my digital camera instead, and I will listen to music on my ipod, and I will type my memos using my PC.But as a phone this is it.Yes it has small keys but have you tried a Blackberry?  I have gotten used to the keys by using my fingernails, and I must say I have gotten pretty good.  However I do not use this to type long text messages.  Rather I call people to talk.  Although I use the Bluetooth earphone, the speaker phone is loud enough so I probably don't need the Bluetooth.It has excellent brightness and color so I can see what I am dialing even in bright sunlight, it has great sound, it has excellect tools for managing contact lists and one touch dialing, and it can be configured to have the most important features as one touch.  The phone comes configured as if you are going to spend all the time surfing the net, trade on EBAY or take pictures.  I changed all that to suit me.  If you cannot experiment to get the configuration right or you must have everything simple then this phone may not be for you.For me, I have configured it so this is just right.
D807 and Nokia 6682 are two top selling phones with Cingular plans. I happened use both of them recently. Samsung is little smaller, less weight and that's about all the advantages Samsung D807 has. Nokia 6682 has much more features with bigger screen, without adding much weight. The reception and voice quality is excellent.  Overall, I LOVE this Nokia phone.
I definitely like this full-featured smartphone. It does everything I'd like in a phone (and then some...). This phone uses the Reduced Size MMC and comes with a 64M card, which I felt was too small to be truly useful, so I replaced it with a 1G card for less than $35. I picked up a Logitech Bluetooth hands-free that works very well with the Nokia. The display is large, bright and has vivid colors. On the down side, the speaker leaves a little to be desired, and the voice recognition is a somewhat clunky to operate and doesn't seem to be as "forgiving" as my old Kyocera. Finally, the shape is a definite candybar--it's almost perfectly rectangular, so I've been unable to find a decent case for the phone, and Nokia doesn't offer one. All in all, a very good phone worthy of the Nokia name.
I bought this phone not long after it came out, and I'm very impressed by it. The features are great and it's extremely customizable.The camera works great and I found that I really like the sliding cover for the lens.The speakerphone works well for me, and is very clear. I've never needed the headset thanks to this.It took some time to master the keylock, but I've had Nokia bar phones before so that made it a little easier.Overall, I love the phone and I'm very pleased with it!
Having had several cell phones damaged over time, I got tired of always losing address books on my phones. I decided that I wanted to sync my information with my iMac. I carefully researched all Mac-compatible cell phones, and I selected the Nokia 6682. And I am absolutely glad that I did. This is by far the best cell phone I've ever owned. I've had 3 Nokia phones with BellSouth Mobility & Cingular), 1 Samsung (Sprint), and 1 LG (Verizon) before buying this one.I was able to sync with my Mac on the first try, although it took 2 tries to get the two items as "trusted devices." I sync my address book, calendar, and to-do items effortlessly.The buttons are a little small, but that is my only complaint, and that is a minor issue with me since I do mainly voice dialing.
This phone is stellar. Look around. All you see are RAZRs. RAZRs everywhere.Then my buddy bought one of these. A Nokia 6682. Candybar cool. I had to have one. I even jumped providers to have one!NOW I can REALLY personalize my phone the way I WANT IT and I can do it EASILY!  Pop the Micro-MMC card into my laptops's reader and I can transfer any theme or ringtone as I choose. I am no longer victim to my former carrier's proprietary services. My phone is now MY phone!It is simplisticly elegant. Very powerful and contrary to what others say, extremely easy to use if you just read the instructions!Get one while you can because these won't be around for long. Don't be a RAZR clone!
I did a lot of research when selecting a new phone.  I really wanted to go from a seperate cell phone and PDA to a single device, but I didn't really want one of those clunky (to me anyway) Treo-type devices.So when it was time to renew our phone contract, I ended up getting two of these units, one for myself and one for my wife.  At first, I was quite pleased with the purchase.  It has many, many features and really did everything that I was looking for.Unfortunately, my wife and I both found the phones to be very unreliable.  They would frequently lock up, and often times when you would try to do something you'd get an "Out of Memory" error.  The only way I could alleviate this was by powering off the phone.  Sometimes it would lock up to the point that the only way to recover was to actually remove the battery.On at least a couple of occassions, I tried to call my wife, or she tried to call me, and the call went to the phone, but the phone did not ring/vibrate/or anything.  It got to the point where we got in the habit of "rebooting" our phones at the beginning of each day to try to minimize problems.My wife got fed up with hers, so I bought her an unlocked Razr.  She's much happier with it.  I planned on keeping mine, but one day it started throwing up the "out of memory" error and I could no longer use the phone.  Powering down, removing the battery, nothing mattered ... every time I'd power it on, within a few minutes, the phone would stop working and every attempted action would result in an "out of memory" error.I could chalk it up to a bum unit but we had similar problems with both phones.  If they ever get all the bugs worked it, it would probably be a nice phone.  Meanwhile, I went ahead and bought myself an unlocked Razr, too, and while it doesn't have as many features, it's much less frustrating for day-to-day use.
This is a very cool phone, unfortunately it crashes every couple days and in order to get it going again I have to remove the battery, replace it and restart it.  I will be exchanging it for something better.  So sad.
i just got this phone a week ago.its better than my pink razor,i love it coz it has MP3,takes  good pictures,i really like nokia phone than any other phone.love it !!love it  !!love it!!!!!
I've owned a couple MOTOROLA  before and have to admit they do have cool-looking phones. They look so fashionable, stylish, and making you feel young. But...the only thing I hate is they dropped my calls a lot. I mean...A LOT! My calls would be just disconnected unreasonable when I only talked on my phone about 10-15mins. Sometimes even 5 mins!NOKIA, maybe some of their phones look chunky, not so cool as motorola, not-so-stylish kind of phones, but they DO HAVE the best quality of cell phones. Not mention the battery life, humanize functions, and of course, keeping stable while being used. I'll highly recommend NOKIA to anyone who are looking for a well made, great quality cell phone.And what is so good about Nokia  6682? Well, check out a lot reviews here and you'll see. They've got everything!
This is my first Smartphone and now I know what I have been missing. You can do so much with this phone especially with all the Symbian software out there - Unlimited video recording, Play MP3, Great camera for a phone and a Flash to boot, Can be used as a GPS unit with the added GPS receiver & softweare, play MAME games, and much much more. Oh and it functions very well as phone too ;-)
After looking at all reviews on Amazon, I decided to go for this phone in spite of being an avid fan of Samsung. Problems started right from day 1. Signal inside my apartment was way too less, and I would have to sit at one place while talking for fear of the call dropping. Still, the phone would be inconsiderate and would drop one out of two calls. My friends who have Cingular come to my apartment, and they get pretty strong signal everywhere!!! Alright... move over to my work place. Wow!! Full strength signal!!. I make a call, and this drops as well... And the display promptly shows 'No network', and then after 2 minutes shows me full strength signal. Ah! I should not forget to mention this. At the underground garage, there is no signal whatsoever. But, once you reach ground level, our hero is still sleeping. He decides that it is time to search for signal after 2-3 minutes. This is the first time that I have seen a phone that freezes/hangs. I would make a call, but I would never be able to terminate it. At times, it would show me 'Calling so-and-so' for 2-3 minutes, but the next step of call setup never seems to happen. I went to a Cingular store, where this knowledgeable representative gives me an engineering solution of restarting the phone, but the caveat being that I should take out the battery while the phone was switched on. As expected, there was no improvement. But, after this, the frequency with which the phone would restart on its own went up. I had my own doubts if my phone was haunted. This apart, in terms of plain usability, this phone is sloppy. I could not find out how to change the ring tone without referring the manual. The menu loads soooo slow that you begin wondering if you went back to stone age. Pressing the green button that you normally press to make a call displays the outgoing calls that you made. But, if you want to see received calls and missed calls, go get some exercise by going through three levels of menu. I called up the Warranty Department of Cingular and arranged to have them get me a replacement. The pathetic part about that is that I would get the same product again. Oh God!!! 1.5 years more for my contract to get over :-( Go get the Samsung D807 and be happy.Following up on my earlier review in which I was hoping that something was wrong with the particular instrument that I was having...  I received yet another Nokia 6682 as a replacement. I was hoping to see a 'Nokia' performance in this one at least. But, it turns out that this level of genius is inbuilt into the phone. Basically, if you do not want your friends to call you up often and disturb you, do carry this phone. Because, the calls never reach you! Your friends would start to complain that you are not picking up their calls, ignoring them, and eventually give up!! The best part is when you would not even see your phone alerting you when there is a call. The silent killer!!  This phone has a lot of jazz with its super-fast mode of operation. Press any button, and wait up to 5 seconds for it to respond. Incredible 21st century technology, huh? But still, other reviewers seem to be amazing. They are thrilled in having a Adobe reader, a voice recorder, a browser, etc. Who cares if you can make a call? Try making one, and your call would drop at least twice for sure. And, if you have a friend who has a pathetic Samsung D807 next to you, he would just go on talking. Poor guy... he does not have a Adobe reader though... what good is that phone?? Oh!! and, did I tell you about the state-of-the-art technology in this phone that shuts down the phone when it hangs, so you just have to power it up rather than power it down and then power it up. That is energy conservation for you. All through the last week, my Nokia 6682 switched off by itself on 5 different occasions.  Given the need for all this high-tech jazz and the ability to make a call, you could carry a laptop and a nice phone. or, you could carry a Nokia 6682 and a phone... the Nokia would be your 1MB-RAM laptop.
I'm pretty disappointed in this phone. It's got poor battery life, and a complicated and buggy interface. It's also very large and bulky. Beyond that, the thing that annoys me most is that there doesn't seem to be any way to have it lock the keypad automatically after some idle period. The end result of that is that I forget to manually lock the keypad and it sits there beeping quietly in my pocket until the battery runs out or it calls a random person from my address book.Unless you want all the whiz-bang extra features for people with a data plan, I'd suggest sticking with a simpler phone that has a good battery life and basic phone features like keypad lock.
First this is a very solid phone with good reception. Especially like the capablity to remap 7 programable buttons and re-orgnized icons/folders to totally change Cingular's default setting that always try to bring me to their value-add services.
Just got this phone last week and have already started liking it. Excellent reception. You will fall in love with its look. MP3 player is well designed and sound quality is GREAT. Sharp display.This is a MUST have phone and is a steal at this price
POWERFUL PHONE WITH TONS OF NICE FEATURES!!!SUPER RECEPTION,LARGE SCREEN,THE CAMERA TAKES ALMOST AS GOOD OF PICS AS MY CANON POWERSHOT.SPEKERPHONE IF GREAT, I LEAVE IT MY SHIRTPOCKET AND CHAT IT UP!!!!! GE YOURSELF ONE I DID!
I'm using it for the last one-week and so for so good.Pros:1. Screen is visble in bright sunlight too. Motorolla's Razor is just the opposite.2. Call Recpetion/ Speaker Phone/ Battery life or charge all are good.3. Camera's Image quality is between Ok and Good.4. Simple Navigation.Cons:1. Just a bit too big.2. Key pad space could have been more.3. Camera shutter/cover dosen't fit perfectly.Conclusion: I recommend u to buy this. It does it's job unlike Razor whose reception, screen, speaker phone, battery life - all are Compromise for it's sleek/stylish design. If you want a phone for communication buy this. If you want to show-off buy Razor.
I got this Phone as an upgrade to my current Cingular plan. Paid about 199$ for the upgrade through business plan. I wanted a Phone primarily that has some decent PDA functionality. THis phone did not disappoint at all. However, if you are looking for a high end PDA that works as a Phone then you might have to look at the HP,Palm or other Windows CE devices. But most of these devices i have tried were great PDAs but not as good with the Phone. (I thought PDA was added functionality , phase was the basic functionity maybe Palm and HP have forgotten that)Pros:1. Nokia software works fine and with ease. There had been reported problems with call logs vanishing etc ala Cingular firmware just cannot fault the phone for that though. I waited till the firmware fix came along and got the phone. All seems to be good now with the fix.2. Design has a business look. Donot fooled by the cheap display models some cingular dealers keep as that poorly made display model does not do justice to the great display(262k equivalent of Razr) and the stylish keys albeit a little small and gets some getting used to.3.Bluetooth connectivity was good and worked easily with IOgear Headset and my PC. Also worked without a hitch in connecting to my wifes Razr to transfer some contacts.4. Software, USB cable, Headset and 64MB card(not enough capacity) but comes as a package unlike Moto Razr that requires me to buy all of the above and the Razr i have does not have memory slot.5.Speakers are great and using speaker phone at home is equivalent of using headsets.6.Light sensing for control of display brightness is a nice touch.7. Symbian OS is fine but if you are a Palm or Blackberry fan it will take some time getting used to.Cons:1.Camera Cover feels like lower grade plastics and come off easily.2.Infrared is not available. Bluetooth works well but infrared is easier with some devices eg: Palm E3.Connectors are not standard i.e USB and Headset(Wired)4.Memory card could've have been Mini SD as Nokia promised to stick to MiniSD but uses Dual Voltage RSMMC. A little difficult to find.
This phone has it all and I even dropped it a bunch of times and it still works great: it has a flash, a memory card and it takes great pictures, it's durable and very easy to use. The only thing I hate about it is its bulky and heavy compared to other phones, but I still think that its worth it.
I'm sure many other people wrote their reviews of this amazing phone... I won't go into details of how future-rich it is. You can even turn it into a navigation system (check out [...]I switched from a horrible motorola v600 phone (never again motorola!) and this phones reception and stability are 100x better!! I highly recommend this phone to anybody looking for a peace of mind making phone calls!!
very impressed with the service provided by amazon and cingular. recieved my product within 3 days, and was well upto my expectations.
This is a great phone, the kind of phone I was looking for. It has everything mp3 player, camera/video, voice recorder, office (to-do, calendar, notes, etc and synchronizable with outlook), internet (e-mail), tv/radio and few others.Also, it comes with its own Symbian OS. You can transfer mp3 songs, pics and any other files easily via your computer. It has much more features and its going to be exciting discover them.The only problem with the phone are the phone buttons, they are very close to each other and it is a bit tricky to press the correct one.
Its a nice phone with good features. Voice cannot be recorded for morethan 1 minitue. that is not good for a phone like this. otherwise, its a good phon.e
I just bought this phone from the Cingular store yesterday.  I played with most of the features throughout the day and many hours last night.  Lugged it around and used it to talk and text message (T9 predictive txt works).  I opted not to surf the net with this phone, I require at least a 17" screen to actually enjoy my internet surfing.  Oh, I did try out the GPS system with this phone ... trial software that allows you two tries before you are required to pay for registration.This entire experience was not what I wanted in the first place.  I wanted a fancy phone, but I did NOT want a PDA.  This phone TRIES to be a PDA phone, but I have used a Blackberry before and this 6682 phone falls well short of convenient PDA functionality.  This phone is NOT light... for a PDA, yes, for a regular phone, NO.The form factor is barely acceptable for a cell phone.  The front facia has an excellent design.  I have no problem getting used to the key/button layout.  The quality of the buttons are superb.  The navigation button in the center is efficient.  The size of the screen is extremely large for a cell phone.  The display is extremely bright and the brightness of the display is controlled by a light sensor that is located on the top left area of the phone.The BACK of the phone on the other hand has more to be desired.  The camera is located in the back and has a cheap, cheap plastic cover over it for protection.  The cover can be easily slid open if you slip it in and out of your pocket... as a cell phone SHOULD be allowed to do!  It is just not a comfortable feeling thinking that the camera lens would be exposed at anytime without you noticing.  You can avoid this by buying a belt clip or possibly with a phone cover.  I am not a belt clip person.The speed of the phone is much faster than my old 6820 phone.  Browsing through 6820 was a really tough task.  I memorize the shortcuts for my phones and the 6820 never could keep up with my shortcut access, I always have to WAIT for the screen to show up before pressing the next step.The performance of the 6682 (Symbian) OS is acceptable.  When you start it off from idle, it takes a brief moment for it to get going.  After that, it chugs along with an acceptable speed.  It took approximately 40 seconds for it to boot up after I turned it off, including entering a password.Learning where everything is located takes a while, nothing is really that intuitive.  The clock is located under the OFFICE folder instead of SETTINGS.  What's up with the daylight savings time?  I turn it on and the hour jumps ahead and messes up all the time.  I turn it off and the time is back to normal, so does that mean it can not automatically adjust daylight savings?One neat thing is that you can configure the placement of the buttons.  Seems like this phone is pretty configurable.  I was able to get rid of the default right button that was point to the web to MUSIC.  It's nice to be able to do all this.Get real, the 1.3 MP camera resolution is really bad.  There is NO focus!  The cost of this phone, the customer should expect something better than a cheap 1.3 MP camera.  Utterly useless, because it is intrusive physically as you hold it.  You can not just avoid using the camera and forget about it.  If they had left out the camera, consequently omitting the cheap back cover, this phone would have been MUCH more attractive.  Seriously.The RS-MMC (Reduced sized MultiMedia Card) is not your conventional memory card that is being used everywhere.  I believe the SD will be used in future Nokia devices.  Unfortunately, they were unable to implement the SD card idea into this 6682 phone.  Therefore, RS-MMC can not be obtained inexpensively.  Sure it comes with 64MB RS-MMC card, but last I checked, only about 40MB is available by default.  Let's see you store an entire album of music in that space... not.  The RS-MMC card does have an adapter so that it can turn into the size of a regular SD, so that you can stick it into a SD card reader device.Oh, I am not sure if I can attach a photo to each individual phone book contacts.  I have tried to find this through the manual, but have not come across this option.  I can not imagine this feature would be left off of this smart phone.  I probably just can't find it, but I don't feel like looking for this information online... I'll tell you later why.My old 6820 phone was missing the automatic security lock that I had enjoyed from back in the days when I used a TDMA phone.  This 6682 phone has the security lock included.  You can set the time for the phone to lock with a password, very nice in case your phone gets stolen.  Especially as this is a smart phone, you would want your valuable information to be secured.Two very good functions about this phone.  The sound quality through the headsets/earphone (included) is as good as a high quality MP3 player.  The speakerphone quality is loud, but if you play music you are better off enjoying it through the earphones.The reception for this phone is pretty good as all Nokia phones are known to be.  I have no bones with the signal quality, it's great.  The talk time, battery, is very strong.  I have owned this for one day so I can not say too much... but I've taken photos, listened to music and played with virtually all the applications for the entire day and I don't see the battery bar going down at all.This phone is heavy, did I mention that already?  I have gotten tired of it by now.  Trying to configure it and text messaging with this phone for a period of time makes you aware of the weight of the phone.Oh, that's right, this is a "smart phone".  Well, I finally understand that a smart phone is just another way of describing a phone that does everything "half-donkey behind".  I will give it 3 stars ratings, just in between.In conclusion, I am not satisfied with this phone.  It has too much of what I do not need and not efficient enough with what I want it to be.  I will be returning this phone for something a little less snazzy.  This is why I do not care to investigate any further online to utilize this phone.Pros:Nice interface - huge screen, crystal clear with abundant of colors.Buttons works for me, configurable.Good reception.Case is nice LOOKING all around.You can use your old adapters for this device (i.e. car charger).Cons:Oh camera feature is so useless.CHEAP plastic cover for the lens & can accidentally slide open without notice.Phone becomes noticeably heavy after a period.OS not intuitive, so be prepared to take time to learn it.Tons of applications, but most require purchase after trial use.As of now, this phone can not be unlocked.
I've had this phone for a few months now. I'm not a kid and I could see how kids would love this type of phone because it does so much stuff. All I wanted was good sound loud enough to hear. It did deliver that.I went from a flip phone to this one. To disable the keys is almost impossible. You have to be very fast and it is easy to hit some of the buttons on the edge unless you are using both hands, so you start over. What makes it really bad is when you want to enable the keys. The screen does not turn on when you touch the keys. You don't know if your phone is off or locked. You must hit the power button to have it light up. If you accidentally double hit the button, it turns off.Many times when using the directory you can push the 4 position key and cause it to get on the Internet... for a ten cent charge. Each month I have charges for my internet use and I have never intentionally intended to get on the internet.I can say the Plantronics Voyager 510 headset works great with this phone... much better than the Jabra models.
Pros:Very good form factor, Good RF reception, Good sound qualityGood camera .. even has a lens cover.Camera takes good quality pictures .. music player is pretty good and loud and so is phoneCons:Keys are too small and close to each otherSoftware is totally useless if you want to synch with outlook.Connector for Stereo head phone is bulky.Standard 2.5 mm jack is missing.Lens cover feels cheap and wiggles.No way to upgrade software.These may seem like small items, but they will annoy you quickly to curse the phone.Comments:It's good phone .. but doesn't work for the PDA functionaliy, the software is too bad. I love Nokia .. but there are much better phones in the market today to spend your money on this.The new phones have too many features and are pushed out by vendors very aggressively, not having the ability to uprade the phone software makes this phone very unattractive.If you want a PDA phone with MP3 player .. Sony has better solutions though as a standalone phone . .it's excellent.The manual is rather skimpy
I recently ordered a new phone and also 3 other phones. I was already an existing customer with cingular.  I talked with one of the customer service people at Amazon and they assured me that if I purchased the phones I could use the phone numbers I already had, WELL this is not the case.  They prepurchase numbers from cingular and will not let you carry your new number with you, this is ridiculious, if the customer service people cannot tell you the truth, then why buy any products from them.
Hi guys,  Nokia 6682 the best smartphone i have ever seen till now that too its nice to know that cingular the leading wireless provider is providing this piece. The voice clarity is awesome and the size i was said that is too big but nothin like that its reasonable size. Some find it large because its not a flip phone and due to this i feel it more comfortable. So i would recommend this piece as the best one to go if goin for cingular and now they r offering it for free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont forget to upgrade the memory card to 1Gb to enjoy the features to the max!
E-mail (more than one address), video, good sized screen, MP3 Player, compact, calendar easy to sync. Show me one better, and not the Blackberry or Treo...they're not.
I've had the Nokia 6680 for about a year now, and it's fantastic! I do feel sorry for the people in the States because when this phone was launched in the UK, it came with an extra integrated camera, just above the Nokia sign, to allow video calling. It's the best feature ever invented, and the 6680s picture quality is flawless,as are all its other features.The only con of the handset is that battery life reduces dramatically after bout 6 months, though this is probably true for all handsets in constant use. My advice....come to the UK and buy the handset here..sim/free.
Very Nice. Fully Customizable ..... I lOve It. Only con is..it's slowwww[...]
I wish I could give no stars for this phone.  I have had two Nokia 6682s in my possession since October and both of them had serious, but different, flaws.  Since I bought the phone from Cingular, I tried to get the issues resolved there, but Cingular refused to replace the 6682 with a similar device, despite the fact that I pay a premium every month for this very service.  Next I tried Nokia, who directed me to send my phone to the wrong service facility.  Long story short, Nokia has had my phone for 24 days and does not expect to return it to me for another two weeks.  Don't be tempted - it looks cool and it would be cool if cool if it actually worked, but it doesn't.  You'll be stuck paying Cingular for a service you can't use!
this phone is very complicated phone to fidure out if you are not up to date with a"data" cell phone BUT if you are a big business person and have alot of files to manage and data it is great> ALSO BE SURE THAT YOU LIKE IT GREATLY BECAUSE AMAZON WILL NOT LET YOU EXCHANGE!!!!!!!!!!!!
I purchased this phone for my (10 year old) kid and added $100.00 worth of minutes. During summer vacation, she kept it on a shelf and never used it. When school started up again, she turned it on and to our chagrin found out that it says it only has limited service. I called Firefly customer service and a very bubbly representative (until I questioned this practice, that is) told me that after 90 days, the minutes expire unless you keep on adding minutes. 30 days after that, the phone de-activates and requires a payment of $25.00 to re-activate. Sim card is sent by mail.I personally think that this is a shabby practice, especially since this information is buried in their web-site.Good Luck with this phone!
When we first purchased the Firefly some months ago it was great. The price was right and it was safe enough for my 11 year old. I had no qualms with the product or the service.  Then after a few months of not being used the display showed "limited service".  After calling Firefly I was informed that the minutes had expired and they had cancelled our service!!  I didn't know the minutes would expire or that I had to keep refilling the minutes. It didn't say that in any of the paperwork that came with the phone.  The representative told me that at the bottom of the registration card it says to go online for terms of services and that this information is listed there.  Why don't they put this information with the phone??  What about people who don't have internet service? I thought that was very sneaky.  Now, for me to get the phone reactivated it will cost me $25, I will have to purchase more minutes (none are included and the $50 worth I already paid for are expired) and a new phone number will be issued.  It will be cheaper to buy a whole new phone.  The product was okay, but the hard to find terms and conditions make me unwilling to buy into this product again.
I've always had a Verizon phone, but I've always had trouble with them. I'm a phone abuser, and when it comes to cheap phones, they never last long. Until recently I was using a very cheap Motorola, and it could not stand up to my abuses. I finally switched to this phone, and I must say, I'm very happy.I've never felt the need for a camera phone, interchangable faceplates, downloading ringtones, or even playing games on my phone. Voice-activated dialing and text-messaging have been things I like to use, and this LG is great for them.The huge colour display is a plus. I've never liked squinting at a tiny, monochrome LCD display -- like I said, cheap phones. The display is easy to read, and very bright; you can even use it as a flashlight. The buttons are easy to read and easy to press. I have no trouble dialing or answering calls.The features on this phone are also excellent, albeit limited. I use the calandar function all the time, and it's simple and easy to write down appointments and dates to remember. The alarm is clear and loud, louder than my alarm clock next to my bed. The speakerphone is also great. It's loud, crisp, and no one has trouble hearing me on the other end.While I've never been a fan of interchangeable faceplates, the LG doesn't disappoint me. I use the one in the picture because I'm too lazy to actually buy a new one, but the ones LG offers are great.Overall, this is an excellent phone: easy to use, sturdy, and stylish.
If you do not need a camera, video camera or some other new fancy feature but still want a nice phone, this is the one for you.  It has the nice features like voice activated dialing, the best speakerphone I have ever heard, ringtones etc.  It also has changable nameplates and I had no trouble finding a lot of nameplates and other items to customize my phone.
When you need a basic, cheap cell phone this is it.  It was free with 2 year contract.  It has most of the functionality that you expect from a basic phone: speakerphone, silent ringer.  Internal display can be seen in sunlight, speakerphone is excellent, ringer is loud.  The phone is sturdy.  It fell many times and still works.  The only problem which I think is serious is that the battery is horrible.  I bought 2 phones from verizon.  First phone needed to be recharged every 18 hours the other could live for 2 days if you do not use the phonr.  I brought the first phone to verizon but they said that 18 hour stand by time was good for the phone.  After some alot of whining on my part they switched my battery and they turned out to be right.  I experienced no change in battery life.  Now one year into my contract I had to get used phones from my friends because both of my phones could not be taken of the recharger.  Also it has poor signal reception (maybe because it does not have retractable antennae)  It does not have battery eating extras like camera, bluetooth, mp3 player.
If I had reviewed this phone within the first few months of getting it, I would have given it a very positive writeup. It's compact, ergonomically well-designed, and it performs well in terms of signal sensitivity and sound clarity. It was fun adding a few new ringtones (though there is not a whole lot of choice available for this model), and the removable, changeable face plates made customizing the phone possible.However, after about ten months the battery life began to deteriorate. If the phone is not used the fully charged battery will discharge in about a day (formerly it lasted several days).  Talking on the phone drains the battery so quickly that I cannot hold a conversation for more than about ten minutes without plugging in the phone (not terribly practical for a supposedly "mobile" phone).  I purchased an a new battery and the problem continued, so one can only conclude that the circuitry of the phone is at fault.I am not even close to my "free replacement phone" opportunity with my carrier (Verizon), so I either have to tough it out with a phone that can't hold a charge, or else I have shell out big bucks for a replacement phone.  This is not a happy situation.  I really think that the makers of these phones assume that you will destroy, lose, or tire of the phone quickly and move on to a new one, so they not made to last.  Personally, I'd like a phone that would hold up for a couple of years, and this isn't it.
Just like I wanted, a phone that serve my needs without all that fluff.  I don't particular care for a camera or video.  I just wanted a phone that will do the job of making and receiving calls.  I found this phone which was perfect.  I particularly like the speaker part because it enables me to type with two hands while on the phone, when surfing the net for info.  I chose this one because I don't see myself using the aforementioned features.  I have a digital camera for pictures and video.  The one thing I don't like is when setting appointments.  There are only defaulted amounts and not ones you want to create.  I've had this phone since December and satisfied.
It was a great little phone for the first nine months. I'll admit, it did have its share of dropped calls but as long as I had a decent signal all was well. In the past month and a half the phone has completely gone to peices. First the battery life went from lasting me about three days to lasting just a few hours, then the phone stopped accepting the charger (I usually have to hold it in, so the phone is useless when out and about), and now almost every call gets dropped at least once. I took it back to Verizon and they told me I was going to need a new phone, that's a $100 purchase without a plan for a cheap phone that's not going to last the five years I had my Nokia for.
I got this phone for christmas, and i liked it. the battery was great, teh calls sounded great, the reception was good, until i dropped it ONE time and it completely came apart. now my volume buttons don't work, and when it's charging it will turn off by itself randomly if you move it. the screen is really small, and there is not a very good choice of ring tones. all tehre is is the annoying ones that come with the phone, and you don't even have the option of downloading the good ringtones. you can only download the ones with the strange melodies that soudn like a song.sometimes my phone decides not to tell me when i have voicemails or missed calls.The battery life is pretty good, but about 3 months after i had my phone my battery started messing up, and i had to charge it all the time. i couldn't even make a 10 minute call without it dying, which kind of defeats the purpose of a mobile phone. i had to go in and get a new one, and after that it's been pretty good. just lastnight it lasted me 3 hours and 24 minutes without being charged.i also got bored with this phone very quickly. there isn't a very good selection of backgrouunds. the graphics aren't that good on this phone, and there is no games and no way to put games on it.overall, this phone would be great for a child's first phone, or if you'rej ust looking for a phone to make a call from point A to point B without all the extras, this phone is for you.as for me, i can't wait to get my new phone. i'm ready for a more entertaining, up to date phone.
This really was an awesome phone...for the first 9 months.After 9 months, though, the battery has gone from lasting 3 days to about 8 hours.If I can make it to my next free phone (2 more months), I'll get another one just like it.
For about the first 6 months this phone worked great, but eventually the battery life and signal strength deteriorated.  This phone says that it charges fully; then within a few minutes it has lost all battery life.  I have switched batteries several times, so I know it's the phone.  I have had so many dropped calls within these last six months: it's terrible.  I would honestly say "stay away from this phone or any LG phone."  It is a basic phone, but deteriorates to nothing within a few months.
I got this phone as part of an employee discount program my husband's company had, and I was able to choose from about a dozen phones. In the past I have worked where camera phones are not permitted at the place of employment, so I wanted to get "just a phone" without all of the extra goodies in case I worked again at a similar employer.I usually have good reception with this phone, and bought it because it was one of the few that had an external antenna. The size is nice (I don't even bother with a case, it's small enough to fit in my pocket) and the voice quality is quite good -- many times people do not know I am on a cell.This phone works well enough that I did not get landline service when we recently moved. I would certainly recommend this phone to anyone wanting a reliable phone without 3000 glitzy features.
Reception is bad and goes into analog mode, drains battery in 6 hours. Cannot configure phone to disable analog mode/roaming.
I bought this phone 3 months ago.  It drops about half of the calls that I am on.  It also does not ring for about 1/3 of my incoming calls.  My old analog phone years ago did better than this one.  I'm taking my old phone back to get it turned back on again.  This one gets the hammer treatment.
This was my first phone and because I really wanted one I just got a simple one until I could afford a camera phone. But this one is great!!!!!!!!!!! It has many good features like voice dialing and interchangable faceplates which is a great feature for a phone if you want to be able to change the faceplate to match your mood or outfit. I have dropped it many times and it has held up quite well, this phone is very durable, very stylish, and cool it is perfect as a first phone for kids, very good quality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i've had this phone for a year now. it was my first phone. the first 6 monthes was great. until the reception started to die down and would drop my calls half the time. then the battery life started to go as well. the battery used to last up to 4-5 days.Im not so shore about the looks either. it was too simple for me. I just want something that has better looks, and more options kike get it now ringtones. i strongly suggest the nokia 6236i. my friend has it and he's very satisfied with the looks, signal, and battery life.
This is a very basic, no frills phone that gets a good signal, trimode for someone who travels as much as my wife, and compact so it can fit into any purse she has.  The battery life is that of any other motorolla or samsung that I have owned or had friends own, and the best part is, is this was a give away phone.  I would recommend this phone, or it's newer younger brother the VX3400 to anyone who needs to have a second number in the household, or for a son or daughter who just needs a phone to keep in the glovebox for travel.
Ok I have had about five LG phones and no problems with any. I know  Motorola is the Big Dog and all the sheep flock to it but the LG VX8100 is perfect. First off you dont need a mp3 player since this phone has that covered. You can go into the secret menu and enable mp3 without going to verizon. Save your money and dont buy the vcast essintials cd unless you plan on buying music from them. They say you have to use Windows Media Player and thats fine but you can stay with iTunes player as long as you rip your cds into mp3 format. I have the one gig card and can hold about twenty cds at 192kb. I take the card and place it into my computers sd reader and right click and send songs to the sd that way and you dont need usb for that and also can move pics from the card or video to my computer by clicking on my computer and the icon for the sd card. They make a 2 gig but 1 is plenty for me. You can set it up so when you press and hold play on outside of phone it brings up the mp3 player. The earbuds arent the best but I can hear the music while mowing the yard. Also takes good pictures but you sometimes have to add to brightness. You have tip calculater and calander and all that stuff. I like the bluetooth since I can push one button on my ear piece and check messages and call people without opening the phone. Also you dont have to record peoples names since the phone goes by the directory. You push the button and the womans voice says "please say a comand" and you say call someone " please say a name " pizza hut "did you say pizza hut" yes "calling" and thats it. Mp3 player is grate and the 15 second videos are ok also but if you buy for camera only then buy a camera or video cam but if you want to take pictures, video, mp3 player and bluetooth then this is your phone. A bit heave and little thicker but have to make room for sd card I guess. Limited and sucky Wallpaper and Sounds and Ringers. Come on LG you can do better although the phone rocks so kudos and you are forgiven. Also Verizon Wireless is great. I was with them for seven years and whent to Suncom with two year contract and with 16 months to go ended the contract with penalty but hey if your mom or dad call and you can here them then that dont cut it. Back with Verizon to stay although they need to work on customer appreciation but hey when your the best I guess thats how it is although they tried to work with me to keep me but Sunom alot cheaper, guess thays why there cheaper and Im back with Verizon.Hope my review helped and maybe you will like it to.
I'm perhaps the only person in America to move BACK from a Blackberry to a regular phone, purely of my own volition.  I was sick of being tethered to my e-mail all of the time and decided to become a normal, picture-taking, phone-flipping, ringtone-changing American.So far, I've been impressed.  Pictures are easy to take and good for a cell phone.  Same with videos.  Messaging is easy, which can include pics and videos if I want.  I bought a $5 cable and now I can export songs, contacts, etc directly from my computer using a USB cable.One thing I liked about my Blackberry and didn't want to give up was that I could send little reminder e-mails to myself.  On this phone, in two clicks I can be recording a voice memo that's at least as effective.The phone plays MP3s, and while I think that's been disabled by Verizon somehow in anticipation of their own service being rolled out, I'm confident I'll be able to get some MP3s on there soon.What else?  Verizon reception in Chicago seems just OK to me on this phone, which is why I subtracted a star.  Battery life seems to be at least what they claim.  VCast at $15/mo is expensive and probably not worth it in the long run, but it's a neat toy and I'm enjoying it (8 minute Jon Stewart interviews!).  Wireless web is actually quicker and more practical than it was on my Blackberry.I did a lot of research before getting this phone, and I have no regrets about the purchase.  If I was forced to buy another non-qwerty phone today, I'd buy this one again without hesitation.
When I decided I wanted a new phone, I wanted to buy the best there was. Therefore, I spent A LOT of time searching and comparing, then re-searching and re-comparing. The debate was between this phone and the E815. My final conclusion was that, though both have had reported problems and benefits, the problems with the E815 worried me much more than the problems with the 8100. So I went with the 8100 and after 3 months, I see nothing to make me think I made the wrong choice. The phone is sturdy and the layout is logical. Whether it is the phone or verizon, my signal and voice quality is vastly improved from my old provider, and I've been told I sound like I'm on a land line. The phone is also very handy: I use the picture and camcorder all the time, with very good results.A word of caution: I have seen several people complain about things that are due only to their own stupidity or inability to look at the big picture. (For example, several people couldn't figure out how to work some aspect, where it was child's play to most people.) Several other complaints are complaints against Verizon in general and may apply to any phone you get with them. (I'm thinking bluetooth here.) Several others would complain about sound or signal strenth, when this is largely due to other factors like location and carrier. I have had no problems with sound quality. Just be careful when listening to complaints.Lastly, as with any technology lately, whatever you want this phone to do, it can most likely do, and there are plenty of people out there willing to help you do it. For example, there is plenty of advice out there on how to get MP3's on your phone faster/easier. All you have to do is search.
I would like to say that I have very much enjoyed owning this phone. I would also like to clear up a few things that are stated in other reviews. There is a software update that disables the mp3 player by default because of the Vcast music store. It if very easy to turn back on by hitting Menu, 0 , then six more 0's. Scroll down to the bottom and their is music setting, and you can turn mp3 support back on. I have software version 7 and it has increased the call volume so I can hear people much more easily in noisy settings. Everything works well on this phone, the camera is pretty decent for being on a cell phone. My phone usually goes for 4+ days between charges and still has at least 1 bar left. This phone can be connected to a computer through bluetooth to transfer files, and to use it at a modem for Dial Up Networking. If you are interested in either of these, do a search on google, and you will find helpful forums. YOu can also put movies on the MiniSD card and their is also a headphone adaptor that you can buy on amazon to be able to plug any stereo headphones into the phone for watching movies, listening to mp3's ect.
I bought this phone in November of 2005. I have loved every minute of owning it. A problem I had with my previous phone was that it had to be charged every day. This phone will stay charged for up to 4 days after being fully charged. One does not have to open one's phone to see what calls were missed, or to read text messages. The camera can be used while the phone is closed, which makes taking pictures of oneself easy. Downloading games and ringtones is very easy on this phone, though not cheap.My only warning is to make sure you don't throw your phone at something or drop it from a 3 story building. The screen may break. :(
Upon first look my LG seemed to be the perfect phone for my needs. It felt sturdy and, had alot of nice functions with it.However, the reception is horrible. I breakup or drop customer calls all the time driving while driving thru the city. Everyone knows how frustrating that is. And I know it's not Verizon because my previous phone worked great in those areas.Also, the camera resolution is awesome at 1.3 megapixels but, there is a one second delay from the time you press the "Take" button to the actual photo. This results often in blurred photos or you actually miss what you were taking a picture of.Thirdly, the programs you can buy with the phone to upload music or photos to your computer just does not seem to work. Often you have to reinstall the programs just to get the program to work one time!Overall, to me this was a phone with great potential with dissapointing results. I'm going in Monday to buy another phone.
Recently bought the VX8100 as part of my account upgrade with Verizon. The ph has some good features but LCD screen is very flimsy and pressure sensitive. I had put it back in my front pocket after a call as I normally do. When I took it out the next time, the screen had cracked. All along I had been just sitting and I never bumped against anything. Its just 20 days from the time I bought it and Verizon wants $50 to replace it. I had a motorola before this for 3 years and had dropped it many times but never had this problem.
This is a sleek little flip phone with many terrific features: excellent main and outside screens, nice ringtone capability, voice dialing, picture and ringtone caller ID.But if you were planning to sync your PC address book with this phone, forget it.  It won't do calendar sync at all, and the address book feature (after you buy the cable and software) only provides phone numbers.  So if you want to use your phone to look up an email or mailing address on the road, you can't.Also, look out: Verizon says you have fifteen days to test the phone and service, but they start counting the day you place the order, before the phone is even shipped.  If I knew who regulates the mobile industry I'd make a complaint.  From the day I actually received the phone I called Verizon after ten days and was told it was too late.
Everything works right and this phone is loaded. Bluetooth, wma playback, speakerphone, 1.3 megapixel camera. The camera is great and has a "flash," which is more or less a flashlight. The zoom feature on the photo mode only works on lower resolution (it is digital not an actual zoom, it just essentially crops your photo). Verizon actually lets you save pictures to the memory card, so they are easy to remove. The built in memory is higher than on most phones, but it fills quick (32 mb unformated). The built in memory can hold about four pictures and 11 songs at 64 kbps wma. Mac users (like me) beware, music syncing will not work nor will address book syncing (bluetooth sees it but wont connect). I have access to a pc so I can sync if needed. The phone is well built and sturdy, and is an awesome upgrade from a motorola v265. Also, keep in mind the phone uses a 2.5" jack and not the standard 3.5" jack, so your normal headphones will not work without an adaptor. The front button do work for playback, so ignore older reviews (older verzion software made the front buttons just for show, they had no use). To elbaborate on music playback (since this is the major draw of this phone)... music storage can be extended with a memory card (I went to newegg.com, got a 512 shipped for about 22), you must use Windows Media Player 10 and can only use wma (xp only, you can get mp3 playback by reverting to older phone software, but you must demand it) you can startup music playback without opening the phone, just hold down the middle play button. The music organization is poor compared to an iPod or other DAP, if you do not open the phone, it just plays it in order, everytime. If you open the phone while the music is playing, there is about a one or two second period in which the music will stop and restart. The music interface on the large display is not common... it does not use the usual hierarchical interface making it difficult and cumbersome. I have not used VCast music, at 15 a month plus I believe 1.99 a song, you spend more money on one song as you would on buying a conventional CD, so I cannot comment on download speeds or playback. Verzion's headphones are good enough and feature a mic so you can use them as a "hands free set"... I ended up buying their music pack which comes with the drivers, usb cable and headphones. Beware, Verzion says using a third party usb cable will void the warranty (Verzion in my experience has poor customer service and rips you off at any chance (20 dollars to bring put a number on a new phone)). Syncing with the Verizon cable is fast (usb 2.0). Do not make my mistake... I thought it would sync by making a sync list in wmp and then connecting it, Wrong. You must go to menu> get it now> get tunes and tones> sync music. Verzion and microsoft should take a page from apple... if you plug your phone in your computer your probably want to sync, you shouldn't have to go through three or four submenus. I have not used address book syncing through outlook, but trying to do it on my mac, there are just as many submenus. Video capture is limited to 15 seconds on this phone. The internal screen is fairly large compared to most phones, and very bright. I can actually see it on bright Arizona days, compared to by old moto, which would be  a blur. All in all, if you are looking for a solid phone that is featured pack pick this up. The camera is good for the quick shot, music playback is good for when you have some time to blow, but it is not an iPod replacement, if you have white earbuds on constantly, keep them, for now. Only gripe is Mac support is horrible, as is Verizon's fees and random charges.
I just got this phone for my wife, and we are both very impressed with it.  Unless you *really* need a full keyboard, this phone should take care of your needs.  Here's a breakdown by function:Call Quality - my wife was coming from a Samsung SCH-A630, and the difference is substantial.  The calls are very clear on both ends, and it has a good speakerphone too.Text Messaging - this phone has T9 for predictive text entry.  For the occasional text message user, this is more than sufficient.  If you are a pay as you go rather than having a text bundle, this phone will meet your needs.  It is nice to be able to set a callback number and have it sent automatically with your messages.Bluetooth - here's another strong feature on this phone.  While it doesn't support the full bluetooth profiles, no phone from Verizon does.  That's a trade off that you make for using "The Network", and in my opinion, it's worth it.  We paired the phone with our PC at home and made a backup of her phonebook using DataPilot - this will save you $10 the next time you change phones.  We also paired it with a Motorola HS850(see my review) which has worked consistently with all of the bluetooth phones I've used.  It supports voice commands and automatic call transfer - if you set the "auto answer" option in Tools -> Call Settings.Mobile Web 2.0 - this works pretty well.  The T9 function works in the Openwave browser so unless you are entering proper names, this is sufficient.  The EV-DO speed is great.  The resolution is not as good as on the 9800, but the 256k color screen still does a nice job.V-Cast - the videos look great, and the stereo speakers make for a nice experience. They could stand to add some more content, but it's not bad for $15/mo. The bonus that you get with V-Cast is that you don't get charged for minute usage on Mobile Web - a big bonus indeed!Music - this has changed recently with the V-Cast Music.  You can no longer use MP3 files like you could on older models.  We don't use our phones as music players so this doesn't really matter to us.Ringtones - typical weak selection from the LG line of phones.  However, if you find something you can stand, is it really that big of a deal?Unless you need to full keyboard that the 9800 has, this phone is probably the best that Verizon has to offer right now.
Fabulous phone.  I've had it for nearly three months now, and it's awesome.  It's a combination camera, camcorder, web browser, and MP3 player, and it even makes and receives phone calls, too!  The operating system is very intuitive and user-friendly.  I never dreamed I would have had this much fun with the phone at the time I bought it.  Highly recommended.
First off my order was delayed over three weeks after I ordered it, it was said to be in stock. Then they charged my bank account a total of 7 times for the same item, which then incured overdraft charges, 7 x $457.61. When I contacted them after the first three charges they said it was fixed. Then I was charged once a day for the next four days with no response to my emails. They say they will reimburse me for any overdraft fee's that incurred from the multiple charges but now I have to go through the whole process of sending bank statements and who knows what else in order to be reimbursed. I finally got my phones which I am very happy with. The picture quality is great, big phone memory(512mb), speakers put out good sound(suprisingly loud), I get good reception, the phone displays are awesome, its just loaded with features. Paired with the 1gb mini sd card you can store tons of mp3's, video's, pictures pretty much anythng you want. I love this phone, I would highly recommend it. Now I am trying to redeem my rebate for the phone and it is coming up invalid. I have now sent four email's to amazon trying to figure out what the problem is and still no response. I oredered this on Nov 27th, its now Jan 10th. There is no reason this should be a headache at all let alone for this long. Phone is great but I cant stress anough how bad amazon's so called service is. Very unhappy with them and will gladly pay more for an item rather then have to go through this again.
I've had this phone for about two months and absolutely love it! The camera takes WONDERFULLY clear pics and I also like the ability to take video clips. The mp3 is amazing. The phone is a bit larger than I would like but then again, I'm coming from a LG 3200. But it still fits into the little 5th pocket of my jeans which is where I would put my 3200. The screens are very bright and large. The speaker phone is nice and loud but there seems to be a bit of an echo and you have the keep the phone opened when using it:( The other ONLY thing I don't like about the phone is the 3-4 second delay when taking a picture. Other than that, it's a wonderful phone! I would recommend it to anybody.
I have had this phone since December and so far it has been pretty good to me. The service isn't as bad as other reviews have said. There have been some questions about the MP3 player being disabled.  Go to the menu, push 0, then push it five more times to get to a "secret" menu. I dont know why verizon made this, but go to music setting, and choose MP3 enable. This sill turn it on. This phone has good service, speaker phone, voice regocnition, text and pix messaging, and most of all V Cast. V Cast is a Verizon service that lets you buy, and watch music videos and other things of the like. With me being only 13, i found this phone relatively easy to use. I did blow the speakers, but that has been the only problem so far... ITS A GREAT PHONE!
I have both the LG 8100 and the Samsung A950, and although they are very similar the LG8100 is a better package.Both have excellent voice quality (although my 1st A950 had terrible reception, the replacement Amazon sent out is great.)The camera on the A950 is better in both camera and camcorder mode.  The camera on the LG8100 is okay - I have made 4x6 prints from it, but the A950 camera is actually quite good.The messaging on the LG8100 is better.  You can read messages on the external screen and it is easier to type in messages.The Music player on the LG8100 is much, much better.  The LG8100 has an equlaizer that really does improve sound quality.  Also the software on the Samsung makes it very difficult to select what song to play next.  The music player on the LG8100 is simple, but works very well.There is a lot that could be improved about the LG8100 (Bluetooth functionality for instance and the camera) but on the whole I am really pleased with it.
I just took this phone back to Verizon and got my old VX6000 back. While the camera might be nice, I'll stick to my Sony Digital for photos.The voice command is terrible.  I felt like I was talking to Dell Support in India.My calls dropped, there was voice feedback on both ends and I couldn't get back to the store fast enough.  If you buy this phone just remember you have only 15 days to return it.
I have had a model of this phone for about one month.  Verizon has replaced my handset because of dropped calls.  However in the replacement model still find that that volume is lacking.  The voice is still choppy.  The stubb antenna is something evil.  Either develop a full antenna or an internal antenna.  A stubb is just in the way.  The features are all gutted by Verizon (And I was told that they have great service).  The ringers suck.  I guess Verizon wants you to buy from them.  I paln to downgrade to a more another phone without all of the features that hopefully gets better reception.
Yeah, it was a good phone for a year, great reception, battery life even when I was usnig bluetooth, hence 2 stars. Well, now it drops calls even in places where my wife's old samsung, also from Verizon, picks call without any problem. Battery life is dismal now. Bottom line, I am not sure about Verizon, but it si first and last LG phone I have to deal with.
I purchased this phone last week and haven't had any problems.  I also took the phone on a trip to Chicago which is the windy  city and had no problems receiving or making calls.  I could also hear pretty good on this phone.  My only problem with this particular phone is that the outside screen completely goes out after a few minutes.  I would sure love to see the time when I look at the phone but I guess it only takes a second to hit a button to see the time.  I do like the fact that I can put a picture on the outside display.  I have never had this feature with my other phone which was a motorola.  So far I am enjoying this phone.  Although, it took me awhile to understand how to actually get the ringtones that I desired on my phone.  I had to spend some extra dollars playing with some of the crazy applications that Verizon makes you choose from but it's okay.  I have learned my lesson playing with ringtones.
I got the RAZR on a whim. I hated it. Crap speaker. Terrible battery 14-16 hour life!!). No traditional plug for headset, and Bluetooth is weak at best. Just plain bad. On the 13th day I returned it for a LG 8100 . AMAZING. Great battery life. (I mean great). Much better speaker. Feels better in the hand. I love it. It's not my first LG, but the best I have had to date. And I can use all my old wired headsets. The only thing is the car charger is different from my old LG. No big deal in the big picture. Highly reccommended. The RAZR has a following that numbs the mind. People who care more about looks than function.
I got this phone and ditch my old crappy phone. VX8100 has good quality speaker and loud enough... it tweets quite well. It plays WMA and Mp3 files (MP3 only when you manually enabled it thru special keystrokes). Bought a 2GB miniSD for less than $65 and stores hundreds of songs and movie clips (3gp only - u need a software that converts AVI and MPEG files to 3gp format). Get some accessories from Ebay and then u can create yur own ring tones.Reception and sound quality is good. Bluetooth headset working well with the phone. This phone can replace any Mp3 player. It has a limited ability as a voice recorder... time constraint. All filenames must have 32 characters or less; the phone won't be able to read the file if it is more than 32 characters.The only complains that I have are the life of the battery is not great especially when I use the phone to play clips or music. Also, there are only a max of 10 playlists for the songs; not enough when i have over 500 songs. Quality of camera 1.3meg - only satisfying - cant zoom... sometimes blurry. Camcorder is good but unfortunately it only records for 15 seconds max.
At first, I was pretty upset with my choice. I made a call and I could hardly hear anything it was echoing so bad. But then I realized that it was because my representive at the Verizon store didn't program my phone. So make sure your phone has had it's initial programming. *228My favorite feature of this phone is the snooze button! I was so excited to see that I could give myself 5 extra minutes to get up. Here are the other good aspects:--quality of the true tones ringtones--loudness of phone (the ringer is loud, the vibration is strong enough and I have no trouble hearing people on the other side)--good reception--voice recognition (there is no training required for the basic menu, I haven't tried the other ones yet)--large viewing screen--camera quality is actually pretty good (much better than my Samsung)--battery life is great!!The biggest thing I dislike about this phone is how long it takes to take a picture. You hit the button. Wait (and continue to hold it still for a 2 or 3 more seconds) and then it takes the picture. This is almost worth it because the picture quality is good.--The other thing I don't like is the size. I'm used to much smaller phones, but I am getting used to it.--I also hate that the outside screen turns completely off. It comes back on with the push of a button but still...I rather charge my phone more to get it to stay on and there isn't an option for that.--There also isn't a voice recorder option (like there is on my Samsung), but I also don't need it. I have a mini-digital-recorder.The Bluetooth on this phone works great. But Verizon does disable a few features. It is irritating, but I can live without them, and it's not the phone's fault.This phone is really easy to use, almost too easy to use.I gave this phone a five because it gets good reception, makes and receives calls and text messages (although I still haven't figured out the EMS feature), and I can hear people and they can hear me. All the other features are nice to have, but it needs to be a useful phone first and it is.
First off, I must agree with all the people who complained about the volume on the phone! The earpiece volume is NOT AT ALL loud enough, so it's frustrating when you're in your car or in a restaurant and cannot hear the person on the other end.Second, this phone looks like a "wannabe" stereo or something. It's heavy at the hinges and the speakers make the phone look soo unprofessional.Third, God help you if you get stranded in the middle of nowhere because the reception on this phone is horrible, even in metropolitan areas!! I live in Tampa, FL in a pretty busy area and the most signal strength I ever get is 0-2 bars.Last but not least, it's a shame how much the salespeople at Verizon push this phone so much...it's really not worth the headache just because it has an MP3 player, camera, and so on. Perhaps they should try coming out with an actual phone rather than a toy. Buyer beware!!
Can someone start a company called "we won't screw you", because these guys did.  Volume, reception and battery life are garbage rated at best.  I am really surprised.  This will be the first time I have left a cell phone company.  I am saying goodbye to Verizon for not taking this back, telling me  how great the phone was and not giving me a discount on a replacement phone...only new customers.  Well I am a new customer, just no longer theirs.  By verizon.
There are only two draw backs that I have found.1.  The minimum volume on the MP3 playback is too loud.2.  I cannot play all of my MP3's that I have recorded on my  1gb mini-sd card.  The scrolling says that they are in the correct format, but they won't play.Overall, I think this phone is a good value and I am having a good time with it.  It is user friendly and I haven't had to get out the instruction book.
I just got this phone yesterday, and I'm loving it so much. I'm less than impressed with Verizon's new standard-for-all-phones menu, but the advantage to that is that it is, in fact, mind numbingly easy to use.The camera takes better pictures than some real digital cameras I've seen, even at a low resolution (I'm only using it for picture caller IDs on a few people, and posting up-to-the-minute pictures of my cats on my blog, so I don't need the full 1.3 megapixels it comes with), and its easy and FAST to send pictures or video to friends.Honestly, I've barely looked at the manual for anything, and in 24 hours, I already know how to use this phone.The one thing I'm really not impressed with is the (lack of) mp3 player, and the associated issues with ringtones. The main reason I had wanted this phone was so I could use the memory card to put my own ringtones on the phone, since I have slightly obscure musical tastes that are generally not covered within Verizon's Get-It-Now service (which has, however, been expanded nicely since my last phone). Everyone I asked at any Verizon kiosk insisted that I would be able to do this easily.When I read the manual, I found out that the only way I can do this is by using .wma files that were processed through Windows Media Player 10. Luckily, I'm not a Mac user (nobody from Verizon ever mentioned or asked about this), because then I would be screwed. However, while I am a Windows user, I've been avoiding upgrading to Media Player 10 because it has downright invasive DRM moniotring/managing abilities (Google for "Digital Rights Management" if you don't know what I'm talking about.) As soon as I can afford my miniSD card to put the files on, I plan on testing this out. Hopefully, there's some way around it. If not, I suppose I'll have to go without my GWAR ringtone.
Well a lot of the reviews are long so i'll make mine short and sweet. This phone is great if you already know how to take care of a phone if this is your first phone not so much. The picture and video quality is GREAT!!!! But the ringtones aren't very cool if that is what your looking for. The music cost a lot you can get it cheaper from itunes!
Great little phone! My major complaint --- it's hard to hear the person on the other side no matter how high I turn up the volume.  I love the voice activated dialing feature - great when in the car. No need to train it to your voice, either. But the computer voice within the phone (volume) is also very low and no way to make it any louder so its often hard to hear especially in the car. Forget it if you're calling from a loud place.I have no use for the picture taking abilities or video clips or to download ring tones so those features are wasted on me, but it's nice to have the ability should I ever wish.  Overall a great phone so far I just wish LG made the volume features all around louder. I have no idea how someone with hearing problems would cope.
I have the LG VX8100 and I can't find anything wrong with it.  I love this phone.  I have had it for 8 months.  I am still happy with it.  I am glad I got it.  As for the people complaining about the reception.  The only thing I wish it would do is hold more ring tones and use your sounds for ringtones.  I would never trade it in for a Motorola.  I had one and it didn't work, I had to send my Moto 3 times for the year I had it and still had trouble with it.
I've had this thing since about when it came out and its proven to be a very poorly designed phone. I got it to replace a basic Nokia non-camera, non-flip phone whose keypad went bad after about three years, and all I wanted was a new basic Nokia phone but the family decided to switch to Verizon at this time and I ended up with this monstrosity. Immediately I noticed that the reception was worse and it dropped phone calls about ten times more often as my old Nokia, but I guess thats the risk you run switching service providers; I apparently live, work, go to school, shop for groceries, hang out, etc. next to Cingular antennas. Besides the poor reception, its just a poorly designed phone altogether. For instance, my old Nokia had an elegant, well implemented, and most importantly, quiet vibrate function, but on the LG the buzzer is louder than the actual ringer in many instances; its not the least bit discreet if an entire lecture hall can hear my phone vibrating away in my pocket so its useless to me. The keypad is illuminated with a very deep blue, which while very attractive, is the hardest color for the human eye to resolve so its actually fairly difficult to see in the dark. The phone is laden with all kinds of useless gimmicks which seem to distract most people from its shortcomings. I remark to my family that the reception is poor and they respond, dont you love the camera? Well no since I have a 4 megapixel digital camera that I use to take pictures. Its awkward to answer calls/adjust the volume/continually have to flip/unflip/reflip, etc....Isn't the MP3 player great? No, thats why I have an ipod. Its a terrible phone....Have you gone on the internet with it yet? (no, I spend enough of my day on the internet). Seems like most of the phones from the Verizon stable are similarly bad phones and its unfortunate that so many people keep buying them and thereby ensuring Verizon keeps selling them.
Don't bother ordering this phone for VCast or Broadband internet unless you live in a really big city. Go onto the support section of Verizonwireless.com and you can click the BROADBAND coverage map. It isn't much! Look for the blueish-gray areas NOT the yellow areas!
You can read reviews regarding the other aspects of this phone all over the place. It's not a bad phone in general.However, if you are using this in the hopes of being able to say "Call John Cell" and your phone actually does that, then do not expect anything close to a pleasant experience.And this may not be the phones fault; however, the phone only works on Verizon Wireless (as I understand it (could be wrong))and it would then be Verizon's totally HORRIBLE voice command/dialing that is soooo bad.Here's how it works if (and that's a BIG "IF") it works properly:1st, press a button to bring up your voice command prompts.The phone says "Please say a command".You say "Call Someone".The phone says "Please say a name".You say "John".The phone says "Did you say John?"You say "Yes".The phone says "Call home?"You say "No".The phone says "Call work?"You say "No".The phone says "Call mobile?"You say "Yes".The phone says "Calling."This takes about 30 seconds if you are VERY lucky.---Here's how it always goes for me:1st, press a button to bring up your voice command prompts.The phone says "Please say a command".You say "Call Someone"The phone says "Please say a name"You say "John"The phone says "Did you say (enter some incomprehensible computer-voice mush that Verizon thinks the name you said sounds like, something like "mlmmaam?")At this point you usually try and decipher the name that has just been repeated to you and then the phone goes "Bloooop" and waits a few seconds and asks you again if you want to speak to "mlmmmmam"?If you say no it will continue to cycle through various  indecipherable names that it thinks you might have said. Often this list doesn't even include the actual person you were trying to call in the first place. If you finally do get to the right name, and can understand the computer-mushmouth, here is how it goes:You say "Yes"The phone says nothing for 10 seconds and then goes "Blooooooooooooooooop" really loud in your ear, then waits a little longer and repeats "Did you say 'mlllmmm?"This can be repeated indefinitely while you try several variations of the word "Yes". I find a long southern drawl occasionally gets a positive response.The phone says "Call home?"You say "No" (it doesn't have a problem with no at least)The phone says "Call work?"You say "No"The phone says "Call mobile?"You say "Yes"The phone waits ten seconds and goes "Bloooooooooooooooooooooooop" and then "Please say a command".ARGGGH
For some reason not all mp3's will play. I transfer mp3's from either my Mac or PC on to a 512MB miniSD car via an adapter. Install miniSD into phone, turn on MP3 player and all songs show up in player and seem to be fine, but some songs will not play. All the mp3's were ripped from CD's and not protected. Also the minimum volume level is too loud. I'm using Jabra earphones and the sound quality is as good as any earphones.Bluetooth is limited to only pair with earphones - who thought that was a good idea?Other than that the Pix and Flix and sound and texting and even the basic phone service work better than expected; even my wife who is technically retarded has figured out how to use most of the features.
I think I'm fair with most phones but after a terrible LG for my wife why did I ever get this phone?Well I went in for VErizon's early upgrade hoping to make some profit.  See I had just received a Motorola e815 (a couple months before) as a replacement for a Motorola v710 and so the e815 was practically free and new.  I sold it and got this LG making a nice profit, but little did I know, I was practically selling my soul... the phone's mp3 player was pretty nice but other than that... what a waste.  I got echo in the receiver several times, low-low-low (very poor) reception even in generally good areas.  Furthermore the phones battery life really isn't to great.Listen if you have to have an LG or a phone that carries MP3 buttons on the exterior casing... go ahead and waste your money or do what I did... take the stinking LG throw it on a certain bidding site for $199.99 and buy a MOTOROLA e815 which by far has the best reception on Verizon's network in my opinion, even better than the razr.  When it come sto clarity and reception my three last Motorolas have all been better than this (v265, v710 and 3815) and that is why I am now in my office with my trusty e815 back in its case.
on this phone u cant even use ur recordings as ur ringtone. if u use mobile 17 to create ringtones it saves in my sounds and u cant use that as ur ringtone plus u need to buy a memory card in order to put mp3a on. to connect it to the pc u need to buy a costly bluetooth adapter of a dat transfer. it takes forever to us camera and video is only 15 secs. also lg is the hardest phone to hack so u cant extend the video time. 4 bluetooth the voice dialing is gat but sometimes annoying. also the ringtone does not play through the headset. vcAST is $15 a month and web mobile is costly. it comes with no games so u have to dwnld them ur self and pay money. i reccomend this phone if u r willing to put a lot of time and money or u just want to show off.
I have purchased this for family members and often recommended it, but sometime in February, VZW busted the .mp3 player so that it no longer works on new phones.I don't know with what software / feature relase this took place, but using the phone as a simple .mp3 player was a great plus for this phone, and the reason I bought it and recommended it to others.At some point, I suppose VZW will turn off the phone service features as well...
This phone is just AMAZING! I have enjoyed having it and all its features.
I don't have this phone; I don't yet have Verizon, but the last Amazon sponsored Verizon Phone offer I tried, it took over a month of continuous shipment delays, and after pushing for a firmer answer, I was told that it would NEVER be shipped - yet Amazon had accepted the offer over a month ago, and continued to update shipment dates pushing them further and further out. There was no money exchanged and no loss of funds, except very frustrating to be lead along for a month - and then only by escalating my calls was I told that it would never be shipped.  Yet, Verizon could ship it to me that day.
Sony Ericsson put out all the stops for this one.  If you're looking for a sleek-looking candy bar-style GSM phone that's tri-band and has a built-in 2.0 Megapixel digital camera, mp3 player, video clip recorder, sound recorder, web browser, FM radio, handheld videogame console with 3D capabilities, fully enabled bluetooth and infrared port, AND a handy light, then this is the phone for you!The phone looks great if it matters to you.  Once again Sony Ericsson made a dual-faced machine, one side a phone and on the other a digital camera (with a sliding lens cover).  The display is brilliant with few problems under sunlight.  Images are crisp onscreen and animated wallpapers run smoothly.Speaking of graphics, to say that this phone has animated menus is an understatement.  Everything can be in motion here, even the highlight bar.  Best of all, it all runs seamlessly.Pictures taken with the camera are at par with lower-scale 2.0 Megapixel digital cameras.  If taken in the dark, pictures still have a decent quality.  Yes, there's a night-mode.  There's even a light to help.  There's even a digital zoom.Mp3 and wav files sound great with the included headphones/handsfree unit.  But you can play music using the built-in speaker which isn't much but it gets the job done.  The phone can play mp4 and g3p video formats from both the Memory Stick and internal memory (same with audio files).  The phone also supports the classic .mid format.There are a few gripes.  First of all, there is no search feature in the contacts area.  You can only search as far as the first letter of the name you're looking for then it's down to scrolling to the proper contact.  Second is the awkward "2" key which makes dialing and typing messages a bit difficult.  Furthermore, the plastic door that covers the Memory Stick port is a bit difficult to open.However, all in all this is a truly solid non-smartphone package.
It's that time of the year when I get a new cell phone, just because I'm a year older, or Christmas is coming, or both, or whatever. Having had good experiences with Sony Ericsson, I kinda hinted strongly in that direction, and must say that I'm pleasantly surprised by this model.My last phone was a Sony Ericsson Z520a, which I was quite happy with, and I had to mentally take myself out of the flip phone groove and into the candybar style of the K750i. This phone is superior to the Z520a as far as sound, camera and features go, but I still think the flip phone is cooler looking.  I almost got the W300i, which is an upgrade to the Z520a, but fortunately I got a chance to see one in real life, and realized that pictures on-line aren't always all they appear to be.(Note: The W300i feels cheap and plasticky, and that orange button on the side is unsightly to say the least.  The keys are these overlapping circles that are also less than aesthetically pleasing)Anyway, the pros and cons of the K750i as observed so far are:Pros1. Big displays, nice weight, sleek appearance2. Dual front design with phone on one side and camera at the "other" front, so it's easy to choose which side is up when you need to take a picture.  It has a reflecting disc for self portraits.3. The digital camera is a 2 mega pixel gizmo that looks like the real thing, with a sliding window to protect the lens and everything. It can auto focus and zoom and can take pictures in a variety of settings, including night and panorama, and do lots of other things like macros and videos that I need to read up before attempting.4. The central joystick button needs just your thumb to operate it, and makes it easy to scroll through the multiple screens once you get the hang of it.5. It's a radio and MP3 media player with amazing clarity of sound, and comes with its own earphones. It's got equalizers and stuff too, and sounds great through the earphones.6. It comes with the cables to upload or download files from the computer, as well as Bluetooth technology which I've actually used once successfully.7. Battery life seems fine so far8. Internet services included where available9. Games included10. It even has a light function, plus all the usual stuff likes alarms and ringtones, silent modes and speed dialing, voice commands and all the other things that I haven't yet memorized from the manual.Cons:1. When you put on the keylock function, it locks itself after a few seconds, so you need to be really quick with your fingers to beat the clock. I can't seem to find any feature to lengthen this time.2. The "2" button can be difficult to press if your fingers are not slim and tapered.3. The power button is hard to press for larger fingers4. The joystick need some getting used to, and at first I kept pushing the button instead of moving it left and right and up and down5. Searching for contacts isn't easy, requiring a lot of scrolling with the joystick6. The pictures look grainy when enlarged, but this may be due to my not using the right resolution or setting rather than a design flaw. (I'll research this more later)7. I'm terrified of dropping it or getting it drizzled on8. With the key lock feature on, the numbers don't light up unless the phone is unlocked, and I have been having problems trying to locate the unlock buttons in the dark.Summary: A really nice phone, appearance and feature wise, even if you only use it to send and receive calls.  Rated: 4.5 starsAmanda Richards, November 24, 2006
This phone is triband only, GSM 900 GSM 1900 GSM 1800, therefore in the US you're left only with the 1900 band. This is a big problem specially inside buildings where the 850 band works best.I bought this phone to use with my Cingular service and it's been disastrous because for Cingular 1900 is the "back up" frequency.  Most of the time my phone won't work.  Specially inside my house.  I can't dial out or get calls.  Sometimes callers can't even get to my voicemail.  I believe on T-mobile the service would be better since they have better 1900 coverage but I don't know that for a fact.Other than that I do echo most of the possitive reviews about the great features etc.  It's not quiet an iPod because the interface is not as good (can't FF or RW songs for example, you have to ceate playlists in order to hear more than one song at a time).  Also it's not as loud as an iPod which is a problem on an airplane.The camera is great and you can get a flash for it but the light that comes standard is actually good enough for close up pictures in dark places.
Well, best phone I'VE ever had (and I had a lot, starting with the original Star-Tacs). As mentioned by other reviewers, this phone has it all and it all works well. Call Volume (after the update), Reception, Radio, MP3 player and camera are all top-notch for such a small package. The only quibble I have is taking pictures in low light, as I do at concerts. Those don't come out so well, but daytime pix are terrific - as good as my Nikon Cool-Pix, as long as I don't blow them up too much.If you're looking for the best phone currently available, this is it.
The new black K750i by Sony Ericsson has it all! It looks stylish, sexy and sophisticated and has a fantastic specification that anyone wanting to update there phone would want and love!It has a brilliant 2.0 mega pixel, auto focus camera that gives you really clear and crisp photos (and comes with a handy light for taking pictures in a dark place!), a video recorder to capture all those classic funny moments with friends, a MP3 player - which is great if you cant quite afford to splash out more money on a trendy ipod. - FM radio, sound recorder, games, WAP browser, both bluetooth and infra-red and the routine Colour Screen and Polyphonic Ring tones.The phone is also great for memory between 38MB - 64MB and this can be expanded even more, great if your particularly snap happy and need more space to store photos!I loved that the phone comes with a USB cable, which means you can connect your phone to your computer within seconds and put your pictures on the computer and transfer music to your phone - this way you can have your favourite song as your ring tone without having to pay 3pounds on the internet/TV!The phone is really simple to use and fun to customise with wallpapers, screen savers, ring tones and themes. Additionally it has other useful features such as calculator, stopwatch, timer and calendar which are all handy to have.Only bad point I have managed to find is the 2 button doesn't always respond straight away, taking a couple of pushes to get it to work! But this is only tiny problem.I have only had this phone about a month now, But I love it and wouldn't thinking about changing it for a long time! plus I don't have to take my digital camera out with me everywhere now, as my phone makes great replacement!
It's been 1 year since I bought this cell phone. And yes, it has it all, great camera, mp3 player, games console, 3d capabilities, it is triband, etc etc etc. However, no one has mentioned it has an internal memory of 32mb. Copying from the camera memory to the memomry card only takes a few seconds. It also has music, photo and video editing software inside the phone. You can also send the photos, videos and voice recordings you take via SMS if you have that service available with your carrier. The joystick is also great for playing games while you are on the bus, subway waiting and doing nothing else. The camera is not that great in dark places even with night mode and the little light on, but you can buy a flash add-on.My only complain with the phone is that after one year of use, the joystick is a bit unresponsive, and dust has collected below the screen. It's probably a maintainance thing, but still, I wish I didn't have to bring it to SE for them to fix it.All in all, a really nice phone, I won't be changing it for at least another year.
Of the phone itself, I really love the features available, which include the mp3 player, with expansion card slot, and of course, the wonderful camera.  In a country filled with phones that have mediocre VGA cameras, this phone has definately been a standout.Unfortunately, the joystick has degenerated into sheer torture to use, and I feel like I'm trying to row a canoe with my pinkie every time I attempt to make the joystick respond.  There is also a bit of a lag time, when attempting to scroll through various photos in the photo album--an issue that has clearly been addressed in the W810i which is nice.And finally, DO NOT get this phone if you're on Cingular in NYC.  Even in the city, with supposedly good 1900 Mhz there are ridiculous areas where one does not have reception, where one really should have it (ie in tall buildings close to a window, or  near a door in a building).  oddly enough, such reception dead zones magically come alive with a Tmobile sim card, since Tmo's network still runs primarily on the 1900 Mhz band.
This is certainly the best cell phone I've got. it's powerfull, faster than earlier SE phones, with its 2-megapixel camera you can take really nice photos and decent videos. it's also worth mentioning that it is classy, great battery life, well built and has tons of cool features. The screen has been upgraded to 256K colors, but this also means that wallpapers that looked great on the K700 show some imperfections in this one. videos and pics from the phone look awesome, though.my only gripes goes against the seller, TigerDirect: why if this phone is sold in America, it comes with a Hong Kong region configuration? I need english and spanish in my phones and none of the two ones I've bought (previously k700)from them has come with it. now I'll have to pay more to get the language I need. also I didn't get the product as advertised, since I got the blasted silver color version, but that's ok, because this one is rarer seen.I got a 1GB SD card and get fun taking pics, playing and shooting videos. I don't use it as an mp3 player since I've got a separate one. if you want a sleek, easy to use, feature packed and awesome phone, don't hesitate to get this one.
If you want a phone that does everything, this is it. Phone, music player, camera, organizer, everything is in there and Sony Ericsson has got the formula down so it all works great. The digital camera is excellent, I used it as my main camera for the 10 or so months I owned it. The screen is gorgeous, it feels great in your hand and looks good too.As of now I believe this is the most popular camera phone that's actually used as a camera. It's a good one, 2.0 megapixels is not incredible but honestly I almost never take anything more than causal snapshots. For serious photos I have a digital SLR I use. The photo LED light is good, but night shots are difficult. You can enable night mode but good luck eliminating blur. Still, if you can keep it stable and the subject is close enough the photos looks good. Regular flash can wash out a picture and give it a cold look but the LED light almost always made the photo look true. Also, this thing is bright-you can use it a flashlight and it's actually very effective. Just don't shine it in someone's eye. The autofocus is very good, you will only get frustrated with a complex scene or very close macro, but that's understandable with a low end camera. Most of the time it's dead on and you get a good sharp focus. One thing I will say, this is a low end camera in every sense. Don't bring this to the ballgame and expect great shots. Like I said it's great for causal shots because it's always with you, but 2 MP can get a bit grainy if you blow it up much, and in low light you may be disappointed at times.The phone itself is great. Like most Sony Ericssons it has a bit of a problem with the earpiece volume. You have to line it up just right with your ear and press a little. In a crowd it's quite hard to hear. Still the voice quality is good, and reception is good as well. The menu layout is simple and intuitive-there's a lot to customize and many menu items even have an Info option to tell you about it. It has most of the goodies that make a phone user-friendly: bluetooth, web browser, email, music and video player (with Memory Stick Pro duo support), PDA-like organizer, file browser, and Java. Java is especially nice because there are a ton of mobile Java apps out there that really beef up your phone (Opera mini is the best example-think of it as internet explorer for your phone but better). As a result this phone is very customizable. You can load it with tools, music, pictures, etc. and soon it's like your 2nd computer. The hardware is excellent, it's sturdy and solid and works even after a couple of drops. There is an issue I have with this phone, and it's the joystick. It's way more convenient than 4 buttons and more intuitive, but after moderate to heavy use it will start to lose functionality. This is a major pain, I almost took a star off but the phone excels so well in everything else; it really is a 5-star phone. Sony will repair this problem, but only if you have a valid receipt. I bought mine on ebay and so I was SOL.Keep in mind that this is not an American phone. It is European tri-band (900/1800/1900), so if you're on the Cingular network, which operates on the 850 band, the phone won't work. T-Mobile customers will be fine since they use the 1800 band. Be aware, though, that if you roam into a Cingular zone you will not get service.I will say one more thing, and that is that if you are considering buying this phone at this point in time, you will definitely want to consider the K790a. The K790a is the successor to the K750i, and it is better in just about every way. The hardware and software is all upgraded (3.2 MP camera now and real xenon flash!). Plus, it's a true American tri-band so you can roam the states with it. I bought one to replace my K750i and love it. The only reason not to buy it is because it is a tad bigger and heavier, and of course it is quite a bit more expensive right now. Still, it is definitely worth checking out.
Since i buyed the cellphone is working fine, and i very happy with the cool features that it have.
I heard that nokias have better reception than other phones, and as this is my first defection from the nokia family, I would have to agree.  I have the same provider as before but calls get dropped more often now, I have less bars in places I had full reception before, etc.Other than that, I give the phone 4 stars because the camera is actually useful, i like that i can store lots of mp3s on a removeable 2gb memory card, I can play the radio or mp3s through the speaker and it sounds decent, it has a good flashlight, etc.  But I sure would like if it had better reception.  And the black finish is scuffing off and becoming silver.
Before I got this phone I always had NOKIA phones and loved them!!! The main reason I got this phone was the camera since I didn't have a digital camera.I love this phone. The camera takes great pictures for a cell phone, alot of friends couldn't believe that those picturs have actually been taken by my cell phone.The phone has alot of other great features and I just love the display.The joystick - while I hated it in the beginning I quickly got used to it.
This is what I call a great cell phone!!! It has it all and It's really easy to use. The only difference between K750 and W800 is the memory they come with. I bough this item and a Sony 2 GB memory Stick and now It has more stoge then W800. The resolution of these cell phones is the same. They both have a 2 megapixels auto focus camara. I really recommend this Item!!!
This is a hot little phone that is all you could want and more.The basics are as follows:MP3 Player2.00 mega pixel cameraHands free stereo headset64MB Memory StickIt also has easy to use keys, and a nice size screen, and for me that is what is best about the phone as is SO easy to use, I might love my new technology but it does not mean new technology loves me especially when it is at all complicated!You have tons of memory to download some fun games, store your favourite music and naff photos, keep appointments in your mini phone calendar, listen to the radio, set true tones oh and you can use it as a phone too if you aren't too busy doing all of the above.It also a sleek little number, and fits nicely into the latest craze over here in the UK which is the mobile phone sock....don't ask but it does fit and looks quite nifty too.Sound quality is good, the hands free speakers work a treat and unlike some other phones on the market with software that has more glitches than Bill Gates underpants, this phone is not one of them.Not a cheap buy at this moment in time but a good buy if you are a serious cell phone user who wants something compact, easy to use and classy to put up against your ear when you are out and about.
this is a great phone, i used it with my cingular sim and had no problem with it. I switched to a prepay plan and it works great. The camera is better than some phones i have seen.The 64MB memory stick is good for pics and music. The bad is you cant get it from any carrier in the states, only online.
Not as user friendly as most Nokia phones.It only works with PC. To Mac owners the USB function is useless.The camera is nice and it is a fine design to look at, but the drawbacks are such that I can only reccomend it for PC owning gadget freaks.
This Phone is Awesome it comes with all the features you need.Get yours from gandhiappliances. it's sick wit it.
Does everything it is supposed to do and does them all well. Just received the x495 as a backup phone (to my P910a) ... no camera, MP3 player, add-in memory cards etc but for a new cell phone user or someone needing a solid phone "that just works simply and solidly" this could be the one.Pros:+ Usability is excellent, simple & straightforward+ strong RF (signal), perhaps not as strong as a Nokia or my P910a but pretty close.+ excellent speaker-phone+ clear audio for you & the caller+ sharp, vibrant screen+ menus are simple, easy to follow+ 3 different alarms, great as an alarm clock even works to wake you when the phone is powered off.+ does WAP/ T-Mobile t-zones nicely+ good battery life, 2-3 days between charging+ Outside screen "can" be seen easily in the dark, just hold volume up side button for 1-2 secondsCons:+ no email+ no easy syncing to get address book, tasks & calendar entrees to/from a PCStill a "5/5" and a great entry-midrange phone ... it just works, no glitches at all (so far).
When deciding how many stars to give this phone, I decided it really depends on your frame of reference.  If you are lining up all the phones currently in production, then you can arrange them in ascending order based on a number of factors.  The factors we use to judge a phone naturally include the number of features.  So in our hypothetical lineup, there are certainly other phones with more features, and those are likely to occupy some of the top spots.  BUT, another way to judge a phone is to ask how well the phone measures up against what it purports to be.  This phone has no camera, no bluetooth, and no email client.  If those are the features you are looking for, then this is not a 5 star phone.  However, this phone, to me, makes a statement abot its intended purpose by virtue of its selective inclusion -- and exclusion -- of features.  While it doesn't have all the bells or whistles in today's spectrum of wireless gadgets, what it DOES do well is act as a phone.  And in that context, it is a great PHONE -- having those features you would likely want in a device for making and receiving calls.  A large, easily readable screen font; a very lightweight housing (made lighter, no doubt, by not including extras like a camera lense); nice key layout with excellent tactile feedback (i.e. the buttons are easy to find and press, and feel good doing so); pretty good menus; excellent color display that can be viewed well even outdoors; a very solid feeling flip (the hinge is strong and pivots smoothly); teriffic battery life; and the phone comfortably cradles your face with it's angled v-shape when open.  Although I don't need a camera, I DO prefer to be able to sync with my numerous phone contacts on my PC.  I would have liked bluetooth for this reason, but a cable and software is available that I am going to try -- I will be satisfied using a cable interface if I can get some good syncing between the phone and PC.  Overall, I am conservatively rating the phone 4 stars, because the sky's the limit when it comes to gadgets, and in today's ever-evolving gadget marketplace it is hard to call anything perfect.  Bottom line, great phone.
I bought this phone to repair an older Samsung model. I've had this phone now for a month and it has not given me any problems. I did not need a phone with fancy gadgets. All I wanted the phone to do was to call and receive phone calls without static. A nice added bonus was the speaker phone which works fairly well. Another benefit of this phone was that you could transfer your phonebook and old text messages that were stored on a SIM card staright to this phone. The included ringtones are a bit cheesy but was not a bid deal since I all I wanted was a cheap phone that works well.
I recently extended my T-Mobile Contract and picked this Samsung Model in-place of my somewhat "klunky" Nokia 6010.  So-far, I'm very happy with it and I'm particularly happy about battery life and the rapid recharge time. My one complaint is that the ringer volume isn't nearly loud enough; even-though I have it set at maximum volume I'll often miss calls because the phone was in my pocket and I simply couldn't hear it ringing over background noise.
This review reflects my wife's and my experiences with this phone. To start, I have to say I've had no problems with the phone. The main design flaw I've experienced is that part of the phone digs into my cheek while I'm talking. So unless I take care to hold the mouthpiece away from my cheek it hurts while I talk. I would have rated the phone with 3 stars if it weren't for the following.The screen on my wife's phone went dark after three weeks, making it difficult to use the menus. She returned the second phone and the new one's screen went dark after three days. This is especially problematic when trying to make a call using the address book.T-Mobile stated that my wife will be upgraded to the next level of phone for free if she is forced to return this third phone within 30 days.
Samsung, in my opinion, the best mobile phone manufacturer out there, has brought another winner to the entry level phone market. Thier entry-level sucsess started with the e105 several years ago. The e105 spwanned the award-winning e series phones (e105, e315, e317, e335, etc). Now, Samsung's x series has another winner. The x495 and its Cingular twin the x497, is a well designed phone that has basic features in a small package. The screen is well sized and vibrant and the menus are intuitive. Voice quality is average, but the speaker is nice and loud, a rarity these days. The flip is burly and seems durable. The exterior screen is informative and easy to read. Speakerphone is average and doesn't stand out in any particular way. The phone is compact and the keypad is easy to use. T9 predictive text is not my favorite (I prefer iTap), it is better than having no ptext program. T-Mobile is great, blah, blah, blah. They have great customer service and the best reception in my area. Their family plan is better than ever now, since they have added more minutes and lowered the additional line cost to $7.99 from $9.99 per additional line.In other words this phone has any basic feature you could want and it just works!(By the way, this phone is my backup for my Moto RAZR. Sometimes I even prefer this phone to the RAZR!)
This is the second Samsung x495 that I've owned. The messenger service quit working on the first one I had. When going to use the messenger feature, the phone would shut off on it's own & turn back on by itself. Luckily it was just days before the store warranty was to expire so I took it back & exchanged it for another of the same model. Well the store I purchased & returned it to only had three models to choose from, the Nokia 6010 and the newer Nokia which cost more than I could afford. So I exchanged it for a new Samsung x495 and this one is having problems as well. I just got it a couple days ago. The phone shuts off on it's own which is not a good thing because I use the alarm feature to wake me up. The messenger service on both of these phones is poor. When I type a message, the screen freezes. It does have poor reception, even when trying to send a text message. Alot of times the texts will fail to go through and if your using the T-Mobile to go service like I am, you still get charged 10 cents whether or not the text actually goes through or not. It costs 10 cents just to log into messenger and even more if you are able to send messages without the screen freezing up on you. The games,the wallpaper and the ringtones that are already on this phone when you purchase it are really bad. I do have to say that the phone looks really nice but that's the only good thing about it. Now I'm going to have to take this phone back and I'm going to get my money back this time and try to find something better. This phone is a complete waste of money. T-mobile support isn't the greatest either.
I had exactly the same experience as "Hannah".  I had the Siemens flip phone (which I loved!), had battery problems and was told I could upgrade to the Samsung under warranty.  Got the new Samsung and used it for two days and hated it!  The volume control on the outside is the stupidest design ever.  I press it the whole time I'm talking.  The sound quality was horrible.  It sounded like my callers were inside a tin can.  The design includes two "hinges" when the phone is opened that press into your cheekbone while you talk.  I sent that phone back and am just going to get a new battery for my Siemens (which, thankfully, I hadn't sent back yet).
I just bought this phone yesterday as an upgrade.  I cannot tell you how much I love this phone already.  I used it for the first time and couldn't believe the great reception that I get with it.  This is my 3rd phone that I had under T-Mobile and its the best one yet.  My 1st phone was a Motorola v66--very cheap, crappy phone with poor reception and boring features.  My 2nd was a Nokia 6010--a frugal choice for the nonpicky consumer, it had good quality reception but also had boring, old technology features.  My new Samsung is a great phone with great quality reception and wonderful features.  I went shopping looking for a phone that didn't overload in features, but still kept my interests up.  This was it!  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good phone that doesn't have a camera, or is not in need of Bluetooth's connection.
I previously purchased an expensive import phone (unlocked) to use with my t-mobile service.  The phone was stylish and full of features but broke in a couple of months... therefore I've concluded expensive phones aren't worth the trouble and decided to stick with cheap, basic phones.  This phone was free with a 2yr contract (I'm on a family plan so ended up getting 4 of these).  First of all this phone is VERY BASIC, with no camera, bluetooth, and/or mp3 player, etc.  Most people do NOT use all of the features mentioned above so it may not be worth paying for those extras.  The phone is easy to use/set-up, which is the case with most Samsung phones (Motorolas on the other hand, are not very intuitive).  The battery life is pretty good (so far, I've had it for about a month) and last about 2 days with "normal" use, which means couple few minutes calls a day.  It has basic features like alarm, memo, and calendar for events.  The color scheme is somewhat feminine in my opinion but others may differ.  I don't recommend getting aftermarket covers since they are much lower quality than the factory part.  The phone comes with handsfree earpiece which works decent, but does not come with a car charger.  The reception is slightly worse than my old phone, which was a Samsung E720....... the previous phone was t-mobile so the generally weaker reception quality has to be attributed to this phone.  If you are seeking lots of extras, do not even consider this phone.  On the other hand if you are just looking for a solid, everyday phone with no frills consider this phone.
After returning the disappointing and (in my opinion) over-hyped Nokia 6102, I really didn't have any high expectations left for flip phones in the $100 range.  Of course with a new or extended contract you can easily get a new flip phone these days for a small fraction of that price.  With the Motorola V-Razor phones burning up the cell phone market now, it really leaves little left for the other guys, even Nokia has struggled to keep up with their biggest rival with the new Motorola "Razor Craze".Someone at Cingular recommended this Samsung x497.  To be honest I didn't even consider a Samsung flip phone.  I knew little about Samsung as a flip phone maker, only that it seemed overshadowed by its bigger brothers, Motorola and Nokia.  But I figured what the hell and decided to go with the x497.  Imagine my great surprise and shock when I opened the box and saw a very sturdy, solid-looking phone.  Once fully-charged, the x497 opens up to a bright, vivid screen.  Buttons and controls are solid without the least bit of "wiggly jiggly" feeling you get with other flip phones.  This one looks and feels like it can last several years and probably withstand some brutal drops onto the sidewalk (not that I will try it to prove my theory !)Reception and clarity are FANTASTIC !!  In the two weeks I've owned this phone, I've experienced maybe one dropped call and that was in a hilly area where all other phones had similar problems.  Speakerphone volume and clarity also are amazing.  I've read so many reviews and complaints from other Amazon users that speakerphone volume seems to be a big problem on many models.  Well, not this one.  I really had NO expectations for the Samsung and this one definitely is a KEEPER !Now the Cons -- It does not come with a camera or Bluetooth, but for me, those issues don't matter.  I am not someone who absolutely HAS to have a camera regardless whether I use it or not.  I know several friends who have to have a camera phone because it is the "IN" thing right now and all their friends and relatives have it.  Jeez !!  If these are not necessities to you, then it may not be a drawback.The other CON may be its size.  It's a bit on the small side if you are a big guy with big hands (like me), but I've gotten used to it and now actually like its size so it can easily fit into my pockets or held easily in one hand.Anyway, if you are looking for a SOLID phone with equally solid looks, feel, and performance, I HIGHLY Recommend this Samsung x497.  At first I thought the phone was a bit on the small side, but it easily falls into your pant pockets, but still big enough for you not to lose or misplace.  I've only begun to start tapping into its many features, but still performance is the key factor.Again, if not having a camera isn't an issue, you will be pleasantly SURPRISED by this Samsung x497 (only thru Cingular), but I imagine its twin brother x495 (for T-Mobile customers) would perform likewise.Bravo, Samsung !!  You definitely have a new fan here.
I've only had the phone for a week, but it works better than the Nokia I had before.  I haven't had any problems w/ it so far.
I had a Siemens phone prior to this and T-mobile talked me into signing a 2 year contract with a new phone instead of just replacing the battery on the siemens phone.  I wish I would have said, "no thank you"  On my seimens phone I never experienced a dropped call and that is all I experience currently.  In all fairness to t-mobile, they did offer me a refurbished  samsung, but the problems still persist.
I am totally disappointed with the physical design of this phone. When I have it held to my ear, the silver edge that sticks out actually digs into my cheekbone. Just enough that after a short call it leaves a red mark and an indentation. After a slightly longer call the mark is actually really sore. Why the need for the sharp edge? Otherwise, it works fine. I'm finally buying a different model after suffering with this one for three months. It's really a silly design.
The Samsung x495 looks sleek and cool but doesn't really meet my basic expectations.  I used to have a Kyocera on Verizon's service and switched because I wanted something a little more affordable.  Choosing this phone/Tmobile was a big mistake.  I'm paying less but I get a fraction of the quality.I consistently don't get service in entire areas around the region--sometimes I'll be out and find I have voicemail for calls that didn't even ring, I have dropped calls, the sound quality is poor, the design isn't that great, it's uncomfortable to hold against my hear due to the hinges.  And the way things are set up inside the phone's systems are totaly counter-intuitive--it offers to edit numbers I want to call and call numbers I want to retrieve information on. Plus the little "T-Zones" button is totally annoying and puts me onto the internet everytime I breath on it! Oh and I found the battery life ot really be unsatifactory--when the battery is low--the phone gives you only a minute or two of warning before shutting down completely.  I'm going back to Kyocera as soon as possible! Stay away from the  X495~!
I shop through amazon all the time and I am usually very happy with my purchases. However, I was in search of a new samsung phone because I like their products and for some reason, decided on this one. The first thing that threw me off was the "list price" that stated the phone was worth $199. I have since been to a t-mobile store and the price is $9.99, for good reason. Why didn't anyone say anywhere in the description or the reviews that this is a YOUTH PHONE???It even feels like a toy. There are 4 screen savers. Lassie, some Lab puppies, a snowboarder, and some teacups, I guess for the sophisticated consumer. And I refuse to pay $1.50 to download a new screen saver because I am not throwing any more money into this toy. I am way too old to be carrying this phone and it is way too hard to return it to amazon without terrible complications to my phone service. BAD IDEA!
This Cell is off the hook. Its awsome cause you could talk to other T-mobil customers free. Weekends are also free. You should really get this phone.
I am aware that this is not the "coolest" phone in the world, but its the most durable out of the 8 phones I have owned in recent years BY FAR!Anyone who has Verizon service knows the lengths you have to go through to replace a damaged or defective phone!  It is a very costly and frustrating process.  That being said, it is important for Verizon customers to pick durable, high quality phones rather than whatever is in style.I am VERY hard on cellphones... I drop mine nearly every day and after a year this phone still works perfectly!  Its not as cool as a Razr, but I am very impressed with the durability!!!
This past January I switched from Nextel to Verizon.  While at Nextel, I had the same Motorola phone for 4 years.  Not once did I ever experience a single problem with that phone.Since joining Verizon and getting the V276, I have had my screen freeze twice and my antenna completely snap off, which is weird because I only use it when I start to lose reception.  Every night I recharge my phone, mostly because I have to or else the battery will be dead in the morning because it doesn't last more than 12 hours.  On SEVERAL occasions (maybe 30??) I have taken my phone from the charger in the morning noticing that the screen showed it as being completely charged and within an hour have the phone die on me because the battery went dead.  On top of that, I have taken a total of 4 pictures and can only download 3 songs because my free space is completely taken up.  Why do I not just delete stuff?  Well, Verizon/Motorola were curtious enough to give me 30+ pictures and 10+ ringtones that cannot be deleted out of the phone.  I have taken it to a Verizon Service provider (to fix the antenna that broke) and asked them to delete the pictures and they told me that they couldn't.  So now I have to either delete songs I have downloaded to add more or delete pictures I have taken to add more.  Honestly, I wish I would've paid money for a better phone and not just agreed to this crappy free one.  I absolutely hate it and do not recommend it to anybody.  I know Motorola can make good phones because I used to have one with Nextel.I hope this review will help out another everyday consumer.
This phone needs to be recalled!  After reading reviews on several sites, I see that everyone is having the same problems I am.  I've talked to Motorola and they won't help (talk about lack of customer service and a general bad attitude).  Apparently all of us who made the horrible mistake of getting this phone on a contract are stuck with Verizon giving us the same bad phone again and again.  Stop the MADDNESS!  If a phone won't charge, shuts itself off whenever, is completely undependable - something must be done.  I'm very disappointed in both these companies for not stepping up to the plate!
I bought the similar V265 model 15 months ago, and just replaced it with the V276.  The new model hasn't changed much, so I believe my long experience with the reliablility of the V265 will be pretty applicable to this model as well.  (The V276 has a better camera, but I never used the camera anyway.)The voice quality of the phone is very good.  The speaker phone function is exceptional.  When used in a car, the phone can be placed in the center console, and both the person in the car, and the person at the other end can hear the conversation fine using the speakerphone function this way.  (My wife and I share this phone, so I have experience with this from both ends.)  The connector to charge the battery is finicky, you have to make sure the indicator and beeper shows the phone is charging, because the connector can get wiggled in such a way that it is plugged in, but not contacting properly, and not charging.The reason I upgraded to the V276 is because the V265 phone developed a sudden failure.  When calling there was a static noise at the cellphone end, and almost no voice reception at the other end.  After an internet search, I found out this is a failure that is not uncommon with the V265.  I have a good guess about how and when this happened.  I touched the phone one day and gave it a fat static shock on its antenna.  It was after this I first noticed a problem with it.Considering the important factors, which means voice quality and reception to me, and with the extended warranty I now have, I think this is a pretty decent phone.
Wife and I wanted to add another phone to our line on Verizon's Family Plan deal (9.99). We were happy with our current Motorola V265 and wanted to be able to use the same chargers so we stuck them and got the newer V276)I'm very happy with this phone. I didn't want a lot of bells and whistles. Just a good basic phone that works. THe camera and other features are nice but I probably won't use them.Reception is great. Voice is exceptional. For 99 bucks couldn't ask for any better.
We've had this phone for seven months now. After countless trips to the Verizon store, we just got a replacement for the original phone that died. The replacement has all the same problems - bad charger connection, short battery life, dropped calls. And the Verizon Tech Support tried to convince us that all the problems with this phone are our fault. I'm totally disappointed in this phone and in Verizon. Can't wait for my contract to expire, so I can change providers.ps. I also have a Nokia and I love it. Simple, user-friendly, durable.
This phone has done alright for me and verizon.  I had a motorola 233 prior to this, so it was a big upgrade. I loved my Motorola V60t when I had it with cingular, so i figured this flip phone can't be to bad, and it is a good brand.  It was free, I have minimal needs, so it is good.Pluses:  Small, fun little camera for quick snapshots(300k), good sound, easy to use menus and set up, voice dialing, speaker phone.Minuses:  drops calls intermittantly, battery life is reduced only after one year (my V60t never had this issue), flimsy feel/quality (flip gets loose), can't do anything without a hassle to use photos once on the camera (unless you upload them to a website, download them again, or pay 50-60 bucks for a cable to connect to computer,  just a hassle), and occasional button stickage/misdial speed dials (even when new).I will likely be able to get a better phone next time with a memory card, but as for a lightweight user like me, this is a decent phone that you don't have to hide from other folks with .  Plus, it was free.  If it lasts  me two years, it owes me nothing.Update 10/16/2006-hey, it was free, bound not to last.  Just had to replace one of my two phones after only 14 months due to it suddenly not charging on any charger.  Only cost me 50 bucks, got my phone number transferred, lost some photos, but not bad.  Had I had the replacement plan, I would have already payed 70 bucks over the 14 months, so I still win. Still doesn't owe me a thing
I have had the earlier version of this phone, V265, for the past two years and think it's a great phone.  I don't know what a reviewer was talking about then they said this phone drops 1 in 3 calls, I've expereience dropped calls at the rate of 1 in a 100 or 200 - no more than any other phone probably.  I liked this one enough to sign up for this current version and I'm tradiing in my V265 to paypal's ez-tradein.com for a $50 gain since that one cost me zero.
Ok, I have had verizon for less than two years and this is my third phone.  It is fairly new so I have no complaints as of yet.  The reception is a lot clearer than the last one I had.  The fact that it has a camera is even greater.  I love taking pictures so this was perfect for me.  The picture quality isn't the best, but for a camera phone it is pretty good compared to the others I have seen. The buttons are the phone are larger than some so I don't have trouble hitting the wrong buttons.  I haven't had any difficulty with the battery at all, in fact the battery seems to last quite a bit longer than the last two phones I had.  I am looking forward to the next 2 years with this phone.
I see why they make this phone on a "Buy one Get one" plan. Randomly, this phone will lose service even if I'm standing right under a cell tower. It will drop calls and randomly call people. It has a hollow sound to it. The screen gets dust under it easily. The camera is horrible quality and you can't store a lot.Much like other Motorola phones...the charger is flimsy and feels like it will break off. A horrible buy. Go with another phone. I'm on Amazon trying to find a cheap phone to buy to have Verizon switch my plan over to that. I'll be willing to give up the camera in order to get rid of this P.O.S.
I have had my V276 for a couple months now and there's nothing I can really say that is horrible about it. I've had no problem with the battery or the screen or really any function of the phone.I actually get calls while at work with this phone. Something with the building makes cell phone usage nearly impossible, all my previous cells didn't work at all in the building. So that is a bonus. If I do get dropped calls it's generally due to the building and the fact I can use it at all sort of removes the disappointment of a dropped call.I have had some problems where occasionally the phone won't ring and incoming calls go straight to voicemail. My fiance also has a verizon phone (not the same model) and experiences similar problems with his phone not ringing so I believe it is a problem with the Verizon network. Not that I don't get my call, just it doesn't ring and all of a sudden it beeps that I missed a call or have voicemail.The camera phone has been beneficial as many of my friends and family have camera phones and I'm currently planning my wedding and they send me snap shots of everything from decorations to shoes all the time.One thing I'm not crazy about is the way the contacts lists everyone. My old phones if you had 2 numbers for the same person there was only one listing and you selected the number you wanted to use. In this phone every number shows on the list so if I go to the contact section and try to find my Dad, I have to scroll through his work and email to find his mobile number. Not a huge upset but I liked how the old phone handled it better.I've used the Get It Now for ringtones with no problem and even used some of the little features like alarm clock for when I decide to take a nap during lunch :-)Is this phone the most wonderful phone on the planet? No.Is it a desent communication tool with a couple extras? Yes.Do I regret buying it? Nope. It does the job well for what I require.
this is pretty much the worst phone to ever exist, and i'm shocked to see that some people have actually given it five stars. i had this phone for 5 months and had to replace the antenna twice (it just broke off) and the screen froze so often, it was just impossible to use. i just got a new phone from verizon and love it. this phone is HORRIBLE.
Reception and clarity in very clear.  Speakerphone is loud and clear.  Voice Recognition works effortlessly, 500 Number Enhanced Phonebook, compact,  Blue backlit keypad looks nice, Currency Converter, Phone Lock, Predictive text for SMS, Talk Time is Up to 180 - 210 minutes and  Standby Time is Up to 150 - 300 hours.  overall - it is a good phone.  incentives(cash back) to own one are good too.
This is the worst mobile phone I have ever owned and I include my first phone in this statement.  The phone doesn't hold a charge, drops calls for no reason, won't charge when plugged in, the list goes on.  Everyone I know who has ever had this phone disliked it.  Don't buy this phone, you'll regret it.
I have no regrets about buying the Motorola V276. It's like a little piece of heaven for me. This phone plays real music tones and polyphonic tones. The battery sucks. The phone has a loud ring, great camera, and many other great features. Might not be great for an older person, but it the idea phone for someone in their teens. AWESOME!
i go this phone from an arcade game for 50 cents!!! and it actully works really well. the camera is good and its really load when it comes to ringtones. verizon is a smart company because it doesnot let u use your voice records as ringtones, if that was the case u could get free music ringtones. i cant say anything about the web because i have not been on it yet.uhhh.... thats about it i recomend this phone aolt
I have been with Verizon Wireless since they started, and I have never had a phone last me the 2 years...this one is no different. I honestly think it is a scam. I think they intentionally make cheap and defective phones because they know you will renew your contract if you need a new phone (especially if it is free), so the "New In Two" was quite a clever marketing scam. This phone drops 1 of every 3 calls, and it will get really staticy ever time I use it...I can hear somewhat, but the person I am talking to can't hear a thing. The only good thing that I can say is that physically, it is a very well made phone. I am very hard on my phones and the hinge on the flip part usually breaks, but this one held up great. Techinally, it is just not a good phone, and even Verizon has admitted that there have been lots of problems with it.
This phone works great. It's incredibly durable. I'm a very accident prone person--I dropped this phone off of a roof once, I'm not kidding! It landed on a cement sidewalk, remained intact, and works great. I also dropped it in a bathtub full of hot, soapy water. I took out the battery and let it dry, and the next day, it still worked, and with no problems! So, if you are accident prone, this is the phone for you!
I'm keeping this short and sweet.Anyone who talks trash about this phone either:1. Is a complete idiot and and probably can't figure out the remote to their television eitheror2. Has no idea about the relationship between their service provider and reception.This is phone is easy to use and sounds great.  I switched over from my other phone in about 5 minutes and noticed an improvement in sound quality, and my other phone was an LG that sounded good to begin with.If your sound quality sucks, it is because your provider does not have good coverage in your area.  If your phone does not work well (battery, etc.) it is either a lemon or you don't know how to handle electronics.  If its lemon, get another.  If you need a clue, get one.I think this phone is fine. I read a lot of these reviews and almost didn't buy it, then I remembered 90% of people are complete  morons.  If you are not a moron, this phone will work fine for you.  Looks pretty cool too.
I upgraded to this phone after two years and it's been awful.  I've gone through three of them. The first V276 they gave me lasted a month and then i couldn't hear people when they talked.  So they replaced it.  The next one they gave me had a problem shutting off when you closed the phone which caused the battery to die in a couple of hours. So they replaced it.  The third one had a problem with the battery connection and stopped working all together and oops... now my warranty is over so no replacement.  Some of my friends have the same phone and they all hate it.  Save yourself the headache.  Don't buy this phone just because it's cheap. However if you do be sure to purchase the extended warranty or you'll be sorry.
I switched to Verizon from Vrigin Mobile's pay-as-you-go plan (which was flat-out terrible) and have never regretted it. Verizon is an excellent provider in my area (Omaha, Nebraska) with great customer service in my experience. I signed on and could have gotten the LG VX3300 free (an excellent little phone in its own right), but I did want the camera that came with the v276, so I payed an exra $60. Ironically, the camera is a bit of a weak point for me, as the resolution isn't that great and I rarely use it. But the reception with this phone is excellent, and i have never had a dropped call. I am also happy with the battery life that this phone offers. It takes literally 10 minutes tops to fully recharge, and on standby, the phone takes FOREVER to lose bars. Howver, the adaptor that is used to recharge the phone is a horrible design: the end plug consists of 2 little prongs that rarely connect well with the phone. Often, one has to rock the adaptor in to get a good connection, and it  usually disconnects itself. What really does drain the battery, however, is talking. Sometimes just a short conversation with a friend will drain the battery at least one bar. That is somewhat annoying when the whole purpose of a phone is to TALK to someone! However, by and large, the v276 is a winner for the price, and does more than I will ever need it to.
I don't know what these people are talking about this is a good phone. I had no problems with it at all. I loved it.
This is a great phone. I chose this phone over the RAZR because of all the rumors going around about the battery melting the phone. Plus this phone is way cheaper and worth it. There's text messaging, Get It Now, and mobile web. Get It Now has the best ringtones, besides V-Cast. I got Fresh Azimiz by Bow Wow, Gimmie That by Chris Brown, and Check On It by Beyonce. Each ringtone only cost $2.99. It's a great phone, the ringtones are bumping. I highly request you to choose this over the RAZR.
I am so disappointed in this telephone. I have had this telephone since October 2005. I have been a Verizon customer since then and I understand exactly why these phone were offered for free. You get what you pay for! My father's V276 warranty REPLACEMENT is dead. To add insult the replacement I received yesterday has just died after less than 24 hours. The insurance company is sending me a totally different telephone this time. There have been problems with the other two phones as well. Until now, I have always preferred Motorola cellphones, but not anymore...
Around Christmas 2004 I bought the Motorolla V276 phone from verizon.  Horrible idea.  Really Horrible idea.  I bought it because of the ideal price, but I really got what I paid for.  The battery of the phone dies 3-4 times quicker than every other phone I have ever owned, there is a constant static in the background no matter if in the basement of my apartment or driving to work in the suburbs.  It has gotten to the point where I can only talk on the phone when it is plugged into the charger and I am holding the phone at a certain angle.  Usually when this happens I take it to the verizion store and they replace it with a new phone.  So the customer service on this phone is great, and thats the only thing that saves it from a 1-star rating, but I shouldnt have to go to Verizion every 3 months to get a new phone.  Maybe next time this happens I will just buy a Nokia.One last reason I dislike this phone (although not a technical problem): When going through your recent calls, it lists your last 60 phone calls.  There is no need for that, and it could be seen as a privacy issue.
I am not sure if everybody who has posted before me is talking about the right phone. This phone is fine. Maybe they are to picky or don't know how to use it...I think its a great phone..
You'll notice as you read these reviews that though they are supposedly by different people, a lot of the phrases in their reviews are like cut & pasted from one to the other.  Comments like bad reception in the basement, or other things are word-for-word the same.  So although I don't own one of these phones (yet), since I had to rate the phone to post this notice about the phony reviews, I'm giving it a 5 to help counteract the duplicate bad reviews I read.

I bought the phone Aug of 2005. (...)The phone is OK, works alright, battery life is a little short, verizon has decent service except that they don't give you local number by defaut, imaging someone would get a phone that everybody in town would have to call long distance to reach you? That's what they believe.followup: (...)= rebate, they deleted it in my review...
So i bought this phone after having an LG for 2 yrs I decided it was time for a change definitely the BIGGEST MISTAKE of my life.. the first problem i had was I couldnt hear anything out of it! so I had to try it in for a new 2nd time I had to bring it because it wouldnt charger 3rd time which is right now --- long behold i still cant charge my phone.. first thing tomorrow Im headed to a verizon store to buy a new phone most likely an LG might as well stick with whats good! if you like problems this is the phone for you but i highly doubt you would want this cuz its been a yr.. and this phone is horrible
While this phone looks nice, and has a lot of features there are problems with the phone.I notice the ringer is not as loud as my Samsung was, and the screen is harder to read than on other phones.My latest problem is the AC charger doesn't seem to make firm connection with the contacts, and my phone died yesterday during a business call. It seems you have to wiggle the plug just right to get a connection. Going to see if Verizon will exchange it for a Samsung or comparable phone.I have only had this phone for less than two months.
I agree!! This phone is a WASTE! I don't use it during the day because I'm at work, and when I go to make a phone call...I HAVE NO BATTERY!!! Can someone expalin this to me?? I mean seriously...the static is unbearable, and I have to hold the phone in a certain position to hear out of it even though the earpiece volume is set on the max. I also quite frequently pick up other peoples conversations on my phone..in the middle of my own conversation!!! I get signal like...NOWHERE with this piece of crap. TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION!!
This is my first ever cell phone and after one month of usage I really do not have any major complaints unlike some of the other reviewers.So let's see what's good about this phone:1.Nice and sleek design. For the price, its not cheap at all.2.External screen lets you see the date, time, battery power,connection strength and caller ID when the phone rings3.User friendly menus4.Touchpad is decent, without hurting your fingers when you dial numbers.4.Camera. Dont expect the quality to be great as it is for emergencies only and not for serious photography !5.TXT messaging, ability to change wallpapers, emailSo as you see it has everything you would want in a nice and simple phone. It is not fancy but it works just as well. Now let me try to give my take on some of the complaints by other reviewers here:1. The chiming sound it makes during turn on and turn off is really annoying. But guess what you can turn it off! Yes just go to settings and tools->sounds->power on/off, and hola its off! So this one is settled.2. The other complaint was that the voice quality is sometimes average. It is true that sometimes the voice from the other side sounds feeble and sometimes its blaring. But its not that bad that you cannot comprehend what the other person is saying. I make a lot of international calls and I am quite satisfied with the voice reception.3. I have had no problems with signal/reception quality so far.4. About the phone going dead within few weeks of buying, just tell me which electronic items are fail proof. I have seen laptops, digital cameras, flash drives etc all go dead. Sometimes you are lucky to get a fail proof item and sometimes you are not. There is nothing one can do about those things. All you can do is pray !So in short if you are looking for a nice , compact, inexpensive camera cell phone , I would recommend this phone.
A basic phone -- fine for calls and text messaging -- got it directly from Verizon Wireless as part of a two-year two-phone sign-up plan.  The plan was for two vx5200s, but upgraded one to a vx6100 for a modest fee.  Would have upgraded both phones to vx6100 but the deal at the time only allowed one upgrade.  No problems with the phone -- feels a little flimsy compared to the vx6100 -- volume not as good either. Verizon coverage in our area is good.  Unfortunately, the only way to find out if a particular phone and a particular carrier will work well in a given area is to find someone with that particular combination in that area -- so it isn't suprising that some reviewers have more problems than others in a particular area and/or with a particular phone.  Can't emphasize it enough -- definitely ask friends/coworkers about their experiences with particular phones and carriers in your area before buying -- for example I had one friend who only got good reception around work and home with T-mobile.  Good luck -- finding the right phone and the right carrier can be challenging.
I just recently replaced my old LG with this one and from a practical standpoint it delivers.  This model is lightweight and fairly compact.  Reception has always been good.  Has some basic color themes which really a variations of red, yellow and blue themes.  Not exactly the most customizable phone out there.There were some issues I had with the design immediately.  On the outside there is a button which activates the camera, so sometimes after I tuck it into my sidepocket I accidently take twenty pictures of lint and keys.  Its annoying to delete these pictures, so I suggest getting a holster if you can.
Got this phone three weeks ago because of the special deal for new subscribers with Verizon. How disappointing! Like others, it emits an ANNOYING high-pitched noise. The person on the other end sounds like they're standing in a metal box (hollow), and I always hear my own comments echoing back a second or two later. The phone does not hold a charge long, either. I don't talk on it much, yet I'll take it out of my purse to make a call only to find it dead! My family got three and they are all the same. Stay away from this phone!
This phone is great--sometimes. When it's not, it's a nightmare. The 1st time I bought the LG VX5200 camera phone (December 2005), I had it for 4 days and it crashed irreparably. I got a new one. Now, about 6 months after I bought the second one, it did the same thing. And my sister's did the same as well. What happens is the screen goes to white with the Verizon logo and it stays that way. Only taking the battery out turns off the phone. But when you put it back in and try to turn the phone on, it just goes to the white screen. I even tried replacing the battery. I have also read of similar things happening to others with this phone, so I don't recommend this phone at all.
Nice phone, especially the automatic voice feature that does not need training... works right away ...My complaints are in 2 areas detailed below. First for those who want to transfer contacts from another phone, PDA or from Outlook.  And second that Verizon has had LG remove file transfer features that forces user to pay for MIDIs and MP3 that are already on your PC, just to use up your air time (= money!)1. The Manual mentions a USB cable once.2. LG's website mentions no such device, nor drivers, for any  CDMA phone. Search engine produces no results. 3rd party  cable exists but advertises 'no drivers, no software'3. No infrared, no bluetooth (of course not for the price)4. Can send but NOT receive text message / MMS in which you  include addresses from your competitive phone.  (This feature exists in Nokia, Siemens, even the oldest  black/white Nokias!)5. Has neat music tunes (polyphone MIDIs) that you can ONLY send  to others, but not set as ringtones. I guess you may send it  to yourself, and charge yourself for airtime!!  Is that extortion?Conclusion: A. camera and hot pix are features that encourage you to share  wirelessly and consume airtime for Verizon's profits. B. This may reveal a deeper strategy of Verizon and LG to  remove technology to force user to spend needlessly C. Suggest "googling" (or searc CNET) to corroborate other  rumors that Verizon makes use use airtime for reading text  message and partially disables bluetooth for file management  to force you to pay for data transfers. D. With Nokia, Siemens and others you can transfer WAV, MIDIs,  and MP4 files from your PC for ringtones via an accessory  cable, or if enabled, via Infrared and/or Bluetooth, and MMS.  There may be a removable multimedia card feature on LG's  8100 or later phones that MAY enable some of these features,  but I hope this helps avoid the wasted moves I had to make.
the previous reviewer who suggested that you could not use a usb cable to transfer ringers, etc. was incorrect.you can buy a usb cable from ebay (make sure it includes drivers) and download bitpim (free). this will allow you to transfer mp3s from your computer to your phone to use as ringtones. it will also let you transfer images back and forth.  you don't need to pay for airtime for these.and if you want to complain about using airtime for text messages, complain about sprint! they force you to connect to the web to send/receive messages.  verizon is much better on this front!
I got this phone in December after the external speaker and the vibrate mode on my lg-vx6100 cell phone had finally died. Apparently the Wireless Zone didn't have my old phone in stock anymore.I like that the external LCD is in color, my old phone was not. Also, this phone is very small and the clamshell fits together well. The vibrating is more discreet than my old phone, which everyone could hear go off in my pocket.However, the camera is absolutely horrible. It has a green tinge to it, until I adjust the white balance. Also, the internal screen is much smaller than it was on my old phone. There aren't many ringtone options available on the phone, and the wallpaper is obscured by banners on the top and bottom that take up almost 1/3 of the screen. The font is also very small. It would be nice if the phone had more than basically two color schemes.Overall, this is a very nice, compact phone, and I haven't had any missed calls. The buttons are made of soft rubber instead of the hard plastic that many are made of. This is a very good phone, minus the display and camera issues.
I recently got this phone, and I love it! The camera quality isn't great, but niether is any other phone's. And, a few of my friends have this phone, too.I know there has been a lot of negative feedback for this phone, but I really dont see why. The only wish I have is if you could make your recorded sounds your ringtones! Other that that, the phone is great. Especially if this is your first cell phone. It is a great starter phone.
Hopefully you find this review before you purchase the phone because returning it can be a real hassle with certain cell phone companies even if you are within the 15-day return policy.That being said, the lcd screen emits a high-pitched noise periodically throughout the phone call.  Type "LG VX5200 high pitched" as a Google search and you will see similar reviews.
I got these phones for my family one year ago and would like to share our experiences. Contrary to what some people are saying, the clarity for us has been fine, not exceptional but slightly better than average. The lighted display is almost bright enough to work as a flashlight in some instances and the mirrored area around the display comes in handy in a pinch to put contact lenses back in, make-up, etc. The buttons are easy enough to work and have had few problems inherent to the phone.Enter Verizon: You should be able to transfer pictures taken with this phone to your pc, but Verizon has disabled it so that a) you'll subscribe to an extra service to be able to do that and b) if you don't, your pics will accumulate and use up battery power faster so you'll upgrade to their slightly more powerful battery. The battery life was never even average in this phone, but after one year a 15 minute call can run the battery down 50%, 2 hours of talking means get this phone back to a power source or it will die. Even if the phone isn't used at all, just sitting on a table will exhaust the battery life in one day. The standard battery is 1000mAh, you can spend another $35-40 upgrading to a 1700mAh battery which was not designed to fit so it will need an additional cover. Voice memo has also been disabled and I'm not sure what else, there has been a lot of rigging to funnel you into buying extras through Verizon. The plastic front display broke the same way, at the same time, on all our phones and instead of buying new housing we're looking at bending over and upgrading to entirely new phones now and hopefully being done with this cycle. In summary this was an average phone to begin with, but after the tinkering Verizon has done to force you into their extra products and services, it's just not a good deal. Save yourself time, frustration and money and just start with a more expensive phone with better battery life.
I love this phone! It takes pictures, IM's, and allows you to download games. the pictures do not turn out as well as desired, but we were taking them in a dimly lit room. The calls sound fine, no static whatsoever!  The only thing I think is bad about this phone is the menus are a little confusing to figure out, and it's hard to get it off of driving mode if you don't read the manual.  So go ahead and get it. It's only $10.00 in verizon stores!
I got this phone  in the begining of 2006 and it has not givin me any problems yet. Here are the pros, and cons:Lets start with the cons:- very delacate- a lot of ringtone sites dont support this phoneNOW the pros:- long and lastful battery- no lag from going to and from settings- nice camera- very lightOverall I think that this phone is worth it and if you want a cell phone that will last then you definatly have to look into this phone.
This phone is great. I got it for my birthday and i've had it since july 2006. Everything works great on this phone, except i hate how long it takes to get to Mobile IM. I mainly use it for text messaging, instant messaging, taking pictures and placing calls. The text messages come quickly, instant messages are quick also. The camera is pretty good for this phone. When i talk to someone on the phone the sound is great. Although it shows up on the inside screen, I wish the picture caller ID showed up on the outside of the phone like my dad's Samsung a970.CONS:-When taking self portraits from the front, the picture is a mirror-image so it is backwards.- No picture caller ID on the outside screenPROS:-Mobile IM-Text Messaging Easy-Camera Easy-This is my first phone, and i think it's great for first time phone users
So far, so good with the phone, but...1) Do not buy from Best Buy. You will get charged an activation fee by both Verizon and Best Buy without being told.2) I was getting spammed text messages by Dada without my permission.3) I get horrible reception out of major towns.
PROS:-Allows one person to talk to another person. (sometimes even with acceptable voice quality)-Average reception (Best thing about the phone, and it's only average)CONS:-The high pitched noise that is randomly(and frequently) made by the screen/speaker not only destroys call quality, but routinely gives me a headache after only a few minutes. This noise is present on both my wife's phone and my own, as well as numerous other reviews-Even when the high pitched noise is not present, voice quality is usually very poor.-Fails in just about every aspect of what a phone should do well.OTHER: Search other reviews and look for references to the high pitched noise.  I read them and figured that it was hype or that I "would get a good one."  Do not buy this phone, you will be dissapointed.
i got my phone a  few days ago and it is way beter  than the other one i had.  i do have to say that the features are  awesome!  they are easier to use than my old phone.the camera is  easy as pie to use.  it has a lot of memory.on the screen you can put pictures that you take with the camera option. or you can download wallpapers for your background.  it is such a nice phone.you can store a lot of contacts in the contacts list.basically i would recommend this phone for anyone.
I got this phone because the price was great, and it was easy to hold in my hand. This is my first cellphone, and I love it!! I'd recommend it to anyone!! A must-have for everyone who is getting their first cellphone. Easy to use, but you have to read the instruction manual first to learn about all of it's features. Nice and bright screen with a nice loud ringtone (that is, if you want to put it the max volume). I hope you choose this phone if you're unsure of which Verizon Wireless cell phone to buy. :-)
We bought this phone, after the crappy motorola c343 I had.  I love This phone!!! Voice recognition comands are amazing, i configured my phone so it would say the number from the person who is calling, the announce mode is totally useful.. It has a pretty decent speakerphone. An average external display and a cool internal display.But, why 4 stars then? NO BLUETOOTH NOR INFRARED. Verizon configured the phone so your sounds cant be used as ringtones, so you have to BUY your ringtones. stupid decision. Here in the dominincan republic isnt a big selection of good cellphones, so this is the best you can get for VERIZON. Hopefully in the future they will bring a greater variety of cellphones
This si the worst phone i have ever had! It always breaksup and suddenly it shut down and erases=d all of my pics. even the ones that were already on the phone. I even think it areased some of my contacts..
I GOT THIS PHONE FOR XMAS. AND ITS A GREAT PHONE!!! THE BATTERY LAST A VERY LONG TIME SO YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO  CHARGE IT A LOT. THE NEXT GREAT THING IS IT DOSENT TAKE A LONG TIME TO CHARGE WITCH MEANS ITS GREAT IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY AND NEED YOUR PHONE YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME. THIS PHONE DOSE TAKE PHOTOS TO. AND YOU CAN ALSO SEND TEXT MESSAGES AND DOWNLOAD GAMES AND RINGTONES. YOU CAN ALSO DOWNLOAD WALLPAPER. AND YOU CAN RECORD SOUNDS WITCH IS ALSO  AWSOME!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PHONE THEN BUY THIS ONE.
I would've given this phone a 3 and a half stars if it gave me the choice.I think this is my 7th phone or so and I mean, it's pretty good for what it's suppose to do.  Come on, people, this is a phone. If you want a MP3 player, get an MP3 player... if you want a camera.. get a camera. For its intended use, this is a pretty decent phone. I will be making some comparisons with some of my older phones in the review so judge for yourself.PROS:1. Good reception- Nokia has always been known for its good reception and awesome battery life. Well, this one doesn't fall short from the rest. I am able to hear clearly and not drop a call at all even in places where I have one bar to no bars. In fact, my Samsung E715 phone.. would even drop a call around places where it had two bars.2. Good battery life- Like I said before, Nokia is known for their battery life. I had a Nokia 6800 and the battery life on that phone was pretty good too but it doesn't seem to be as good as this phone. I had talked on the phone for over an hour the first day and left it laying around for 3-4 days and only then did the battery bar drop one bar.3. The price on this phone is excellent. Where could you find such a deal for a camera... video playback, speaker phone?4. The speakerphone function is actually not too bad. If you are in a decently quiet room with some background noise, you can hear your caller just fine. I don't know why you would be on speakerphone when you are out in a crowded place... You don't have Nextel or Boost Mobile.. this is T-mobile we're talking about. and if you cannot even hear a caller well under such conditions, maybe it's not the phone that is the problem.5. The ringtones that come with the phoone is actually decent. I actually enjoyed some of them.. And just to clarify.. THIS PHONE IS NOT A MP3 PLAYER. It can play MP3 ringtones.. but in no means is this to be used like an ipod. If you want an ipod that badly.. then get an ipod!6. It's a pretty good job by Nokia considering it is their first flip phone. It seems pretty sturdy.. unless you are going to drop it a hundred times. But no phone is going to survive that kind of brutality.7. Good thing about T-Mobile phones is that they give you a free headset with the phone. This helps tremendously since you cannot listen to the radio without the headset.CONS:1. Like many people have stated before.. the memory on this phone sucks. I think it has about 3MB or so for you to use.. which really isn't much. But if you're not going to be downloading a hundred things onto your phone, it's not a big deal. And if you really really need to download a bunch of games so you can play it everywhere you go, you might as well get a gameboy or a PSP.2. The annoying Nokia tone and t-mobile tone cannot be deleted in the ringtones section. Everything else that comes with it can be deleted. but it's those two annoying tones you are pretty much unable to delete.3. The T-zones button gets hit really easily. I don't know what it is or if anyone else has had this problem. But there are tons of times where I go to open the flip after closing it for a while.. and for some reason.. it's on the t-zones page. I think the problem with that is the button to select t-zones is so close to the edge that when you close the flip, it's easy to trigger it.4. No bluetooth! For a phone jammed packed with stuff, there is no bluetooth whatsoever. I've never had a bluetooth phone so it may not matter to me but for those of you who cannot live without bluetooth.. this isn't the phone for you.5. There are just somethings about the design of the phone that does not make sense to me. First of all, if you want to set a caller ID for someone after you have taken the picture, you cannot just simply go to the picture and set it.. you have to go to the contact name and add the detail in. This is annoying since with all my previous camera phones, you can just go to the picture you want and select from there. Also, like someone else said, there is no button that goes straight to vibrate. The # sign and the * sign don't even put this phone to silent, which is pretty annoying.6. EDIT: I have now just downloaded some ringtones from the t-zones section. Just a warning to everyone.. the ringtones that I downloaded sound absolutely horrible. It hurt my ears to listen to them. And it's about 2 bucks for one ringtone. So do not use t-zones to download ringtones.7. Unlike many other Nokia phones, this Nokia does not have those awesome changeable faceplates. In fact, if you do what to change the faceplate for the phone, you'd probably have to get it off of Ebay and it requires you to use a T6 screwdriver in order to change it.. not worth the hassle.Overall, don't be fooled by some of the negative reviews you read. Sure, this phone has its flaws.. but so do every other phone. The thing to remember is that this is suppose to be a cell phone and not a all-in-one kind of deal. The camera is decent for a camera phone. Not the best I've had but good enough. And so far, I am pretty satisfied with it.
I did a thorough search in Nov. 2005 and examined many phones and service providers before selecting "Nokia 6101" and T-mobile. Other providers did not have the flexibility with the prepaid system to meet my needs. This phone has everything I was looking for and it is easy to operate and use. I love the camera and video which are easy to operate. I quickly grasped the "how tos" on making, receiving calls, and text messaging.You can store 16 MB of information, send photos via email to friends and create photo albums. The text messaging system is super! The Voice Mail was a bit complicated to set up due to my lack of experience and discomfort with all this high tech equipment. I used up minutes unnecessarily listening to the T-mobile prompt telling me about Voice Mail until I realized it was an "information only" call. It dawned on me that I had to read and reread the manual which was not enough so I finally went to the Nokia and T-mobile websites for more detailed precise directions. I finally got it right!The SIMS chip placement was straight forward, no difficulty with the battery either. Activating the phone and receiving my phone number was a cinch! However getting my 1000 minutes to upload *was* a bit of a hassle, I bought a card which could not be directly uploaded. The help number at T-mobile set me straight. I am not locked into a monthly plan but choose to prepay minutes. I found T-mobile offers the most convenient method and options for obtaining 1000 minutes which last a whole year and whatever you don't use rolls over when you buy the next 1000 minutes. {I do not talk all that much but need the phone for safety and short interval calls.] Other service providers had more complicated methods of buying and using minutes, with a lot of add-on costs.  It is so easy! I love the phone! I am enjoying the extra features more than I imagined. It is not *just* a phone - it is a communication device that makes me feel connected to the world. This phone works best for me. [Planning next to buy the headset to use the FM Radio ...] Erika BOrsos (erikab93)
I've had the Nokia 6101 for about a week. It operates well and has good reception. Voice mail and e-mail are easy to use. Overall, I'm pleased.Pros:* The unit is small and very light. It comes with a lithium ion battery that can take a charge any time (does not require a full discharge to preserve battery life like older NiCad batteries).* The keys are large and easy to use. The menu system is highly configurable. Shortcuts are easy to set up.* You can send and receive text or pictures to/from anyone with an e-mail address.* Besides e-mail, the phone has an infrared port, so users can exchange info with a PC directly via wireless infrared (no cable is necessary).* Reception and voice quality are acceptable. The handset has acceptable volume and the volume is adjustable.* The phone comes with a bunch of nifty extras like a voice recorder, a stopwatch, FM radio, and a camera (stills and moving video).Cons:* The camera works well in standard or bright light, but it's not good at low light levels. Also, it doesn't have a zoom. So I would say the Nokia 6101 camera is substandard compared to most cameras in phones and most digital cameras.* After you stop pressing keys, the phone's lighted screen stays on between 10 seconds and 30 seconds depending on your menu level. Then everything goes black. You have to push a key (any key) to get the light back on. There is no way to adjust this (that I have found). This is a nuisance when you're learning how to use the phone, but it's not a big deal when you're familiar with the menus and quickly clicking through the various menus.I have read comments here that say the phone is cheaply made, or is cheap looking. I disagree. It has a sleek silver and black outer case, and it seems reasonably sturdy. The buttons have a nice firm feel. But of course, it is a tiny lightweight phone (only 3.4 ounces). The casing is made of thin plastic and (I suppose) the back cover flanges could crack if the back cover were to be removed roughly or forced incorrectly into position. So...um... Don't do that. The phone should hold up well to standard handling.It works as advertised. It was worth the price. I'm satisfied.
I read all reviews here before I bought this phone. After I read the review I did have some concern since some reviews are really not good.Finally I still decided to get one because I trust Nokia.Now I have used this phone for three months, I LOVE IT Absolutely. Now I'd like to give my own comments.First of all, some reviews are really NOT reasonable, they complain there's no bluetooth on this phone, come on, before you buy, you should know this is NOT a bluetooth phone, right? then why complain? You also can complain this is not a PDA phone even there's bluetooth.This phone is not metal finished, so comared with a metal-finished phone, it looks like it's not that good, but this phone is well made. I used it for three months, it's still like new, no chipping off.This phone's voice quality and volume is good. Some guy complain it's not clear. Actually you need to put this phone on the right position, not too below your ear, then everything it's ok. We all get used to our own phones, after you buy a new phone, you need to adjust your habbit a little. After several days use, I can put the phone on the right position without any problem.Some guy complained this phone is difficult to use, for example, he need to press 6 times to reach 'silent' option. This is absolutely wrong. That's only original setting. This phone provide quite flexible personalized menu button option. You can re-define those button's funtion. It's very useful.Your can re-define those 4 navigation button (left,right,up, down) to any funtion you like so they provide 1-click access. For example, I define my 4 buttons as 'alarm clock, calculator, games,phone book'. You also can refine that "Goto" menu, both the contents and order. I define my 'goto' menu as 'meeting, normal, missed call, recevied calls....' since these are frequent function I use. You even can define that 'exit' button ( the button just on the right bottom of the screen) which seldom phones provide re-define for it. After you take a while to define these buttons, you will feel this phone is just right and convinient for you.Don't feel reception problem.The alarm clock funtion is fantastic. It provides 'graduate' wake up which means it increases the alarm sound gradually so that you won't be shocked. Plus I define it as 1-click funtion, now this is my favorite alarm clock. Easy to set.gentle for use.Image and video quality are vivid. Radio function is excellent.Then why don't I give it 5 star rating?Radio function need headset be pluged even you want to listen it from speaker. This is at least inconvient to me since I seldom bring the headset.Background light always turns off automatically if you don't press any key for several seconds. I can't find any way to make it on constantly.This is really inconvient, sometimes I can't keep pressing key since I'm reading the games help or just look at those pictures.BTW, I bought it from TMOBILE prepaid and then unlock it easily myself. I found the shortcut menu to "voice mail box" still stick to the prepaid phone number. THere's no way to change it. so now if I want to listen to my mail box, I have to dial my phone number, not just press "voice mail" menu.
[...]To unlock this phone...  go the site, in the DCT4 menu type in the IMEI of you nokia 6101 or 6102. Then pick USA - T-mobile as a provider for 6101 or Cingilar Orange for 6102. In GEN menu select "original". In the model menu "asic 2". Press get code. turn the phone on without sim or with wrong sim, enter the first code to unlock.

This phone is a great phone to have.  It has so many great features, and it also has great reception wherever I go.  I have had this phone for over a month now, and it has not yet once done anything weired to me or anything to question it's value.  There are some cons to this, but not a lot.Pros:Great reception (better than most other phones).Videos are very decent quality.Pictures are very decent quality.Includes an fm radio that sounds great.The fm radio can be either listend to on headphones or on it's loudspeaker.The loudspeaker on calls is very loud if you want it to be.The loudspeaker can be used with the phoned closed.The phone has a very sleak design.The ringtone of the phone can be set to be very loud.There is basically a personnal planner in the phone.You can record messages or other things.Theres a timer that can be set off at a certain time.And there are many other more features that are great on this phone.Now for some of the Cons.This phone does not have a desirable amount of memory for it to hold too much.  It is compatible with mp3 ringtones and videos and all that stuff, but you come with only about 2.5 megabites, so the memory on this phone isn't that good.This phone also has to have the headset in no matter what if you want the radio to play, even if you are playing the fm radio on the loudspeaker.The material for this phone feels kinda like cheap plastic.  I don't necessarily know if it is that durable, I mean I have dropped it many times so far and it hasn't broke yet, but I don't know still if it is able to resist a fall on concrete.  I make sure it is in a cover for it most of the time just in case.This is about it for this phone.  In my oppinion, this is a great phone and I would still want this over almost any other phone.  But, if your the kinda guy who needs more than 3 megabites of memory or like to drop your phone constantly on concrete, this phone might not be for you.
If you are looking for a phone with lots of cool features this one is not for you.PROs- Great reception- Looks niceCONs- No Bluetooth- Average camera
Overall I think this is a pretty good phone.  This is my first experience in owning a camera phone, I just upgraded from my motorola v66.  I primarily chose this phone because it has my favorite feature... voice activation dialing (which comes in handy if you are driving).I rated the phone 4 stars because it is fairly simple to use and easy to setup.  I was virtually able to setup all of the features I wanted (personal wallpaper, screen savers, ring tones, caller id, voice activation) without even opening the user's manual.  The reception is as just as good if not better than my old phone and I can hear people clearly on the other end of the line.Now the room for improvement:-The pictures are often grainy unless you have BRIGHT lighting (such as sunlight).  Because this is my first camera phone I don't know if this is normal or subpar (use a real camera if you want nice pictures).-The downloadable ring tones do not sound as clear on the phone as they do when you sample them on the website (perhaps websites should lessen the quality of their sound?).-The navigational buttons take some getting used to.  It is basically a square within a square, but it can be confusing because the TOP left and right hand corners on the square button correlate with the BOTTOM left and right hand corners of the screen respectively.  Perhaps this won't bother you too much, but it is constantly tripping me up (it seems to me bottom corners on button should correlate with bottom corners on screen).-The most annoying feature to me of all (some may see this as a plus) is that the screen does not reset itself to the main screen when you flip the phone shut.  If you are somewhere deep into the menus of the phone, you must remember to push a button to clear the screen before you close the phone, otherwise when you open the phone hours later, it is still on the same detailed screen you were on last time as opposed to the main screen (like I said, some people may like this feature... I hate it).Because these quirks are minor and probably personal, I do recommend this phone to others.
If you're already accustomed to Nokia phones you can probably ignore this review.  If you've used other phones, buyer beware . . .I've used an older Samsung phone for the past five years.  Archaic in terms of current features.  Then I upgraded and even changed providers.  My first new phone was a Samsung E335.  It was easy to use, the screens were crisp and clear, and it accepted standard accessories (e.g. a 2.5mm headset).  Unfortunately, I was forced to change it because Samsung, according to a T-Mobile rep, has only recently begun to use internal antennas (which the 335 has) and the phone just has far too weak a signal for my needs.So then came the Nokia 6101.  It has fantastic reception.  And it's about as intuitive to use, at times, as DOS or Windows 3.1.  Menu items are not logically placed and it frequently takes multiple buttons to get to a single feature.  The navigation buttons at the top are frustrating to use.  They basically consist of a square within a square.  This frequently results in hitting the wrong button.  The screens, while working fine, are also not nearly as clear as what I've seen on other phones I've used.After using the Samsung E335 (and phones others own - an older C225 and an unknown Motorola) I feel like I'm walking through quicksand to get where I'm going.  This perception was further confirmed by Consumer Reports which recently rated several dozen phones . . . they ranked Samsung, Motorola and other phones as being "very good" in terms of ease of use while they only ranked Nokia "good."  Wished I had seen the article before purchasing!Perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of this phone is Nokia's proprietery accessory connection.  You can't just go down to the eletronics store or dept. and pick up any ol' 2.5mm headset.  You have to have one that works specifically with Nokia.  If you're into the kind with an expandable mike that comes around your face (the kind you might see operators or telemarketers using) you might be out of luck.  I've yet to find one that will fit the 6101.On the good side, I get access to FM radio, a feature I really really wanted.  As for the low-res video, I didn't really need it.  The camera is just average.  This phone also has tri-band coverage which makes it fairly flexible.  Still, I'm not sure if this phone is worth the hassle.  If I had found a Samsung or Motorola that had the features and price I had wanted I would get rid of the 6101 in a heartbeat.
This review comes after a full month of hunting through the phone trying to figure things out.  And secondly, I'm using this phone coming from a Motorala V300.Pros:Phone is light and easy to carry.When in a menu if you close and reopen the phone, your position is saved.  I kind of like this.Love the Voice Message (not voicemail, but 1 minute messages you can send to users)Radio quality is nice.Emoticons available for text messaging.Cons:About the other users that claim that the sound quality is bad or that it is hard to hear:  I must say, you do need to carefully position the speaker to your ear.Loudspeaker quality was somewhat lacking and could be louder (but I don't really use speaker phone much).  MP3 ring tones transfered from my V300 sound like crap.Screen is also smaller than V300Menu animations are "cartoony" and of lower quality.And my number one pain with this phone: NO IN CALL TIMER????  Please, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I've searched and searched and found nothing.  Is this phone only for the rich?  Some of us need to know how long we've been on the phone during a call.All in all, a phone is a phone.  All depends on what you do with it.  If you're coming from a V300 like myself, you may want to look for another phone.  But, it's acceptable for me.
This is my 3rd Nokia phone. My first two phones were the candybar style, then I tried the V300 from Motorola, then decided to give Nokia another try. The Nokia/T-Mobile combination is the best by far. I have notice a great improvement in clarity since switching from my Motorola. I had AT&T; (Cingular) with my two Nokia candybar phones so I definitely think T-Mobile and Nokia together make a difference.Likes:-Easy to use buttons-Camera with night mode-Large display-Sleek designDislikes:-Handsfree headset that came with it (I can always hear an echo, maybe I'm not using it right?)-Video (does not have night mode so videos are dark)-Ringtones (limited selection)-Hard to see missed calls or received messages on outside display. There's a tiny little icon but if the display is not lit up then its hard to see it.Haven't tried the FM radio yet so I can't comment on that feature.Overall, I am pretty happy with the phone. I had a problem a week ago where on some of my outgoing calls, the volume would drop and people would sound far away so I called T-Mobile and they "reset" my phone so it would find the nearest tower. The issue has only happened once since then so I'm still in the process of troubleshooting to see if it's my SIM card or the phone itself.
I got this phone when I signed up for tmobile and still am pleasently surprised.Design:  The Nokia 6101 is arguably the most attractive phone on the market. The glossy black with silver colloring and the mirrored surfaces on the outside give this phone an amazing, eye-catching design. Open up the phone and the interior is nearly perfect with the well spaced and very symmetrical keys. Though other than the number keys nothing is labeled, it gives the inside of the phone a very simple and attractive look. The keys are a tad slippery and not the most tactile but the phone in general is nearly perfect in terms of looks.Screens:  The external screen is one of the biggest on the market, but on the downside it only shows a little more than 4000 colors and is awfully grainy and washed out. It does do a good job acting as a self portrait display, making the entire screen your viewfinder. Another downside is when you set the photo caller ID, it only displays a tiny little picture of your caller which you can barely recognize.  The internal screen is a perfect size for the size of the phone. It too is kind of grainy and washed out but it is is also one of the easiest to see in sunlight. It does the job but isn't great.Camera:  The picture quality is a little sub par, not really all that crisp and vivid, but there a lof of extra features so you can edit and play with the pictures which is a huge plus. There are several choices for the sizes of the pictures but with the shared memory of the phone goes quickly with everything you do, so a lower setting on the camera may help.  The video scores some points for being able to record more than 16 sec, but the quality yet again isn't perfect, and when it is sent to a computer the quality is pretty crappy. However it does the trick on the phone.Extras:  The addition of the speakerphone is very welcome, and the quality is pretty good. But personally I felt that the volume was a little low on the speaker when in the car, but it does the trick perfectly if you are just sitting at home.  The FM radio is a welcome addition, even though an MP3 player would be way more desireable. You can preset 20 stations and really the reception is very good given that the phone is small and already pretty featured packed. On the downside, the sound quality is not perfect and the earphones are pretty uncomfortable, and unfortunately since it requires the earphones to get the reception, you can't get another pair.Pros: Amazing, eye-catching design that is sleek, light and attractive. Speakerphone and an FM radio. Large external display.Cons: Displays are a little washed out. Uncomfortable earphones for the FM radio, no MP3 player. Shared memory goes fast.Overall: Great design in and out, with a decent speakerphone and other features, even though the screens are lackluster.
This phone is packed with features from the camera to the radio, but when it comes to storage it's not that reliable. I find myself frequently deleting unneeded games, wallpapers, and ring-tones to make room for more. Also, I got it in October and last month the screen froze similar to a computer and now it's simply un-useable. So, let me lay it out flat. It's a gorgeous phone and easy to love but, if I were you I'd look a little more before settling.
I upgraded my phone two months ago from a Motorola V300 to this model because I wanted a radio and a larger keypad. After one month, the radio no longer worked, the battery dies when it claims to be fully charged, it takes three tries to get it to connect when making a call, and sometimes the phone just freaks out and resets itself while you're in the middle of texting or surfing the web. It's flimsy. I've had my V300 for two years and everything still works on it. The Nokia 6101 has a lot of issues.
Coming from the "freebie" phone that Verizon gave us - a LG 4400 - this phone, the Nokia 6101, is a letdown.  I expected more from Nokia.I have only had this phone three days so far.  The phone functionality seems to work good, I can hear fine, and it has good signal strength and whatnot.  So that is all OK.  The form factor is nice.  It is a pretty good size, and seems pretty durable.  The black does show fingerprints/smudges easily.But I have a couple big problems.1. The backlight doesn't stay on long enough, and even in a brightly lit room it is impossible to see the screen when the backlight goes off.  There is no way to increase the backlight timeout - and there is no easy keey to press that will turn the backlight back on without possibly messing up what you are doing.  On my *free* LG phone I could change the timeout to a longer value, or disable it all together leaving the light on all the time (hurting battery life obviously).2. There is no quick way to switch into or out of silent mode.  You can set shortcut keys, but not for silent mode.  So to go into or out of silent mode you have to:  Open the phone, press "Go-To", Scroll down 4 times, and press "Select".  That is open the phone and press 6 keys - to do what I could do with one external keypress on my *free* LG flip phone.And finally, like all Nokia Series 40 phones, there is no Macintosh support.  Nokia does not support the Macintosh, and Apple iSync does not yet support series 40 phones, and none of the third party products yet supports the 6101...
This is a great phone.  The basic features are easy to use, the buttons are a useful size.The phone is very small and light, and the battery performs well.This one came with a recharge dongle that allowed me to reuse my old Nokia recharger on this phone as a spare.The extra features are brilliant.  Camera works easily and takes little movies.  I really like the radio too.For the money I think this is the best phone around at the moment (2006).
this was my first t-mobile to go phone, thought it was great for the first 2 months then things started wrong with it camera was first then it started saying memory was full, i deleted stuff but no use, so took took it back. Once again another CRAPYPhone by Nokia. DONT BUY THIS PHONE , not worth the money.
This was my first cell phone, and I had it for a full 3 months until a homeless person stole it from me. If I ever saw that man again, I would thank him. I hated this phone so much, but I could never justify buying a new one since I already had this one. First of all, my main complaint with this phone was the lack of memory. I had a total of 5 ringtones downloaded, 1 video, and 6 pictures on my phone. It was so annoying that everytime I wanted to take a new picture or send a picture message I would get a "Memory Full" message. Second of all, it's not possible to put an individualized ringtone for a certain person on your contact list. To do this, you must first create a new group, and then add the person to the group, and then choose a ringtone for that group. This of course takes up more memory!! Another complaint I had with this phone was that the backlight would automatically go off after 10 seconds of inactivity. This got to be a nuisance, and there was no way to change it as far as I could tell. Also the vibration feature of this phone is very weak.It practically has to be pressed up against your skin for you to even feel it. This caused me to miss a lot of calls and text messages. Speaking of which, when a call is missed it will just say "1 missed call" but it wont say from who. Then you have to go to your missed call list just to see who it was. The same goes for when you receive a text message. One thing that I did like about this phone however, was that it rang very loud. You could easily hear it in a crowded area. So in conclusion:Pros:Rings LoudlyCons:Low MemoryHorrible VibrationLow quality camera and even worse videos.Text message autocomplete is horribleLow Memory ( I know it's here twice. but that's just how bad it is)I've never been happier with my Samsung t509
I bought this phone in hopes of overcoming a weak T-Mobile signal. I couldn't use my old cell phone at all at my office and a few other places I frequent. The Nokia 6101 was definitely a good purchase to meet my needs. I can now sit at my desk at work and have a conversation without any problem! It also has many of the "extras" that people have come to expect today - camera, radio, voice dialing, loudspeaker, etc. My only complaints: the loudspeaker feature can be activated only after you have placed a call and the radio works only if you plug in a headset that acts as an antenna.
I got this phone from T-mobile for free last week. I tried to find out how to make sound lounder. I barely hear when I talk on the phone. I went back to the store to find out what's wrong with it and they said it's normal. It's easy to tell that this phone is lower than normal if you compare with another cell phone in the same price. So far this phone on froze 4 times. I'm thinking to take it back with in this week. I would rather pay more money to get a phone that you can hear when you talk and don't have to take battery out when the screen is frozen.
Much better reception than the one I replaced - Nokia 3595.  I got no bar with 3595 but 4 bars with 6101.  Camera is OK, just a VGA. The clock digits on the front panel is too small though. New battery runs 7 days on standby.
Hi there,  we have had this phone for 8 months and the molding around the front face plate &  around the atenna has come undone ( both my phone and my husbands) Which means now we have multiple dropped calls and no signal half the time. Went to T-mobile for this problem and they stated that they would consider this a physical damage and not replace it, but For a $100 ea. phone we could upgrade.  Well we didn't expect our phones to come undone in 8 mos. and we don't have an extra couple hundred dollars to just go ahead and upgrade,  POOR customer service from T-MOBILE.
Don't buy this phone! Yeah it's free on tmobile.com but the phone is raggedy. This is Nokia's worse phone they ever made! The phone be cutting off by itself for no reason. The memory is low and the ringtones are loud and sometimes unclear. The camera doesn't show up clearly and then the battery goes down quick if you have it on vibrate. Also, you have to put the phone earpiece on your ear in the right place or you can't hear the other person. I never used the ugly headset. Just don't buy this [...]
I have done my research on this phone for about a month before purchasing it. And I am vdry glad that I researched and bought the phone.Now, yes, I have only had the phone for 2days but it hasn't been acting up yet! It has a very sleek look on the outside and on the inside. Very modern looking. But as soon as you go thru the MENUS it isn't the same story. NOKIA has kept their old traditional screen-look. Which to me, is very 80s looking. The colors are just not enough to make it look digital enough as a product! And the navigation is a bit "weird" when first dealing with the phone.I absolutely love the FM radio feature on this phone. The radio was what really attracted me to the phone so that explains why I'm so entusiastic[sp?] about it. This NOKIA  phone gives you a bit of an inside scoop on the new additional features phones are going to come out with. [e.g- music videos, phone themes, etc.]The camera takes decent pictures for it being a camera PHONE.Some things that DO "suck" about the phone though, is that the backlight doesn't stay on for very long. And thats a tad bit annoying; but I'm glad that it saves battery power! I used this phone for the past 2days and haven't had to charge it but once! YAY , NOKIA!!Personalization is SO much fun on this phone! There are so many ways into making this phone "one-of-a-kind."As far as the headset, it wasn't a problem with me cause T-MOBILE supplied it in the box it came in, even though the wire is a bit long and ugly looking. (lol)The phone is light-weight and the material seems durable enough! Haven't dropped it yet though.Well, until further notice this is a very good buy!
I just wanted to leave a comment to the user who said you coudln't get faceplates for this phone and if you did you'd have to use a tool to take the phone apart and what not, this is not so, You can get snap on faceplates which require no tools at all.
I got this phone knowing some of the bad reviews. Being my first cell phone. I didn't think I'd mind so much. At first it was great, perfect for me.However, 4mb of memory is so little... all the features get more annoying.It serves my needs still until I can upgrade. Now starts to freeze...I do like the size, and menus (they aren't THAT bad to navigate) and displays are nice to customize. It isn't a terrible phone, but not great.ALL PHONES have their quirks people range so much in reviews... and any phone can die even the best always a few rotten apples in the bunch. This phone was good for me as a first cell phone when I didn't need all the features and memory I would like now...So I won't knock more stars off because I outgrew it, but it does have it's issues and annoyances. Definitely not a phone for more advanced users or people who like features, and as for FM radio cool idea I used to use it... but since getting an MP3 player really haven't touched that feature.
I HAVE HAD THIS CELL PHONE FOR ABOUT A MONTH. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT YET AND DONT HOPE TO. THIS IS MY SECOND CELLPHONE, AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN MY SONY ERICSON T637. I DID NOT GET THIS PHONE ON AMAZON, I WOULD NOT PAY SOO MUCH ON THIS SITE FOR THIS PHONE. I GOT MY 6101 FOR FREE FROM WALMART, YES WALMART YOU'D THINK THEY DONT HAVE GOOD PHONES BUT THEY DO.PROSGREAT RECEPTION ( TMOBILE IS GREAT)LOUD SPEAKERPHONEVOICE RECORED (WHICH YOU CAN USE AS A RINGTONE)VIDEO RECORDERPREETY GOOD CAMERA ( BETTER THAN MY SONY ERICSON)LOUD RINGTONESLARGE SCREENSLARGE KEYPADEASY NAVIGATION, EASY TO USECONSLIGHT TURNS OFF AFTER LIKE 15 SEC AND THERES NO WAY TO CHANGE IT, ANNOYING AT TIMES.DOESNT FEEL THAT DURABLE, BUT DOESNT FEEL FRAGIL SO I GOT A CASE FOR MINE JUST IN CASE.YOU HAVE TO PRESS LIKE 6 KEYS BEFORE YOU GET TO THE SILENT BUTTONTHE INTERNAL SCREEN DOES NOT RESET ITSELF AFTER YOU CLOSE THE PHONE, THE SCREEN IS THE SAME AFTER YOU OPEN IT LIKE 2 HOURS LATER WHICH IS VERY VERY ANNOYINGALL IN ALL THIS IS A GREAT BEGINNER PHONE (FOR THE PRICE I GOT IT FOR.)
THis phone will torture you to the death! THe keys rust really easily, it is amazingly SUCKY! and is $150?!?!?!?!?!?!?!WHO THE HECK WOULD BUY THIS??????Call quality SUX!
I bought this phone in March of 2006 and had to have it replaced in June 2006 because it just simply died. The replacement phone is no better, the charger works for about 3 weeks and then you have no other choice but to purchase another because it just simply stops working. I am so disappointed with this phone and I do not recommend that your waste you money on it. I am sorry that I did.
I have owned the Nokia 6101 since late October 2005. I absolutely love it!!! I wouldn't trade it for the world. My boyfriend even wanted me to trade it tom get a Motorola Razr V3 like he has, which does have it's own set of great perks, but I love my phone. There are a few games on there (with room to download), the camera quality has great clarity, the FM radio works perfectly (and is a great passer of time), and it has great reception on T-Mobile's GSM network. You can also use the recorder to record your own ringtones. It's great!!!!
I received this phone yesterday and just couldn't wait to use it based on past great experices with other Nokia phone.However.....After the first couple hours of exploring it.....I found this "cool" Nokia flip phone has poor sound quality while I was driving on the highway.....I tried to talk to friends both with and without headset.....they couldn't hear me that well....not as my old Sanyo 8100, which has perfect crystal clear sound even I was driving during the windy days....it doesn't have anything to do with the reception (as other Nokia phones, the reception is great), everyone I asked all responded that I should get a different phone....If you normally don't use the phone while you're driving....then this is a great phone to have but if you're a person like me who like to talk to friends even when you're on freeway.....please think twice.....
I thought it was a pretty good nuts and bolts phone.room for improvement.1. speaker needs to be louder.2. the headset of all things shouldn't sound like a tin can.My phone died after 2 months.  I found condensation on the inside.  I work in and outside alot but the phone never got wet.  I have to believe it was the condensation that killed it.  The interior of the phone is not sealed.
I like this phone. It's my first camera phone, so I don't have too much to compare it to. The picture quality is ok, but it is a camera PHONE.
I've had several of Nokia's phones before and have never been disappointed with them until now.  When using the hands-free headset, whoever I was talking to sounded liked they were talking into a tin can.  Since I use the hands-free set the majority of the time I'm on the phone, this was a big problem.  The other problem I found was that the phone did not have a very powerful vibrate mode.  I sometimes did not even hear it when it was sitting on my desk next to me.  The one plus of the phone (other than Nokia's easy-to-use menus) is that's it's very light and compact.  Because of the problem with the hands-free set, I had to exchange it for a Motorola V360.  This phone is a bit heavier, but has much better sound quality and vibrate mode.
I've had this phone less than a month and the finish is already chipping off. You have to position it perfectly on your ear in order to hear properly. Other than that's, it's been ok. It just seems very cheaply made.
How do I start ?OK, let me just start by saying that If I were the handset test engineer for this product, I would have hung myself for passing off this substandard handset through the Quality Assurance process.T-Mobile let me upgrade my old Sony Ericsson T-610 with this crap. Good Reception and a decent camera are the only redeemable features. Voice quality sucks. It is inaudible even when there is pin drop silence in the surroundings. Switching over to the Loudspeaker blurrs the audio. No Bluetooth connectivity. Headset quality is poor. This handset doesnt seem to have any games as well. The screen fonts are archiac and tasteless.The Address book has different options for a new contact, such as Home, Cell, Work and General. By default a new contact number will be stored as General. Will somebody tell me what a General phone is ? Additionally, you can have any number of Mobile / Home/ Work numbers for a single contact and this crap wont even throw up an error message. Further, when you click on the name of a contact, his/her name appears twice in the next screen along with the phone number. Why should the name appear twice? What a waste of memory!! Also, it is painful to see "My Album" and "My Journal" being listed as defaults in the contact list.The Call listing feature is pathetic. If you want to see your recent call list, you will have to click three different buttons: One for the calls you placed, one for the calls you've received and one for the calls you've missed.Suppose you add a new number to your contact list, the call list does not automatically update the new contact. So the call list will continue to show the numbers instead of the contact name.Further, if you set your phone on the 'Silent' mode and would like to change it to Normal, you actually get a whole bunch of options including 'Silent'. Why does anybody want to switch from Silent mode again to Silent mode!! If you examine the handset you will find numerous such instances of redundancy and memory wastage. The programmers who developed the software for this handset ought to be fired!Additionally, the key pad is not user friendly. The Sent messages item does not save any of your sent messages by default. Furthermore, when you type a message you wont know how to enter the special characters since the screen does not offer you any clue. You will have to figure your way out. Let me give out the secret. You will have to press the * key to enter any special character.Not worth upgrading to this phone and definately not worth buying. You probably are better off with other phones.
its a great phone and i have no complaints about it
This phone is awesome and has great features!! I have had it for a year and it hasn't given me a problem ONCE!! The ringtones are AWESOME!! The camers quality is great and it has cool games that are fun that you can order. This phone really lets you show your style with features that let you pick your phone colors and online shopping for ringtones and wallpaper! It lets you adjust the phone volume AND ringtone volume to your liking and the t-zones online shop has all the best artists and songs that gets everyone dancing, like Rihanna, Chamillionare and A LOT MORE!!!! So, if you want a reliable phone that lets you personalize and just be you, with so many cheap plans to choose from, then you should get the Nokia 6101 Phone ( which is T-Mobile of course!) because it's the best!!
We upgraded our phones right after Christmas and bought 2 RAZR's and 2 SE z520a's.  My sons love their phones.  My daughter and I loved ours, too, for about 2 weeks!As much as we hate to, we've boxed them up to send back to Cingular.  They are great phones as long as long as they are working.  My daughter first noticed she was missing calls.  She said the phone would vibrate without ringing and when she tried to answer it she could not hear nor be heard.  Since it only happened a couple of times and this phone had good reviews, I didn't worry about it.  Then I noticed there were times I would be talking to someone and then couldn't hear them, although the call timer was still running.  I wanted to believe that Cingular was having some service problems and then it happened.  I noticed my phone with it's cool lights dancing and realized that I didn't hear a ring.  I popped it open to answer and got dead air.  Isn't it funny how it's always worse when it happens to you?  Well, this was serious.I immediately went to the Cingular forums and found lots of frustrated people wanting help with these phones, most having the same problems with them.  Those complaints weren't there when I ordered our phones.  I saw today that Cingular has pulled the z520a from their sales site.Some people believe that a memory leak is the cause.  They have suggested powering down the phones each day.  That didn't work for us.  We put the call into Cingular, boxed up our really cute phones and are now waiting for the labels to ship them back.  The new sim cards work great in our old phones.  They will just have to do until Cingular puts an improved version of the Z520a or something equally cool up for sale.  Something that will match the functions of the RAZR without the blocky width and it needs lights that help you find it in the bottom of a purse.  I miss my defective phone!
first and foremost, i'm a gadget geek so i REALLY researched phones before deciding on one. i bought this phone about a week ago and have been testing out every feature on it. i really spent a lot of time reading reviews on various phones - read all the various reviews on amazon and cnet as well as other gadget sites. the 520a was cheap, had bluetooth, was a flip phone, and didn't have one of those annoying antennas which stick out. i also have a powerbook and this phone syncs beautifully if you have a bluetooth enabled mac.pros --i really like the look and feel of the phone.-i like "sexy" gadgets and this definitely meets my standards-can't beat all the features i got for only 39 bux from cingular-it's sturdy and just the right weight so that i don't drop it.-i don't like the hinge to be too easy to open because sometimes i like to hook the phone on my jeans pocket for easy access.-bluetooth worked great to sync up the calendar, tasks and contacts on my powerbook.-features were relatively easy to learn after being a nokia user for 6 years.-large number of ring tones.-able to have mp3 ringtones and customize ringtones for certain callers.-shortcuts allowed me to do some customization for features I use more often.-great camera features - panoramic pics, video-quadband allows for better reception in my house (all my friends have problems with reception in my house - it must be all the lead in the walls =P  )-love, love, love being able to check the % battery life and my day's appointments on the external screen with the touch of a button.cons --sensitive camera button (like you've seen on every review)-my old phone had digital and analog. so before i had worse reception, but i had warning when it was going to cut out since i would start hearing static. now i get no warning when my call will be dropped. however overall reception is still 80% better. I used to not be able to pick up  my phone at all on the first floor. now i have no problem.-i was used to a candy bar phone before so i'm getting used to the whole flip phone thing.-vibrate isn't as loud as my old phone (i used to be able to hear my old phone rattle in my backback or my purse. can't hear this phone)-battery life is not as long as they advertise, but it's longer than my old phone. i lasted 4 days on my last charge with heavy use. i talk at least an hour a day and i was learning the phone so i was playing with all the features.overall, great phone. haven't had any technical problems with the phone. i had one of the boxes with the little yellow dot so that means the firmware was upgraded. very happy with my purchase! the only other phones i would rather have cost hundreds more. i'll be upgrading in 2007 when i can afford to pay more (i'm in grad school right now). in 2007 they will be much smaller (less # parts) and have many more features.
I recently purchased this phone and have only had it for a couple of weeks but am already thinking about exchanging it.  I was attracted by the quad band technology and outstanding talk and standby times.  I'm not the type who's swayed by Bluetooth, downloadble sounds and all that.  At the end of the day a cellular phone is still a phone, first and foremost.  While I sort of like the overall design, this phone has some nagging problems which should never have slipped through Sony Ericsson's design team.  For one, the keypad is too cramped and navigating through menus and icons requires too much attention.  You think you're pressing an arrow key and you end up making a phone call.  The buttons are too small.  There's no room on this phone for someone with large hands/fingers, and forget using this phone if you're elderly or unfamiliar with technology in general.  But... the MOST nagging problem of all is the large, sensitive camera button.  It is almost impossible to hold this phone without taking a picture accidentally.  My son-in-law has the Z500a and though it's really close in design, that phone is larger, has more room for fingers, and a much less sensitive phone button.  You'll be holding the phone, thinking you're checking your voicemail, or making a call, and suddenly you hear the shudder click!  It's absolutely maddening, and there's no way to disable the camera!  I'll try it for another week and then I may return it.  Until then, I can not in good conscience recommend this phone.  Thanks.
Pros:- Interface is well done- Easy to transfer themes, MP3 ringtones, contacts, etc. via Bluetooth- Sony software makes it easy to create your own themes with their software- Was very simple to configure as a modem for my iBookCons:- Early version had a software bug that required the phone be restarted every couple of days (fixed February of '06)- Camera button cannot be locked, and often goes off in pocket (until the memory is full, then it's no longer a problem)
I bought this phone in April and I must say don't buy a phone on looks alone. Though I love the phone the most annoying thing is I get almost to no signal anywhere inside buildings and sometimes outside the phone will just cut out due to no signal.Besides the signal problem this phone is great - mine came with a free bluetooth headset and 2 free face plates, one of which is furry to touch. You can buy faceplates separately, which is a nice change to only Nokia phones getting them.The phone itself has many settings and allows you to go on the Internet and download songs, sounds, themes, music, games, videos and much more.Some things that are special to this phone include changing how the light glow around the phone, a MusicDJ, a VideoDJ, PhotoDJ, world clock, remote control, media player, camera and infrared port.You have other average settings like calendar, alarms, scheduler, themes, master reset, sound recorder, tasks, notes, synchronization, timer, stopwatch, calculator, code memo, profiles, language, shortcuts, speed dial, silent mode, key sound, wallpaper (internal & external), screensaver and brightness.Overall it's a great little phone and I'd recommend it to my friends.
Overall, the phone is good. The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone. The speaker is pretty audible, ringtones understandable.But, one of the disadvantages of it is the Camera/Video button on the left side of the phone. On my phone, the SLIGHTEST touch, will enable the phone's camera, and it will take pictures. My phone has taken well over 120 photos of my pocket, my fingers, blurred scenes and random unintended places. When you answer a call or dial a call, your finger naturally lands near the vicinity of the Camera/Video button. The camera can be enabled DURING a phone conversation, thus it will take pictures after repeated accidental presses on the button.Basically, I would be walking around the house, with the phone in my pocket, and I would hear this shutter noise. Then another, then another, then another. I take out the phone from my pocket, and see the camera enabled. But it was just in my pocket! Solution? Don't touch the button. As far as I know, there is no way to disable, or lock the Camera/Video button on the side of the phone, which, to me, is the main Con factor of this phone.
I am totally in love with this phone. This is the first phone that I could use without worrying if the signal is going to drop. It is so much more reliable and lighter than z500. Plus it's when you change faceplates, you don't have to worry about all the dust and faceplate slipping off. Sure it has a *VERY* sensitive camera button but I find it entertaining to see what pictures I have taken by accident. That's just me but oh well. You can't have your cake and eat it too
I needed a phone with a long battery life and bluetooth. I use it 99% as a phone, so games, text messages, etc was not really a consideration. After about 1/2 year, I can say I am very very happy. Reception is great (SF Bay area, that is a big deal), battery life is amazing, and bluetooth works great. It turned out I love MP3 ring tones - I can use sone nice music now. I had no problems with contact synchronization on bot Windows and a Mac.
I had purchased two Z520a phones, one of which was defective upon receipt.I shipped the phone for warranty repairs.  However, I was without a cell phone for a month because of their lack of response.There seemed to be little to no communication between the warranty repair center and the customer service support.  It was difficult to get any repair information, and the phone was returned to me unrepaired with the statement that the repairs were not under the warranty coverage.Obviously, one less Sony Ericsson customer here.........
I was considering Motorola Razr or this phone, and finally I got this phone from Cingular.  It has so many nice features that I just wonder why I waited so long to get this phone.  The three most useful features:1. Sync with Mac through bluetooth:  I could transfer my contact info and meeting onto the phone automatically.  I don't need a PDA for that anymore.2. I could forward all my emails to the phone, and it could display much more than my previous Nokia 3185.  If I want, I could also email out of the phone, but typing is no fun on the phone keypad.3.  The bluetooth link with Prius is great: The whole phone book could be tranferred to Prius with one click.  The built-in BT in the car link with z520a seamlessly.Only two minor complains about this phone: it's so small and slippery that I dropped the phone a couple times already.  The camera button location is not ideal, could be triggerred by mistake.Overall, a great tiny quad-band phone, and the price is just great.
My wife and I did some online checking before we bought our Sony Ericsson Z520a phones from Cingular. It turns out that we were lucky when we bought them, because we received the phones with the latest firmware upgrade. If you buy this phone and have problems, you need to contact customer service. They will replace your phone.The biggest negative is the camera button. It is very sensitive. A lot of people have complained about it. Apparently there's either a new version, or an international version, that has a spring inside the button that requires a harder press. A firmware upgrade could fix this (require the case to be open, for instance). I'm hoping for this. It doesn't help that the button is positioned so my thumb always wants to push it.On the positive side, it's a light phone with good quality sound. It's sensitive to the direction you point it. I talked to my wife yesterday and the phone cut out a couple of times. On the other hand, the signal quality in our apartment is good, whereas our old Nokia's would cut out entirely. So sometimes the sound cuts out, but in general you have better reception. It plays polyphonic ringtones and MP3s as ringtones. You can get quite a lot of volume out of the ringtones, which is good as our old phones were too quiet (often couldn't hear them ring in another room).The battery life is excellent; the batteries are not. If you use it just as a phone, you should get something close to 10 days on standby. I'm not sure how much time, maximum, you get from talking. The literature says 5 hours, and some reviews have suggested that it's closer to the truth than most companies' marketing information. Unfortunately, the batteries aren't well made. We've had ours replaced twice, each, in two years.The sync cable doesn't come with the device, and it's pretty pricey at $24.95. The software for syncing the phone is free online. I downloaded it, installed it, and within half an hour I was putting MP3s on my phone to use as ringtones without haveing to connect to the internet! When I bought a new laptop with Bluetooth I didn't need the cable anymore.Sony Ericsson also gives you free software for creating your own themes. It takes a little getting used to and lots of trial and error, but in a couple of nights I put together a pretty decent little "Invader Zim" theme on the phone. I have little graphics from the show for everyone on my contacts list.The menu system is easy to use. You can define hotkeys for the four directions of the "browser ring", which is nice.The phones were okay for what we paid, but I'm less than happy with the batteries. Recently my phone has been powering down for no reason, and I can't start it back up until I pull the battery. I suspect that the battery is dying again. I'd get it replaced, but it's no longer under warranty, so I'm going to find a replacement phone.I originally rated the phone as a 4, but I'd now rate it as 3.
I got this phone and several of the buttons did not work properly after one day. I went back to the store and they gave me a new one, which works much better. When you first flip open the phone, the screen blips for a second but is okay. The backgrounds that work for the main screen and outside screen are nice, and the antenna is much cooler than the original ones. It has nice features and pretty good in the menu category, although some of the features are hard to find in the menus. The battery life is wonderful and the changeable plates are nice, too! All in all, a pretty good phone.
After reading the reviews here on Amazon I had mixed feelings on whether to get this phone or not.  There are some very positive reviews and some strongly negative ones.  I went ahead and got it and I LOVE THIS PHONE.  Its just pefect. Small and light and easy to use and lots of features.  Excellent reception and voice quality and a good user interface.  I havent had any problems with the camera taking pictures ont its own.  Not once have I had to delete any inadvertent pictures.You do have to use the sony headset or one compatible with the Sony Ericsson models.  You cant just use a generic pair of headphones.  Buy a set on e-bay if you want some wired headphones to use with it.I am glad I got this model and would choose it again.
I was looking for a phone to make decent phone calls.  That's all I wanted.  I didn't need to watch tv or use the internet or any of that fancy stuff.  I just wanted a sturdy phone with good quality sound and good reception.This phone is it!  The buttons are large enough that I don't have to use my fingernail to press the buttons, EVERYTHING is customizable.  For every contact, you can add a picture, seperate ringtone AND a different light effect!  You can also customize the ouside/inside/startup screens & a screensaver.The camera is good and the reception is great for my area ((central PA)).  The call volume is loud and clear ... and so are the ringtones!!  The phone is also very lightweight.  So far, my battery life is excellent too.I must say, I am very impressed with this phone.  I traded it in after dealing with a crappy LG7200 for a month.  I'm glad I did.
Even if you're careful, you might occasionally drop your phone. My previous phones were able to survive a few drops. I dropped this one ONCE, and the screen died. Before that, it worked fine.
I LOVE this phone. Who cares about what EDGE is?I bought the bluetooth headset, as well as the Bluetooth dongle for the PC. I can drag & drop ANY mp3 from my machine directly to the phone for a ringer. I can also drag & drop ANY image to the phone for a background image on the inside or outside of the phone. My favorite part is that I can record my phone conversations, and drag them to the PC, and listen to them with RealPlayer (A cruddy program, but the recordings are GREAT!)
Ok, I am going to make this really short.  I have dropped this phone out of my pocket 20 feet onto a wood deck.  Still worked.  I have left it outside in the snow for a few hours in Indiana during a January winter, and it worked.  I recently had this phone go through a Washer, and 90 minute Dryer cycle (forgot it was in my pants pocket)  I took the battery off, put the battery back on, and presto.. It WORKED!  I hate cell phones, and I can't say much for the customer service a few carriers give to you, but as far as this phone goes... I am going to give it five stars. I can't seem to kill it.  I wonder if it is bulletproof?  If it is, I will write another review.  BUY THIS PHONE!
The phone works great.  I've been getting service in places that my old cell phone has been unable to.  The menu is very easy to understand and simple to navigate -- it's very well laid out and even the novice user can pick up how to use it easily.There are only two things that I found at fault with the phone:- As everyone else has stated, the camera button is extremely sensitive and gets turned on all of the time by accident.- While the neat looped antenna looks aesthetically pleasing, it's slightly annoying because it leans backwards slighty towards the back of the phone.  When you lay the phone flat on its back, it cannot lay flat because the antenna is leaned back so much.  This is no big deal when it's just laying on the table, but when I have it in the pocket of my pants, especially when I'm wearing tight fitting pants, the looped antenna is sticking out the backside of the phone, which makes carrying it in my pocket rather uncomfortable.But aside from those two things, it's a nice phone that works great and gets great reception.
Bought the phone from Cingular and with the exception of the dumb camera button it's a very good phone.  I had just switched from a Nokia, and while I think the Nokia OS is more intuitive, you get used to the SonyEricsson very quickly.I have only one "must have" requirement for a cell phone and that is Synch capability with MS Outlook. This phone has a InfraRed and the set up and synch process is very easy.  It would be nice to have a log of the synch activity like Nokia offer but at least the Sony doesnt delete contacts randomly like the Nokia used to.Camera button.....well, just how dumb was the designer who thought this up, and forgot the software switch to turn it off.I did have to return my first Z520 when the screen went, but the new phone has a much stiffer button and doesn't turn on the camera or take photos as easily. Much better. I did buy the SE hip holster for this phone and since I did...no more camera problems.Best things about the phone....voice dialing (when paired with a Bluetooth Headset), calendar/contacts synch and the solid feel when it "snaps" open and closed. My wife has the Nokia 6201 and it feels mushy in the open position. The Sony feels nice and secure.Things I wish were better....Camera button, and the Operating System being a little more intuitive.Overall, I love the phone, and with the belt holster, I can live with the camera button.
Most things have already been said about this phone.  It's a good one for the price/class.For all the people complaining about the camera button, buy a bodyglove case for you phone.  Since I did this, I have not had one issue - not one - with the camera button.  The thin edge of the case adds just enough thickness to the side of the phone that the camera button is no longer too easy to accidentally press.
I got the Sony Ericsson Z520a because I really loved the sleek design and it had all of the features of a top of the line modern phone.  Although it does pack a lot of features into a nice design the phone is not as polished as some of its competitors like the Motorola V551.  It is not as customizable as the V551 nor is it as straightforward to use.Plus Points of the Z520a include:- Sleek design with a the antenna made to look like a little handle on top.  It is also far lighter and more compact than the Motorla v551- True quadband phone so it will work anywhere in the world (once you unlock it)- External color display that can be used to view picture caller ID or as a viewfinder for the camera.  It can also display appointment information or phone information.- Bluetooth is easy to use and setup- Cool looking glowing lights around the keypad that light up in different ways when you receive a call.- It has great battery life (far better than the V551) and the charger is a lot more straightforward to use (the v551 requires jiggling and finessing to get it to work).- Some nice game demos are included although they are VERY short and the full version will cost you $7 bucks extra!!**** Negative Points of the z520a include  ****- The external screen has poor resolution (it is not a TFT screen so it is not really usable in direct light or at different angles).- Also the font on the external screen is very small so it is hard to read without concentrating on it.  And the external clock is TOTALLY useless because you cannot read the small font when it is not backlit- The camera button on the side of the phone is EXTREMELY sensitive so you will accidentally push it all the time.  This means that you will have a lot of accidental pictures.- The internal screen is nice but is not as large or as crisp as the screen on the V551 and it has lower resolution than the v551.- The camera is not very straightforward to use.  You have to use the 5 way pad to zoom and the side conrols to adjust brightness.  Plus there are all kinds of other controls like Night mode etc. that are accessed by pushing various numbers on the keypad.  Not very easy to remember at all.- The camera makes a very loud shutter noise when you take a picture and unlike the V551 you cannot turn off this noise or change it.- There are NO dedicated buttons to send or receive (answer or hang up) a call.  You do this by using the multifunction buttons when the option comes up on the screen over the corresponding button.  Also the keypad buttons are all backlit with the same blue color so it is hard to distinguish buttons in a hurry without concentrating on the phone.- There is no way to lock out some of the features you do not use.  For example you cannot lock out the internet or ringtone/game shopping features so if you accidentally push the wrong buttons you will be charged!!  The Motorola gives you full customizability on what features you want to lock out as well as full control over the interface.- The construction seems like it has a bit too much plastic so it might not hold up very well to abuse.- occasionally the phone software gets buggy and the screen blanks out for a few secondsOverall this is not a bad phone but if you really want a phone you can customize to your needs then this is not for you.  It seems like it is geared more for the college age and teenage crowd who value the cool factor over true functionality. I thought I would use this to replace my 7 month old Motorola V551 but instead I am going continue using the old phone and give this to a 20 something sibling who will be more impressed by the flashing lights and less irritated by the ergonomic flaws!!
I just got this phone as an upgrade through cingular. The first thing I loved was the bigger buttons, making it so much easier to dial than my old lg10. It is a little larger too, than my old lg10 and it is easier to grab and hold and talk on. This is one case where size does matter, smaller phones are incredibly difficult to use. I also love the external screen for a quick take on what time it is. Games are fun and easy to download. I like the features that allow you to see calls missed, messages etc. It's all very intuitive and easy to get the hang of. I always read through every manual when I purchase new items. The phone manual was fairly easy to use and helpful, but not actually necessary to read. I also got on ebay and bought a usb cable to connect my phone to my computer (apparently the upgrade phones don't come with cables, extra software etc. just the phone and a battery). So now I can update my calendar, to-do list and contacts straight from Microsoft Outlook. This is very cool, as now I really don't need to carry my Dell Axim around anymore. When I have an upcoming appointment (usually its a reminder to take my daughter to ballet or pick someone up someplace) my phone makes an entertaining little noise and flashes a reminder at me. As a home-schooling mother of 4 children, a store owner and a writer, I need all the help I can get keeping my schedule straight. The only issue I have with this phone is that the screen turns itself off too quickly and there doesn't seem to be any way of resetting it. I think Sony should have left that up to the user. I don't mind having to charge my phone a little more often, but I want the screen to stay on during my calls and not go off until I flip it shut! This is annoying and I hope Sony will update the software on this phone and allow the users to download a patch or something so we can have control over our own screens. Overall, however, I'm happy with the phone, the internet, the camera, the ring tones, and especially the connectivity with my pc. I'm going to wait another two years to get a new phone. I want the next one to play music like an ipod, have features similar to a pda, and do my nails (jusk kidding).
This phone has serious bugs in it. I can't believe it even made it out of the lab.The features are great and all work OK for a while, but before long (8-24 hours) it croaks. So far we've seen 3 things happen: - It stops ringing (it knows there's an incoming call and the lights flash, but it makes no sound), - The mic shuts off (you can make a call, but the person on the other end can't hear anything), or - It just locks up.Each time, it starts working again if you power-cycle it, just to have one of the same problems happen again after a while.Check the various online problem-discussion forums and you'll see that mine is not an isolated case by any means.
First, I'd like to start off by saying that up until about 3 weeks ago, the Z520a had flawed software on it, which is probably the cause of most users' problems. If you take your phone to Cingular they can update the phones with the older software to the newest version.Now, with that said, I have been pleased with the Z520a. It is built solidly, has some good features (Bluetooth, dual color displays, camera) for a very pleasing price. I got the Z520a as kind of a second phone (my main phone is the Nokia 8801) but I have played around with the Z520a for about 2 weeks just to get an impression of it.First, this phone has great reception! Previous Sony Ericssons have had pretty average to poor reception; this one however, even beats out my Nokia! That's very impressive. Call quality is also very good, both using the earpiece and the speakerphone, which has a very large speaker for a cell phone, and that keeps calls (and ring tones) very clear even at maximum volume; there is no distortion.The user interface is among the best I have used, and it's very stable. I will never buy or recommend a Motorola again until they have released their new operating system for phones, as their current OS is terrible and buggy. The Z520a, from Sony Ericsson, however, does not suffer from this, and is very solid and easy to navigate. The internal screen is also easy to read and fairly bright and sharp. It's not the best screen, but it is perfectly acceptable for the price of the phone, and it is an active matrix display, which helps keep it from washing out as much. The external display, though a passive matrix type display, is pretty good and serves its purpose well.Battery life is pretty good, and when you press the up key on the side of the phone, in the run down of details about your phone, it has a battery life percentage as well, so instead of having 1 2 or 3 blocks for judging battery life, you also have an actual percentage, which is nice.Bluetooth works very well, it is easy to use and pair with other devices, and it a fairly advanced implementation, especially for this class of phone, even offering remote control of a computer (when paired to do so). It is also possible to synchronize with Microsoft Outlook on a computer without any special software, just using the standard Bluetooth synch system.Pictures from the built in camera are decent for a camera phone, but overall, they are still pretty poor (as pretty much any camera phone pictures are outside of Asia).There is only one notable fault I could find with the phone, and that is the camera button located on the side of the phone. It is very easy to accidentally press. You do have to press and hold in order to activate it, however, if it's in a pocket or something, that's not necessarily hard to do, so you end up snapping pictures of the black abyss of the inside of your jeans.Otherwise, for the average cell phone user, whose main intent is to make calls, this Z520a is a perfectly wonderful device.
This phone is almost perfect. When we upgraded our Cell one contract to GSM, I went with a RAZR, my wife went with a SE Z500. The error of my ways became apparent within the first day.We live in rural MN, I could give a plugged nickel about my phone functioning as a camera or MP3 player. I have the appropiate toys for these purposes. I do however, want my phone to work well as a phone.. there's a concept.The first day, my wife and I are playing with the new phones and she has great signal anywhere in the house. Meanwhile, me an my RAZR are hugging the windows, looking at the deer and trying to make a call.Two (2) RAZRs later... I could only recieve and make calls if I had a full 5 bars of signal. 4 or less equals "Call Failed". Yes, my wife is calling everyone on her Z500 like its a damn landline. Now, if you live in rural MN, you already know that the only time you are going to get five full bar signal strength is when you strike the cell tower with your car.So...I've had it. I go to my dealer, he tells me about the Z520. I buy it and it is so apparent the this phone rocks. My RAZR sits there with "Emergency Only" on the screen while I use my Z520 and it sounds like a landline. Hello Moto?... you suck dirty socks.Now the con... and it seems so silly that it just has to be an oversight given how well the Z520 functions. Yes, it is the damn camera button that everyone is talking about. At first, I thought these people were placing the clamshell phone in their pocket in the open position. Then reality strikes, if the external shutter button is pressed long enough, it will indeed take a picture of your pocket... like over and over again. How can this be?I still love the reception of this phone for my service area. But the camera thing can and needs to be fixed in a firmware update by Sony Ericsson. If you own this phone, email SE and insist that the make this phone the perfect phone it could be.... Thank you for your support.
The z520a is by far, the best mobile I have ever owned.  Originally, I believed the 16 MB would not be enough, but it turns out to be plenty as long as you upload your pictures and movies every once in awhile onto your computer via bluetooth or IR.The second screen is not only an excellent way to take pictures of yourself (it acts as a "mirror" of sorts), but is also a great way to save battery life if you happen to be an impulsive cell phone checker (checking the external screen saves more battery life than opening and closing the phone), as you can check the time and date, as well as checking if you have missed calls, messages, or voice-mail.The outward antenna isn't an issue at all, but if you're a stickler for looks, it honestly looks fine.  The speaker on the back can handle much abuse as I have mp3 ringtones that use much bass, and the speaker doesn't have any issue playing them.A+ for an excellent phone, and likely the best phone I'll ever own for its price!
I got the Sony Ericsson phone yesterday and it 100% better than the Motorola RAZR, which I am returning today and would never recommend to anyone.RAZR only offers 3 ring tones (stingy!), the speaker volume is low, the handset volume is also low, even when I tune the volume to max.Sony has lots of ring tones, speaker and handset volume are much louder, can take picture with phone closed, AND it can take videos too.Also, Sony's phone is much easier to user, consider that my father who doesn't know English couldn't memorize the basic functions in RAZR but easily learned the same features in the Sony.Cingular now offers the Sony phone for cheap, so anyone spending a lot of money on the RAZR is just throwing $$ in the trash.  RAZR is full of hot air with some style and zero substance.Sony phone is smaller & cuter (the thickness is just a little more than the thickness of my Samsung phone), easier to handle, overall design is more user friendly, and offers more features.I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, but I'm sure it'll be just fine.
I've heard about the software/firmware problems with this phone.  Actually didn't know about it until after I upgraded at the Cingular store.  Fortunately my box had the yellow dot to show it that this phone had the upgraded software.  I've had no problems with this phone.  I think this is a great phone as long as you have the updated firmware.I upgraded from an ancient Motorola Timeport P8097 that I was using as a car phone.  I did a lot of research and visited all the major cell providers' stores before deciding on this one.  I've been very happy with this phone.I wanted a camera phone but I find I haven't been using the camera (or the media) features very much.  The camera is not very good.  It's only .3 megapixel.  It's OK to take simple pictures of stationary objects, but pictures are very blurry if there is any movement at all.The PIM features are excellent, and there is 16 Meg of memory.  It's not a lot compared to a smart phone but it's still large enough for all my information.  I wanted a phone that could replace my old Palm Vx and work as a basic PIM.  Many of the phones I saw had contacts and calendar, but not many had a separate To Do list feature, which I wanted.The only major complaint is that I can't get it to sync with Yahoo's Contacts Backup service.  This is a relatively new feature that allows you to backup your contacts, calendar, etc to SyncML phones.  I've gotten different information about whether this should work.  Some of Yahoo's pages say that the Z500 is supported.  The Z520a is a newer version of Z500 that should be supported, but I can't get synch to work.  This syncs just fine with Outlook except that long notes fields on contacts get truncated.PROS:* Very light weight, easy to fit in pocket* Has bluetooth and infrared* Has contacts, to-do list, calendar, etc.  Allowed me to replace my Palm Vx.* Great menu system which is easy to useCONS:* Uses a special headphone connector instead of standard 1/8" jack* Signal sometimes cuts out and I get static or interference on some calls (but still relatively good)* Camera button is too easy to activate!!!* No high speed EDGE, just slower GPRS* USB charge/sync cable is extra* Sync software doesn't allow you to map fields or exclude fields.  All you can choose is whether or not to sync Contacts, Calendar, To-do list, and Notes* Long notes fields on Contacts get truncated after about 40 characters, even when there is free memoryAll things considered, this phone has been better than I hoped for.  I used to hate carrying my old cell phone around, and friends could never call me.  Now I carry this Z520a around all the time and I actually like using it.
The phone crashes a lot.  Sometimes I get calls and though I can hit 'answer', I can't hear anything.  Nor can the person on the other end hear me.Sometimes the screen turns into garbage.Power-cycling fixes the problem.  I have these problems every 2-3 days regardless of whether I use the phone a lot or not at all.I plan to return the phone.
This phone was freezing daily. I called support and they had the following to say:There have been some occurrences of a phenomenon known as memory leakon the Sony Ericsson Z520a cellular handset.  It is extremely importantto note that this phenomenon is rare in its occurrence and is totallydependant upon the simultaneous existence of multiple networkconditions.These conditions appear to be typically associated with highlypopulated, central urban settings.Even in these network environments, memory leak will only beexperienced if the mobile does not complete at least one power cycle in a periodof approximately four days. A power cycle occurs when you turn off andturn on the phone, remove and reinsert the battery or the battery goesdead and complete a recharge and power on.What a crock. I told them it was not rare that it froze, it was daily.  Plus the phone has taken lots of pictures on it's own of the inside of my purse.  I am very disapointed.  Guess I got spoiled by my Nokia phone, wish I would have not left them. :(
This phone works great and sounds clear. I have family with Nokia's and they have issues getting a good signal but my Ericson Z520a gets 4 to 5 bars. When I am on the phone you do not get the typical cutting in and out as you do on many cell phones. Even in the car on the freeway my wife can hear me clear without any breaking up or distortion.My wife also has the Ericson Z520a and does not have a problem using the phone and likes the extra ring tones. It is great with both IR and Bluetooth available. Options for getting extra personal ring tones is great.The camera button is not that big just in a place where most people grab the phone if it is in a bag or pocket. It is easy to get out of the camera mode with one click of the back button and you can go from there. I would rather hit a camera button then an internet button or other paid feature on accident like you can on some other cell phones. You do have the option of telling the phone to answer the call when you open the phone so you do not have to worry about missing any calls.The battery life is great, I can talk a lot and do not need to charge it every night. So if you are traveling, you can survive without living next to a cell charger.It comes with some demo games already installed but they are only demo games. Full version of the games can be bought for under $7.The button size is not bad at all. I have big hands and have no problems hitting the correct buttons on the phone. This phone has good size buttons for a small cell phone.
I got this phone and I think its awesome. It has an MP3 Player (you must use a seperate USB cable for the phone that you have to buy for about $30) It also has a camera and video camera.PROS:-Mp3 player-Camera and external camera-Downloadable games and Ringtones ETC...-Bluetooth-Internet-Changable faceplates (not included with the phone)CONS:-Sensetive camera buttom (It is on the outside and it's very sensetive so sometimes when it's in my pocket it'll be snapping pictures)-Hard to flip open and closed-Sometimes its get a little slow for about 30 seconds.In conclusion, I think this is a great phone. It has its cons but dont all phones have them?) It has alot of cool features and is timelessly cool.
Phone is good... Doesn't have a great camera or music support, but it does it's job, and that's communication. Have no problems with it, and it's easy to use. It also feels much more solid than my v551 I previously had.
This phone has great battery life.  Call quality is ok.  I had lots of dropped calls, buzzing, etc. then got Cingular to replace it for me.  It's been fine since then.The camera quality isn't that great, photos are grainy and don't look good anywhere but on the camera (and even then they aren't perfect).  The camera button is on the outside of the phone and frequently gets pressed when the phone is in a pocket, bag, etc., resulting in lots of black photos that need to be deleted.I get really good reception with this phone, I live in a mid-sized city and use Cingular.
---I was exited about buying this phone. But was a little disappointed to see that the camera is useless, pictures have such poor quality, I am not even sure why manufacturer would bother building camera in this phone. On the top of it takes pictures on its own while I carry it in my pocket or in my purse. Not sure about quality either. The phone broke after a little more than three month.+++Design and navigation through menu is quite nice and simple, also it has good collection of ring tones and wallpapers.
Combine a phone that is under silent recall with a Cingular customer support organization which is more bent on transferring you to another department than helping you ... and you get a terrible product with terrible service.Phone drops between towers ... known memory problemPhones (some) will take pictures without any buttons being pushedPhones have problems chargingBatteries go badPictures and video not kept ... memory problemsThe issues are quite long and are documented via Sony if you can trace through all the barriers they have erected to keep you from knowing that they have a terrible product that is being replaced like water over a waterfallBetween me and others in my family who have these phones ... we are now on our 12th (4 of the same phones on the plan) ... Cingular's site related to this phone has thousands of postings about this phone and it's problems ... to see 3 stars out of 5 on Amazon is a bit of a shock ... I guess some actually have workable phones
I've always been a big fan of the Japanese phones. They got cool designs and better functionality over other brands (including nokia). I ordered a SE W600 along with a Z520a in mid April. This phone appears pale when compared with the W600. The first thing I noticed is the screen resolution. It's not very sharp, which reminds me of my old nokia 6820. Images are kinda pixelated. The camera is a typical vga with 4x digital zoom. You can't expect much from this mediocre phone. But the camera is packed with many cool features. I enjoy the "frame feature", pretty funny. I like the external screen a lot, you can even change its wall paper. The menu interfaces are very user-friendly -- another amenity of sony ericsson. There are plenty of shortcuts in the "more" menu, so you don't have to exit to the menu and re-access whatever.I find some little flaws on the design. For my phone, it takes me both hands to open the clamshell. I cannot just use my thumb to flip it open like I did with my samsung phone. When you entirely flip it open, there is a click sound. Also, PROTECT THE INTERNAL SCREEN. Use some kind of screen protector or simply plastic foils to cover the screen up. Of course it wouldn't matter for those people who don't care about the phone's appearance. I wonder what they made the screen with, it's absolutely unavoidable to scratch its surface. (BTW, I heard you can make the scratches disappear if you rub it with toothpaste) Also, the screen is hard to see under outdoor light. You have to turn the screen brightness to max to get a good view. The external screen is more durable than the internal one. I haven't found a single scratch on it yet. There is also no cover at all for the outside camera. So dirt and residue can easily build up. I've gotta nothing to say about the loop antenna. It doesn't bother me, kinda stylish actually, though some said it's bulky. I don't know if this design actually boosts the reception, but I used a different phone on cingular a year ago, and it had 4 bars. Now there are 5 bars on this phone with cingular.There are plenty of features on this phone; many unnecessary ones, but still nice to have them. You can use infrared port and blue tooth to connect with other devices. The phone book contains slots for many information of your contacts. Beside adding personal picture and ringtone, you can also add a different light effect. The edges of phone light up by different sequences. The entertainment department is overloaded with many unnecessary applications -- video, music, and photo DJ. I don't even use them on my w600, what can you do when the z520a only has 14 usable memory? (But 16mb internal memory is pretty large among the same rank phones) The games on the phone are very enjoyable. However, everything gets cutback when they are all demo version. A courtesy to Cingular. But that doesn't really bother me, I can find any game I want on google. (You MIGHT wonder how I transfer the games onto the phone. Well, I'm not rich enough to pay for the unlimited internet subscription, so I just downloaded the games onto the computer and transfer it onto my w600 and then onto the z520a through bluetooth.) The phone does play videos and mp3. But once again, what can you do with 14mb memory anyway? The internet button is very accessible, almost too accessible. You can accidentally press it and waste some data usage. For cingular, it's $0.01/kb. There are three IM softwares installed: AIM, Yahoo!, and ICQ. I don't ever use them, so I don't care. The organizer is packed with many tools: alarms, world clock, calendar, tasks, notes, synchronization, timer, stopwatch, calculator, and code demo.Comparing with Nokia 6102, this phone far exceeds its competitor functionality and price. But I don't know about the durability. Though Nokia phones are known for its durability, but my previous 6280's keypad stop functioning after a year.Another to mention is regarding the health issue. I consider the SAR value of z520a to be very high. "The highest SAR value as reported to the authorities for this phone model when tested for use by the ear is 1.47W/kg, and when worn on the body is 0.695W/kg. In Canada and the US, the SAR limit for mobile phones used by the public is 1.6w/kg." I suggest turning on the speaker or use a handfree/bluetooth to get the phone away from your body as far as possible.Okay, that's all I could think of right now. Overall, this is a very satisfactory phone with a very low price tag. Consider getting this if you are on a low budget.
i thought this phone was amazing at first... all the extra features are nice with 16 mb of memory and a nice camera but there are some gltches  this phone has good potential but i do not think it is ready for market yet my screen came loose and it shuts off sometimes at random.  the phone turns off if to close to another phone.  i returned this phone and got the razr instead. although it doesnt have as much memory it is more dependable
well first off, this is a wonderful phone.  i rele like it and i think it is probably worth your money on these conditions:(cons)if you don't have like huge hands because this thing is super small!!!  in comparison to others at least...also...your fingers can accidentally push the HYPER SENSITITVE camera button if you don't hold it correctly or there will be hundreds of shots of the inside of your purse, pant pocket, backpack, etc.long charge times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if you don't need the camera, video, voice recorder then you probably don't need this.  although they are nifty little features, if you don't use them you might as well get a different phone...now for the plus side of things.cool gamesneat camera...takes good photos.video feature is neat!voice recording is also cool...all of the last two are perfect for that concert you wanted to catch for your friend who couldn't make it, or that perfect shot of mick jagger running across your side of the stage.  ;]cool interchangeable cover plates...sleek innovative design.mesmerising light effects.you can create neato movies too...overall, the phone is great...i think it is perfect for me and i really enjoy it and hope you do too!
I think this phone is great. I love the menu options and is the best Sony Ericsson that came out on the market. I have it for 2 months now and I just love it. I recomand the Z250a
Ok, I got this phone for christmas, and I can tell you right now, this phone is thee coolest phone on the market for the price. My favorite feature yet is the video recorder, cause I take tons of clips at school so it's worth it. The reception is beyond excellent! The external screen is bright too. Bluetooth is awesome cause you can just put on a wireless headset and talk. The infered port makes it much easier to upload pictures and video! And to complete it, It is a stylish phone.
Pros:1.  Real music ringtones.2.  Bluetooth3.  Small form factorCons:1.  The phone tends to cut out based on the direction you are facing or if you put your hand over the antenna loop.2.  The placement of the button that activates the camera.  It is on the side of the phone, and just carrying it in your pocket is enough to activate the camera.  I'll be walking along, and all of a sudden I hear the camera snapping photos of the inside of my pocket.  Also, when you pick the phone up, you have to actually try to NOT activate the camera.  The button is right where you grab the phone when you pick it up.Conclusions:  While I love the bluetooth connectivity and the real music ringtones, there are other, better phones out there that have both.  If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this phone.
I haven't had any of the issues other users have reported, and I've used the phone extensively for a month.  If I do run into some the problems reported I will simply have the firmware upgraded by Cingular or will exchange it for a phone with the upgrade already installed.  The features that this phone has simply cannot be beat by any other phone in its class/price-range.  My wife also has a z520a and has had the same positive experiences so far.
I received my z520a phone about a week ago, and I have no complaints.  It's nice and small, and my favorite part is that it doesn't have an antenna that will jab you if the phone is in your pocket.  I use a Mac and Entourage, and I'm able to sync with my Entourage address book using a third party program called MobileSync.  Made by Salling Software.  I was also able to use it with a Motorolla bluetooth headset that I already owned. Pairing the two devices was extremely painless.I've had to call Cingular a few times for small things and found their customer service to be very good.  I have also yet to have any reception problems or dropped calls at all.I think that this is a great little handset with a ton of features, and the price is certainly right.
Pros: Great reception, nice flashing lights, decent menu's, good bluetooth, great battery life.Cons: Flimsy lid, terrible camera quality compared to most other new phones. I don't care for the sync software. Most importantly ... There is an extra camera button on the left top side of the phone as your looking at it. This is right where I and my wife hold the phone to open or talk, guess what?...You end up with the memory full of pictures of the inside of your car, the floor, the ceiling and everything else. I emailed Sony and they said to get their generic phone case which should cover the button. but their is no way to deactive it. I think I'm going to put a drop of gel superglue and fix it myself..lol.I would not rate this as an excellent phone, I should have returned it. I use the Nokia 6682 and it replace my Motorola MPX200 Smartphone (MPX200 microsoft as usual, very buggy with lots of reboots). Hands down the Nokia is way superior in every way. Some say the camera on the Nokia is terrible indoors. This is true if you have low light. With enough light and outdoor pictures I can actually use the picture on my laptop. The 520 however looks like crud. Only useable on the little screen on the phone itself. Hopefully this review helps you.
My brother got this phone for me from cingular. ive had many phones, but compared to this one they all STINK! The antenna is alot cooler than an ugly pull up one, and there are two screens, one on the inside and one on the outside. you can even customise you phone with pop off frames, witch is really cool. this phone can do EVERYTHING that any other phone can do and MORE! There just isnt that EDGE thing or whatever that is, but that doesnt matter. It has Light FX on the outside, and it can play MP3. The keys light up blue, and it is the best. if you want to have a phone that looks cool, and can do it all, GET IT!
This phone is great. I got it from Cingular. I love all the features, and I've had no problems with it. I love MEdia net from Cingular, because I learned how to create my own ringtones from an mp3. It holds a lot of data. When I got it, it had 17,000+ kb. One disadvantage is the clamshell design, because it's hard to open and it clicks when you open and close it.
My wife and I both own this phone. Needless to say we are both disappointed with the poor quality. The main problems we encountered are:1) The phones will go into a weird state at random; The phone appears to be working but will not receive calls or make calls. The only way to get the phone to work again is to physically remove the battery and then replace it. When the phone reboots it will work.2) The camera quality is poor and the images are compressed too much. Plus, because of where the camera button is located, it is fairly easy to unknowingly take dozens of pictures of the inside of your pocket or purse.3) One of the phones died after 11 months. The inside screen was toast.I am surprised that some people actually like this phone. Our experience has been that these phones are junk.
after reading some of the reviews on this item. i had to do it. i work in n out of freezers all day. i still get 4 bars in a freezer that is -35 degrees below. ok ok the ringtones occasionally slide around but its an easy fix. just change it back. but the ringtones that i set to certain callers remains the same. the bluetooth functions are great, and easy to use. the pictures i take are good, and clear. yes the camera button on the outside of the phone will take pictures of my pocket, but it takes 2 seconds to delete those pictures.
I too was getting a lot of pictures of the inside of my pocket.  I just loaded the phone up with songs (about 9 LOL) and now there is no room for anything, much less a picture.  :)
I was nervous about purchasing a less than mainstream phone after using Nokia for years but glad I tried the Sony. The features list is impressive there are very few phones with as many features anywhere near this price. Navigation is slightly odd and I have heard others complain of the camera performance but since I dont use it I can't comment. Battery is good for three days of heavy use, reception is also good..no real complaints!
as other people have stated, there have been problems with the z520a in the memmory allocation department, causing the phone to not ring. people, THIS IS SOLVED BY SIMPLY SHUTTING THE PHONE OFF AND TURNING IT ON AGAIN EVERY 1-2 DAYS.this is not a gigantic hassle. this phone has been recalled, but as i am aware, cingular will replace all phones sold with this problem... with a brand new, reflashed phone.ok, moving on to phone features. its a cute, quirky phone, which is not for everyone. lack of dedicated send and end buttons can cause problems for some. the buttons really are slightly difficult to get used to but beoyond that, this phone is packed with features. bluetooth, decent camera, great reception, and the nifty light patterns. its a good, midgrade phone, for not a ton of money. i do highly sugjest it, and i would have given it a 5 dispite the lack of send and end buttons.
Wow, these are the same problems I've been having~~!! My friend got the same phone and he is experiencing the same problems as well! OYE!! One time my sister called me and when I picked up, I got this Hispanic lady speaking to me in spanish. I think we were both shocked....she hanged up first. Every couple of days (if I don't turn my phone off) my phone would flash with no ringtone....the problem is fixed when I restart the phone. I do not plan to return my phone at the moment, but IF the phone should start missing calls, I will definitely return it!!@
I am using Debian Linux Sid with kernel 2.6.16, and the SE Z520a works fine with it over Bluetooth using a generic USB adaptor. The phone supports OBEX file transfer, allowing me to copy pictures and videos to and from the phone, and to delete them, also, using Kbluetooth and the Konqueror file manager. Using the following ffmpeg command [ffmpeg -i videoname.mov -s qcif -r 15 -b 64 -vcodec mpeg4 -ac 1 -ar 8000 -ab 12 -acodec aac -pass 1 videoname.3gp] I was able to convert videos into a format that can be played on the phone to entertain the kids. They can only be a half an hour at the most, however due to the 16mb file size limit. I have not tried to use the phone as a modem as I do not have any internet or data on my account at the moment. That will probably have to wait for the future as I do not yet have a computer that needs such services. Using OBEX SyncML to transfer the address book over Bluetooth does not yet work in Linux, but it is being worked on, and will hopefully work in the future. Otherwise, the other reviews covered all the other aspects of the phone. **Update** Ich have now used it as a modem with Linux and it works fine.
i got this phone for christmas and for the first month it seemed fine, then it started to freeze and  not work. i got it replaced and the new one worked for only a little too.  last night the speaker in the back was humming and no sounds would be heard on the phone. im exchanging it for a motorola today..dont buy
don't fall for the rebate trap - I did everything they asked in the timeframe they asked and my rebate request was refused for no apparent reason. I was told that they were going to put it thru anyway, sure. I bought the phone 6 months ago - still no rebate check. What a rip-off.
This phone stinks!  It was great for a month or so and I loved all the features (color screen, camera, etc).  Then I found that it does take pics all the time.  AND I have found that it changes ringtones arbitrarily, won't show the person's picture who is calling (just a black box), won't let me answer calls, vibrates instead of rings, the picture quality is HORRIBLE.  I am going to go back to the much favored Nokia or Motorola phones that have been so wonderful in the past.  Do not buy this phone if you don't want the headache that goes along with it.
Overall, the concept of this phone is very nice. There are nice features that are fun to use and handy when they work right. Both my husband and myself have these phones and they both have different quirks that should not happen on a phone we paid this much money for.First of all, the phone fails to ring DAILY. I've read that you have to shut down and restart the phone every day or two to prevent this. This is ridiculous to have to do. No, it's not hard, but when you pay a lot for a cell phone, you shouldn't have to be inconvenienced like that. I don't use my phone as much as a lot of people I know. I forget about it in my purse, often to find out hours or a day or two later that I missed a call.As others have said, the camera button is in a bad place and is too sensitive. One review suggested to buy a case, but as I keep my phone in my purse and will not use a belt clip (maternity clothes don't really have any good places for a clip), I would miss just as many calls trying to get to my phone and get it out of the case as I do when it fails to ring. It would be nice if they had an option to turn the button off completely and manually turn it on when needed. I've lost count of how many pictures have been taken of the inside of my purse or my husband's pocket.The other problems I've had were having the pictures I took show up blank in the pictures folder until I restarted the phone. I deleted several I shouldn't have because I thought they were random shots of the inside of my purse... completely black. Also, every now and then the phone completely freezes and the only button that ends up working is the power button. Everything seems to work ok after it restarts, but it happens even when the battery's fully charged. Once again, it's silly to have to do this over and over again to keep the phone in good working order.My husband's phone has a problem with the battery coming loose every now and then and, of course, the phone won't even start until he tightens the battery. I haven't read this being a vast problem with the phone, so it might be because he carries his around in his pocket... I'm not sure.I have a feeling we will be returning these phones soon to make sure we have the upgraded ones. I like the overall concept and mainly if I could get the phone to work without having to restart, I'd love to keep it. That's my main problem with it. We've never had problems with our past phones... all Nokia, if I remember correctly.
My frustrations with this phone have prompted me to write my very first review on amazon.  I have had three different versions of this phone in the last 3 months including one with the new hardware update- but it consistently drops calls and the display don't work.  I was unable to place or make calls for two days although the phone thought I was "connected"= so I have been a cell phone user for >10 years and have never had so many problems with one phone- I had to write something to save someone else from my frustration-
This phone is excellent.  The best I've had as far as reliability and signal - may be partly because of Cingular, too.  The buttons are a little hard to get used to, but it doesn't take long.  The screen is clear and easy to read, the battery stays charged for a good amount of time (especially if you don't use it to call anyone), and it's just an overall good phone.  I totally recommend it.
After owning this phone for two weeks, I returned it today and am so happy.  This phone sucked.  It looks good but the design has a fatal flaw.  The camera button is located at such a spot that when you pick up the phone and open up the flip, you will touch it.  You will touch it even when you are on the phone talking.  My husband once used my phone to make a call and took more than 10 photos when holding the phone talking.  His hand is too big for this phone to avoid touching the phone.  It became very annoying.Also, I had dropped calls often with this phone, but I was not sure it was the phone's problem or the service problem.  By the way, Cingular's customer service sucks too.  They close on Sundays and also close after 9pm on weekdays.  On Saturdays they are on a shortened schedule.  It was very inconvenient when you had a problem and needed help.
this was my first time using anything other than a Motorola..I really wish I'd stuck with them. I've had my Sony Ericsson Z520a phone since early Dec and have noticed that, when it's closed, it feels like it is loose; if I 'wiggle' the top & bottom, there is definitely some kind of loose movement going on, almost like there's a screw loose somewhere. That's something I've never had happen with the Motorolas I've used (V600, V180).As for the camera: first of all, the side button is irritating as heck! I don't know how many times I've accidentally taken a picture of the inside of my holster (case) when removing it! (And as far as I know, I can't reassign the thing!)  Pic quality is ok, nothing to write home about (now, my son has the Nokia 6102..he sent me some really GREAT pictures last week when he was in NY from that one). I do like the photo-assign feature (nothing new there, I had it with the V600) and being able to assign different ring tones to callers in my address book (ditto the V600) Video feature..fuzzy at best.Ringtones -- I don't even use the ones that came with the phone. I paid a charge of just under $8 over at freeringers.net & get unlimited ringtones, wallpaper, etc...it comes with a nifty converter that lets you make/rip any song on your computer - or a cd - into a ringtone -- not bad for a one-time charge of, again I say...under 8 bucks. When I change the phone -- and trust me, I will as soon as I decide which Motorola to go with --all I have to do is change the phone type I currently have to the new phone type. It's the first time I've found a 'free' ringtone service that means what they say! They offer 4 slots so you can share the service with your friends/family. The only downside is that if you screw up a number, you can't delete it, so definitely be careful with that! They also don't bug you with annoying emails, etc. (one service I tried keeps sending me text msgs reminding me of my login info! They were supposed to be 'free for life' at $29.95 but changed hands..guess what..the new folks are not honoring that free for life motto!)okay, back to my review: Bluetooth - any camera I own now must have Bluetooth technology. Setting up the Z520a to use w/my headset was relatively easy. No upside/downside to that..
I was very surprised at how well of reviews this phone has.  The reason I purchased my sony is because I saw all good reviews, then, after I got it, the screen went out just from a minor drop on our carpet.  Cingular exchanged it but it cost me and I could only get the same phone.  The new one I got flipped out on me and kept going off and wouldn't come back on.  When it did come on it would flip out and flash and act crazy.  It also would call me and have someones name that wasn't even calling me!!!  Cingular exchanged this one for free because I didn't drop it and this time the phone I got flipped out again.  It did the same thing as the second one only not as bad.  I owned a Nokia 6010 for 2 years and sold it and it was still in good condition and NEVER had a problem with it.  Heck, before I had Cingular I had a tracfone and my Nokia worked no problem, no complaints.  Cingular, again after talking to a million supervisors sent me a new phone and I have yet to get it but I wouldn't order or upgrade to this phone again if I had to choose between it and chop suey!  Get a Nokia you will get a better deal and quality.
Same problem happened to me -- mic cuts out. I hoped it was just the phone. I returned it and got a new one (probably refurbished). I wish I had done some research before I got it. Oh well.
I definitely love this phone!!! It has cool lights and you can get great ringtones too! It also takes good pics.!!!  I've had mine since St. Patricks Day (2006)and it works like a charm!!! I'm glad I got it and I hope your thinking about getting one too!!!
i received this phone as a christmas present, since i saw it i was fascinated with it, so finally on the 25th i owned it! awesome!, its was the white one, so it wans t month yet and i started with issues, like the playnow, sometimes didnt work, the camera sound that should never be off, suddenly stopped, and twice, i received a call and the screnn shut off, as well the lights and the sound kept on, there was no way no make it react unless taking off the battery, and the infrared port falied 3 or 4 times, so i turned it back, and when i went back for it, they told me there was no way my phone could be repaired, since i bought it was wrong, so all my sounds, music, ringtones, videos, pics, etc......i lost them! all of them!!, just because sony ericsson cant work well, and be a professional company i lost important pictures, and stuff they told me that if i wanted they could give me another one, but they just had them on gray, and after what happend, i chose not to take the chance again, so i payed a difference of 20 and received a panasonic vs2 with a built in camera with 1.3 mp and 32mb of built in memory!.......what a hencesonyericsson has the heapest and latest phones, but ive known lots of people that find them with defects, or between 6 months to 1 yr of use starts to develop failures, and taking more time to open features and stuff, the camera sucks, the worst definition ever, and ive owned, nokia, motorola and now panasonic, so thhis phone really is a waste of money, besides its 16mb of memory sucks to!, i had just 2 songs, about 20 extraringtones, and 52 pictures ans memory was full..:s...oh yeah and 2 or 3 videoclips, about 12 seconds on each, so it really sucks, if you like it wait until their price lows it a lot of money thrown.
I have had this phone since December of 2005 and have had to have it replaced four times!  This first phone kept locking up due to the firmware version, the 2nd one worked fine for a week and then lost the network, (my SIM card worked fine in any other phone), the 3rd phone barely held a signal and would drop calls, the phone I have now doesn't seem too bad, but the reception isn't as strong as the first one I had...  When this phone works it has great features, but for the price it's not worth the hastle!
This phone is a brick..sure it may be lightweight, but this sucker is huge.
It was a really great for like a month! Then it started to not have network conections and you can't make phone calls.  Then we tried a new "smartchip".  It wasn't that smart.  It was horrible!  We the n sent out for a new phone and they sent us the same phone and 2 months later i broke!  We were so mad.  We talked to them and they gave me a Motorola v557!  I would not try his phone at all!!  It was so bad.  You'll regret it later.
Well, I learned my lesson.  I have been and always will be a motorola fan although I thought I would try something new and there in lies my mistake.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the phone other than the fact that it did not fit me at all.  After one days use, I went home, put it in the box, called cingular to tell them I was returning it and haven't regreted it since.  I kept hitting the camera button, it did not feel comfortable on my face when I was talking on the phone and the 'new age' antenna is a load of you know what.  After I got it in the mail, I realized how ugly of a phone it was and the technology aspect never really won me over.  Sony needs to reconsider how they make phones for this one was more a pain in the rear to use than anything else.  I have ordered what I originally wanted which was the motorola v557 and can't wait to get it for I truly miss my moto!
i thing i made a biggest mistake by purchasing this phone for rebate. it has already been more that three months and i havent got anything from these peoples and in customor service too i get the differnt reply each time i called them and they dont know how system of rebate work, its rediculous!.the phone is ok but i am using my old phone instead.
I got this phone for Christmas and it was so awesome. But the only problem I have with it is, its very hard to flip open. And I've always wanted a phone that can flip becuase I think they're really cool. My friends all make fun of me for it. But it's okay because they're just jealous HAHA.
I got two of these phones.  One for me and one for my wife.  My wife had problems from the start.  Her phone didn't get good reception, but mine did.It was hard to find accessories for this phone.My daughter is teething and she got hold of the phone and slobbered on it.  The phone immediately started acting up.  The microphone stopped working, the top three buttons no longer work, lights stay lit when they aren't supposed to.I sent it in to Ericssons to have it repaired and it was returned to me unrepaired because the water damage voided the warranty.I've always had motorolas in the past.  This is the first ericssons.  I'll never get an ericssons again.
I got this phone when it first became available, mid-contract (so it cost the full $250 it was priced for when it first came out) and it was the hot thing to get at Nokia (for awhile) due to its incredibly small size.  It's a really good phone--too bad the cell phone company I got it from, Edge Wireless, isn't!  It's as said before amazingly small and compact, colorful and elegant but still cool.  It's compact design is, of course, the major selling factor, but it's reception is awesome, polyphonic tones, text messaging and other uses make it a worthwhile phone as well.  Highly recommended from someone who doesn't know much about cell phones--it's hot, but so easy to use.
This phone is an excellent basic phone.  The speakerphone works well, is nice and loud.  The ringtones are nice, and the reception is amazing.  You'll love it.
I got this as a second phone, aside from my Nokia 6270.I've used this phone a long time ago (not mine), and because I loved it so much I got one this time.Since I mentioned this as a second phone, normally the lack of camera and bluetooth will be fine. Those are the things that matter in a primary phone.Power on/off button on top of the phone is a little hard to press, but how often do you shut your phone anyway?It comes in a lot of different eye candy colors. Very attractive.It has the basic functions of a phone (eg. alarm clock, stop watch, countdown timer, calculator) which is great.Ergonomics is pretty good too, and the size is perfect. Not too bulky, just right.I hope this helps.
Mike, Most cell phone screens are hard to read against Wallpaper or a photo for wallpaper in the background. Go into you Settings, Wallpaper and set it to OFF. Then go to Settings Color Schemes and pick a background color that gives you good text/background screen contrast. I found Blue worked for me.Next, all small phones that fit in pants pocket have a lock-out function to prevent keys from being activated until Unlocked. Go to Settings, Phone Settings,Automatic Keyguard and set it to ON. This will automatically lock the keyboard, if you forget, after about 1 minute on no key activity. To Unlock keyboard, on the Main screen press Unlock softkey then Asterisk key. To lock keyboard manually, at Main screen press Menu softkey followed by Asterisk key.Tips:1. The Speakerphone works great on this phone. It is also usefulfor a higher volume in you need it when using the phone nearyour ear. Be sure to hold the phone away from your ear, saywith your index finger inserted between you ear and the phone.To activate Speakerphone, when a call is connected SPEAKERwill appear on screen above right softkey. Press it. Adjustvolume using left/right direction keys to decrease/increase.2. Use Calendar to alarm yourself of Birthdays and to Noteevents. After you have Saved the alarm, press the Optionsleft softkey and select Repeat to set in a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly reminder alarm. Birthday are automaticallyrepeated yearly.3. Use the 'Add Detail' Option to a Contact to store Addressand Notes about the contact. You can add more than one Noteto the same Contact if you run out of space(about 32characters) on the first one.3. Use Settings,Personal Shortcuts, to set the right andleft Softkeys for what you phone functions you want quickaccess to. Consider assigning one of them to ShortCuts thenmake a list of Function Shortcuts you want at Settings,Persona Shortcuts, Assign Shortcuts. You can also OrganizeShortcuts here to prioritize your shortcut list, top to bottom.4. Use Nokia's free software to Backup and Sync Contacts on yourcomputer using MS Outlook/Express(a must if you have lots ofcontacts and information data on your phone). You will needthe Nokia DKU5 USB cable. The DKU2 cable is for the 3120's bigbrother, the Nokia 6230. DKU2 is not usable with Model 3210.Find them cheap on Ebay.THIS IS A GREAT AND RELIABLE POCKET PHONE WITH ALL THE ESSENTIALS!! Not a Digital Camera. A phone is not a good camera, buy one. Not an MP3 Player. A phone is not a good MP3 player, buy one. Just more things to go wrong and act funky on your phone.
I have to preface by saying this is the first phone I've owned.  That said, the layout is pretty straightforward, and there are lots of little functions tucked away to make life easier; dated reminders with alarms, countdown timer, email, etc.On the negative side, the display is impossible to read in strong light.  Time displays in a nice big font but only when the screen is dark -- good luck seeing it under most lighting conditions.  And a case is mandatory -- too easy to lean against the buttons when it is in a pocket.
I puchased my Nokia 6101 about 3 months ago.  From what I've seen from the last phones I've owned this phone can take a lot of damage I've dropped it several times, and to my suprise it still works efficently.  I've read the other reviews talking about this phone and one said that their atenna was falling off which I believe they were talking about a diffrent phone because the atenna on this model is apart of the phone. Another thing I like which is probably a personal prefrence is that you can record with this phone and use that record as your ring, that way you don't have to spend money on purchasing ring tones on-line.  I hope this review helps you for finding a phone that fits you.
Unless you are only planning on making occasional phone calls on this device without holding many contacts or personalizing the ringtone, this phone is not for you, especially at this price.  The lack of internal memory prevents you from saving more than a handful of games, pictures, ringtones, or text messages without causing it to lock up due to a "lack of internal memory".  There are many better phones available at better prices, especially if you are a T-Mobile To Go customer.  If you do use To Go, purchase a terrible phone (like this, only cheaper) for the SIM card, then upgrade to an Unlocked Phone on Amazon.  You won't be nearly as frustrated (unless you try to download from T-Zones, which can be a hassle, but I would rather not have this phone and not be able to download) as I have been, wasting my money on downloads only to discover that they won't fit in, even when I have barely anything on my phone.  Unless customization and having control over your phone (instead of the other way around) aren't for you, run away NOW!
It's a phone - so there's one feature that you should prize above all others (and it's not durability)... sound quality.  With this phone, you need to have the earpiece at a certain angle to hear a conversation.  Going the other way, the microphone's in a weird location that maximizes wind noise.  Many people commented on the poor sound quality when we spoke over this phone.So it's not good for a conversation.  What else about can I say this phone?How about you cannot connect to it using the cable that's supposed to be supported?  Try this: Google "Nokia 6101 Enhancement Not Supported".  Message boards are filled with people who are unable to connect to the phone from their PC.Another complaint is that the vibration is very soft and easily missed.  My old LG had a strong vibration that you could feel when the phone was in your pocket.  I have missed many calls from this phone due to the weak vibration.The only compliment I can pay this phone is that I like the "spell ahead" feature that figures out likely words you are trying to type when text messaging.  That worked better than I expected.
This phone is not durable. Mine hit the floor once and it was destroyed. Going back to a samsung.
I've had my 6101 for 2 months and it's not working already.  It was dropped once and since then it quit working right.  It would only work on speaker phone, and then all of a sudden the screen stopped working all together.  You can't hardly hear the person you're talking to, I used to have to push the phone so hard against my ear to just barealy hear them.  This phone is NOT worth the money, my advice, spend it on something else!
Definite durability issue, the antennae on mine is about ready to fall off.  The menus are confusing (as are most Nokia's) unless you are familiar with them.  I'll be looking to go back to an LG for the easy to use menus..
Simple, well built, excellent battery life; the 6010 is a great phone-and that's all it is.There's no easy way to move information/addresses to the phone-no bluetooth, no included cable.  There are 3rd party cable's available.The keyboard is large and is great for dialing in the middle of the night (like I do). I think it has one of the largest number keypad's of any phone.I've dropped this phone numerous times, and it hasn't had any problems.If you only want a mobile phone with nothing else, this is a good choice.
That's even much better than the other reviewer mentioned: IT has its web browser which works pretty well, not a just-a-phone thing, it is a cute one with a decent keyboard, good for guys always complaining of their fingers not fitting ok...!Works with instant communicators! Yahoo, AIM & AOL, it's its coolest feature, indeed! For weeks connected to yahoo, and at the same time using the phone, as well!Every now and then dropped on the park, 10feet high to catch it alive and well, down the hill... Lots of ringtones, one for each buddy call, or sms, very much a user-friendly phone.Charge last much more than my other Motorolas, maybe more than 2 times longer. Bought a second spare one, maybe for the times I cannot find a new one available, one year or so from now...!!On the side I have a Motorola C650, just for the camera when its warm outside, but can't leave my 6010 at home, just love it!
I'm peruavian, bought this phone in Peru with movistar service...PROS:It looks nice and solid. I was very scared in scratching the screen (I've always done this in my past phones) and this one is incredible solid! the phone also felt down once, of course with no intention, and continue working normal.It has cool features, you can personalize where to locate your quick options in the menu, so you get a very simple navigation. Finally i have to say that the battery is great...i can use it for 4 days with regular use and continues working.CONS:The internal memory is poor.No USB cable included.Pictures with low resolution(but normal in cell phones of its kind)This phone is still BIG and heavy considering some other models.For the price, durability and apparel this one is a good choice.I've never made friends with nokia in the past, and i regret, beacuse this is a very good choice if you need a hard-everyday-use phone...simple and firm.
I've had this phone for just over a year now, and it has been a good phone, but after a year of use, its pretty shot.  It operates fine, but the physical looks and features wear out very fast.  The rubber side pieces were a nice little thing to have until they started to yellow and they all fell off.  It doesn't support mp3 ringtones.  However, I have never had a problem with the service and its been a great phone for texting and talking.  Battery life is pretty good also.  I absolutely love the user-friendly menus and screen features.  Nokia has done a great job creating one of the best phone operating systems out there.
this phone has more features than i need, so i can only evaluate the basic functions which were fine. if it weren't for the bad service i'm getting from T-Mobile i wouldn't even dream of getting rid of it. I've had it over a year and never had any trouble with it. I used the camera in the beginning as a novelty but i don't use it much anymore, but it works fine.
I have had this phone for about a year now. I almost always recieve good reception thorough this phone. I just recently changed the cover because the phone comes with two, which is a nice feature.My only complaints are that there is no regular phone ring tone. They are all songs or the T-moblile ringtone. The other thing is that the select button is kind of odd and can be difficult to use by just pushing down on it. Sometimes it goes right to the camera or other features and not the menu.This phone has held up pretty good for me. I am not too hard on it though.
I bought phone because it was cheap and the lights looked cute.However, upon testing it out, the first thing that made me cringe was the interface.  My service is T-Mobile, and according to the manual, the carrier has the option of altering the menu interface.  I suspect that this was the case, because my interface did not match the one in the manual.  Anyhow, there were no submenus.  Rather, everything from your phone directory to text messages, to adjusting the ringtone, to using email, is listed in a HUGE list.  This means that to do something as simple as send a text message, you must scroll through a list of about 100 items to get to the text message inbox.Also, the volume of the earpiece was extremely quiet.  In an empty room at home, with no noise coming from outside, I could not hear the other person talk unless I shoved the end of the phone against my ear, and even then they were barely audible.  With my previous cell phone, I could hear the person talk even if I held the phone an inch away from my head.  There are no buttons to speak of on the side of the phone (e.g. volume control), and I didn't see any call-volume controls in the menu.The blinking colored lights on the sides were bright and fantastic, but otherwise this phone is lacking in every way possible.
I like the phone a lot! I couldn't find it around here anywhere.
I have owned the phone for about 6 months now.  I talk about 3500 minutes a month, send and recieve about 20 emails a day.  The phone has a bunch of great capabilities and is ocassionaly a great work companion.  The wide screen is excellent for viewing.  The cpu functions work a little slow which could be expected from such a small package.  The frustrating part is the phone frequently works slow as well.  When it does calls are lost.  About once a week it is necessary to take out the battery and let it sit for a minute before turning the phone on.  The phone takes a couple minutes to turn on.  Overall, it seems slow and unstable which overshadows all of its great features.  Reminds me of Windows 98.
This review is for a 9300i - the latest model - not listed. I bought this - very expensive- phone in the middle east, configured it to English UK and when I come to use predictive tect find that I get Arabic popping up.  The handbook clearly states there is a Dictionary in Options when writing Text.  There isnt.  Nor can I access predictive text by pressing the suggested key twice - as in other Nokia models.  My service agents have variously told me - 'It's ok - just use the computer keyboard'.  - 'It's not available on this phone' 'Yes this phone has predictive text'.- It has been to the main service agent here in Dubai only to be returned in an altered state - but no predictive text. I cannot contact a sensible person face to face to get the help I need.  NOKIA - get this sorted!  How many people come to Dubai and buy these treats only to get them home and find they have spent a lot of money and not got the bargain they had hoped for.
yes, the dial takes some getting used to.  but once u get the hang of it, it becomes very very easy.  a lot of people say texting takes too long.  i agree it takes longer than on a keypad, but the intuitive programming in text mode is very helpful.before buying this phone, i read every review i could find online.  and i have to agree, that the reason u would buy this phone is for its styling rather than its practicality or ease of use. however, for a phone that's supposedly built for looks, it's packed with features.  sure it doesn't support java and doesn't come with any games, but when was it decided that a phone had to have games?  other reviews complained that the camera resolution is also not that great, but i think for a phone camera it's decent.  besides, i don't use my phones to take pictures.  i have  a 6 megapixel camera for that.summarily, i'd have to say this phone was worth every penny.  it has everything a cell phone needs.  it dials out, it recieves calls (great sound quality and reception, btw), has voice dial and voice activated features, stores contact numbers, has a date book and planner, text messaging with a multimedia format, et cetera, et al.and oh yeah, did i mention how gorgeously STYLED this phone is?  thin, lithe, retro-60's chic, pulsing lights, and a mirror finish on the screen.  'nuff said.  i'm keeping this phone until it falls apart.  and then i'm going to buy it again.  ;-)
The last commenter had some very valid comments; I'd like to add that although it's a bugger to dial with that little rotary (and text messaging is downright akin to sending smoke signals), you can use voice dialing to dial. I use this with a bluetooth headset (Jabra 250V) -- just press the button on the headset, the phone beeps, say the name, it plays the name back to you for confirmation, and it dials. The phone stays in my backpack or pocket the whole time.You can also download software from Nokia for this to manage contacts, numbers, schedules, move around mp3s and pictures, create ringtones, and lots of other neat stuff. You can do all that over the unit's bluetooth.Good points: audio quality and reception, speakerphone (LOUD for such a small device) bluetooth, infrared, radio (you need a special headset for that, not included), camera (lousy quality, but heck, it's there if you need it), small size (like 2 iPod shuffles), zappo-neat Tron styling and glowing buttons. You can hang up by snapping the pop-up earpiece closed. The perfect hardware to use while ordering shaken, not stirred, beverages.Bad points: Icky dialing and operation. Non-user replaceable battery (though Nokia will do it for you; I tested them on this, and their customer service was GREAT. Has a bit of a reputation (propogated by Nokia marketing) for a "fashionista" phone. Mirror ed screen makes seeing the screen difficult in daylight (which is not a problem for me since I live in Oregon).
I would give this phone 3.5-4 stars. I've seen some bad reviews for it, but it's mostly from people who expected performance and versatility of a Blackberry. It's a good basic phone, with a few less features than other phones. If you're looking for a practical phone, this is a good choice IF:1. You can live without a camera on your phone (like <1 megapixel camera does anyone any good)2. You can live without speakerphone (I don't know anyone who utilizes that feature when thet have it anyways)3. You don't have to have the flashiest, fanciest, most cutting edge phone on the market.I wouldn't sign a contract to get this phone, I'd get one off the major auction website (begins with an "e", ends with a "bay"), where you can get it for about $30.
I like this phone. I dropped it in a glass full of water, and then a few months later took it swimming in the ocean with me, and it was fine after a few days. I doped it on a weekly basis and aside from a few scratches a dings it never seemed effected. The reception was okay, and as for the lack of camera and speaker, who needs those things anyway. I liked it and my experience with LG phones in general has been great, they're built to last.
This was my first cell phone in a few years, my first was the bulky bag phones. I now own a sony ericsson z500a and have had good luck so far despite the horrible reviews. As for this phone, I liked the design and ease of use much better than my new one. I even dropped it in the toilet and after a week of dry out worked fine. The only thing I realize now is that the signal strenght wasn't that great. My wife and I both had these phones and now she has a nokia 6010 and both of our new phones have better signal strength and clearer call reception than the lg did. But I absolutely loved how the lg 1300 phone was set up more than either of our new ones
I will have to disagree with the positive reviews on this phone -- mine is a real piece of crap! The phone, although the battery lasts for several days, has terrible reception, terrible menus (it will always go to the online shopping option first), the screen cuts out, the hinge mechanism is loose, the call volume fluctuates, and God forbid you sign a 2-year service plan like I did. There's a little mirror on it, but for what? It has a status light, but does nothing useful -- no clock, no caller ID, and as a mirror, it reflects an area about the same size as your eye, if you hold it out at arm's length. Stay away from this phone at all costs. Get a Nokia, Motorola, Sony, ANYTHIN but this LG. LG may make refridgerators, washers, dryers, and other household appliances, but they certianly can't make a phone.
Lets get one thing straight - you will never buy this phone for its features, so why give it a bad review because of its lack of features? This phone is meant for one thing -- Style. And not one other phone in the market comes close to this phone in style - and the sales of this phone prove it.The signal strength on this phone is very good. In elevators where I didnt get signal with other phones, this phone picks up enough signal to carry the conversation through without any of those "didnt hear you - can you repeat that?". I really havent seen another GSM phone with signal quality as strong as this one, which is funny because this phone's antenna doesnt even stick out (internal antenna). Bluetooth audio is clear - I have verified this with the Jabra BT200 and the Motorola HS820.Camera is good, but not as good as some other phones out there. Video is good, not as good as other phones out there. No memory card. Here's the bottom line - if you want a phone that works like a good phone and looks damn good, this is the phone for you. If you want a phone that does videos / audio etc, then look elsewhere - or wait for the v3i.Want a good looking phone with great voice quality? Buy this phone. Theres really no competition. Want a camera + camcorder + mp3 player + organizer + toaster? Skip it...
I am a cingular customer and was totally bummed when I found out that I couldn't get this awesome phone from my provider. A lot of people online have been questioning why someone would get a phone from here for so much money when you can get one from T mobile stores, but if you are not a T mobile customer you need an UNLOCKED version of the phone to use it. All I had to do was put my old sim card in it and it worked! I have not experienced any problems at all with my phone so far. It works great and it is beautiful. It works great as a phone and the camera and video opions are fun. It also comes with software and a cable that connects to your computer so you can transfer songs and pictures to you cell, which is awesome. You can take any song and make it your ringtone for free! I would like to say that a lot of people complain that this phone isn't a great camera, mp3 player, etc...but those things are just for fun extras. Buy a digital camera or an i pod if you want all that! If you like style and pink this is the phone for you! The only complaint I have is that it took almost a month to arrive!
I ordered the Pink RAZR phone knowing that it would be, just that, a phone. I didn't have any big expectations for cool features, I figured the large price tag was just what you have to pay for style. When I got the phone, I was pleasantly surprised at some of the features, and disappointed with a few flaws.The biggest feature of this phone is undoubtedly the fact that it's pink, svelte, and beautiful. I get tons of compliments on it from just about everyone who sees it. In addition to that, however, I did find that as far as camera phones go, the RAZR's camera was pretty decent. I was also pleasantly surprised at how large and bright the LCD was. My favorite feature, though, is the mobile phone tools software that comes with the phone that allows you to use segments of mp3 files as ringers, which saved me a lot of money (I usually buy them online) and enabled me to use whatever I want as a ringer. You can also upload pictures using the software, which was pretty useful and made for some cute wallpaper. More or less, it provided me with the style I wanted, and more features than I expected.Despite the fact that it was a great phone to begin with, I started having problems about three weeks into owning it. I would turn the phone on, and it would randomly dial numbers and then shut itself off. I thought perhaps I had dropped it or gotten it wet, but upon investigation, I found no sign that I had damaged it and had no knowledge of any accidents involving the phone. I was very worried that I'd just spent over 300 dollars on what would now be a very stylish paperweight, but I called Amazon's customer service and a very nice representative shipped me a replacement phone and labels to send my defective unit back with. I got the new phone, and everything has been going great so far, so I would just assume I got a defective phone to begin with. The only other flaw I can find with the RAZR is that it doesn't have great battery life, however, this isn't a huge issue, it just needs to be charged every day or two-- especially if you're constantly taking on it like I am.Overall, it is a great phone and more than I expected it to be. Amazon also went above and beyond my expectations to get my phone replaced as quickly as possible, and I am a very satsified customer. Plus, out of all the different phones I've had (probably 10 or more including other motorolas, nokias, samsung, etc.) this is by far my favorite.
The phone works great.  Great reception, sound, and video quality.  The only real problem is the charging.  Plug in the charger, set the phone down and it is charging fine, come back in a few minutes and it is no longer charging as if the cord is not even there, or it has completely shut down and is no longer charging.  Have to unplug the cord and replug it and the charge starts over.  This can happen over and over, can take days to charge this phone.  Have taken it back twice.  First time they replaced the battery, it did the same thing.  Second time they replaced the whole phone, it worked great for a few weeks, now the new one is doing the SAME thing.What good is a phone that won't charge!
I bought this phone and after a few months it went dead!  Motorola would not honor the warranty because they claim these unlocked phones are not made for use in the US.  I have also written to Amazon.com, but no response! DO NOT BUY THESE PHONES...NO WARRANTY!
I just bought my Motorola pink Razr phone 2 days ago.  It is pretty in color, and the keypad is awesome.  The picture taking quality seems pretty good.But I haven't been able to do anything else. Here are the problems with the first phone:1. exterior camera did not work 2. the screen was blank with a vertical or horizontal line running through it.3. the image on the interior screen was upside down. 4. The digital data and imagery jumbled together  and it looked like digital vomit on the screen. 5. 2 hours into using my new phone...the phone died. After charging for 4 hours, I discovered the phone felt red-hot.  I unplugged the phone only to discover it did not accept a charge. T-mobile thought for sure I had the 1 in a million truly defective phone.  So I got an exact replacement. I am unable to set up options.  The camera does not work at all and is causing the image on the screen to repeat-blank white to white with the date and battery charge indicator to the blue T-mobile screen saver to black and repeats.  I can do nothing with this new phone.  I really really want this pink phone, but so far...I am not impressed.  Is is really possible to receive the two brand new defective phones within 24 hours of each other?
I live in an area where phone reception is horrible.  Although there are pros and cons with this phone, the majority are pros:Pros:1. Out of all the cell phones my family and I have used, this one takes the shortest time to connect as well2. Clarity with every conversation3. Numerous amount of features.4. aesthetics5. battery life is longCons:1. like most phones and services, accessories and fees for extra services (i.e. for verizon the V-cast feature is aprox $15)2. The camera is good for about a 1.0MP but the zoom blurs once you reach the max 4x.3.  It is rumored that after a few years, the screen blinks.  This is TBD and I personally have not heard of any other technical error(s).In general if you take good care of the phone, the phone should work.
Have tried lots of phones and this is the best I've had. Not only for the color, but also the slim profile allows me to put it in my back pocket and never miss a call like I did when my old bulky phone was in my purse. Sound quality is better than my last Nokia 6600, on both the receiving and talking end. People say they can hear me better now. Highly recommend for function and style.No downsides to this phone that I can see yet, as of 2 months of use.
Yes, The phone is small, adorable, rings cool tunes and we know the rest. My difficulty has been with voice mail.  The phone is "unlocked" but is set up for T-mobile since they are the ones who actually market the pink version.  My voice mail works about 50% of the time and I get a note telling me that I missed a call.  I emailed Motorola and they said that the phone is "flashed" to T-mobile and there is actually nothing they can do and no software to fix it.  So beware of "unlocked" phones.
The Moto RAZR V3 represents an assault on your vision.At first impression, you are struck with its bold magenta color and slim profile.  Surely this can't be a phone!  Once you get it open, you are taken by the intensity of its huge main screen and the clean curvy lines of its backlit keypad.Before the "ooh" factor has worn off, take a tour of its features and you will be blown away.  Motorola didn't skimp on the technology in this model.And oh yeah...  the camera is decent too.  For a phone that comes in a camera.
Cons1. camera color balance is AWFUL. Everything has a bluish purple cast. (motorola blue flip phone camera was good)2. phone randomly shuts down (learned that this is a software problem admitted by tmobile-hey ever thought of FIXING THIS?)3. software interface is TEDIOUS. Take 5 steps backwards to move 1 step is the best way to describe it.4. dropping it (on carpeting) is fun-we all drop them right? the only way to turn it back on is to plug in the charger. try that when you're out and about.5. don't bother with "pay as you go". if you send a picture to another phone on the same account with t-mobile, they run you throuh a sign up here at this website to view the picture (you'll use extra extra minutes on the web)6. GRRRRRRR The phone randomly shuts down --twice while trying to type this review. JUNK JUNK JUNK7. the exterior screen (good idea but cruddy execution) doesn't work all the timePros (stretching to come up with them)1. exterior screen - shows time, battery charge, picture. Lets you close the phone while using the camera.2. basically a pro is that it's a cellphone3. the pink doesn't scratch off easily4. it's pretty slim for the pocketIf my friend asked me if they should get a motorola phone I'd steer them very clear of it.
I live in the UK and have recently - last few months - purchased two separate pink v3's.  To start with i loved it - gorgeous exterior and the large colour screen was gr8.  Also compared to my last motorola the photo quality was good.  All the extra features didn't bother me since i don't use them, all i needed it for was calling and txting - so it would be good if i could get my phone to stay turned on!!Yes - I'd barely had the phone two weeks and the phone started to turn itself off!  Not only this but the screen would every so often show a blank white screen.  Furthermore, when making a call every time i bent over the signal would die.Now you may think that ok she's just got a defective phone but as i mentioned earlier this is my second phone.  Loving the look and convinced it was just that one, i purchased another one from the only store in the uk that sells them.  And again, not two weeks into to having the phone the SAME problems have occured!  You can't tell me that its just a one chance defective phone now - not when the same problems have happened!Plus having recently been into a phone store to ask about repairs i found out that there have been some MAJOR software problems with the v3's!  I am now stuck with a phone i can't use and one i can't replace since i'm down under for 6 months!  Also stuck with dilema of which phone i should get now - i just love the colour and look!So to sum up, by all means buy the phone if all you care about is the colour and look!  Buy it if you want a phone that turns itself off and then wouldn't turn back on again unless you fiddle with the battery!  And finally buy the f**king phone if all you're going to do is look at how pretty it is!Note - the two stars are purely for the look and colour!
I got the Magenta Razr in December. It was defective. I got a big blank screen when it was opened after being closed for just minutes. If you get the phone at T-Mobile it has a 1 year warranty. I used that and my new Razr works just fine and dandy.But the phone sold here on Amazon is way too expensive and is without a warranty...so I'd be weary.
We got this phone when it first came out many months ago (really for my teenage daughter).  The immediate problem I had with this phone was when I went to hold it (hands free) between my ear and shoulder it was extremely difficult and uncomfortable.  You really couldn't used the phone that way for long without suffering a crick in your neck.  I know the old adage about not being too thin but if you are accustomed to propping the phone without an ear piece then you are likely going to be miserable with this phone and shouldn't buy it.  No wonder the phone manufacturer is pushing and bundling the bluetooth earpiece attachment because without it, forget it.  I also have some trouble using to the buttons for dialing the numbers since they are so flat and feel different that you are not sure you are hitting the number unless you watch the numbers appear in the window as you punch them.  There is also just the slightly longer pause let's say from the time you end or clear the last call and the time it takes for the phone to be ready to make the next one; if you start dialing the next call right away you may often find that the first number or two you pushed in the phone number didn't fully register so you need to start over the process of dialing the number again.  If you're used to quick, reliabile dialing it can be another aggravating aspect of using this phone.  Other than all that - it is a beautfiul, sleek, and sophisticated looking phone.  It feels slick and sleek in your hand, not like most phones. It is also a really good size.  I see many men especially having to go see-sawing the head from the ear to the speaker because some these new phones are so compact and tiny.  Size length is really the best on this phone above most all others and should be the industry standard for ease of hearing and speaking.  If you can deal with the problem of the "thinness" interfering with hands free use then I recommend the phone.  I have had no problems with connectivity with this phone thru T-Mobile.
we just upgraded to 3 new razr v3 phones 2 pink and one black.the reception is awful.we always have to redial a second time before the static goes away.once it is connected none of us can hear what are callers are saying, the speaker sucks and there does't seem to be anyway to turn it up to level that one con comfortly say i hear you now.we plan to return them
Stylish AND works great!  What a concept.  The clarity and reception on this phone really blows me away.  I can actually hear the conversation when driving in the car!The price is high and I recommend getting a case.  Amazon lists it as coming with a leather case, but I did not receive one. (**update: Amazon did in fact send me a case for the phone after I inquired about it.  It didn't fit though.  I ended up paying almost 30.00 for one at the Cingular store.) As of yet, they have not got back to me regarding that matter.  A little deceptive about what comes with it, (cases are expensive) but it does not take anything from the phone itself.I love it!(UPDATE*** Also, now that I have had the phone for a while, I wanted to state that some people have stated the battery life isn't good with this phone.  I have had NO problems at all and today is #5 that it hasn't been on the charger.)
I'm truly happy with this phone. I currently live in Paris and the very day I saw it in one of the very few shops that sell it in France I bullied my hubby until he caved in and bought it for me two days later. I've had everything: Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Sagem and a couple of other european brands...and motorola is by far my favorite at everything: the browsing features, the way the addy book works, the button positioning, the ringtones,........ plus I love that it's pink.I haven't dropped it yet (and hopefully I never will) but everything else that has been cited concerning the features doesn't seem to bug me... I didn't buy this phone for its camera nor to have MP3s on it or anything else of the sort (for that I have a digital camera, a palm, a mini iPod -and a pink one I might add)... I bought the Razr to use it as... a phone! And as such it works perfectly well... and did I mention it's PINK???Basically I love it! Everytime I pull it out of my purse people turn to look at me and everyone has commented on how cute it is.... and now, by reading how big it is in the states it only confirms that I made the right choice. AND IT'S PINK, HOW COOL IS THAT???
look every oen keeps complaining this phone turns off  goes blank etc mine did this i admit  but i called the company take the battery out put it back in and only charge the phone when its off i havent a problem since!!! but other then the colour its just a simple tiny phone and  doesnt break like people say
My wife needed a new phone to replace a crappy Cingular phone and we were still under plan, so rather than paying $200 for another crappy phone at the store, she wanted this one.  I actually saved $40 on ebay, but the phone that I received was either a knock off or a cheaply manufactured piece of garbage.  I sent it back and bit the bullet on this one.  My wife loves it, she can hear the person that she's calling and they can hear her clearly.  I don't like spending the $ when most phones are heavily subsidized, but in this case it was worth it.  Easy to use, put in her SIM card, charged the battery and that was it.
The phone is perfect. I've been using it for a few months now, without any problems, came with all accesories and manual. However for internet you do have to contact service provider for settings but it only took 5 minutes. Overall great phone.
My wife loves this phone. We found a package deal in Ebay which included the matching bluetooth headset for less than what Amazon is selling the phone for.The recpetion rivals many of the Nokias I have used in the past. Because the phone is unlocked you have to input your carriers settings (sms, mms, internet, etc) yourself. It is a little time consuming but isn't at all difficult to complete. It's a small price to pay for having a phone your carrier hasn't basterdized.I am thinking about picking a RAZR for myself.
This phone is great! Especially if you upgraded from an ancient model like the v180 and v188. I am such a girls girl and this color of pink actually doesn't make me sick unlike the lighter pink version from verizon out now. I feel alive when I hold this phone. I saw this phone online and fell in love. My phone was delivered and no problems whatsoever! The features are exceptionally great and the screen is very bright and clear. My husband has the pebl and trust me that phone is not that much smaller in size and the features aren't greatly different for the price. I only paid 174.99 for an upgrade and I'm completley satisfied. My phone didn't come with any usb cable for my pc or a belt clip but that's ok with me anyway. My only gripe so far is that the directional button is so flat if you're not paying attention you will hit the wrong thing. Anyway, don't miss out on this phone. It's a limited edition! Perfect gift for any female for any reason at all.
The moment T-Mobile came out with this Razr I knew I had to have it, luckily my fiance was 2 step's ahead of me and got it for my birthday gift, it's one pricey phone, but I gotta say I could not be happier with it. The Magenta color is vibrant, and absolutely beautiful. I have had no problem's with the phone or any of it's function's. It did take some getting used to the slim yet wide feel of it for a while, but other then that it's perfect and I would highly recommend!
This is a great phone,definetely a hot phone for any diva in you--however, unlocked doesn't mean its used for everyone. Verizon will not activate this phone, been there done that. Just hope they come out with their  own magenta razr soon.
I think this is a great phone! I've never had any problem with this phone; speaker is great, volumes easily adjust, picture quality is fantastic and battery lasts for a long period of time! Definitely a reliable phone!
This phone is awesome.  I have only had it for about a month, but I have enjoyed it from day one.  I can truly say that it was worth every penny. My screen did flicker on me one day, put all technology isn't perfect.  I recommend that you definitely go out and buy this phone.
This phone is awesome. You can download songs on it. You can record video, take clear photos and access the net. I would definitely recommend this one.
I just got my first picture message and it wouldn't download. A half hour with Cingular trying to update the software on the phone and another half hour with Motorola and I found out that you can't have any "browsing" features on the Cingular network with the phone I was sold. That means no picture messages.Voice calls and SMS work fine, however. I think for $400 the phone might do a little more.
The phone is cool to look at and thats about it!. The screen is a nice size but the picture quality is awful. The zoom feature is nice but the pictures are still grainy even when totally still and at close range.  What pisses me off the most is that you can not down load your pictures from the phone without buying even more crap from Motorola.  When I got the phone, right away I took a bunch of pictures. When I got home I tried to download them from the phone with no success (no, I didn't read the manual very well the first day!). After literally 4 hours of BS on the phone and internet with Motorola Hildago support, they finally told me I had to spend another $35+ for the "special software" to download pictures (they didn't even know this when I first called so I wasted 4 hrs for nothing). Oh, and you need "Their special cord" or it wont work.  I tried 4 other cords and sure enough, the phone wont even register that they are plugged in. Tried the special Motorola cord and the phone finds the cord here and there but not all of the time. The company says the phone is not broken as the charger cords work but after almost 8 more hours of support calls to their "tech support people", they still can't figure it out so the pictures are stuck in the stupid phone and thats where they'll stay!  (the bluetooth transfer also has problems that tech support can't figure out) Also, for the price of this phone, the over priced software should come as part of the package!!! My husband has the Treo and he can just plug his memory card into the card reader to retrieve pictures. No additional cost!!!!  The reception quality is also nothing near what my previous Motorola flip had!(yes it was old but worked so well I wouldn't trade it until it died). Also with the Razr, If you don't have your ear in just the right place, you wont really hear your caller! The speaker phone is worthless while driving as the smallest bit of road noise makes it so your caller can't hear you!Besides the cool looks, this phone has nothing special to offer!!!
I recently got this phone for Christmas. I love the outside soo much because it is Hot pink and very versatile. The keypad is very cool seeing as it is just like a touch pad. Now the frequent problems i have had with this phone is: 1) It is unable to charge sometimes and i have to take out the battery 2)Its Memory is terrible! for the 2 weeks ive had it now its memory is full 3) its battery lasts for a very short time and you must charge it EVERY night. Now my review is not intitled to disincourage you to buy the phone but if u do you must suffer the consequences. Oh and 1 more reason EVERYONE has it.
You can purchase this phone on ibuyplasma.com for $298.99 and you get the pink razr phone, HS820 Bluetooth headset, a car charger, and belt clip for that price of $298.99!  Can't beat that!
I love the Pink RAZR.  It definitely is flashy and catches the eye, and what else is the point for getting the RAZR.However, being inept with technology, it's a little bit more complicated to get it working the right way than I was led to believe.  With Cingular, I am always roaming.  I don't always get a powerful signal if at all because it's finding the nearest tower, any tower and not Cingular.The signal strength is really the only issue that I have but it's a big one.  Other than that, the phone is really easy to use, a real user friendly phone and works well.
was reading other reviews, and many people are idiots. most of them have a RAZR, but probably not this version. the black or silver one perhaps. the pink'ness of this phone makes is worthwhile.this is the third version, which is the best of all RAZR's. some guy said, want an mp3 player, buy an mp3 player. want a camera buy a camera...etc. well, this handy object has all, not to be the best but to be somewhat a toy. if you buy it for those features, you're stupid. buy it as a phone and see everything else as an extra. i have this pone, an iPod and a digital camera.i love this phone. it's a motorola so it's sturdy. drop it and you're ok, not like a nokia phone. i used to have a nokia phone, and i love nokia because it's so easy to use, but this pink phone was too cute to let up.this hot pink phone is of the "bratty" variety. that's it's unique selling point. don't get me wrong, it's a good phone too...but you can find a cheaper one out there if you don't care what your phone looks like.
Oh sure these phones look good and have neat qualities, but  the damn things cut out when you are talking,. hold no charge at all etc etc.They have been recalled for this reason. I suggest anyonme that buys cell phones avoid buying Motorola. Every phone we have purchased from them SUCKS!
this phone is the best phone with style .. youll love it it has great reception and wonderfull accets... i got this phone when i first heard about it and i never have been happier in my life with this cellualar device.
I've had a Razr since it came out and it's the best phone I have ever used. The sound quality of every call is amazing, even if the phone has little service (which is rare with cingluar in Atlanta). It's almost hard to describe, but after a while it seems to sink in and become even better. Also (responding to the previous statement)"Geez I wonder why people from other countries think that we are sooo materialistic" - The phones were in the UK long before they ever came here so all those people "over there" had the WAY before we knew what a Razr was."I wonder how many needy people that money could have helped feed or clothed right Buffy" - So what you think your $20 that you send to green peace every year helps out so much more than not spending $200 on a phone...how about attacking Bugatti (a car maker) for making a $1,350,000 car, or the people that spend $20+ mill for a house no matter what you say its never going to stop and 200 bucks on a phone is NOT taking place of feeding the poor especially when a phone has become such a mandatory item in American culture."You people agree that the phone basically sucks but oh don't buy it because it can only be used to talk and nothing else but by all means buy it because it's a pretty piece of junk" - I got one when it first came out...accidents happen and it got broken, because I liked the phone so much I bought another one. Right now I'm on my 3rd Razr and I will never own a different phone just because of how nice, simple, easy to use, clear, and yes its looks (I have a black one). So since you made the wonderful comment of feeding the poor lets see you donate the 200 bucks to feeding them...
good day i am mr djubril smith i am intrested in buying the motorola razr v3 gsm camera (pink) if u are intrested in saleing it out to me i will appriciate it.  thanks mr djubril smith
How come the suggested retail for this phone is $249 and amazon is charging so much more than that? Well I guess they are pocketing about a hundred dollars per person who decides to buy the phone on amazon instead of through like tmobile.com or other cell phone websites. The one that amazon sells doesn't even come with a sim card and its like a hundred dollars more than you can get it other places.
This phone gets great service evrywhere i go (Cingular).  It was cheaper than the newer Nokia models that have the same features at the Cingular store, and I didnt have to sign a 2 yr contract.  It doesnt have a camera or iTunes or internet service, but as a phone you cant beat Nokia.
the one i was sent was the silver not blue version but overall, i liked the phone and it was mainly due to the simplicity of the phone.pros:speakerphonespacing of keysinside screenreceptionbattery lifecons:outside display of the contact name and the word "calling" next to it.... it seems redundant to have that.can only have individual ringtones if on the phone itself and not on SIM card.simple functions difficult to find without the help of manual.the cons are minor if you don't mind a few gliches but i recommend this phone for those who want a simple phone with quality over quantity.
Easy to uselong battery lifegood features if looking for a Basic phone
i looked at a couple of the other phones and they were not as good. This one stood out. It was shipped to the wrong house, but othe than that it is great! the voices are crisp and good, and cingular is the best becasue they have the only chat thing. i need a PUK code and they gave it to me. i wish I could give it more than 5
ok. lets get real, your a kid who needs a phone (sometimes parents really do make you have luxuries) and then you want a fli phone with good signal("no "wha? what? wha?" or can you hear me now") and dont forget design... well just go don to radioshack and get one, as in now! it rocks! plus prepaid is easy to follow and use. CINGUALR ROX MY SOX! the best phone since nokia tracphones.
Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR.  Worldwide, it made a fashion and technological statement, which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market.  Then they released a candy bar equivalent (SLVR), and then improved on the RAZR's lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL.  This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days, the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality.  Recently, I have played with Sony/Ericson, PalmOne, Nokia and Samsung phones, and must say the Motorola sounds best.  First of all, the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street, with cars, trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise.  Second, the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level.  Third, and best of all, the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise, so that the person you're speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you're saying.  I have found that Nokia is good at this too, while Palm, Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones don't do this well at all, with Sony ironically at the back of the pack.  Also noteworthy is the speakerphone.  While it's not as loud as an office phone's speaker, it is plenty loud, for example,  to participate in a conference call while driving.  And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone, I was impressed.  Also, it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts, the phone will recognize what you're saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones, but as a designer recently explained to me: form should follow function.  So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone.  Then you can add the bells and whistles later.  Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers: GSM is worldwide, so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA.  However, this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular.  Having used both, I feel that Tmobile sounds better, but Cingular has better coverage.  It's a tradeoff.  Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day "trial" period during which you can test the network's performance.  I recommend use that trial, and don't hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1. Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models "quad-band" GSM, which means the phone will work well in the USA (850/1900 Mhz) as well as the rest of the world (900/1800 Mhz).  Most GSM phones are Tri-Band (850/1800/1900) so while they'll work great here, but performance abroad will be touch and go, with the phone performing poorly indoors.  None of the others (Nokia, Ericson,  Samsung etc.) offer quad-band GSM as a standard, and until Motorola's recent offerings, you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2. Battery life: All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time. But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person?  My answer: 3 to 4 days.  With moderate use (about 10 calls a day, totaling between 30 and 45 minutes), I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3. USB port: the phone's connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port.  The charger fits this, or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable.  This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players (at least the ones that don't use overpriced proprietary cables).  Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC, two things will happen: the phone will start to charge from the USB, and the PC will detect a new device.  Download the drivers from Motorola (if you didn't get the CD with your phone).  In addition to phone drivers, there is a "Phone Tools" application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook, or you can simply backup the phone's contents.  You can synchronize your photos, ringtones and SMS messages as well.  Here's the best part: the phone is also a modem.  Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet, and you no longer need a hot spot.  GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup, EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4. The phone has an alarm built in.  In fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone's highest resolution.  That is a nice touch.And now, three Cons:1. For the longest time, I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface.  Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but Motorola hasn't caught on yet.  If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times.  This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2. The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book; however, for contacts with a custom ringtone, the phone doesn't differentiate between calls and text messages, so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text, the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep, which can be annoying in the middle of the night.  Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you'll avoid that problem.3. The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking "icky".In conclusion, I was happily surprised with the PEBL.  It is a very sexy phone, and it sounds great.  It is the perfect phone for the audiophile, or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days.  Historically, Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL.  If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones (SMS, MMS, etc) - in other words if you plan to use the software features, expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones.  As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware, their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times.  I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface.  Then, the Moto range would dominate.  In the end, it's a good phone, it's solid, it's small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket, and above all it works.
I just got the PEBL and I love it. I had been waiting for its release for several months and it was well worth it. Many of the ticky-tack features that I didn't like in the Motorola RAZR have been corrected here. While not as thin as a RAZR, the PEBL is lightweight. The black cover has a rubberized feel and the oval shape means that it sits comfortably in your hand. The hinged mechanism to open the phone is great - and one of its most distinctive features: One flick of the thumb and the phone gently flips open. The sound quality is great, from video clips to HiFi ringers to speaker phone. It's loud and clear. The camera and video features are decent. Overall, it operates like any other Motorola - the menus are standard. If it bugged you that the Call and End buttons were flipped right to left in the T722 models, Motorola has returned to its senses and placed the Call button on the left and end on the right side. As for fingerprints, they do show up on the cover and key face. The PEBL is still no v60, but it comes pretty close. If nothing else, it definitely has the Wow factor.
I have had the PEBL for two weeks now and it really is as slick as everyone says.  Bluetooth and very good battery life are two of the pluses.  However, as other reviewers have cited, there are flaws:- The directional button is already missing paint in a few places from the screen sliding past it when the phone is opened.  If I am seeing paint missing after only two weeks, I shudder to think what will happen after a few months.- The inside is definitely prone to getting dirty with fingerprints.- The magnets require you to keep the phone away from your credit cards as well as items such as your computer.- The first PEBL I received rang only intermittently.  Sometimes it would ring and others it woudnt do anything.  In these cases, I would only know that calls had been missed once the voice mail indicator showed.  The replacement phone I received now rings with every every call.- Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a sequence of six or so steps and therefore must be done before turning on your car if you are going to talk while driving.  No way can I connect the headset while paying attention to the road.  I have always used corded headsets prior to this and I find this to be annoying.- It took a few tries to get the hang of the voice commands.  I would say "name dial" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found.  However, then I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command.  As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands work fine.- The phone opens when dropped.In summary, if you want a very cool looking, eye catching phone than the PEBL is for you.  However, if you are someone who does not care about the appearance of the phone, I would recommend looking at other models because all of the problems with the PEBL make it only about looks.
Hmmm? What can I say about the phone that everyone seems to want?The Motorola PEBL phone itself, is indubitably eye-catching.  It offers exceptional operation & premium features.The PEBL is one of the most charming phones.  Shaped like a river stone, it's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge. I especially liked the oval shape, the rounded edges, and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty. It's very compact (3.4" x 1.9" x 0.8"; 3.8 ounces), and it has weight when it's in your hand.As for features... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date. I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen. Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3's. I also appreciate the camera, vibrate mode, a one-minute voice recorder, voice dialing, calculator, calendar, alarm clock, text & multimedia messaging, PC syncing (my favorite!!), instant messaging ( with Yahoo, AOL, and/or ICQ), and a Web browser.  You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers, themes, menu styles, color skins, screensavers, and message tones. You can always download more depending on your service provider.Ok, now the bad.  The PEBL has a low-resolution camera (whaaa), and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb.  The flip opens when dropped and can demagnetize credit cards.Would I buy the PEBL again? Yes.  Would I recommend it to others? Sure.  Who couldn't say 'yes' to such a looker?!!?!
This phone is a delight to hold and a pleasure to feel. It's unusual shape makes it stand out from other phones. Very STYLISH !But, has very limited in built memory of 5 MB which can not be extended. Camera quality is not much to talk about. It weighs much more than Razr V3.It takes some time to get used to the flip mechanism and there is a real danger of phone falling off your hand  when you try it for the first few times.
I have had this phone for two months now and it is the best one I have owned,I have had three razr's and many other so called cutting edge phones even the V3i and none are as good as this,as for the pebl it is simple to open unless you are a butter fingered fool,and as for the finish wearing off on the keypad well mine is just fine.The phone is made better than the flimsey Razr is,you want a quality phone that works as well as it looks get this phone,you want cheap made buy something else.
1. I will have to say first the design is very nice and small I wanted a small phone so I did like this phones size and it does look sexy2. Great screen color.3. Decent navigation through the phone4 Picture quality is average  could be a bit better my friends nokia 6101 takes better photos.5. Great phone ringer sound quality and battery is very good 2 days with use6. Speaker phone so-so the speaker is on the back so its a pain to listen and talk to at the same time.7. the keys are a little cramped have to get used to using them and they are shinny yes they get smudged all the time.8. The reception for me was average sometimes spotty cutting in and out of conversations at times.9. The other big problem was that if your keep this phone in your pocket or put pressure on the clam design the keys begin to etch themselves into the screen so you can see the outline of the keys from being in the closed position so do not put a lot of pressure on the clam when closed because over time you will see this problem.Overall I think its a decent phone but for the $250 I think it should be cheaperI paid $150 with contract upgrade dont really think it was worth that much $50-$100 would have been better
With the unique design, seems like this could have been a really cool phone, but some of the problems I experience, make it fall short.GOODLooks damn cool and not many people have it.The automatic flip open looks cool and is convienent.  I really like this option.Fits easily in your pocket.Rubberish coating makes it easy to grip.Lazor etched keypad doesn't wear out.Uh... not much else for me!BADThe action of sliding the top down causes physical wear and tear on the phone.  I've only had the phone a few months and am not someone with the phone glued to my head; however, the metallic coating over the bottom directional button is already worn off from rubbing against the screen. The screen has a permanent imprint of the directional pad on the screen from the sliding as well as a quarter inch scratch caused my the screen sliding over the center directional button.Not sure if this is related or not to the above problem, but I'm slowly loosing the bottom of the screen. Not the physical screen itself, but the image.  It's tricky to describe but it reminds me of when you scan a picture and abruptly pull the picture from the scanner right at the end.  Right now, I've lost 2/8" inch of visibilty on the bottom of the screen.As someone else mentioned, the automatic opening works by pulling down the top with your thumb and then letting go.  Essentially, the phone pops open while it's resting on your hand.  For a moment, you are not really holding the phone at all.  More the once, the phone has popped out of my hand when opening.Impossible to read the screen in sunlight.It is difficult to read time accurately on the analog clock.  There is no option to change it to digital.Camera quality is poor.When my bluetooth headset is enabled, I cannot change the ringer or ringer volume.I cannot get the phone to send text messages.  I had the same problem with my Razor.If this where a $100 phone, no problems. But for this price... not worth it.  You're really just spending your money on the cool look and flippy thing.
I bought this unlocked cell phone (though I got the teal version) the last time I was in the US, for use for me in China.It has been a dream for me to use.  The Bluetooth features have been a little more friendly to use than on my previous (locked) RAZR v3.  The pictures the phone takes often look pretty reasonable.  The opening/closing mechanisms work well, with no signs of damage in the month I've used the phone.  I would say that my only complaint is that I don't yet understand the voice commands yet.So, I would recommend the use of this phone, easily!
I ordered this product from Amazon directly (not from a third party, although it appears amazon doesn't sell it anymore), and while they sent me a new, functional, phone like I had ordered, it is not the US version.  The first hint was that when I opened the box the charger was the continental Europe-style charger (two round prongs).  The second hint was that the spellings of some of the menus are in the Queens english ("Personalise" for example).  The phone is working fine with my US provider's SIM card (Cingular) and they did include an adapter for the charger, but it sticks out of the wall almost 5 inches now as a result.  4 Stars for the phone, but 2 for Amazon for not making it clear what I was getting.
I've only had this first for about a week, but so far I LOVE IT!!!! I've had many many cell phones, a new one every 4-6 months, and so far this is my fav! I like the rubber like shell of the phone. It was alittle weird at first but play with it for 30mins and you'll love it too!
i got this phone because it looked nice and it does.  but in terms of functionality and usability it is at the bottom of the list.  motorola interface is very counter intuitive and it took a bloody long time to send one text message out.  to top it off the pairing of bluetooth devices didn't work autmoatically.  everytime i wanted to connect to my toyota prius i had to press about 6 buttons.  i got tired of this and ended up selling my pebl.  if you want a real phone get a k800i by sony.
It didn't take me very long to pick out this phone from the lineup at the store; it just looks and feels totally differnt from all of the other phones.  Yes, I love all of the features, but really, I love how it feels.  My previous phones feel so cheap now compared to this.  It's solid; it firmly flips up and confidently closes with a snap.  The black, exterior coating is unlike anything I have ever felt before.  It reminds me of a rubber coating, but is much more solid, as it turns out, the coating is actually paint.  Imaging a cross between a rubber coating and a car finish.
I love my pebl now that the bugs are worked out.  Amazon is selling phones intended for distribution in Mexico or another Spanish speaking company.  This was confirmed by Motorola when I gave them the code of my phone.  My phone was shipped with a 100% Spanish manual and the phone turned on in Spanish.  Luckily, my SIM card switched it to English so I didn't have to hunt for the correcto Espanol button.  When I told Amazon about the mixup they could care less.  They told me to contact Motorola and gave me the wrong number.  When I complained further they gave me a link where I could download the manual.  No thanks.  I live in the US and I paid for a English hard copy manual.  Bottomline, my phone works but I no speaky spanish so I am out of luck.  Stay away.  Amazon has major issues.
After my dreadful V551, I was hesitant to return to Motorola. Since my Sony Ericsson S710a didn't work out, and since my wife's V3 has been solid so far, I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.First, the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT. The machined aluminum outer casing, and machined nickel keypad, provide substantial heft (this is good) and tactility. Moto could've used a little better plastic in places, but it's fine otherwise.Second, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.Third, unlike Sony Ericsson, the new Moto's (V3i, SLVR L7, etc.) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port, and use standard memory cards. (I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing.) No more proprietary chargers and cables, nor goofy Sony-only "Memory Sticks."Fourth, the Bluetooth. Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation, and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson's, it is almost unshakable in its stability. (Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend. The T616 had great Bluetooth, the S710a's was unstable. The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable.) Range is excellent, too.Fifth, reception and call quality are both excellent. Volume could be better, but is still adequate. I have to admit, though, that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.Finally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.My only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes, even with the memory card upgrade. However, I'm an iPod owner, so this doesn't concern me too much.Now for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't "see" any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better. Caveat emptor!
I got this phone a couple days ago and I am very impressed it has some pros and cons. I never used a regular v3 so I can't really compare it to that. I don't understand what one of the reviews was talking about saying the phone book is hard all you have to do is start search then you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it'll take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter, but thats neither here nor there.Some things you want to consider before you order this unlocked non North American version of this phone. Not all V3i's come with itunes, only Australia, NZ, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Turkey, South Africa, Rest of Africa, North Africa, Israel, Thailand, and finally Middle East versions of the V3i come with itunes. Is the one amazon is selling from one of those markets I don't know, I got mine off ebay. But even if it doesn't come with itunes you can still listen to mp3s off of it within the motorola mp3 player software which I think is called Digital Audio Player or DAP for short.Alright the phone feels and looks great, and the camera quality is damn good considering the size of this phone and the fact that is indeed a PHONE with a CAMERA and not a CAMERA with a PHONE. Here is a link to a picture I took with the camera at work. [...] . This phone is semi customizable like being able to change your wallpaper and having your own mp3 ringtones, via a usb cable. Like I said my version came with cable, data software, itunes and stereo head phones I don't know what this version comes with. Next I'll list pros and cons.PROS:Small sizeLooks GreatGood reception and sound qualityCustomizable featuresMp3 player capabilitiesTakes fine photos and videoIn my opinion easy to use and straight forward navigationSpeaker phone is loud and clearCONS:iTunes seems to limit the number of songs you can have depending on what size transflash you have. For example with my 256 card it only lets me have 50 songs and on a 512 card it'll only let you have 100 songs.A delicate phone, I use extra caution handling this phoneFront screen resolution could be better, but gets the job doneIncluded java games suckIn closing I think this phone is well suited for me, by being slim, customizable and having mp3 playback. Even if it does cap me at 100 songs my walk to and from work is quite a short distance anyway this way I can just keep the ipod plugged in the car and just use my phone for music.
I purchased this phone unlocked about two months ago.  I am not sure why it is not readily available in any US store.  There seems to be a lot of confusion out there about this phone.  The V3I is awesome.  Hands down the best cell phone device that I have EVER purchased.  The itunes capability is great, even though the song limit is 50, it works great as an ipod back up.  The sound is as good as you can expect and you can listen to your itunes songs over the speaker without having to use any headphones.  The best thing about this phone is the removable transflash card that can be used (up to 1gb) that can be used to store songs, use as a thumb drive, or whatever you would need a 1gb worth of space for. In addition, the one megapixel camera is a definite upgrade from the old V3.  Also, the video capability is awesome.  Unlike its predecessor's, the V3i will take as long of video as your memory will hold (three minutes, thirty minutes etc).  The looks and feel of this phone are amazing too.  The gunmetal look stands out among the sea of normal RAZR phones. Also, I love the front blue light, which you can program to flash differently for different things.  The only problem with the phone is the fact that you cannot purchase it at any United States phone dealers.  You either have to purchase it here or someplace like eBay. I purchased mine on eBay for about $250.  Go for this one, you wont be disappointed.
As of 2/6/2006 - most Mac users are able to sync via USB or Bluetooth but not through both - it seems to depend on where the product was intended for (Euro or Asia) but it seems to be able to sync through one or the other.As for the address book problem (s), Motorola has also updated the software along the way but unlike computer OSes, it's not always readily apparent. I'm not exactly sure if the reviewer with the multiple address problem has tried this:"Just change the "sort by" option in the address book setup to "Name". Then add numbers to the names instead of making new entries."That sounds like it should resolve it.There is one other caveat. If you want the iTunes software in the phone, the US version right now does not come with it and neither does the Euro version but apparently the Asian/Middle East version do ... huh? Yea - who knows what's going on.Still a great phone - just too much work for everything :-)
My post is mainly for the bad review given by Giovanni.I got my Razr v3i for my wife, and got it from ebay.Mine is not defintely for American, but in any case, I do not have any problem with1. isync, so no need to edit  But I agree with "denomalizing", this is same as other moto phone.2. No hard reset so far3. itunes works with NO problem.  itunes' m4p also works.  In fact, the only reason I bought this is itunes, but I have to add : sound quality is mediocre. (It doesn't matter with my wife, since she doesn't have keen ear).  In ebay, there are some items - instructions to add itunes to this phone - at 10-30 dollars. I didn't try it yet and I didn't hear the success story. But it seems to me that it is possible to add, even if it only has moto's mp3 player.So, basically, I do not have any (significant) problem and I did not pay $349. My complaint would be no regular headphone jack and no bluetooth ad2p profile.  I got the phone (ebay), 1gig transflash sd (amazon) and stereo headphone (from ebay) and three year warranty from ebay and in total, I paid $300. I don't think it is much cheaper than ipod nano + cheap phone, but it is very nice to have two in one piece.
This is the best phone I ever owned.  Reception is very good, battery life is good, ring is audible, and quality of voice is very good.  Mine already came with ear phone, USB cable, leather case and 256MB memory card.  There are a few things that are not so good: - Need to clean cover frequently (it gets easily smudged); - MP3 sound is not perfect (well this is a phone not a MP3 player); - Once when I switched the GSM card it reverted to Kanji characters and I had a hard time to find the English option ;)
the phone is sick.. i found it more like a device to get girls.. the phone looks sexier than any other models you like. only problem is my ear piece broke so i had to use  the speaker everytime i make a phone call. other than that its a cool phone. people give this phone horroble ratings because of one thing, like the first one who rated this phone on amazon. he said the voice recognition sucks. yes at first i had trouble with it but the trick is you have to speak the word correctly and how you would actually  say it. talk like the phone does.
My V3i shipped w/ a 256mb card and itunes allowed a maximum of 50 songs.  Bought a 512mb card and still only 50 songs.  Hope someone can hack this soon since card can fit far more.Otherwise I am very satisfied with the phone's other features.UPDATE:iTunes not compatible w/ bluetooth either.  Once bluetooth module is connected, itunes continues playing but not audible through headset.
Excellent phone overall with one limitation unless I am doing something wrong:When you start search, you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it'll take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter, but no second letter search to narrow the look up.eg. If I am looking for Moly, I will get all the M's and will have to scroll down from MA... all the way to MO...Is that a good thing or am I wrong ?
This is by far the best phone I ever owned.  The features on this phone are great.  The phone looks awesome too (better than the V3).Pros:iTunes music playerpretty loud speaker1.3MP cameragreat receptiongreat screenCons:can only download AAC format songstakes a long time (sometimes) to download musicOther then that this phone is awesome and I recommend it to anyone!
this is the best phone in the world!!!!!! it has a excellent camera, its slim and sleek, the front is cool, it has a good speaker phone, and its for the best plan, cingular! i highly reccomend you get this phone. oh i forgot to mention, IT PLAYS ITUNES!!!!!so you can replace your ipod with this. the best way to get this phone is off of ebay. I got mine for about $200 and it was brand new,sealed in the box. the price may seem expensive, but some people ask for more than $400! the US will not be getting this phone for a while so i suggest you get it NOW before it is too late!!!
I would like to share with you my (very bad) experience with this product so you don't come across the same bad experience I do. I have had it for 3 days and tried almost every possible feature and read the accompanying documentation.My previous cell phone:I had the Sony-Ericson T610 and I was quite happy with it I must say. The only issue is that it was getting old (three years already). I wanted to change it because:- It did not have "out of the box" any way to synchronize contacts with my PC (ok Bluetooth, but no software provided and my PC would have needed a very expensive Bluetooth adapter).- No MP3 player.- Its display is very difficult to read specially under sunny day light.- It is very slow and annoyingly lagging (seems to be the Java running on it).Apart from these, it is -in my opinion- the best phone ever, user friendly, lot of great options, navigation and facilities and the T610 do really synchronize wit my Apple iBook.The new phone Motorola V3i:Pros:- The phone V3i is indeed very appealing, most appealing at least for me was the fact that it has all "advance level" phone features like e.g. QuadBand, GPRS Class 10 / Bluetooth / USB, etc.- Especially nice the MP3 player with expandable memory and it works ok, the music hears laud enough as to have (while wearing the stereo headset) one colleague of mine complaining 4 yards away from me :). The phone comes with a card of 64MB, rather too little for the high price.- It also includes software to synchronize with your PC whether through USB or Bluetooth. But please note I mentioned only PC, Mac users do not have a chance with it, read on.- Finally it has a very nice design, it is quite eye catching and rather easy to handle. This is the main reason I attribute to the fact that everyone wants it.Cons:- Totally excludes Apple Mac users and this is not stated in the system requirements on the box (btw there is no system requirements on the box) not even in the very poor Users Manual. Hence, no way to get any contacts into my little iBook, no Mac software included. Not even using iSync, iSync *does not support* this phone. Please have a look at:  [...]  if you see the phone V3i listed there, please let me know. Also google for "iSync Motorola V3i" to find a large list of frustrated users.- Very poor written documentation at least the Users Manual in German, Italian, French versions. They only took a bit of effort in explaining the trivialities and leave out the important information e.g. you do not find anywhere how to manage contacts i.e. *search contacts*. Funnily you find something like 3 pages explaining how to open and close the phone.- The software included with the phone "Motorola Phone Tools" from AvantQuest is a baby's joke e.g. in the middle of the synchronization it would continuously ask you to delete all of your Outlook contacts with no setting anywhere stating to delete anything. It would hang eventually until you restart your computer times enough as to feel like throwing phone and computer over the window. The software is in general very complicated, it would ask you for every contact, one by one to repeat the same action again and again, so be ready to be very very very patient with it.- Synchronization could not be more user unfriendly: I did not find anywhere stated that the phone had to be *closed* while synchronizing, I just found out only because of the fact that I got continuous synchronization errors. When you get errors you can only abort and there is no information given (synchronization log "Error found." cool).- Software documentation is and old-fashioned 5-pages marketing material subset of the phone written manual. If they invested so much time developing the fancy application phone "look and feel" they could have at least explained that the crappy phone e.g. denormalizes the contact data or that it discriminates Mac users.- This beautifulness of phone is or at least imports contact information from SIM cards or Outlook in an **incompatible** way than the usual design of contacts data, meaning how contacts are organized in Outlook or even other phones like Sony-Ericson i.e.  Instead of saving contact like should be:  Name: Manuel Peres  Cell: 111111111  Home: 555555555  Email: manuel.perez@email.me  The V3i saves it like:  Manuel Peres (111111111 Cell)  Manuel Peres (555555555 Home)  Manuel Peres (manuel.perez@email.me Email)Meaning they denormalize or repeat the same contact information (name, address etc) for every different phone or email information. This makes it a real perfect mess for any user to handle e.g. say you realize you made a mistake and want to change in your phone "Manuel Peres" to "Manuel Perez" SO guess what? you have to change three records! instead of changing it only once! This problem has a name in Database Design and is called "Update Anomalies" (google it please). The same situation goes also for addresses. The same happens if you need to send e.g. via Bluetooth the contact, then you must do it three times, once for each different registered phone! plus it will be received as three different contacts on the receiver side! oohhh dear!- The functionality offered with the phone is very poor. You do not have any way to search a contact by name or the reverse lookup. Instead you have to search a number navigating the contacts one by one each phone number or ease the pain filtering by category. So go figure if you have over 200 contacts that are flattened for each different phone number makes it 200*(3 phones each approx.)=600 entries to navigate one by one! namely SUCKS. Actually you can use a "speed number" assigned to each phone number ... so ... you would need to remember something like e.g. 345 is the "speed number" assigned to 3051111111. Well if you have to remember the speed dial number 345 then just save in your brain the next 4 digits and get the phone number itself LOL.- Yes it has MP3 playing functionality that works sometimes i.e. it however does not support iTunes m4p format, so forget about copying from iTunes folder directly to the V3i memory card => unrecognized format. Many mp3 files that work on the PC are not recognized either, do not ask me why. Not to mention it takes something more than 10 minutes to copy 50MB, and I have a very fast PC with USB 2.0- So little time owning it, and have got already several total phone crashes and hangs. The only solution have been a hard restart ... thankfully though, and at least, the crash display is not blue but white (just for a change).- Be sure to allocate some additional bucks in your budget to buy the expensive headsets for this phone, because motorola made sure to make the connector incompatible with any ordinary headset. For example, here in Switzerland you do not find the motorola stereo headset anywhere, so mp3 player without  headset :). I got mine somehow.That said, there is no lower score I can offer for this expensive crap.Please accept my apologies. I only write reviews when I am extremely happy or extremely frustrated. In this case it is unfortunately the later. My advice is if you are planning to get a professionally designed cell phone device that is not just a crappy but good looking and very expensive MP3 player,please sleep well and look somewhere else.Good luck!- Giovanni
And I can sync my phone just fine. Over USB anyway. iSync recognizes the phone and syncs it perfectly.I love this phone with a very few exceptions.1. It didn't have AIM installed by default, I still don't have it because you need to use a PC proram to modify the phone to enable AIM and I use a Mac.2. There are no BT profiles on the unit I purchased.3. Since the phone hasn't been released in the US yet, Motorola won't give US owners support on the phone.Other than that I'm happy with it. I'd suggest that you buy one from a place where you can try out the phone first to make sure nothing you want is missing before you get it.
Nice color dark grey purple. The unit is not a US model. It has an adapter to plug it in. It won't send pictures or text with T mobile as it is not one of their phones. It does work for the sim card...
i jusy bought the v3i and i liked alot the only poblem i had with this phone is that is a little fragil.Besides this it a very good and cool celular phone and i recomend this for to anyane who want to buy a phone.
I haven't use it yet because I'm still in the US and I bought it to use it in Venezuela. But, as far as I've cheked it, it looks like is in great conditions and working perfectly. It's very elegant and sharp looking, and the graphic interface is great and very easy to use
It works in US, but the charger comes as European charger; with a US adapter.  It's strange that Amazon is selling this phone only to the USA when it's a non USA phone...The most important feature it is missing for me is the Autoupdate Date/Time from the network or service provider.  According to Motorola it because it's not a US phone.  It's frustrating if you travel and the clock does not update.
Giovanni, everything you said about this phone is true.  The setting up of the Contacts is the most idiotic set up I have ever seen.  There is a way to search for contact with out having to go through all of them individually, but it is so complicated and the manual is of no help and I already forgot how I managed to set it up.  The phone's menu's differ greatly from the manuals description of what they are.  Needless to say , I was happier with my old Nextel that was 3 years old too.
well, i'm in the military and was on a mission in the Phillippines.i heard the hype on Cnet 2006 and went out to get a V3i phone.as u will find out from readings,it says that the countries that have iTunes in it are Phillipines included.well, let me say...thats horse crap.mine doesnt come with Itunes and it says it clearly on the side of the box @ the bottom side"V3i generic Non-iTunes Hgm." meaning there isnt a iTunes in it but the other MP3 player software instead.you can also read elsewhere on the net about the ones that have iTunes...the message button is replaced with a iTunes icon instead.so, that verified my V3i.just be careful before u buy anywhere and ask to see the side of the box where it describes what kinda phone model it is.i'm trying to go back to the store before i leave this country and see if they can exchange it for the real deal"iTunes". further report later.
If you choose English as your language, then the system does NOT allow you to customize voice settings for each name on your phonebook. The built in voice recognition system attempts pathetically to mismatch with any available name. In the previous RAZR, we COULD go to individual phone numbers assign a voice to that number.Motorola has really smart hardware engineers and but some really dumb ones who believe that all world's english speakers have certain type of enunciation, modulation and speed.
I have had the original razor since it came out.  On Valentines Day my sister bought a pink V3i.  I have played with both phones.  I had to teach her how to use hers.This is my opinion...they are exactly the same except for 2 things.1-the V3i has a video camera and the V3 doesn't2-the battery on the V3i has been updated and seems to hold a charge alot longer than the V3.Other than that, they are the same.
The product was good and the product was shipped on time too.
This is my life. Finally, my very spirit incorporated in a physical object.Death, where is thy sting?
WEll i just recived my motorola razor v3i and for some reason the sender found it nessicary not to send me half of the accessories i needed for my phone to work in the mannor it was ment for.  And to top it off they do not have a way for me to contact them for me to recive the rest of the things they neglected to send me.  So i do not recommend buying this product from this site.  If they railroaded me with their hijinx who knows who else they are tying to give the shaft to.
I just gave it one star because I know that when you look for reviews people look at the bad reviews, so I wanted to catch your attention..This is a PERFECT phone!I can not believe the nonsense people write here, I was afraid that when I will buy it I will not have the ability to search people, or to pick up the phone with out hitting the speaker phone.Up until know I still don't understand what the HELL they where talking bout?The speaker phone button is INSIDE the phone, there is no way of pushing it, plus you can not put any button on the side unless you are total clumsy.When you want to search people you can search them in two ways, like in nokia or search engine, I really don't understand the people who write here, maybe they talk about the older v3 model.
This is a very nice phone.  Call reception and battery life are excellent on the Cingular network.  The iTunes features work fine but it won't replace my iPod nano any time soon.  This phone has a very solid feel to it.  The SLVR is not without flaws but show me a phone that isn't.PROS:Very solid, slim and sexy.iTunesQuad bandExpandable memoryExcellent receptionExcellent battery lifeBluetoothCONS:Camera (0.3 megapixel is pathetic in this day and age)No high speed data (EDGE)100 song cap on iTunes (not shocking, Apple still wants to sell iPods)No dedicated headphone jack ( form over function compromise)USB 1.1 transfer is VERY slowSame old Moto OS ( Contacts list Stinks)Conclusion:If you're looking for a very sexy looking phone that has excellent reception and battery life I can think of no better choice than the SLVR.  If you need a smart phone or all the latest bells and whistles there are better choices.
Update - Cingular sent me a replacement for my SLVR.  It has the same problems.  That's three phones out of three - two for me and one for my daughter - with the same problem.  Lockups and intermittent operation.  I finally figured out part of the problem.  Whenever an attempted voice dial fails, whether it was an intentional dial or an accident of pressing the button by mistake or pressing the headset button too long, then the phone will not make or receive any calls until you power it off and on again.  At least now, if I am really careful how I handle it, my phone works most of the time.  My suggestion is not to buy this phone for another 6 months or a year!Original review follows:This is a great phone when it works.  There was a report this week on CNN about the RAZR phones that were sold late February 2006 and early March 2006 being recalled for a software bug.  It is my guess that the SLVR, which is a close relative of the RAZR, has the same bug because my SLVR only works about half the time.  Most of the time, when I try to make a call, the display will say "Calling xxxxxxx" but it just hangs there until I click End, even up to 20 minutes with nothing happening.Any time I don't use my bluetooth headset for a few hours and then try to use it, the bluetooth on the phone will have quit working and to get it working again, I have to power the phone off and on again.My daughter has the same phone and has the same problems.When it works, though, it is a great phone.  The iTunes holds only 100 songs, like the other reviews said, but that's an iTunes issue - it treats this like an iPod Nano.Cingular is sending me a replacement for my SLVR and, hopefully, it will work better and have these issues resolved.  In the mean time, I suggest giving more time for the bugs to be worked out.  Once it becomes more reliable, I would highly recommend the phone.
I must say I was a bit shocked when I read some of the negative reviews. I buy a new cell phone every couple of months. I got this SLVR thru Cingular. But I like new gadgets. So, sometimes I buy an unlocked phone and change the sim. I have tried countless phones from Nokia, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson and Panasonic. This is my favorite so far. It is thin, sleek and easy to operate. I always laugh when I hear people complain of the Motorola menu or interface. These are people that most-likely started out on a different brand and expect every cell phone manufacturer to use that same menu. Every brand has their quirks. And, most cell phone users have their quirks.On my SLVR I have 50 songs loaded with room for that many more. It accepts the super-small Transflash card, included. I love the fact that there is also an included connection from the USB port that allows you to use your own headphones. In addition, no one makes better bluetooth headsets than Motorola and this phone connects to it easily, with a crisp clear sound.The only thing I would change is the color. It is a deep, almost black, brown color. I would prefer silver or matte black. I have not encountered any software problems and I have had the phone since the first week it came out.
This phone is great! I love everything about it; size, function, quality, battery life, iTunes. The ONLY negative thing I can say about it is that it has USB 1 and not the faster USB 2. But the phone charges itself while it's connected to the computer updating iTunes so the slow download doesn't bother me.Apple has limited the phone to 100 songs. The 512MB micro card is sufficient for about 75 songs at a time (saved at 192kb) - not a 60GB iPod, but plenty for on-the-go music enjoyment. The iTunes integration with the phone is very nice; sleek and easy, but you cannot use iTunes for ringtones (those MP3's are stored in on the internal 5MB memory - like on other phones that utilize MP3 ringtones).
Honestly, I really do like my SLVR. It's sleek and it does everything it's supposed to do. But there is one major problem: the iTunes volume control. iTunes has volume settings 0-7, with "0" being silent. The problem is that setting "1" is as loud as my regular ipod turned up to 2/3 of its maximum volume! this is just too loud a lot of the time. I couldn't use it in the office or when I wanted to listen quietly. It's even a little too loud for walking around outside.I contacted Motorola about this, but they denied that it was a widespread problem and said they had no plans to fix it, even though it has been mentioned in reviews of the phone. I was forced to do a sloppy fix by buying some new headphones with an in-line volume control. This works for listening to iTunes, but creates another problem. With the included heaphones, if the phone rings while you are listening to music, you can just press a button on the cord to answer. With any other headphones, you must fish the phone out of your pocket and disconnect the cord before you can answer. It's not a major thing, but it is an annoyance.
I got an unlocked SLVR a couple weeks ago and am really pretty happy with it.  As a prior user of three Sony Ericsson phones, I became used to their intuitive user interface and how seamlessly they synched up with my Mac and PC. There's also a lot of software available for the SE's.  It's possible that the SLVR is still too new, and that's the reason for the limited the level of intependent software available for it.  The phone reception is a bit better than the SE (T610) and tends to work in places my T610 didn't.  The music interface on the SLVR works just like iTunes (songs, genres, albums artists, etc.), but it doesn't sync up via iTunes on your computer like your iPod does.  Rather you must drag+drop the music onto the phone's SIM card (there are a couple different ways to do this, which aren't too difficult) It's just too bad this isn't seamless via iTunes like the Cingular versions. As for new software/firmware updates, I spoke with R&D; at Moto, and they said there aren't any plans to make the non-Cingular versions compatible with iTunes, nor are they working on a Mac version of their synching software.  The phone does sync nicely if you use iSync to sync it with your Mac Address Book or Entourage, however.  In all I recommend this phone for many of its useful features and stunning good looks... and I'm just getting used to keying and scrolling through the somewhat antiquated and cumbersome address book.
After reviewing dozens of quad-band multi function phones, I decided on Cingular's Motorola SLVR7 and am not disappointed in it at all.  It is very easy to set up and use--and I'm an over 50 grandmother who is a musician.  It's perfect for my orchestral work because I can load it with the music I'm getting ready to perform and listen while I'm on a plane, etc.  I'm glad I didn't buy an MP3 player because this is like a twofer!  It has great reception as a phone and the signal is strong and clear.  I can actually hear it when it rings inside my purse.  Excellent!  And, I bought the hot pink one--of course!
This review is for the Cingular version of SLVR 7, not the unlocked version.  It's not clear why the vastly more popular RAZR isn't available in the US with iTunes rather than the less spectacular SLVR model.  I've always had flip phones.  I like them for compactness and their screen/keyboard protection.Basically SLVR is RAZR in a candy bar form factor.  It's a little too tall to fit in a pants pocket for sitting down.  As this is a new phone, accessories are hard to come by, including custom holsters.iTunes works as advertised.  The interface is adequate if not a peppy as an iPod.  The 100-song limit is a mystery except maybe they wanted to disguise the slow upload speed.  It has a very PC-like interface so it's pretty clunky to navigate. (Rumors of Apple designing a phone make me hope that finally a firm with some user interface expertise will enter the cell phone market!)Motorola's radio electronics are the best in the business, but the rest of the hardware is poorly designed.  The keyboard is difficult to use.  I have to press the keys with my fingernails to not double press keys -- and I have small hands!  The bizarre EMU Port isn't compatible with anything, so can only use Motorola's awful headset with the phone AND iTunes.  There are no quality stereo headsets with microphones (wired or unwired) that will allow you to use both as of this writing.  I suspect this is true for RAZR as well.  My phone did come with a 3.5mm adapter to plug in good headphones, but when the phone rings you have to unplug the EMU adapter to answer a call.  I tried using an adapter with my 2.5mm headset but I could only hear sound for system tones and iTunes. When it switched to phone mode, the sound was muted and apparently the microphone didn't work either. The phone needs an ESC(ape) key to help dig yourself out of dead-end menus for which none of the 3 choices is what you want.  It could also use a HOME key to quickly take you back to the top menu, rather than having to go backward 15 levels.I could live without the camera, which takes only fair pictures.  Many places now confiscate your phone if it has a camera. The Cingular version wastes a lot of valuable storage real estate with silly "protected" images and movies that you can't delete.The web browser is too slow, clunky (and expensive on Cingular) to be useful. I downloaded a few games.  This was easier to do on my computer then have them sent to the phone.  Their performance is acceptable but the screen is really too small -- if you want games, I'd suggest something the size of a Blackberry.  Also, the phone keypad is pretty useless if you want to do any kind of text messaging.Although the manual says you can't use iTunes for ringtones (which is true) you can use standard mp3s.  You just have to connect the USB cable and drag them to the mounted RAM card, then move them to the phone RAM and assign the tone. You could also email them to yourself.  Any music or sound effect could be used as a ring tone but you will need some kind of editing software (or use Trim in Apple Quicktime) to keep the length under 20 seconds.  Copy protected material will have to be burned to CD first then re-imported.  It seems silly to pay $2 for a 20 second ringtone when you could buy the whole song on iTunes (or perhaps you already paid for it), but you will have to go through a few steps to prep it for ringtones.  Just to be clear though, you can't use ringtones directly from iTunes, you can only use sounds stored in the multimedia folder.SLVR syncs (using iSync) with my Macintosh calendar and address book very well.  Each phone number on someone's "card" in your address book becomes a separate "card" in the phone, so this can be a bit of a hassle to scroll through.  You'd get even more cards if you turn on the mail and fax number feature (defaults off).  The calendar sync has a bug duplicating repeating events with each sync.  Otherwise the functionality of the phone calendar and phone book are acceptable.The voice recognition feature works fine but unlike phone network-based systems, you will have to teach the phone each name (twice). A daunting task for several hundred names.Voicemail integration with Cingular is non-existent.  It dials the voicemail number but then you're on your own with a generic DTMF interface.  They on-screen commands do nothing.The phone has fax capabilities but apparently no scripts to interface with computers. And I couldn't find any for RAZR either. This seems to me to be part of basic business functionality. Sure you could fax a note from the text interface on the phone...you might have this sentence typed in 2 hours.This is the first new phone I've bought in 5 years and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the overall lack of integration to the phone network and standard computer peripherals.  Manufacturers waste too much R&D; on coming up with new designs and geeky gimmicks like ring tones while you still can't send a fax from your PC.
THis is the first music playing phone I have used(so can't comment on others in the market). I have always respected Motorola's quality. This phone comes upto their standards. There are lot of positives and small negatives from this eye turner.Positives:1. Blue tooth. Offers TransFlash memory expansion slot which gives users the flexibility to expand the memory by up to 512MB.2. Very nice design, good battery life.3. Amazing color display(along the lines of razor)4. ofcourse being able to play music(it plays only itunes at this point), but some folks are pointing to me that it can play mp3; i need to research that aspect. If so, that is great too.Small Negatives:1. Not so flashy camera, very limited capability compared to SOny music phone.2. It does not have FM yet.Irrespective of the small negatives, it is a fantastic phone to carry around and it has that advantage of being able to play music.
Please be aware that the phone shipped by ACE Digital Club is from GermanyDoes not include any of the items that come with the phone in USDoes not have a memory flash card, does not have the earphone attachmentThe User Guide is in GermanAnd the software can not connect with iTunesNeither Motorola nor Cingular support this PHONE fro ACE DIGITAL CLUB - do not buy it from them
I got the SLVR for a birthday present, and I have to say this is probably the most amazing cell phone I've ever seen. It's unbelievably easy to figure out and use, even for those inexperienced in the tech department.The picture quality is great, though you have to hold the phone super still or the picture will be too blurry to make out. The video quality is decent, but decent is pretty amazing for a cell (again, if you have shakey hands, you're not gonna be able to make out what's going on). Other than that, the color quality and clarity are great. Oh, and the phone doesn't have a flash, but that doesn't really matter as long as you're outside, or have some lights on.The iTunes is where it really shines. I was worried about the sound quality of the music, seeing as how it is a cell phone and not an iPod, but the sound is absolutely superb. Though, the one downfall is the voume only goes from 0-7, and there isn't really a quiet volume setting. So you have silent, loud, very loud etc... but personally, I don't find that to be a real problem.
I have the cingular version of this phone and it comes with a 512mb tflash card. Yes, it is restricted to 100 songs but it is more than enough to me ( I never use up the songs limit). Furthermore, if one song is around 5mb, 100 songs occupy 500mb. There is no point to buy 1gb tflash for this phone since you will never use the extra 500mb. My only complain is songs transfer into the phone need to be below 192kbps. Other than that sound quility is excellence in my opinion.++By the way, at the time that I bought this phone, the cingular version is unlocked. I try atandt and tmobile card on it and they work fine.
So I got this phone about more than half a year ago when it was kinda introduced into the US market.  I got this phone for free when I signed up for a TMobile plan (if you are asian you know how to get this phone for free).Anyhow why the heck did I ever get this phone???  Everyone who has owned a RAZR has complained about their phone, but the salesperson (stupid me) convinced me that the RAZR was a significant upgrade from the RAZR and that I WON'T get the problems like the RAZR.  Also, the RAZR had only 3 upgrades v1, v2, and v3 whereas the SLVR had upgrades L5, L6, and L7.  You know what folks?  Those upgrades don't mean jack since they really don't help out at all.So what are the PROS and CONS of this phone???PRO:-I have bragging rights on people who have never seen such a thin phone (pshhhh!!!)-It fits in my pocket so discretly-Bluetooth works well with a Motorola Bluetooth ear piece, I had to switch to a Jabra one when I lost my Motorola Bluetooth and now I'm having all sorts of static problemsCONS:-Compared to my OLD cheap Nokia, this phone reception is severly crappy.  I get so many drop calls per day, I don't have enough fingers to count (this only happens while driving) (sigh I miss my old Nokia)-Battery life is NOT like my old Nokia, this phone needs to be charged about 1 1/2 days (if lucky 2 days) but that is rare.-the OS is super slow.  When scrolling down from name to name, this thing doesn't move fast.  IE when moving from Kathy to Kelly, the interface doesn't respond as fast as you wish.  So sometimes it takes a tad longer to move from point A to point B.  and this isn't just the phonebook, it is on almost every movement in the phone.-Bluetooth... I dunno, I seemed to be "OK" when using a bluetooth earpiece but when I switched to a JABRA it didn't seem to well (see my JABRA review for that)-Yes I know this doesn't operate like my old cheapo Nokia phone but that phone just worked.  If you folks want a phone to work as a phone, stick with Nokia.  I don't know why I keep on going back to Motorola but this is my 3rd one and although my first 2 were pretty good, this one stinks!!!-Oh and camera quality is really really really bad.  Not even a full megapixel.I could go on but I got stuff to do.  I laid down the basics for everyone.So what is the answer folks?  If you want a phone that doesn't work so well but to showoff (stupid me) then get this phone.  If you want a phone to operate as a phone and not drop off from the face of this planet, get a Nokia or NEC or a SONY.  Those puppies work great.  Stay away from the Motorola RAZR (which my dad has) and this POS Motorola SLVR.  Not worth it, even for free (sad to say).
I ordered the Slvr L7 from this company thinking I would be getting in return, what the discription online was.  Including Itunes, USB cables, and a cool new Slvr phone. Did I get that in the mail after waiting over a week?? No, I did not.  I got some cheap European version, with no itunes or cable or cool phone.  It came with a charger that was meant for Euopean outlets...what the heck am I going to do with that in the States?!  I am very disapointed with this company and they claim that I can't get a full refund for something that I didn't want.  Sweet, thanks for the false advertisment.  dont buy from here
this is the best phone i have ever owned, through cingular. do not buy this phone UNLOCKED because you will not be able to use half of the features. Cingular provides bluetooth and web access and you cant use either on a unlocked phone.
I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self. People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone. Our unlocked SLVR (apparently produced for use in Europe...it came with European plug and a US adapter)did not come with iTunes. Having read the reviews I expected this. My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging. The SLVR has worked well for this. The only issue is that some of the shortcuts don't work. The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed. We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone. Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone. We're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here, so it's extra cool for others to see. The small, thin form factor is great. I'm almost tempted to get one of these to replace my RAZR!
All complaints of the L7 SLVR are from consumers who need to buy a Smartphone.  The SLVR has great design, and awesome multi-media features like iTunes, video cam and a very bright screen for games and web-browing.Software can be purchased to sync it with Outlook.  mp3's can be used as ringtones when they are put in the Sound folder when you connect it to your computer, but not when they act as an iTune.The keypad takes some getting used to - but I don't mind cuz I feel so cool talking with it in public.My only complaint is that this isn't a smartphone, which would allow me to add/remove programs that I want.  But this was definitly worth the money.
This is a great phone for style and looks...But these days, you want it all on a phone. And on the functionality department.. it lacks numerous advanced capabilities:- Camera quality is very poor. This is a VGA quality phone, you won't get the same quality as megapixel camera phones- If you guys buy the unlocked phones, you won't get iTunes. It's a given. The agreement between Motorola, iTunes and Cingular is to sell phones in the U.S. with lower cost but restricted capabilities. For example, if you buy this phone in Europe (or some auction sites) - you'll be able to use a 512 MB trans flash card and comes with a standard MP3 digital player. However, if you buy this phone through Cingular in the U.S., you're limited to the 128 MB card and only up to 100 songs on your iTunes. They don't allow for more than 100 songs (again because of the U.S. contract agreement between those 3 companies)- SMS (Text Messaging) is overtly complicated on this phone. It lacks the ease of use of dictionaries and auto text input like Nokia phonesBut I have to give it props for the style and design. Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing. It looks awesome and it's realy an eye catcher. If you guys want to have a stylish phone with awesome capabilities, you might want to check out the Nokia 3250. It looks promising so far.2 Stars for the SLVR.
i like to travel, and i have a phone for everywhere i go. for example, when i travel within the US, i use a cheap, old nokia (only because i wouldnt really care if it got stolen). when i travel to europe, i use my nokia 8800 which, up until recently, i thought was the best phone ever manufactured.I only just recently bought the motorola SLVR L7 to use on a normal daily basis, and I have absolutely no problems with it whatsoever. Its small, sleek, and stylish with all the amenities I could ask for in a phone, plus some. Who cares if the phone only holds 100 songs?! its amazing that it holds that many at all! and the sound quality is excellent. ALthough it is true that the battery doesnt last that long, I only charge my phone once a day, and thats while i sleep. I use my phone a lot, between calls and texts and listening to the iTunes, its unbelievable that I only really have to charge it once a day. To any ppl who are in the market for a new phone, I whole heartedly recomment the motorola SLVR L7.
Anyone who knows me will tell you that I'm a huge fan of electronics but I'm also not in the habit of buying trendy or gimmicky devices. When I first heard of a phone coming ready with iTunes, I was interested but understandably skeptical. Was this just a tie in with no real functionality to sell phones? I have used many other (non-iPod) mp3 players and was happy with their performance. I read a lot of the SLVR L7 and bought the refurb version through cingular. Out of the box the phone is exceedingly simple to set up and use. iTunes definitely makes a difference by updating your phone with any changes you've made to your library each time you connect your phone to your PC. YES the phone does only hold 100 songs but SIZE is not always BETTER. When I used a 10 gig MP3 player I still only listened to about 5 to 10 albums at a time, which, with the right settings, can easily fit on the SLVR. I've read other reviews that compare this phone's performance to much more high-end phones like Blackberry. This is obviously an unfair comparison since the SLVR isn't even in the same category. The only feature that I would have tried to as would be video playback, since many phones on competing networks are already well into video updates and such.
I just got this phone about 2 weeks ago.  I did it through cingular, and I was impressed that it actually did come with the 512MB Micro SD card.  IT was a great price for a great looking phone.Pros-Great looking phone, all my friends comment on it so it goo that way-it has integrated itunes which works great-the transfer time is pretty good- menu is pretty easy to use since you can rearange the buttons assignment (soft keys!!).-I am pretty impressed by the speaker-the screen is a good size, good color under the right conditions-my favorite is that it can play mpeg-4 videos just great.  The only thing is that you need to convert videos down a bit so that it can play on your phone.  I use itoovideo software.  You can download the shareware which works great for me.  I use 200bit rate 18fps 16000khz audio 174x144 screen size.  It clips look awesome.  If you really wanted you can fit two full movies on the 512 card, but I personally wouldnt watch a whole movie on a phone.Cons-In the direct sunlight you cant really see the screen well-the camera is absolutely horrible 0.3MP camera.  A simple VGA, and just fuzzy as hell.  Dont even try the video capture.  It sucks.  Choppy, out of sync, horrible resolution.  I guess everything cant be good.-The worst thing of all is that it drops calls all the time, and has horrible reception.  It will say its dialing for minutes without saying anything.  This is my 5th phone through cingular.  Ive been a customer with cingular for 7 years.  Ive had this problem with my last phone as well, but it was worse.  At this point I am not sure if the phone is the problem or the carrier because ive had this problem for the last couple of years.  I am just used to it.I still would suggest this phone to others, but it has its problems.  I am just not sure if I could blame the phone for the dialing problems.  And as far as the camera, I dont expect much in that department when it comes to mobile phones.
I bought the unlocked SLVR about a month ago now, and I love it.  Keep in mind that I am not tech-savvy in the least, and it was somewhat difficult to figure out how to get the messaging to work and the internet.  I found a bunch of sites online that helped with the setup, and once I did, it was great!  The only bummer is that I didn't read before I bought it that the 'foreign' (unlocked) SLVR's do NOT come with ITunes.  I was a little bit upset over that, but then again, I do have an IPod...
I was really worried that this phone would not work with my service, BUT IT DOES! I am so excited. This is a great phone, one thing that I want to express is that my mom has a black SLVR L7 and it has different ringtones and wallpapers than mine (some are the same). So if your buddy has a phone that they bought from America and you want it just because of the wall papers or something like that, don't buy it. It is a wonderful phone and gets great reception at my house which is out of the city (big accomplishment). I love this phone and am so happy that I purchased it!
Look, it's not an MP3 player, but it does hold 100 I Tunes, it's a phone -- but note that these cannot have been recently purchased as they will be loaded onto the phone but not played -- SUPPOSEDLY Motorola is working on this with Apple, but we'll see.  You have to burn your purchases onto disk, delete them from your library and then load them again.  But if this is an important feature for you DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.  The songs that do load sound great.It's not a camera -- it's a cameraPHONE -- so the resolution isn't great, big deal, it's easy enough to use and apply the pictures to phone numbers etc.That said the phone is ok, the manual is useless. Be sure to store your numbers to the phone NOT the SIM card.  Also, while you can have multiple entries for Aunt Sally at her home, biz and cell, the phonebook lists them all, which just takes up screen space.
I just bought this phone and i'm quite impressed. here are the pros and cons:pros:-great design. probably the phone with the best deign i've ever come across. it's thin and very elegant. something you only realize when you hold it in your hand.-versatile: mp3, camera, bluetooth and all the rest. if you think about it it's really very good for a phone of that size and weightcons:-when the display isn't backlit the phone goes black and you need to be in the light at a very particular angle to see the display.  this happens with all motorolas. Nokias disply, when not backlit, is still perfectly visible in a normally lit environment. Although, after all, you only have to press a button and the phone lights up. no big deal.-not a good camera. believe me, i'm a photographer: if you want satisfaction out of a camera, don't rely on a phone camera. They all suck, no matter the megapixels. I didn't buy this phone for the camera, and neither should you.- the integrated loudspeaker isn't very loud, although you can hear it ok from a short distance. (and yes, i did try it with max volume!!). other motorolas are better.-This is a defect with my phone - not all slvrs - bluetooth doesn't recognise other phones and therefore only recives. But that's just me and my incredible BAD LUCK with elctronics.this is the review of a very picky person. 4 stars is a good rating
this phone is about 50-50 for me, not the 3 stars i gave it.i renewed my contract right when this phone came out and with that i only had to pay like $50-$60 i think, which was quite a bit cheaper than the Rokr... the iTunes was a cool selling point to me - but the phone looked pretty cool to.first phone - i bought a car charger from walmart along with the phone, i think there was a bent peice of metal in the charger connector tip right out of the package so it screwed up the charging port on the phone, days later when it was out of juice and i couldn't charge it - i got it switched out.second phone - a few months later when i went to buy a bluetooth headset i was informed that "bluetooth" in my phone wasn't working so i had to get a new one from motorola, which was very easy and i kept my phone until they sent a replacement.third phone - blue tooth now works, but the iTunes do not - thats ok the iTunes aren't actually that cool on the phone, the ear buds they give you kinda suck (well i hate all ear buds really) and aside from a few times (airplane etc...) i never really used the iTunes on the phone.  though - despite what people say, i love the iTunes software!i don't care for the keypad it feels offset, its kinda tough to dial w/o looking at the buttons - cell phone numbers are small and tightly squeezed together as it is, on the Slvr they are like offset or something.  the camera on the phone is awful, no light and the picture quality is quite ify, you have to be PERFECTLY still while taking a photo.  the software on the phone is pretty decent, the layout of things anyways, however i look forward to a new layout coming out sometime.overall - this was pry the better of what was available at the time, but i miss my flip phone, would never get a phone/iTune combo again, buy an iPod if you want that, and would pry get something with a little better camera.  oh yeah - i hate how there aren't even any "complete" games on the phone, you have to buy the whole version, they should include atleast something.  (by the way i got this phone through Cingular)
My husband just got me a pink SLVR, and it's awesome! I can play iTunes m4ps or regular old mp3s on it. I also set my own mp3 as a ringtone. The camera and video aren't as high-res as my casio exilim, but they're great for random funny pics or capturing unanticipated once in a lifetime pics that would make most say "man I wish I had my camera." I haven't tried to webbrowser out yet because we're waiting to add that onto our service later, but the screen is clear and colorful. This phone is actually much better than I anticipated. It's like having an iPod nano, a basic digicam with video, and a phone all in one. Awesome for only $200! And it's PINK!
I upgraded to this phone from my Motorola v200 and absolutely love it. My biggest compliant with my old phone was the connection for charging. It was so fragile that it would break after about 6 months of normal use. I wasted so much money going through so many different chargers! I think Motorola got it right this time by using a standard USB interface. Not to mention now the phone can be used as a standard flash drive which is just an extra bonus!I paired the L7 with a Voyager 510 blue tooth headset and could not be happier. Very easy to pair them up and the quality is excellent. I don't think I could have made a better choice.Do a search on eBay for this phone and you will find much better deals. I paid $150 for an unlocked phone with a car charger, leather case, ear buds, 128mg, Data CD, USB cable and a travel charger which I have never used. I stick with the USB cable for charging.  If you have Windows XP there is no additional drivers needed for charging or using the phone as a USB drive.This is an excellent phone and I highly recommend it.
The unlocked SLVR L7 comes with some German firmware which is 100% uncompatible with iSync, iTunes or any Bluetooth connection made with Apple software. Beware!
I bought this phone for its long battery life and design. I have been very happy.I am not a power user of cell phone. I use only the basic features and found this phone very pratical and functional.The iTunes is also pretty cool.
I got an unlocked one from somewhere else. Be aware that different online seller might sell different version of slvr l7. Mine didn't come with iTune yet has a motorola audio player in game & application which works mostly like an itune: play, pause, skip, shuffle, visualizer,playlist......However, comparing to other brands like nokia and sony ericsson, slvr's operating systerm is not very personal or delicately designed to approach our convenience. I have to press so many buttons to get to where i want.Nowadays, so many phones claim to have bluetooth and so does slvr l7. However, my pc wasn't equipped with bluetooth. so i plugged in an usb bluetooth adapter. I found dissappointing that slvr l7 could only exchange some files and connect to a bluetooth headset. I could not found the Human Interface Device of slvr's bluetooth. *human interface device (hid) lets your phone remote control your pc like a mouse through bluetooth wireless. It would be very helpful when giving a powerpoint presentation and switching slides. may be i didn't get the right usb bluetooth adapter. Anyway, I tried my friend's sony ericsson phone and it could be automatically installed and remote control my pc like a mouse. hope motorola to make its technology more personal.PTT is a little award to set up. and the phone couldn't support many video formats.the design  is phenomenal.the battery hurts pretty bad if you use too much entertainment feature such as music with the speaker on, although the speaker is decent. GPRS is hard to set up, and my carrier T-mobile doesn't provide much information to set up the phone.to make this slvr phone work to its optimum, over $100 would be spent to expand memory, bluetooth headset, higher capacity battery......
Terrible customer service - phone was dead on arrivalby anonymous - 02/08/2006, 04:59 PMPros: Would be a good phone if it worked. Unfortunately, I got a "white screen of death" on startup.Cons: Motorola Australia customer service really bad. I had to return a phone that was dead on arrival and it took 6 calls, complaints to a manager, and even compaints to the manager's manager before anything was done. On 3 occassions Motorola promised to call me back and never did. They tried passing me off to different internal divisons with different phone numbers who made me re-explain everything. Interestingly, their technicians acknowledged the phone was faulty but that didn't speed up the process any.I'll never buy another phone from Motorola again, I used to love the brand.
Have to second the other reviewer. Did not come with 512MB card as advertised, but with 128MB. Also, bluetooth functionality consistently froze the phone when pairing with computer or headset. Thus, was quickly sent back. Beautiful styling though. Perfect size and weight. Will probably pick up a Cingular branded version and have it unlocked.
I just got this phone 2 days ago and started tinkering on it. The fact that it has i tunes on it is pretty cool. I text a lot and I dont suggest getting this phone if u text more just because my fingers are getting calloused already since the keypad is hard (because of it being so slim) and the keys to the letters are not perfectly alligned with each other so i miss a lot of letters which is a waste of time to keep deleting and retyping. The address book also sucks since you couldnt type in other numbers like home number or office number under one name. It will create another line of the same name if you type in their other phone numbers. Its my 1st time to own a motorolla since I always have the newest nokias but I just wanted to try it (for a change). But Im not impressed at all.... and the camera is VGA....yikes! (not bad but its cheap that they didnt make it into at least 1.3Mp)...And the ringing tones are so few and they suck too... For all texters out there, this isnt for you!!!
As a cingular user I feel like they don't have a lot of good  phones to choose from right now anyways. Given that I choose the slvr.  As soon as I had walked out of the store and to my car it had frozen. White screen of death. Restarted it as I have had some experience with my former Motorola A300 P.O.S. (BTW- never ever get that phone).  As this first week has progressed, the phone has times where it takes forever to process a request and eventually after 5 minutes of waiting I have to exit out.  It won't process the request to submit a text message which is highly annoying having to keep retapping it out. (It won't save it as a draft during this time).The voice recognition has failed to do anything.  Once it even continued a call for 15 minutes after saying it had ended the call. The reason I know this is that my mom and called during this period receiving a busy tone the whole time.Suffice to say I'm glad I have 30 days to try the phone and return it. This baby is going back and after the 3 straight Motorola's all with the same issues, I'll be choosing a new brand.
If it always worked like it was supposed to it would be awsome.Mine drops calls when It shows I have full reception. My calls break up and I have to hang up and call back before it will work. Sometimes when I try to unlock the keys to use the phone, The screen will go blank and the phone will not respond for about 15-20 seconds. Way to many little gimick features that just clutter up the user menu. My wifes is way worse than mine but she got water on hers so I won't complain about it.
Some specifics about my experience, and usage tips; I'll leave it to others to do an overview:Out of the box, this is NOT a great phone.  It took a LOT of effort to learn and customize in order to use it effectively, but after that, it's very good.  If and only if you're up for the effort, I highly recommend the phone.  Older phones I've had were much more usable out of the box.MENUS:I changed the home screen buttons around to have the items I use the most - SMS, recent calls, and calendar, and to put phone book where I'm used to it being.  I also changed menu order.  Some moron put Tools under the Settings menu; that can't be fixed.  Since when is a Tool a kind of Setting?  Maybe it makes more sense in whatever language the developers speak.PHONE BOOK.I changed the phone book listing format - this was CRUCIAL to making it usable.  It has its own Setup menu, separate from Settings. These made it usable, especially View and View by:-- View by:list, Sort by:name, View:Primary Contacts, Search Method: Jump To.  I synchronize my phone book with my Mac iBook using the FREE iSync, for easy data entry and for backup.STORAGE:ESSENTIAL: I changed where it stores images, games, and ringtones (from the phone to the memory card), which allowed me to transfer images to my computer, transfer games to & from my computer (e.g. cellufun's free sudoku, chess, etc.), and use an mp3 as a ringtone.  This should be possible from the phone's internal memory, but it isn't, so WOW - knowing that this change makes is possible makes the phone MUCH BETTER than I thought it was at first.  Also, these settings (and some others too) get lost if the phone loses power and have to be reset; this is LAME!BLUETOOTH:It works well with the cardo scala-500 I got from amazon.  I set up a shortcut for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset. FYI, if you get a bluetooth headset, be warned that it can't be used to listen to music; in fact, if you have a bluetooth headset active, it refuses to play music through the built-in speaker.  [Edit: it does work with some (unspecified) bluetooth headsets, according to the manual; Update: BUT, I've tried 3 bluetooth headset models and they didn't work.  The SLVR doesn't support the required protocol, A2DP, so I think the statement in the manual is false.]iTunes:Very good!  I just wish it would remember what songs it had already played.  [Edit: maybe the repeat all option does that; it's undocumented; trying it now...]PRICE:I got mine for $50 with contract renewal from cingular ~Mar '06; a billing dispute took such a huge effort to resolve that the office of the president staff let me get it at that price.I've yet to figure out how to use the free EDGE I have grandfathered on my account to browse the Internet at no charge.  I've called, but haven't reached a clueful cingular support rep yet.
This phone has it all! Cool looking! Sleek designHowever, there are 2 things Motorola needs to improve:1- Cannot retreive the phone # from your phone book when you're talking on phone2-Cannot see the screen unless you have to touch the key padOverall it's a great phone! I love it!
I received this phone for my birthday and love it. One reviewer who already reviewed this phone claiming that the volume is way too loud. I wholeheartedly disagree. I believe it has a volume problem, but it is the music goes nowhere near loud enough. I have an ipod 3rd generation and it cranks out way better than my phone. I also have problems with the fact that you can save ringtones and pictures to the memory card, but if you want to use them as ringer or picture IDs they have to be saved to the phone. The camera also has no flash and if you don't have a steady hand you'll get blurry pictures. I love the screen! It's beautiful. The bluetooth works wonderful too. It synced with my Mac with no problems. The size is wonderful. Small and thin. I am a little bit worried that if you don't buy a case the screen will get scratched to kingdom come. I don't like that it uses a specialized headphone jack so you have to use their headphones. You can't use your headphones and charge at the same time. If you have the money for it, I would suggest buying this phone especially if don't have an ipod or are sick of carrying both your phone and ipod everywhere.
I'm yet to really use this phone, but I got it in the mail today and it only had 128mb memory with it, not 512 mb as advertised. And mine did not have itunes with it, just a digital media player that, as of yet, I have not been able to get to work with itunes on my computer. I hope I just had bad luck and everyone did not get what they didn't pay for.
This phone being my first cell I love it. The only problems I have is that it slips out of my hands easily but it hasn been tough so far. Second  thing I HATE about it is when I am on the phone when I lose a bar sometimes the phone will flash off and then turn back on, which can be exremly frustrating when trying to type a long text messege :|
I really like the whole setup of the Slvr, the iTunes connection is nice and the sound is clearer than I've ever had. My only problem is that the screen smudges easy and is hard to clean, I suggest buying a screen protector.
I purchased this phone from amazon.com and experienced 2 significant problems with it...1)  The phone amazon.com shipped does not have support for iTunes.  The product description indicates it does.2)  The phone locked up when the memory card was inserted.
This phone is absolutely brilliant.I owned the RAZR, but had to replace it (in a moment of stupidity, I decided to change the housing of it to a clear after market housing, which totally destroyed my phone) quickly.  Because the RAZR's now free, everyone has one, which having one less cool so I looked for another phone.  When I saw the SLVR, I fell in love.  I happen to be a lover of non-flip phones.  This non-flip is thin, yet not fragile.  The video images are EXCELLENT considering this is a camera phone.  Saving and retrieving from the SD card is easy, even for tech-dummies.  And pairing with other devices (head set, IPAQ) was simple.
just got the phone yesterday. everything about this phone is great. it's very sleek and not many people have it yet. itunes is a huge plus. i plugged it into my computer with the included usb cable and my pc automatically found and installed the phone. audio transfer from itunes is a breeze. the only drawback (as mentioned in another review) is the ridiculously loud volume when you have your headphones plugged in, but it doesn't bother me too much. it's a very user friendly and sturdy phone. i would reccomend this phone to anyone. i owned the razr before the slvr and i'm glad i got it. i can't wait for more cases and accessories to come out. over all, if you're looking for a great, stylish, fun, easy-to-use phone, i would say get it! it's well worth the price.
Unfortunatly when I went looking for a new phone I was in awe at the pink Slvr L7. They had just gotten in the pink one and the idea of iTunes was a huge turn on for an obsessive iPod user.  The phone in general is horrible and had to be replaced once. After about three weeks of having the thing it decided to hang up on who I was talking to exactly 13 minutes into the conversations. On top of that the people I would be talking to could hardly hear me and I could barely hear them even on loud volume. However I will say that Cingular did exchange the phone with roughly no questions asked; great customer service. The keypad is a bit hard to use so if you like to text this isn't the best phone. If you use the calander function on your phones forget about this one. All of the softwear is the same as the Razr which is highly unimpressive. Everything on this phone scratched so easily it was irritating. I'd even keep this thing in a leather case and it'd somehow scratch! I use a digital camera for almost all of my pictures but I do occasionally use the cell phone one and I can tell you this one sucked. It seemed like all of my pictures were blurry. On top of that I don't recall being able to put those pictures on the computer ((I could be wrong though, I gave up after about two days of trying to figure out some of the features that didn't have to be difficult on this stupid thing)).  Some good did come with this phone. iTunes was an interesting feature I actually enjoyed. The music sounded very nice despite not going up loud enough for certain situations. I also liked how if you had a message or a call coming in it'd turn the music off so you could answer. The sound of MusicTones was also very good. The bad things about the iTune function was that it took just about forever to load the songs and you could only put 120 songs on it. The hot pink color was pretty cool too. But that was about it.  I put aside my Treo for this. One piece of junk for another. Unless your new to cell phones and/or don't use it for anything but talking ((and I suppose a bit of music)) I would highly advise you not buy the Slvr L7.
Pros: sleek design, very thin, very light, good interface2. itune doesn't require the locked version, I got my hacked itune by surfing online and got it on the phone3.  Can play MGP-4 video, but very small in size, because control panel takes half of the screen.4. SD mini card if a great design, acts like a flash drives5. quad band is a great feature, you can use it almost any where in the world except for Japan and S.Korea, since they use 3rd or even 4th generation cellphone.Cons: Some areas out of services even tough same services provider phone(a song errison)has full strength, I had few or no signal areas in Wal-mart, even it's a very opened area.2.  Don't drop it, cuz it leaves a very ugly scracth, My phone was fine untill yersterday, I was getting out of the car, and it dropped, I mean it dropped, I'm so f***ing piss.3. Camera resolution wish to be highier, VGA camera sucks and no flash(guess it's the draw back for being thin and small).  But then again, phones aren't made to take pictures, if I want a good picture I use good camera like Nikon or Canon brand camera.
OK it's actually the review for the L6 but the features are the same.Here's the good part -> It looks good.Here's the bad part:Reception - Terrible. I used to have 1-2 bars at home even with a 8 year old phone now I get none.Automatic keypad lock - None existant! Now I understand why you wouldn't have it on the Razr being a clamshell but for god's sake everytime I forget to lock it I come back to find that I like to call 911. Automatic keypad lock is a must!Screen - Fine I hear about it all the time, it's not the best under sunlight. Did anyone even mention that it doesn't display anything at all??? Yes unless you press a button, the backlight doesn't come on. I don't wear a watch so my phone has always been my watch. Imagine the fustration when you remember locking your keypad as in above and decide to look at the time. Oh now I have to unlock the phone first because of the nag screen before I can see the clock. Fabulous.I have probably more issues with the phone but this is where I will stop. A cellphone must first and foremost do what it's supposed to do. Make calls.What I have is a phone that has bad reception, susceptible to buttons pushed while in pocket and unable to see any missed calls without pushing the button.
Be honest, my old Nokia 6210 works much better than this piece of junk.  For example, I used to get at least 3 bars at home by using Nokia 6210; nevertheless, my NEW L7 gives me zero bar most of the itme. In order to make a phone call, I would go to my bathroom where the signal exists.In addition, the original battery is so cheap, which can only last one day. I need to charge the battery every night just in case it won't shut off during the middle of tomorrow.Recommendation: 1. If you live in suburban areas like me, you should avoid this phone for any cost.2. If you don't have a car charger or you travel often, try a phone that can stay up longer.  Otherwise, buy a couple of extra batteries if you think you are so rich.Overall, why should you pay hundreds of dollars for this phone when you can get other great cell phones for free when sign up a plan?
I had the Rokr and it played audiobooks from audible.  It was large so I sold it and picked up a Slvr. I was surprised that I can no longer play audiobooks from Audible.  Whats up with that?  Other than that, it is thin, small, lightweight.
THIS PHONE HAS EVERYTHING! IT IS THE COOLEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD! BUY FROM J_ELECTRONICS. HE SHIPS OUT QUICK AND HAS A US VERSION. HE ANSWERS EMAILS FAST AND SHIPS FEDEX!
The slvr is a exelent phone to begin with as a first time cell phone user.You should really get it!!!!!!!!!!
I WANT IT BECAUSE MY BABY DESTROY MY RAZR,  IT'S JUST THE SAME ONLY THAT IS NOT A FLIP PHONE,  SOMETIMES IT'S AN EXTRA, SOMETIMES YOU MISS IT.  WATHEVER,  IF YOU THINK IT'S BETTER THAN THE RAZR, FORGET IT, KEEP YOURS,
i got this phone for free. before i had an old beat up mototrola phone i had for 2 years. when it got stolen, cingular sent me there newest phone the slvr for free. i love cingular. oh and the phone, its actually pretty good. great features, nice look.
The slvr is a teribal phone mine broke within 24 hours. I was listning to music but it shut down so I replaced it with a rokr e1 and I love it.I rate it a five star+++++. I love it so much. If I could recomend one thing it would be to not get the slvr!!!!I love my rokr!!!
I have been using tracfone for seven months and I am satisfied with it. I have light cell phone usage and it costs me less than 15 dollars a month. The signal is good, no matter in the city of Boston or in the countryside of PA. I have not dealt with their custom service though. Tracfone has a promotion of 120 free minutes if you get an invitation from other users before you activate it. Let me know if you need one. I will send you an invitation instantly. And I can help you even if you have already activated it recently.
The C139 is the cheapest model in Tracfone's lineup.  It's a very good basic phone that gives you good voice clarity and easy text messaging.  Because Tracfone doesn't have a lot of services to offer (which isn't a bad thing for people who only want basic cellular service), this phone doesn't give you music downloads or live TV (which on other carriers are mostly misleading hype anyway).  The color screen is small but good-quality.  The only thing I don't like is Tracfone's 60-day refill polic: you must refill every 60 days to keep your account active; otherwise you forfeit your number and balance.  Other prepaid providers like Speak Out Wireless (from 7-Eleven) give you one full year of usage.
This review is for the phone unit itself - Not the TracFone service.Folks, stay away from this phone.  I liked it a lot for the first 60 days, then it 'died' and lost my call information, my minutes and everything else.  TracFone says that they are having big problems with the C139.  They're sending me another one, but that doesn't make me comfortable.  What happens when it dies?Meanwhile, I'm without a phone for over a week now.Save yourself some headaches.  Pick another phone.
My tracfone has worked out good so far. Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use. If you decide to get a tracfone, please email me for a quick referral before activating it- we each will get 120 free minutes from the 'refer a friend' program. I'll also send you the simple instructions to follow. I've used Tracfone for quite a while, so i should be able to answer any questions you might have.ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes.
This phone may look cool, but I'd recommend the Nokia 1100 or one of the other Nokia phones instead. Sure, the Motorola C139 looks cool, but you'll be charged 0.3 units per outgoing & INCOMING text message. You're only charged for outgoing messages with the Nokia Tracfones. The Tracfone user guide says that all incoming messages are free. I called their technical support and they told me that this is incorrect. They confirmed that incoming messages are chargeable for this handset and some other Motorola's. That's probably why the price was reduced to $18.88 in Walmart. I already have a Nokia 1100 and can confirm that I've never been billed for incoming messages. I got the C139 to replace my 1100 since I've had it a while and it's starting to look a bit scruffy. I used the Tracfone "refer a friend" to get 140 minutes free (worth approx. $50). Once I've used this credit, I'm going to throw my C139 away and get another Nokia Tracfone.
In the past I have had contract phones with monthly charges, cancellation fee etc. For me that was not worth it as I only need the phone for infrequent use. I have had two tracfone (C139) for a few months now. I am perfectly happy with them. Each Tracfone only cost $20, and that will also include free minutes...10 with the phone...10 if your activate online...and 120 if you allow me to refer you...we both will get 120 free minutes. I also have 2 additonal codes for 30 and 60 more free bonus minutes. The service will last 2 months when first you activate, and 2 more months when you add the free minutes. After that point if you have not used up all your minutes you can roll over your unused minutes when you buy more minutes...for as little as $20 every 60 days. If you decide your don't need the service after you have used up the time and minutes...store you phone and reactivate it at a future time...no fee...just buy as little as $20 for 60 minutes...however, you will be assigned a different phone number, which I don't think is a big deal. Contact me (matman713 at hotmail dot com) for my referral and get started with a bunch of free minutes!
Tracfone Review and 180 FREE minutes!!!!! , September 13, 2006I love this phone. I purchased it a family member who is a limited cell phone user. It is perfect to keep in touch without paying a high monthly charge. If you have this or any other Tracfone and plan to activate it you may benefit from Tracfone's referral program. I can send you a referral and we both get 120 free minutes PLUS you'll get a bonus code to enter with your pin for ANOTHER 60 FREE mintues! Email me and I'll send one over to you. This offer works on new or reconditioned phones not yet activated before receiving emailed offer.[..]
I have been using tracfone for about seven months. The signal is good no matter in the city of Boston or in countryside of PA. Compared to other prepaid services, I would say this one is the cheapest. And you get 120 free minutes if you get invitation from others before activation. Let me know if you need an invitation.
I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.com
My tracfone has good reception. i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id. if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes. please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral. it's a win/win! thank you.
Tracfones are ideal for people with light or medium cellphoneusage, so it works out well for me. The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc. I paid an extra $10. and got the car charger that just plugs into the cigarette lighter if the tracfone battery gets low when i'm driving. If you email me for a referral before activating then Tracfone will give each of us 120 free minutes!  I can also tell you how to get more free minutes.
Tracfone is exxxxxcelent.  Service is exxxxxxcelent. (though I've never seen fit to use it in 2 years.)  Voice mail is free.  What else do you want?  Email me before you activate, and I'll show you how to get free minutes for life!breezydai@yahoo.com
Got my Moto Cell Tracfone about 2 weeks ago and love the service. I just wanted a cell for emergency purposes and this fits the bill great. I like that you can buy 1 yr of service at once with no monthly billing. My girlfriend has a Nokia and barely gets 1 bar at our house...the Moto gets 4-5 barsand we're in a difficult area....love that. If you're considering a Tracfone, email me @ LMimagery@aol.com, and I'll get you the link for 120 free minutes....which can even be 240 free minutes if you buy the ear service with double minute upgrade.

Samsung has produced a great little wonder. A small cell phone with a lot of power, feature rich, and great camera.The slide action is what makes the phone very unique. Very smooth and easy to operate. It takes 4 or 5 tries to get used to the slide action.The sound quality as far as calls are concerned is great. Very clear, and loud and very understandable. The reception however is a bit weaker than phones with external antennas. I did not find this to be a phone problem, however, but rather a Network problem. I am basing this review on Cingular service, and where I work. I work in a place where there are a lot of electronic devices, which affects the reception a lot. Once I am out of that enviroment, the reception is great.The buttons on the phone are very small, but managable. Like everything new, you need to adjust to the buttons, and you will. The control buttons are very small and cramped together, that it makes it difficult sometimes to push the right one.The menus are very clear, and easy to get to. You can customize the function buttons to any of the applications available.The Camera on the phone is a 2 Mega Pixel camera, that takes some of the best pictures, and videos, I have seen. You have total control over the camera, just like an expensive Nikon digital camera. You can adust and fix pictures on your phone, but I recommend using a photo editor program instead.The phone has a built in MP3 player. The sound is okay from the phone directly, or you can use the included head set for a much better sound.Interacting with your PC is very easy, after you install the included software, and using the included USB cable. You can control every function from your PC, from your phone book, to adjusting the settings on your camera.The wireless printing is very unique. I have played with it a couple of times, but I will not use it as I upload my pictures on my PC first, then print from there.The phone also connects to your TV to view photos and videos. A very easy set up, basically just hooking up the A/V Cable that came with the phone and you're good to go.Finally, this phone is very highly recommended. I gave the it a 4.8 because there is no perfect cell phone, and there will never be one, IMHO.
I bought this phone in the islands and I really like it. THe sound quality is GREAT and the size and weight are also easy. Also, I like the way it locks when it is carried. Unlike wth razor or other phones where you have to go through a million changes to lock and unlock your phone so that the settings dont change in your pocket; this one is EASY.THe only thing I dont like about this phone is that the menus are a bit cumbersome. Although they are clear, it takes too many steps to get to where you want to go. Nokia does a better job of this.
I bought this phone in China early March 2006. It was just on market for a week or so. I intended to buy a Microsoft Smartphone kind of device, but came upon this phone. The things that attracted me was the near perfect finish (black version only, feel like the early IBM Thinkpad T23 skin-like touch), the fast response, large screen, transparent screen cover and a unique feature: Business Card Reader(BCR).The BCR take a snapshot of a business card, automatically recognize the information and input into contact list. The character recognition is not 100% if the business card design is too fancy. If the card is standard, with regular characters, the recognition result will be very accurate. It saves lots of time when you finish the job in a long day and rest in hotel room. Remember, you have to set the lens switch to Macro position, otherwise the card photo it takes will be blury and recognition is impossible. The switch is above the lens, very easy to miss.Other features include the radio, recorder, bluetooth, Real Player, voice command, notes, 2.0 MP camera and camcorder.Writing recognition is also very accurate. I write in Chinese and English. Both are very easy to use. Overall, the software are great.It comes with other features such as getting online but I don't use them. You can add Transflash card inside. As of May 2006, the largest card size is 512MB for $70.I don't think I digged all the goodies out, still in the fun process learning how to use it more wisely. Overall, it is a great phone, better than any other phone I ever used.
Before I bought this phone, I had the V3 that I got from Cingular.  I was really unpleased with it, it wasn't what Motorola made it out to be.  Then I got the V3x, which I wouldn't have done if I knew that it didn't support the 850 GSM Band. It was a lot better than the V3, had an MP3 player, but it didn't support 320kbps MP3's.  I had problems getting a signal with it, cause of the 850 GSM band Cingular uses. Then I saw the Motorola MING (A1200). I've had this phone for a month, and I haven't had any problems with it yet. It plays all my MP3's and it even comes with Real Player, so if you wanna play Video's, you can, but you have to convert them first.  It sucks, but the phone does come with some converstion software. I've also tested the phone with some software that I found off GetJar. I only had a problem with one of the programs, it was an Internet radio.  But the Messengers worked fine. The Hong Kong site says that the phone comes with MSN Messenger, but I haven't found it.  It supports 1GB MicroSD and can record videos up to 2 hours.  The only downfall of the phone is the fact that it doesn't have any 3G capabilities. I, myself, don't use 3G since it my provider doesn't have Video Calling yet and I'm sure that when it becomes available, it'll be expensive and no one that I talk with will get it for years to come.  The phone uses Linux as it's OS. That kind of scared me at first cause I don't know how to use Linux that well....heh, but it's pretty easy to use.  The OS is also Open Source, you can get it from the Motorola Open Source site (https://opensource.motorola.com).  The phone has a virtual keyboard on the screen that you use to type.  There is also a virtual keypad that is used when dialing a number or when entering info that requires only numbers.Here is the short version...if you want a great phone that doesn't support 3G technology, that supports J2ME applications/games, and you can see small letters close up, then get this phone.  If you have to have 3G, then get something else.Hope this helped ^_^.
I have had Startacs and Razors.  The Ming A1200 is a pleasure to use. It is compact, sleek, ergonomic. As a regular phone, it is easy to use, the sound quality is the best Motorola I have used so far.  The outlook-like address book is far better than the miserable 1 entry per phone number that the Razor has. There may be better MP3 players, FM radios, cameras, or gaming devices available, but this is one unit where all perform very well in one integrated unit.I can recommend the Ming for those looking for a well-designed, sophisticated phone, even if you may never use all the features (but they are nice to have)!  Only caution is very limited US support.  Motorola advises that this phone is intended for the International Market (I bought mine in Dubai). I find it hard to believe that Motorola would not market one of their best products ever in their home country.
I just got this phone a few days ago and i love it. It has every feature you can possibly want a phone to have, including email access, fm radio, camcorder mode and more. It is compact, has a touch screen and a whole lot more  i can't remember to mention.This phone is a must have.
I recieved this phone as a Christmas gift, and have two warnings:  The merchant will not accept returns, and Motorola customer service says this phone is not usable by any carrier in the U.S.  However, I was able to find a local phone store which sucessfully programmed the Internet access through T-Mobile zones.  This was not a "no-brainer": the phone software is loaded with a dozen or so European service providers, and you'll need to know and add to the phone the IP addresses to access your phone company's servers.On the plus side, this phone's screen is a true stunner: it's bright and crisp, and nicely displays a web page in either horizontal or vertical orientation.  Should the built-in software leave you wanting more, there seems to be hundreds of free java phone applications available for this phone on Motorola fan websites.
I'm extremely happy with this phone.  I have owned it for almost a month now.  The menus are very responsive and the display is crystal clear and very high definition and more colors. The "free" RAZR that came with my plan is still sitting in the box -- doesn't compare.I have added 1GB of memory using SD micro flash.  So can definitely be used as a mp3 player.  But you would need to get a NOKIA -> headphone adapter plug from third party vendor. Or you can use speaker on the phone in a pinch.The camera takes great pictures as long as the lighting conditions are good. The menus have many options for customizing the phone (though some of these options are somewhat hidden from the casual user further down the menu tree).The speaker independent voice recognition seems to pull up the correct name most of the time or give several to choose from in some cases.I really like the flip phone button that opens the phone, so you can open it with one hand. It works very reliably and the spring has the right tension.The keypad is lit and easy to see in darkness.  Due to the high contrast and brightness of the display it seems to consume some battery power. On standby the phone can be on for many days if not used, otherwise you would need to charge every other day if you use features that keeps the display turned on for long periods of time (editing notes/organizer etc.).Some nice features:-Todo lists-Notes-Calendar-Various kinds of reminders (with reminders that can be set before the event)-The next item on your calendar today can be shown on the main screen on the bottom.-MP3 player / w/equalizer-Radio (need to use headphones (which also works as antenna))-Black almost rubber-like finish for easy grip and does not scratch easily.-Simple and userfriendly menus and keypad (the phone I purchased was not branded so did not have any of the preprogrammed "buy ringtones/wallpaper" buttons etc.-Great voice quality-Sych phone numbers/appointments via bluetooth/IrDA/cableHighly recomended!~!
Ok, so the nokia 6131 I must say is a phone that I like to call a "sleeper."  It does not look like much, but when You go to use it, it is a different story.  First off, the camera is very cool.  I have had some issues using it in low light situations, the pics become grainy, but over all it is very cool.  The push button flip works just as you would expect it too.  In regards to computer compatibility, I am a heavy Mac User.  According to Apple, this phone was not suppose to be compatible, but that was an easy fiix.  Allowing syncing of all my contact info. and calanders.  In regards to the menus, they very responsive, and very quick. The internal and external display are extreamly high quality, and very crisp.  For bluetooth compatability, I have had no issues.  I previously owned a RAZR and for bluetooth options, this phone blows my old razr out of the water.  You have the option of uploading new themes (which are easy to find or make) you can upload ringtones, pics, what ever.  And the data transfer is much quicker then my RAZR. I would highly recommend this phone to any user.  It is by far the best phone that I have used.Pros:  High res. screens, quickness of menus, BT, Camera, push button flip, speaker is loud.Cons: Unlocked from Europe comes with bulky euro charger (not a big deal.)  And the only thing that I would say is that the battery life is somthing to be desired.  I use BT allot and I end up having to charge my phone every one to two days.
I didn't realize about the size of the buttons until  I got it, I have big fingers and it's difficult for me to use a telephone with tiny buttons, with this one, problem solved, big buttons, big screen, big memory.Very good camera resolution,  1.3 M,  I think it is enough for a Cell Phone if you want more quality in your pictures use a Camera.The screen resolution is incredible.The FM radio, Bluetooth, IR and MP3 are some valuables in this telephone.I neever saw a telephone with an  "open flip button" this is very comfortable, and helps you to open it with one hand.The problem, the camera button is outside and you can activate it accidentaly.
pretty good phone.the good:large inner and outer screens.. 16.7 million colors is pretty coolloud ringtones and speakerphonelarge keypad with nice white backlightthe push flip is great. its somethin fun to mess withpretty fast internet connection with cingular's edgereception is also goodmusic playerbluetooththe not so good:camera really isn't all that great, especially in dark placesvideo is kinda choppybattery life doesnt last very longThe good outweighs the bad and this phone passes the test.
I love this phone nice screen quality comfortable feel inyour hands for a 1.3 meg camera picture quality is great. only drawback is the battery life nokia needs to release anew and improve battery i am enjoying my phone it appeals to my friends
This phone is exactly what I was looking for. The menu is easy to use and the function keys are simple. The quality of the pictures are also good. I was into motorola cellphones before and switched to Nokia when the battery in my motorola died. This was supposed to be a temporary move, but I fell in love so much with Nokia's ease of use that I decided to get a higher end Nokia phone. I am very pleased with my purchase and will continue to purchase only Nokia's lines.
I abused my Nokia 6131 beyond belief and it still works.  I am amazed!  I actually accidentally put mine in the clothes dryer with my jacket and I only realized it was there 20 minutes later.  When i took it out, it fell to the cement and tumbled a couple of feet away.  It came out piping hot and smelling like dryer sheets, but I was amazed to find that it was still working perfectly!!!  Seriously, it's amazing.The only thing that bugs me is the battery life, which isn't great at all.  I don't remember what it was like after the dryer fiasco, but I imagine the battery life is much much shorter now than it was before I had my accident.  I'd buy this phone again if I had the chance, because I know it's built to last.
I got this phone 3-4 days ago and it is amazing.  Let me tell you, it is completely customizable, i quickly and easily used its bluetooth capabilities to pair it to my computer, i could even access phone info via windows explorer after I installed the free nokia software which can be downloaded from their website.  The screen resolution is excellent, it has everything I could possibly want, and believe me I am picky!!! so if you're picky and hate buyers remorse, trust me, go with this phone and you wont be disappointed.
Recently I've got my new Nokia 6131. The phone is great. I've been using Nokia 6230 for a while and the best feature I loved in it was editable Voice Tags so whle driving you just press a button on your Bluetooth device, say a name from your Contact List (previously recorded by yourself), phone recognising your voice and dialing desired party. Very convinient. But this Nokia 6131 comes with prerecorded names tags for every contact you're entering which is not good because it doesn't work in you case. Different voice and prononciation so most of all times you're getting someone else instead by calling it's name into the Bluetooth. I can't understand what was the idea to do this.The other thing(was described in previous reviews) is a battery which doesn't stay longer than 2 days and needs to be recharged.The idea of Nokia 6131 is amazing, beautiful design and etc. I think Nokia has to recall this product for repair those 2 items.
Big fan, I was an avid LG guy and then I switched over to the Nokia 6102 (not a bad phone itself except I destroyed it).  I then wanted to go up and get something with an MP3 player and Bluetooth so I could be that guy with the headset on in the supermarket like I was asking Scotty for more power.  Anyway, here is the lowdown:Pros:-Compact: much thinner than my old 6102-Bluetooth range is excellent, I have gone 20-25 feet and still had my headset work: I have the Sony Ericcson HBH PV700.-Display is excellent-Large numbers on the keypad are great for dialing:  most of those other small phones have tiny buttons that my fat fingers can't manage.Cons:-The new Nokia voice dial thing, it automatically assigns a voice to each name, you can;t record your own like the old days.  It is a bit rough and needs some work.Another note: I use cingular, you can go to the Nokia website and download all the settings to get your internet, MediaNet, etc to work.  Make sure you go into the site and say you are in Europe since this phone is not in the US yet.  You'll find the info in the support section, they send a text to your phone and it updates everything.Over all, great phone.  Probably my most favorite yet, for the price you get options of most $400 phones. Haven't used the MP3 player yet, so can;t say much on that.
Wonderful Phone, as you know it's a nokia which it means you are getting a great phone, but I think they need to work to improve its battery life duration. As well, night pictures could be improved.I do recommend it.
This phone is crazy! its full of features, all the features you could want in a mid range phone. The display is absolutely gorgeous. The only drawback is that the picture quality could be a little bit better. Overall this is a great buy. The clarity is crystal clear and the signal is excellent.
This is one of the best Nokia phones, which I have owned! The design is great, the camera is big enough for excellent photos and you may go through the menus for a long time. The price is also very good and overall I am very pleased with it. Highly recommended.
all good...I need only the basic features so pretty good...have not played around with the contact informations  yet (name directory), but have a doubt that I might be slight disappointed if I can search for names only by entering the first character of the name ? any ideas if that is the case ?
I was looking for a good phone but did not want to expend much and I made the right choice.  I am very happy with the phone, easy to use and the blue tooth compatibility is just great.  The camera is not that powerful but it works great and it is easy and fast to use.  It is the best phone I have ever had!
Very good cell phone.if you want to get something with everything on it and to expenda reasonable ammount of money is a good option.
I'm mainly writing this review so that others have an idea what comes with it.  Not knowing was really the sole hesitation when deciding what to spend my gift certificate on.--USB cable--charger (not US but comes with adapter)--256 micro memory card w/adapter--Motorola Phone Tools software (mPT)--headphonesI needed to upgrade from my v300 for 2 reasons.  I love being able to connect my phone to my computer to backup, etc, but it was taking more effort to connect the cable due to use.  Also, it was kinda a brick; not pocket-friendly when I did have them (women's clothes & pockets...oy vey) and when I did use the belt clip it was weighty & bulky. The pocket friendliness of the Razr alone makes the purchase worth it.  Being able to play music and video is a bonus.  This is not an iTunes version but transfering mp3 is easy enough via mPT.The only negative worth noting so far is that the phone has blacked out twice, requiring me to momentarily remove the battery to completely power off & 'reset' the phone.  My v300 "fritzed" on occasion too, also requiring the battery removal but it never proved to be more than a minor annoyance.
I was very unhappy with the phone.  It did not tell me anywhere in the info that the phone may not work with the internet.  It is a phone that was sold in Europe and is not compatable with the web services in the United States.  So I spent quite abit of money on something that is of no use to me.
this phone is garbage; i've gone through two already.  that's right i've spent $600 on the world worst piece of sh*t.  shame on me eh?why is it bad?:  when combined with cingular you get half your calls (i had a nokia prior which didn't drop ANY), reception sucks, i mean really sucks (where i used to have service with my 'fashion nokia 5260) i don't even get reception with this garbage), besides if you call with this phone internationally you will sound like a stuttering idiot (as my european friend told me in his words) as the reception is so bad.  i've already gotten in fights with my wife as she has tried to call me in ordinarily perfect spots and nothing went through.  not outside in soho nyc.  not even voicemail.  consider this all b4 buying this half assed piece of junk.  i'm telling you go nokia as prior i had no problems for 5 years...
My previous phone was a Nokia 6600. It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the "my computer" icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved "Disc2phone" and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%.

Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i. People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion,All though I am very happy with this phone, I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage, you can save messages onto your pc but come on, who's gonna do that?Buy this phone if you like what you read. Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners. BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics. There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25% which I just noticed.However, unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes "Stereo Widening" impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about,reallyGood luck,fellow techies
I won't lie, I'm a Sony fan. Have been for years. When I was at school, I would take the Sony catalogue with me and look at each of the hundreds of products and admire the constantly evolving designs and technologies this company offers. Sad, I know.There are two things that made Sony what it is today; televisions and Walkmans. Their TVs were and still are today the standard by which all TVs are measured by. And Walkmans, well, they revolutionised the way people listened to music. And of course they are now good, if not the best, at many other things, from video gaming to professional video cameras used by James Cameron and Michael Mann!The company however has always annoyed a number of people by unnecessarily introducing proprietary formats. Some good, some bad, but ONE company alone will always find it hard to win public support with a format if it is not supported by other manufacturers. This was highlighted by the company's biggest EVER mistake, encapsulated in one word: ATRAC.Sony were slow to the MP3 market. In the beginning they shunned it, developing the MD and Discman lines whilst Napster was taking on the world. It took computer companies like Creative and Apple to introduce MP3 players whilst the likes of Panasonic, Sony and Philips failed to embrace such a simple concept. Sony were so complacent that they built their own audio compression format, ATRAC, which could only be made by Sony's own Sonic Stage software, and played by Sony's hardware. The software was absolutely appalling, and did not really improve on MP3's already strong compression rate. It was cumbersome to use, and next to the hip image of an emerging iTunes, and the ever improving iPod, Apple  did not just overtake Sony, they pretty much obliterated them out of a market they dominated. Heck, they invented the portable audio market.Come 2005 and Sony execs are looking at themselves wondering what happened to their once-guranteed hundreds of millions a year. They quietly admitted to themselves that they blew it. But their other markets were thriving. Look at the PSPs, the PS2 and upcoming PS3. Look at their Bravia HD displays. Look at their groundbreaking HDV cameras. Sony are kicking butt, but Discmans and MD players are no longer a top 5 option for ANYONE. It is either an iPod video, an iPod shuffle, an iPod nano (get my point) or maybe, for those somewhat bored, a Creative whatchamacallit!But they have found a way to use the Walkman brand, by using cutting edge technology and simple, ingenious design, and incorporating a music player in their line of phones.The W810i is one of the more recent additions to an ever-expanding line of sublime phones and I've got to say "it is amazing!"This phone, unusually so from Sony, allows a great deal of flexbility in terms of how the user can import and export data. The phone boasts a memory stick port, which is such a massive feature, because this means you can replace the standard 512MB stick with a 2GB stick (4GB is now available, but let prices fall before you buy one). 2GB!!! We may no longer be impressed by such a figure, but may I remind you that with an average 4 minute, 4 MB MP3 we are talking a ridiculous 500 song/45 albums capacity. That's an iPod nano my friend! Hook up your phone via USB and two drives pop up on your computer, the memory stick and the phone's internal drive, and just like your own HDs, you simply drag and drop data from folder to folder. It's brilliant, and obviously lends itself well as a USB stick for students. This means you can use it with PC and Macs, unlike an iPod, and it is not restricted to working with ONE program, unlike an iPod, although iTunes does rock!So just how good is the Walkman feature? Well, it is very similar to the iPod interface, and whilst it may not boast the brilliant iPod navigation wheel it still has some effectively positioned buttons that allow volume change, starting and pausing music and skipping back and forth tracks. They are in the perfect place, and I commend the designers, because this is where the phone truly excels; ergonimics. With such a vast array of features, it must take a pretty smart bunch of people to make it anything but a hassle to use. The devoted Walkman button transports you to Artists/Albums/Playlists etc etc. You can change the equalizer, you can send your tracks via Bluetooth/Infrared to other people, you can basically have fun.Sound wise? It sounds damn good. Is it hi-fidelity? No, not by a long shot (but then, neither are iPods!). It comes with good earphones, but I like good sound, so will use my best phones, and encode at a slightly lower compression to cull the best performance from this hardware. It does not sound as good as an iPod, but this is a very personal opinion. The differences are marginal, but this, unlike an iPod, does so much MORE!A test of whether this is a direct competitor with an iPod is whether, if you took away all the other features and were left with just the Walkman feature, would it be good enough, and the answer is yes. It can improve. It would be great if Apple would allow iTunes to work with other players, because integrating the W810i with iTunes would be phenomenal. The W810i could improve by showing the music artwork, having MORE control over how your music is played, and I would argue to somehow make the menu less cluttered, although it is already well designed. The small details Apple lend their products are great, so if Sony could change the font or anything, to make it a LITTLE bit more streamlined I think it would be more or less perfect!. A great extension to this would be allowing Walkman phones to be dockable in cars like the iPod is, so drivers can control the songs through their stereo. Basically it is a great product, and Sony needs to think big like Apple so it can really stop people buying iPods! They have the quality, but they now need to work hard with PR and accessories to convince people who are set on buying an iPod to reconsider.Next up is the 2 MP phone, which, for a phone, is remarkable (and is now no longer the biggest, with Nokia's N80 offering 3MP). Compared to the first batch of dedicated 2 MP cameras, this wipes the floor with most of 'em. It does not come close to any dedicated digi cameras on the market today, but I took some pictures this past weekend that were full of colour and detail. It is impressive stuff, and serves perfectly well for a number of applications. Yes it is grainy, no there is no optical zoom, but it has a macro feature, which is amazing. Noise is naturally evident, and I won't be taking my holiday photos with it, but considering where we were two years ago with camera phones it has to be said it no longer is a gimmick. In a year or two cameras on phones will be able to take pictures comparable to point and shoot digicams, and that my friends is a fact. Please look here at a picture I took with the w810i! ([...] Looks good, doesn't it! The phone comes with flash, white balance, macro, panorama, nightshot, and a number of other features. The video camera is subpar, so I guess another year or two will mean DV quality cell phones coming our way (maybe not, lets not get excited!).Another massive plus is the RDS radio. Reception seems to vary, but once it hooks onto a strong signal it sounds very good, and if you have RDS services it will show you the name of the station. That's another one over the iPod!As for the phone. Well you got simple navigation towards your address book. Text messaging and calling is straightforward. The person on the other end of the line sounds good. You have a lot of detail on your Call History. It is so easy to make calling on mobile phones to be frustrating, much like Sony's earlier phones. Thankfully they have not taken anything for granted and made this an effortless task for users.Sony's unsurpassed battery life lasts for hours upon hours. How they do it I will never know!The screen is bright, and the phone saves battery power by reducing the strength of the LCD light based on the ambient light.The phone is very modern, has a good weight, and unlike the Motorola RAZR, is not uncomfortable to hold in you hand (sure, it looks good, but I do want to HOLD a phone sometimes!). The phone numbers are small, but I really cannot expect anything different when you consider just what these designers are having to pull off.I wish I could comment on the internet capabilities of this camera but my service provider still charges too much for surfing the web via my phone, and I find the whole experience a bit boring and slow. Mobile internet still has some way to go before it can really be an attractive proposition for me HOWEVER, the RSS reader function will certainly serve me well if I want a quick headline from the BBC website.You see, when you have a camera, a phone, a Walkman, internet, text messaging, radio, games etc all in one package, that because of consumer demand needs to be small, be light, pack in a colour screen, long lasting battery and removable media, then you have to wonder how it will all work together. Sony have done brilliantly here, and as technology becomes more and more advanced (smaller, lighter, quicker, brighter etc) phones will continue to evolve. They are clearly the best place to find the latest technology, and the W810i may not be the absolute cutting edge, but it is certainly the king for the moment. Apple better watch out. Sony want their crown back. Thankfully there will be only one true winner, and that's us, the consumers!
...and it should be for this price.This is my first review; I just had to add my two cents after reading the previous review.I have used my phone with Cingular all over NYC, Long Island and Colorado.  All I can say is that the reception is better than it was for my two previous phones, a Nextel Blackberry 7510 and most recently, a Verizon Blackberry 7130e.I bought this phone after using a friend's cheapo pay-as-you-go Sony phone. I am a harsh critic of poorly implemented technology, but very quickly recognized that Sony Ericsson makes great phones with lots of very thoughtful features and, most importantly, pairs those features with the most intuitive user interface I have ever seen.I am an early adopter of new technologies going back to the very first CD players, the Apple Newton and First Generation 5gig Ipod.  Believe me, Sony has a real winner here with the Walkman cell phone line.  It sounds great (as good as your source material) and the software for loading songs  was refreshingly simple to install and use.And, oh, the camera is pretty good.  If you are going to an important event, it is no replacement for a dedicated digital camera with a full fledged flash.  But for impromptu moments, it takes very good pictures in daylight.Love the phone, would recommend without hesitation.
9/19/06 Update. Since my first review, I'm still enjoying this phone and have added some other fun things to do with it. Besides the obvious music and watching video, I hook up this phone to my big stereo's auxilliary RCA inputs via the 35mm earpone cable and voila!, the sound rocks and is very portable especialy at parties. Speaking of parties, I save some encoded karaoke video clips with scrolling song text and minus one music to my phone then plug to the stereo and BAM! instantly I have a portable karaoke machine in my hands. Friends view the song on the phone screen as it plays while they sing. Mic is separate though but boy the fun never stops. Just some ways to improvise to have fun and this phone lets me do that. Try it...I'd been shopping for many months now for a good phone and a portable mp3 player. After careful research among carrier phones, reading tech reviews, and among other brands out there including the ipods, W810i wins highly because I love listening to portable music plus the phone/camera/FM radio/expandable memory integration and yes the unique MegaBass all in one just fits my kind of need. Truly an audiophile's phone. Of course there are many similar capable phones or dedicated units out there but not quite like the W810i. Ipods and RAZR pale in comparison...in my opinion. W810i is just SUPERB. Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW. I have this phone for more than a month now and NOT a drop call occured. I have T-Mobile service with T-Zone for internet access which is fast in my experience since the EDGE GPRS is supported mostly in my area of travel. Downloading files and viewing websites was a fast treat. I enjoy this phone so much that I decided to upgrade the included removable 512mb memory stick duo to a Sandisc 4GB Ultra II Pro Duo just so I can store more than enough of my favorite mp3, video clips, and one full length movie too for my entertainment. Here are my own observations of this phone:PROS:1. Mega Bass. Adds more thunderous punch to the low frequencies of music and boy I love this feature. Tip: invest on a good quality heaphone/earphone for it makes a big difference folks in sound quality preferably those that have bass tube or bass enhancement designs.2. A built in 5 channel Equalizer and other audio settings to suit your music taste.3. A dedicated Walkman button for easy acces to music. Walkman menu and the overall phone menu is very easy to use and navigate around your music and other phone folders.4. 2 Megapixel Camera with autofocus is a big plus compared to none.5. Camera features includes:  - selectable white balance  - select between video mode(realtime action) and normal camera  - self-timer, effects(sepia, b&w;, negative, solarize)  - shoot Mode has normal, panorama, frames, macro, night  mode and burst  - self-portrait mirror on back6. Easy to use tactile keypad buttons, center navigation D-pad, and has T9 text assist for messaging.7. Speakerphone is loud, Quadband GSM, bluetooth, infrared, FM stereo with channel save presets for your favorite stations.8. Video clips/movies in 3gp/mp4 format can be viewed verticaly or widescreen. Some games can be played also in widescreen.9. A decent LED that acts like a penlight is helpful in finding lost keys in the dark. This light is helpful also to brigthen up your subject at night when taking pictures but it does not seem to function like a flash when you hit the shutter button.10. Phone call quality so far for me is great. Clear crisp  voice exchange reception from the other end with no static noise.11. Battery life overall is very good even in long minutes of music listening and watching a few video clips.12. EDGE GSM gives you fast internet access if supported by your carrier.13. Operating software is fast and makes navigation between menus or retrieving content very responsive.14. Expandable Memory slot. A BIG BIG plus folks especially if you want to add more memory. I have 4GB and it works.15. While playing music, it will stop during an incoming call then resumes once you hang up. Nice feature.16. Has music mode where phone functions are turned off. A plus when traveling in air or inside a hospital.17. Basic amenities like notepad, calculator, calendar, clock, alarm, SMS/MMS, text, email, voicedial, phonebook, contact....and the rest you can read on the specs.18. Some notables:  - Video DJ - create video sequences  - Melody Composer/Music DJ - create your own ringtones  - Has some imbedded games/ringtones/themes already  - Disc2phone software included for music transfer from PC  - During music transfer or while plugged via the USB cable  to the PC, phone is charging.  - Downloadable ringtones, games, themes, and wallpaper are  available from SonyEricsson.com of which some are free.  - A dedicated shortcut key directs you to a menu of your  commonly used features on the phone.  - Supports Opera Mini web browser which I think is much  better than the default Access NetFront Web Browser.  - gives you option where to save files between phone memory  or the memory stick.  - phone status setting gives you up front information on the  remaining memory capacity, battery life, and profiles.CONS:1. Ear speaker volume may be too low in crowded noisy place.2. Carrier dependent features like downloading ringtones or games may not be supported yet by this phone as expected but there is always a work around if you know how.3. Pixelation is more noticeable on my video clips if I switch to widescreen. Understandably expected but sad nonetheless.4. Automatic standby offscreen is a good feature to conserve power but can be very annoying at times when you're still viewing the screen. I'm still trying to figure out if it can be adjusted at all. Sony are you listening?5. No camera lens cover. No biggie for me since I have a Krusell Leather Case around the phone however its still a minus. I've seen people mod this phone and put a K750 back plate as lens cover.6. No dedicated earphone slot. Must use first the supplied cable adapter to hook up.Overall the phone is great and user friendly. It meets most of my expectations in ease of use, common useful features, and of good quality. Just know that if you are tech savy, you can do many things on this phone that may seem limiting to others on average. You may hear complaints from early users a month or two ago about drop calls but this had been fix already or can be fix by updating the software easily from the manufacturer's website. It is also rumored that Cingular might carry this phone later this year. If I may brag a little, some online reviews give W810i as one of the Editor's top choice for cellphone. It is also one of the popular cellphones in asia and still continues to grab attention worldwide. So far W810i can be found on online retailers and third party dealer stores. Getting it unlocked by itself with no carrier plan is very expensive. Dont' do that unless money is not an issue. Get it cheaper with a plan or wait for Cingular..if ever. I know the wait is such a drag. Better yet if you can't wait, grab this phone and avail of Cingular or T-Mobile services now...it still works.Finally, if you love music or listening to tunes on the go, or better yet be able to watch video clips, watch movie(I do), browse the internet, play 3D games, take pictures, and most importantly make and received phone calls, then you're going to love this phone. Its simply loaded with fun stuff at your disposal. Goodluck and I hope this review was helpful.
My previous phone was a Nokia 6600. It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on, I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially, I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates, I gave up my plan. Without much pondering, I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i. Now, it's been four weeks. Let me just give you a brief run thru of features, pros and cons.Features1. This phone is an mp3 player. This phone is a torch/semi flash light(with an SOS signal that can be configured). This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera. Overall, it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2. The interface is fast. It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera. I'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second, to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds, a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture. Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly. It's around 7 times faster than my Nokia. Images can be clicked in sepia, black and white, solarise(kinda yellowey), negative and normal modes. Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button. I noticed grains on images of larger size. I don't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must. Plus while clicking a video, the light goes on and off, if the flash light is turned on.3. The build quality on the phone is both good and bad. I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones. It took me three days to get used to the keypad. The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell. So they're definitely there the next time around. The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic. Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece. The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down. You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on. There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone (800i) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4. The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory. The usable memory,however, is only 431mb. Upon connecting to the pc, both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the "my computer" icon. The accompanied software is almost brilliant. I loved "Disc2phone" and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs. Despite lacking an English Manual, I found I didnt need one because I don't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5. The bundled earphones are sublime. I cannot beleive the sound on these. They cancel all the noises in a room and it's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya's mesmerising voice or even Tool's prog metal for that matter. The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder. If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones, the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course. It supports m4a, mp3 and aac formats(and a few other formats)6. The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder. Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone cannot accommodate a mere 200 messages. The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on. Bluetooth transfers to Samsung,Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones. Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement. I don't use mine quarter as much as I used to. This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera. Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby, saves battery, easy to work with 50% brightness. Even when I reduce brightness from 100% to 50% (lowest possible) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen. The keypad is much lighter but that's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor, super graphics and wallpaper options, includes a good browser, calendar, good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15%. (tried and tested)- Good keypad(KEY FEATURE), good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone, mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent,fast log, the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter (The longer ones used in cameras) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic, looks a bit boring too soon, screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad, the message memory is very limite (Big DEMERIT) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory, only 431mb is useable. Ideally, i'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i.

As an already dedicated Walkman phone user(w600i)and converted SE afficianado, the w810i was an easy choice for me when facing the dilemna of having to find a worthy replacement for my beloved w600i(Which is no longer being produced.)Walkman phones are not only chocked full of quality features, well made, loaded with the extremely quick and user friendly SE interface, but also extremely easy on the eyes. And besides, it's a WALKMAN phone, complete with Sony's own Mega Bass trademark. It simply doesn't get any cooler than this.Rumour has it that Cingular will be releasing this phone sometime soon, but I found myself too impatient to wait and went along and got the unlocked version to use on my Cingular service. For anyone who has considered buying an unlocked phone but is nervous(I was,) I can most honestly tell you that SE makes it painless to set your phone on your network. You simply go to the SE website and answer a few questions about the phone, and they send you everything you need in a text message which contains special software for your carrier which installs itself. It is also beneficial to buy unlocked phones because sometimes service providers cripple some of the features and capabilities when 'branding' the phones to them and adding their own software. Also, sometimes the carrier's software can cause problems with the phone, which was rumoured to be the case with the w600i, which would often crash unexpectedly.Onto the phone. I was astonished when I saw just how small and cute the w810 is. It's size and width is about comparable to an ipod mini, and certainly lives up to it's "ipod killer" nickname since it has dedicated music buttons and can store up to 2gb(4gb in the future) of music(the w810i comes with a 512mb memory stick pro duo, NOT micro, which is what a lot of other mp3 phones have.)The camera is absolutely pristine at 2mp's and has a lot of cool effects. The radio is also extremely well done and lets you select preset stations and has RDS, which not only displays the station's name, but also the artist information and tracklisting for the current song(when available, as it's up to the station to provide that info.)You can use mp3's as ringtones, message alerts, and even as your alarm clock sound. Another neat little feature is that the keypad has a light sensor that automaticly brightens or dims it's light, depending on the amount of light in the room. As expected, the internet connection is flawless and lightning quick, and the bluetooth capabilities are all present and work beautifully. Plus, when you connect the phone to your PC, the phone and memory card are recognized as mass storage drives that are listed as "Phone" and "Memory Card," so you don't have to go out of your way to try to locate the devices on your PC. Special software is included but you don't even really need it, as I simply drag the files and drop them into the appropriate spot and it copies itself automaticly. I have no problems with midi, wav, or windows media files being put onto the phone, and as for itunes, you can also drag and drop them too, but I've noticed that some of the files are recognized and playable on the phone, and some are not; it's somewhat spotty with files in that format, but afterall, this isn't an itunes phone and what doesn't work in itunes format, I'll simply convert back to wma. Obviously, the 20mb of storage on the phone is mainly for use when adding themes, images or games, while larger files can be stored on the memory card. Of course, there are so many other little tricks and features that I haven't even discovered yet.Gripes? Not many! Afterall, this is a Sony Ericsson phone, which has every feature imaginable and cutting edge technology. My only disappointment from coming from the w600i is that the phone is a candybar, so it can't make cute little sounds when opened, and it doesn't have three speakers like the w600i(only one speaker,) so there is no stereo widening on this one(although I suspect this was a deliberate move in order to get us to buy the portable mini speakers{MPS-60} separately. Mine are on their way as we speak.) Of course, these are nitpicky little things...So, put down those Razrs and Chocolates and buy yourself a phone that really is a "toy," because you'll be playing with this one endlessly.
That I love my phone!!!???!!!  I now only have to carry around 1 thing...my phone.  It came with a 512 Memory Stick duo card and I have well over 100 songs which I put on it using the included software.  It has a 2MP camera which is better than most phones have (although, I think Nokia has a 3MP one).  The radio works well, although the earbuds are hard to use when you get sweaty at the gym (or at least for me...they keep falling out)The camera is a nice to have feature because I can't very well take my huge clunky, professional camera with me when I go to the Irish Pub down the street.  The 2MP camera is a quality camera and more than enough if you want to make 3x5 prints or upload the pictures on your blog.  The screen has good colors which are vivid and bright.  You do have some control over the quality of pictures that you take, too.  You can adjust the ISO, macro and the powerful lamp also doubles as a flash (ok, itz not great, but it works)  You can also switch to night mode as well.The phone itself is solid and comfortable to hold.  The buttons are easy to reach and very intuitive.  There is a feature that allows you to easily set up your phone.The MP3 player is just as good as an iPod (which I don't use anymore since I got this phone) and the external speakers are really great.  There is only a single button to push to turn on the player.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this phone and I'm glad that I purchased it.  I think that if you want a good all in one phone this is your new toy!
Before this phone I owned a Nokia 6230 and a Motorola SLVR L7, both international unlocked versions. Motorola phones like the SLVR and the RAZR are slick and feature-packed but they have a horrible interface, the non-US carrier supported versions are horrible to set up in the US and they lack a lot of features. Nokia is the opposite, nice user interface -possibly the best- but a downgrade in design and slickness. Enter the Sony Ericsson. This phone has everything: Feature packed, all the features work, easy to set up, friendly user interface and eye-catching looks. Before this phone I had an international version of the SLVR, which I use on the T-Mobile network and I was very frustrated with it (didn't recognize voicemails, only the sync feature worked with Bluetooth on my Mac, couldn't browse the Internet and some buttons were wasted on features not available in the US), no such problems with the W810i. It works with the network as good as any supported phone. The Walkman mobile interface works like a dream. I'm surprised by the quality of the pictures, which is similar to early Cyber-shot models. If I had to criticize anything about it would be the flash, which is not really a flash that goes off when you take a picture, but a light you turn on manually. I would have liked the lens to be covered for protection and hooking the headphones with a normal plug and not the Cell phone's proprietary jack. For the money, this is a phone that can almost replace your snapshot and your .mp3 player, so I consider it a bargain. It's also a cell phone that will make you stand out of the Motorola RAZR crowds, for those who consider a cell phone an accessory.
This phone can play music videos just like the ipod, with 400 kbps video rate and 128 kbps stereo sound.  It takes the same format as the ipod (3gp container) with qcif (176x144) resolution.It would be even better if the headphone jack is built into the phone instead of requiring SE's connector.
I haven't used an SE phone since Ericsson's T28 maybe 6 years ago. Motorola's asthetical appeal and occasionally superior features always dominated my phone purchases, moving from the v60 to v878 to a668 to v3 the last 4 or 5 years. Most recently, I became fed up with my v3's lack of capabilities.I changed to this SE W810 and I am thrilled to own it. First off, the 2MP camera blows away the old razr v3 vga cam.  Plus it is very intuitive to use since you hold the phone a way you would hold one of those disposable cameras.  The memory stick allows me to store as many pictures (and music) as I need. It plays music flawlessly, arguably better than my iRiver stand alone music player. The phone features everything and every convenience you might need.MOST IMPORTANTLY, I love this phone because of the detail in the design of the operating system. Hats off to Sony, seriously. It is incredibly easy to use. Understanding the functionality of the menus is so intuitive you can pick one up having never used an SE phone and have no problems doing what you want the very first time around despite needing to use the phone's long list of capabilities. Whenever an advanced function is needed, it is explained by a short succinct popup info message.The integration of the walkman features and the phone feature is amazing. The headset is one to be admired, serving as a radio antenna, microphone for handsfree use, and stereo sound for the walkman. While playing the walkman, you can receive calls by pushing a button on the headset, the phone knows to stop the music and take the call. Microphone has absolutely no distortion. You can also keep the music on while using the phone's functions like the calendar and the phone book. It will display the song in one line that appears on the top. Just incredible. The walkman allows you to build playlists using the phone. The easy access walkman buttons work flawlessly in line with phone functions, the play/pause button and the orange walkman button.This thing is just incredible, now I'm just worried about destroying the headset and scratching the camera when I bring it around, but that really shouldn't be SE's concern, it is really mine.Buy this, 10 out of 10 any day of the week. Don't be afraid of it's inferior exterior looks to phones like the SLVR L7 or SE K800 or Samsung D800's.  What's programmed inside makes up for it  10 or 20 fold.
Had the phone for about a month now and I love it, especially the Walkman. So since most of the reviews will tell you how awesome the phone is let me tell you some of the bad things.1) The buttons are to small, especially since I have big fingers.2) The connector that connects the phone to the headphones is awful. The gold contacts need to be cleaned daily or it will result in a loss of volume and sound quality, not to mention that sometimes the phone wont even know the headset is plugged in.3) I regret paying $350 for the phone b/c now I have seen that you can sign up for a two year plan and get it for free. This wasn't available when I got mine.Although I have stated only bad things don't get me wrong, this phone is awesome and one of the best out there.
I've had a lot of mobile phones. Dropped in pond, dropped off motorcycle (while moving), and often forget to insure. Many times just get bored. I have probably had all the brands, though not all models of course. And I'm hard on my phones. The best previous all around phone was Treo, and I still like the OS platform. But in terms of entertainment this phone is the best. The MP3 is easy to use and software is intuitive. Though still not sure if it accepts songs from iTunes. I've only loaded on my own CDs. FM reception very good, and I live in a poor reception area. The headphones are great, but I've always used Sony earbuds. Have not tried it for gaming yet, but will explore that. The camera is easy to use, good quality pictures, and screen can be seen in bright sunlight.And...oh yeah....it is a very good phone. This was my first experience with an unlocked phone but after installing the SIM from my prior drowned MDA it worked without a glitch. Blue tooth and hands free work well. I can even take calls while on motorcycle. Earbuds fit inside helmet and automatically cuts out MP3/radio.I would recommend this phoneI like the way it looks and has been sturdy so far. Also SonyEricsson website very well organized and helpful.I would highly recommend this phone if you are looking for a fun phone. I still carry my Treo 650 for work.
I bought this phone after making a horrible purchase at Cingular with their LG320.  Terrible phone.I bought the W810 so that I could play music at the gym after my wife started using my Ipod.  And this phone worked out perfectly.  After sticking 2GB of memory stick pro duo in to the phone, I was up and running in no time flat.  The phone has really easy to use controls and the music quality was pretty good.The software that Sony gives you is also easy to use and easy to setup.  I was easily able to transfer music and files back and forth to the phone.  I loved being able to go out to Sony's website and download new themes for the phone as well.I'm sad to say that I had to sell my W810.  I found that travel was too difficult without staying in touch with email.  So I've moved over to a Blackjack.  However, I am so sad to not have my little phone around.  I really got attached to it.  It was an awesome little phone and would HIGHLY recmmend it.
I've always been a loyal Motorola user when it comes to cell phones, my latest was the black razor V3.All the previous models from Sony Ericsson seemed to me to a little to delicate, and frankly under par, I decided to give a Sony Ericsson a shot, because of all the features that the W810i offers..... Let me tell you, it was an EXCELLENT decision.I couldn't be happier with this phone, if you get a 4GB card it becomes like an iPod Nano, only better and more complete. Imagine having a cell phone and a digital camera in your iPod.Get it with confidence, it's unlikely you'll be disappointed.
I've been a frequent phone switcher in the last few years and I've had the Sony T68, T610, T616 and the Motorola V3 RAZR, V3i RAZR and the SLVR as well as one blackberry.Let me tell you right now, this is the best phone out right now, period.  The Sony User Interface is literally about 3 years ahead of the motorola versions and it's painful to use a RAZR after using this phone.  Seriously, I love the form factor of the Motorola's, but you won't catch me anywhere near another Motorola phone until their UI is at least CLOSE to as phenomenal as the Sony one.The only "con" in my opinion on this phone is that (thanks to Apple) it can't playback protected songs purchased through the iTunes Music Store.  I love iTunes, and I'm an Apple person, but that is a bit of a bummer.  Apple really should be linking up with Sony Ericsson and not Motorola, as this phone with iTunes on it (or at least the ability to play iTunes purchased songs with the Walkman software) would be simply the best phone made YET....bar none.Even with the iTunes issue, this is still my first choice of any phone out as of October 2006.You won't be disappointed with the Sony Ericsson w810i.  I've tried all the popular phones and this is the best.  Anyone want to buy a used Motorola SLVR??: )
My T616 brought me to Sony Ericsson; my S710a almost drove me away. I decided to give Sony Ericsson (SE) another chance with the W810.Should be an awesome phone, right? Good-looking and well-built. Quad-band and EDGE. Walkman player and 2 MP auto-focus camera. That great SE interface, made even better and now lacking the infamous sluggishness of past phones. And as always, one of the best Bluetooth implementations available.And yet... My first phone died within 12 hours of using it; first power-cycle resulted in a flashing white screen. The replacement phone from SE's service center was shipped in a partially disassembled state. The replacement for *that* phone was fine for two months, but now has a FastPort that's going bad (wired stereo headsets - and I've tried a few - don't work properly any more). This phone will be going back as well, but what am I going to get in exchange now?I give the phone itself 4 stars, (my increasing concerns over its) build quality 3 stars, and SE's lousy service and support 2 stars. That averages out to the 3-star rating I've given above.
I upgraded from the Razor to the W810- what a difference.  Every function on this phone is of high quality.  My favorite is the very fast download speeds from the internet, the 2.0 pixel camera and the mp3 player.  I use this with T-mobile service which is fine, but Tmobile does not support this phone with T-zones...which is fine with me- but may be a bummer for someone else.
This is my first year using Sony Ericsson, I had previously only used Motorolas, which all worked well, but I wanted to try something new.  I signed my new Cingular contract and got the SE Z520a, which had horrible reception and OK features.This phone on the other hand has far surpassed my expectations- especially with the fact that the features actually work!  Reception is perfect so far, haven't made it out of town yet, but so far so good, and everything else has worked like a charm.  I'm not sure how the "My Friends" works which has apparently replaced the IM/chat section, so I will have to look into that.The camera is very nice, one would expect a 2mp camera to be better than VGA so I can't see how anyone would complain about that, and so far it hasn't disappointed.  I love the radio, and the themes are neat too.  It came with less ringtones than any other phone I've seen, but that doesn't bother me at all because once I load the music I will just use those.  The inside ear & outside speakers get very loud- I had read that the ear speaker was low, but they must have fixed that because it isn't on my phone!  The equalizer (including Mega Bass) & play modes for the walkman are neat too.Basically this is the best phone I've ever seen, much better than my friend's SLVR and RAZRs and I can't see how anyone would be disappointed with it!!
Where to begin??Well, I ran out and bought a 4GB MS Pro Duo the first day I got it (1 week ago). Now I have: 200+ songs with very nice audio (even the speakerphone), good quality snapshot pics (daytime), Full web browser (Opera Mini), RSS Reader, eMSN Messenger, email, 40+ games, Google maps (for directions), currency converter, all the stuff that the phone came with originally and I still have a little less than 3 GB left (videos coming soon).  Oh, and it's a phone too.  A very good one at that.  No dropped calls so far (005 update with Cingular service- Miami) and good battery life, especially when you consider that I have been using it quite heavily for the past week.  Feels solid too. Everything else has already been said.Gripes- The volume in the earpiece is a tad low (but much better than my old Moto V551), and I haven't figured out how to hear my ringtone while I have the earbuds on (while I listen to music, the music simply stops when I get a call). And about the earbuds- I like them a lot. Yes, it does kind of suck that you have to use the adapter (especially when you want to charge at the same time), but I don't see why they would not be portable since the buds and adapter are about the same length and size as a normal pair of earbuds.Overall, best phone I have ever owned.
I used to use Nokia phones until last December, when the Sony w600i came. That was another great phone also. I recently spied the w810i here and found it to look most intriguing.  I liked the design of it for starters; clean elegant lines and a stately satin black with small touches of Walkman orange make for an attractive phone.The layout is very intuitive and uncomplicated. This phone seemingly does it all. The pictures are the best I have ever seen from a camera phone, and with the included software (actually download the software from the website to make sure you have the newest version) sending your pictures to your pc is fast and easy via Bluetooth. It also synchronizes nicely with outlook, again with the convenience of Bluetooth. However, you will need to use the cable for importing your music.Now that were on the subject of music, the first thing I did, and you should too, is to put the included 512MB Memory Stick PRO Duo aside and buy a 2GB Stick. I imported 169 songs into the phone at 128kps and I still have over 1.2GB worth of space remaining on the Stick. Wow, that will hold a lot of pictures, videos and more songs!!!I know I should also list the shortcomings here, but I honestly could not find any. I will not list shortcomings that defy the laws of physics as some people do; "the buttons are too small", or if it is not that it's "the phone is too big". Am I missing something here? How can it be both ways? Actually, there is one thing that a few people have mentioned and that is that the earpiece volume can be a tad to low on some calls. But this is a small percentage of calls.This is a great high-end phone that you will be proud to own.
Sony Ericsson has a really great product here. It has everything I wanted. However, there is a well-documented hissing problem with the audio on the Walkman application that I din't discover until I got the phone. This is utterly *ridiculous* for a phone branded with the Walkman label. What's worse Sony Ericsson appears to acknowledge in support requests that there is a problem, yet will not fix it because the hissing was introduced when they fixed (via a firmware update) a sonic distortion problem when volume is cranked up.So, everyone who listens at a normal volume level is out of luck while people who are piercing their ear drums at least do it in crystal-clear audio. Nice. This is a firmware issue that SE refuses to fix, at least for now.SE had a real chance hear to create a killer product. It does a lot of thing really well. Just don't expect it to replace your ipod. Wait for the Apple cell phone. Apply appears to actually take audio seriously, unlike Sony Ericsson.
I was quite thrilled when I got this unlocked walkman phone. Its' voice call quality is great,music is simply awesome with the stereo headsets that come with the phone, and the phone's battery life is phenomenal. However, the phone drops way too many calls when I am in my apartment. I am with T-mobile and admiteddly, T-mobile coverage here isn't as great as those of other service providers. Nonetheless, my previous phones with T-mobile didn't drop calls whatsoever. But with this phone, I can barely be on a call for 5 minutes.T-Mobile doesn't officially carry this phone, and so help from that quarter wasn't forthcoming. Sony Ericcson webpage doesn't seem to have any software upgrades.Overall , it's an amazing phone,but with such high percentage of dropped calls, I would not recommend this productRam
i gotta say, i love this phone. i think it's trully amazing.when i first got it i thought it looked awesome and was smaller than expected.  you can get a 2g mem card for it and that is also amazing.  were talkin fully loaded, the alarm even has a snooze that you dont even have to turn on. metronome and list of guitar chords that you can hear on music mate. the camera and video feature set is great with cool effects and options.i call it my super phone and love to show it off. it also will tell you name of song and artist if station has it logged in.cons are few, but i'll name what i've figured so far. 1 radio has to have long wire antennae plugged in to play.  2 i would've liked the video camera to be a lil better at night, but hey it's a phone ;]  3 a flash would've been nice instead of having to keep the light on because it's blinding to look at. [ oh yah, it has a verry bright light that can be turned on or off that can also be selected to flash s.o.s.] 3 screen gets smudged real easy, but i don't know if theres much that could be done about that.  let's see, hmmm. i think that's it.  buy it and enjoy your new camera,video,radio,mp3 player,organizer, internet with java,and game player.  if something happens to this one i will be replacing it soon as possible w/ the same one.
I bought the SE W810i quite some time back now, in July 2006. I have been using the phone every day, ever since - and I have enjoyed the experience.* I recently bought a SE W910i for my wife. Except for the 3G, the W910 is a downgrade from the W810. Poor camera. Poor audio.* Compared to all the Nokias that I have seen (not the N95, N96), but all the other new Nokias as of 2008, the W810 still packs quite a punch.* This phone is light.* Well designed buttons. Not too many buttons. Intuitive software interface.* A very good camera.* Excellent audio.* Flawless interfacing with MacOSX.* Fast web browsing (EDGE).* Great, great battery life. Long lasting battery too. I use the phone quite a bit. And I need to charge the phone once in 3 days. Even now, after 2 years of nonstop use.* Opera mini browser works beautifully.* So do google maps and gmail. (Google maps can't zero in on the location, though. Apparently the version of Java used in the phone is old.)* Large memory. I have 2GB of flash and it works very well.* The torch is really really handy. In fact, this is all I had when I visited the volcano on Big island, and was stopped by the park rangers at night.* Phone can be used as a remote - and over bluetooth one can control the computer.* Infrared - I often store post-script files onto the phone and beam them to IR capable printers to print them.* Video recording - the audio pick-up is simply excellent.* Software is excellent. Does not hang. Fast and responsive. Even after 2 years of use.* Phone can be used as a modem. I have used it everywhere - airports, in the car... EDGE is decently fast. My experience has only been with MacOSX.The only reasons why I still look for phones now and then are:* A better camera.* WiFi capability.* GPS.* 3G.Apparently there aren't any phones out there that can match the W810i (I had bought it for $500 in 2006) at the same price, and yet offer me a better camera, WiFi, GPS and 3G.Yeah - probably the iPhone. But I hear one can't connect the computer to the internet through the iPhone... (Yes, there are reasons why I would want to surf the internet on my computer.)
These people need to state upfront, the fact that this phone has no US charger, no instructions in English, is based on the Orange network in Europe, so the additional extensive functions will only work for Orange users. These people are based in NYC, and I'm in California, so there's obviously an integrity issue here. I've seen other Americans say the same thing about other unlocked GSM world phones purchased from this company. I'm sure it's a great phone, but if I can't even charge it/comprehend the instructions if I could/ or use any of the additional dowload/update functions, what good is it?
The Sony Ericsson W810 is an amazing phone. It has a little bit of everything in it. It's not just a phone, it's also a digital camera, e-mail client, web browser and personal organizer. Featuring USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity, the W810 can sync with your PC and synchronize with Microsoft Outlook to keep your calender and address book updated. Of course, the selling point of the phone is the Walkman branding. This phone is a full-featured MP3 player, limited in storage only by the size of the Memory Stick Pro Duo you use. Like the iPod, you can create playlists on the Walkman, have songs shuffled around, rate songs and organize your music by artist, album or song title.Seeing as this phone is becoming cheaper and cheaper as newer models come out, I would highly recommend buying this phone. It's one the few Sony Ericsson phones that is quad-band and supports the EDGE network, meaning this phone will work all over the world, but especially well in North America.
This phone has all the cool features - bluetooth, mp3s, etc.  My main requirement for a phone was the ability to set mp3s as ringtones and this phone can do that - but ironically I found the build-your-own-ringtone software on the phone to be a lot more fun than, say, setting your default ring to "Let the Eagle Soar" by John Ashcroft.  Hard to describe this build-your-own ringtone software, but I absolutely loved it.Other pros include the great form factor - very pocket-friendly. I like the speaker mode for mp3s too, turns it into a mini mp3 boombox.But now to the bad parts - first of all, I couldn't hear people when talking to them on this phone.  On the very highest volume level I had to mash the phone against my ear and plug my other ear in order to make out what people were saying.  This is in a quiet room.  (no, I'm not deaf)  Maybe I had a defective phone, but the other things that annoyed me about the phone were sufficient that I didn't care - I just returned it.Those other annoyances - very short battery life, the requirement of an adaptor plug to use headphones with it (meaning I never actually wind up using it as a "walkman" since I never have the adaptor with me), and so-so pictures with the built-in camera.  I know it's just a cell phone camera but part of why I chose this phone is because I thought it had an awesome camera.  It doesn't.These nuissances might be minor to you.  The battery life issue is probably just due to the fact that I don't get a very good signal at work.  But I expect perfection out of a higher-end phone like this.  For me the hunt continues...
Hey, wow! that is the most important thing about this phone.  WOW.  one negative is the battery cover.  difficult to get off.  However, I am so pleased with this product.  Music, themes and games are so simple and fun to download to the phone and the sony ericsson web site is great in walking you through all you need to know about the phone.  whoohoo.
I had the W810i for slightly over a week and am very disappointed in it.  Assistance from Sony was sorely lacking.  I was told to send it to them (turnaround would be 14 to 21 days) to see if they could do anything to get it to stop dropping calls and to work with my Acura handsfreelink.  Cingular insisted unlocked phones would not work on their system - which was not quite the whole truth since I know others have working unlocked W810i phones on their system.What I like about the W810i:Small sizeEasy to navigate menusSound quality for both music and phoneEase of text inputCamera qualityWhat I dislike about the w810i:I could not get it work with my handsfreelink in my 2005 Acura MDX.  It would pair, but then transfer all of my calls made through the handsfreelink back to the phone.I had multiple dropped calls - almost every call!  I updated the software, changed the network to a manual selection, called Cingular, got a new SIM card and called Sony.  All to no avail.Bottom Line:I cannot recommend the W810i for someone who plans to use it as a phone!  It is a great music player though!
Got the phone 2 days ago. Love the function, look and everything. But the phone freeze during call today and it won't buzz, I can't even shut it off. Try to remove the battery from the phone to restart, but the cover would NOT COME OFF!!!! I try all day till my finger bruise up and still no buzz. Try customer service and were tell "not recommended to force open the cover" because it's not cover under the warranty (But can't shut off the phone!!) Bough to local phone repair center and were told they were having the same problem with this phone with many customer. They explain sometime they have to "smash the phone on the floor" to break it open. Am I the only person experiencing this problem??
I have read a lot of the reviews and spoken to a number of current owners of the Motorola Q. I have also owned and used Blackberries, Treo's, LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor. I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.The phone layout and design are excellent. Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo, the keys are in a much better location (about ½ up from the bottom end of the phone) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type. The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry. Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.Active Sync, which it comes with, is a breeze to set-up and start syncing. Works great with Outlook. I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account. I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring. No so here. Works like a charm and very fast. Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry, which my work has supplied me.The battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on. That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars. Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.One of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them. First, the Motorola is like any computer....having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer. Second, to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews. Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and "Kill All" tasks running.So far very happy with my decision.Update: 6/12/06After a week of using my Q, I am still pleased with my decision.  I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky, i.e. the screen is slightly off center.  Interesting...I didn't even notice until that person pointed it out.  What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well (pda, phone, etc).  I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good.  Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do.  I just need a device that syncs with my home computer (outlook), can send text and picture messages, syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet.  The Q does all that and more.Update 6/16/06Ok.  I have returned my phone(s) yes, plural!!  Let me explain why.The first phone had an issue with it's bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.My second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.Motorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.When I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on...they said the Treo 700w.  As such, I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w.  Wow, what a difference!  The Treo is much faster and much easier to use.  I would downgrade my rating but unfortunately once the stars are choosen in Amazon's rating system they cannot be changed.
MotoQ is a very good tool.  The designers have optimized the features for people who need to be connected via voice, email, and web without carrying a briefcase full of stuff everywhere.It's not a PC, so you will be disappointed if you intend to work extensively with a spreadsheet or other work applications.  This device is also not for power PDA users that service data centers from their huge PDA's.However, if you are on the road and want to be able to review an email, word, excel, power point, acrobat document, or quickly find information on a website from just about anywhere, this is an awesome tool.  I decided to keep my MotoQ when I had to review a 4MB pdf file for work during a family outing.  I was able to download the file and review it on the MotoQ.  A 5 minute time out was so much better than any other options.Something I found very delightful is the fact that I have constant access to the internet.  Waiting in lines has become just a little bit more tolerable since I could surf the net instead of reading 6 month old magazines.I was very concerned about a lack of touch screen, but within a day, the scroll & navigation keys won me over.  It is very nice to be able to use only one hand.So, why did I select the MotoQ over BlackBerry?  The MotoQ is actually a very good phone with superior call quality.  The bluetooth and speakerphone are the best I've used.  I was quite disappointed by calls on the BlackBerry, a deal breaker for me.  Please note that sending and receiving emails seem to be a bit faster on the BlackBerry, but downloading information from the web seems to take the same amount of time.  For me, functionality favored the MotoQ's phone call advantage, and the aesthetics made it easy to go with the MotoQ.**********Update: 6/17/2006As with previous reviewers, the honeymoon is already over.  I am finding that none of my prior PocketPC applications will install on this phone.  If you are migrating, you should seriously consider this.  Fortunately, there is only one application I really use frequently, and there are other less convenient ways to compensate for my application.Also, if you use the bluetooth headphone a lot, you really need the big battery or charge it frequently.  I was surprised to get a low battery warning on the MotoQ mid-day when my Razr would last the full day with similar usage.  The large capacity battery makes the phone look much less attractive, and it will no longer fit well in the nice fitted case.On the other hand, I've received several compliments on the sound quality of the phone on the handset, bluetooth headset, and speaker phone.  I don't remember getting so many positive comments on other cell phones I've used.I've got a few more days before the full refund expires if I opt for an annulment.  So, I'll keep it for now and post how I decide.**********Update: 6/22/2006OK.  I am keeping the MotoQ.  Let me go through my decision process in case it is of some use to you.First, more problems I encountered:(Please note that I am not tech support, and I am limiting my time on solving MotoQ problems.  So, there might be better solutions.  If you have them, I hope you will post.)(1)  If you get an attachment in the email, you cannot save it to the storage card.  This is lame.  There is a work around:  you can save the message into your Draft folder and view it later so that it doesn't disappear from your Inbox post-PC_download-send/receive.  If you have a lot of documents, your memory will fill up fast since the Draft folder is part of your internal storage.(2) You cannot edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint).  You can only view them.  Perhaps there might be 3rd party software that can do this.  For me, only real bummer is that the spreadsheets could be useful sometimes for simple math such as adding a bunch of numbers.(3) Windows Mobile OS almost survived a week without crashing, but crash it did.  Minor inconvenience, it just needed to be power cycled.  (Update: Windows Mobile OS has been crashing about once per month, not bad for MS)(4) For security code, you can only enter numbers.  And, because you have to press the activate-numbers-key, you cannot unlock the phone one handed.  This is really lame.  (Update: you can press the "ALT" key twice to lock it in the number key mode, so you can do this with one hand.)(5) I've been able to find all the PDA programs I used on my Dell Axim with comparable replacements for the MotoQ.  However, I've had to purchase all of them, and I have now spent a big chunk of the MotoQ discount on replacement software.Something obvious in retrospect:The MotoQ is a "smartphone", not a PocketPC PDA with a phone.  This was not a distinction that was clear to me with the fuzzy marketing; also smart since I probably would not have tried the MotoQ if this was obvious.  So, migrating from my Dell Axim to MotoQ was easy; nothing could be saved... buyer beware!Why I am keeping the MotoQ:I've identified more cons than pros so far, but there is a very positive and significant thing about the MotoQ: I use it all the time.  My wife noticed that the only other devices I've used as much were my Palm V & Sony Clie; may they both rest in peace.In spite of all the problems, the MotoQ is very convenient, so I use it.  I feel a little bit more organized and connected; more in control over my schedule.  I have some similar flashbacks of the switching pains from the big Flanklin planner to the Palm V.It is nice to quickly and easily see my calendar to check for schedule conflicts, instead of asking people to wait until I return to my office.  I like being able to spell a name to make a quick phone call from my contact list, instead of waiting to return to my office to find the number.  And, I really like being able to check my email to see if an important message arrived during a flight and being able to search for information w/o looking for a hotspot.  Yes, it is another leash, but one that helps me achieve higher efficiency and save time that I can later spend with my family.What was interesting is that when my Sony Clie died from old age & high mileage, I replaced it with a much more powerful Dell Axim.  But, I did not use it.  Even with Wifi, Bluetooth, functional office apps, etc, it sat in my desk or briefcase, only to be used a couple of times per week.  I could point out a lot of detailed reasons for this, but they all come down to the device being a little bit inconvenient (does not fit well in pocket, takes a couple of seconds too long to turn on & switch apps) to use, just enough of a barrier to keep it from being really needed or wanted.How often did I use the excel spreadsheet on the Dell Axim to do simple math?  about 5 times in 3 years.  How many meetings did I miss because the Axim was on my desk and not in my pocket?  too many to count!  How often am I using the MotoQ?  Enough to require a battery recharge every night... :)**********Update: 8/24/2006I am still happy with the MotoQ.  My MotoQ is 1 of 5 that my company purchased for some of the employees.  Of this group, 4 out of 5 really like this device; the 5th is OK with it.  The 5th person "downgraded" from the Treo 650, and she really seems to prefer the Palm OS.  None of us experienced the catastrophic problems mentioned in other reviews for this product.
My first statement right off the bat is that those who are writing negative comments seem not to understand the difference between the PocketPC and Smartphone operating systems.  I have personally been using both since the introductions of both PocketPC (with the original iPAQ) and with Smartphone (with the original Orange SPV).  I am switching to the Motorola Q from the i-mate K-JAM (aka the T-Mobile MDA/Cingular 8125); some of my more recent devices include the Treo 650 (Verizon), Samsung i600, Orange SPV, and the i-mate Smartpone2, as well as  several iPAQs: the 4150, the 2215, and the older models as well.  I will say off the bat that I agree, the Smartphone OS is much more simplistic, and I honestly LOVE it that way because that's what a phone OS should be like.  I definitely loved the PocketPC Phone Edition with the K-JAM but found myself wanting something smaller that would handle my contacts, calendar, To-Do list, multimedia, occasional gaming, occasional eBook reading, heavy web browsing and some light document viewing.  Enter the Motorola Q.  It does everything and it does it well.  I love the Smart Dial for instance: start typing in a name OR number and it will immediately start searching your contacts database for a match from which you can directly dial.  Try doing that with one hand on a PocketPC.  You can do it, but it's cumbersome (for the K-JAM/HTC Wizard, install SmartKeys from xda-developers.com for some improved one-handedness).In fact, anything can be managed with one hand because THAT'S how Microsoft designed the operating system.  I admit off the bat that I truly do not like Windows XP and I am a Mac user.  [I synchronize my MotoQ with my black MacBook using Missing/Sync and have not had any problems synchronizing via USB (occasional trouble via Bluetooth).]Microsoft's mobile OS, on the other hand, I am a great fan of.  To those complaining that you can't edit Microsoft Office documents, WHY would you want to on a screen this small?  It's not meant for that.  You can do some TXT editing as well as some light spreadsheet editing (using PTabs...check Handango.com).The PIM organization is nearly identical on both the PocketPC and Smartphone: if you want improved management of Tasks (as well as a better Calendar), I HIGHLY recommend Papyrus or Pocket Informant (both adapted from the PocketPC apps, and both are identical on the Smartphone).  Also, I highly recommend FACADE (again, check Handango or Smartphone.net), which enables a much more detailed (and TABBED) view of your schedule and To-Do list on your homescreen.For multimedia, the Q cannot be beat...the experience is much better than the Palm OS (the best multimedia app on the Treo 650, TCPMP, is better on the Smartphone).  I use TCPMP for video (it handles iPod-encoded MP4 video that is NOT purchased flawlessly).  For music, I use PocketPlayer 2.8 from Conduits (which displays a library screen similar to my iPOD's, with Album/Artist/Album Artist/Genre/etc. categories).  Sound quality using a 2.5mm to 3.5mm headset adapter and my iPOD headphones is excellent and sounds fuller than my iPOD, albeit with a lesser volume.  The Q supports Bluetooth stereo / A2DP as well; I have not yet tested this out.Other apps I highly recommend: CityTime Alarms SP (for a top of the line alarm clock application), PocketNES (NES emulator for the occasional Mario), MobiPocket Reader (for eBooks that you can purchase or, if using a Windows computer, convert with their free desktop importer-->I currently have The Kite Runner, The Devil Wears Prada, and The World Is Flat... on my device).  Agile Messenger is a great IM program.  SlingPlayer is a MUST for SlinBox owners and works flawlessly over EVDO (just be careful not to use 10+GB of data per month, or Verizon will terminate you based on their TOS).  Finally, Virtual Earth Mobile is PERFECT for a 411/directions app all in one...it's sort of like mini Google Earth.  Excellent for a free app.  Finally, PhatNotes from [...] is a top of the line notes application for jotting things down on the MotoQ...you can add text, voice, pictures, links, etc.On data: EVDO speeds in the NYC area are excellent and extremely fast, much to my surprise.  I don't miss WiFi much and love having fast internet wherever I go.  I use the EVDO for slinging, web browsing, Wikipedia searching for research information, Google.com/xhtml for everything Google (including access to my personalized homepage and news and GMail), Virtual Earth Mobile for directions, maps, and 411 lookup-type features, Agile Messenger for AIM conversations, and NewsBreaker for RSS feeds.Battery and performance: I was disappointed at first with battery and took advantage of Verizon's extended battery offer.  I have ceased to use the battery since buying it, however.  I can now use my Q for 2 days (with all of the above being used regularly, i.e. music for 45 minutes while jogging, browsing, eBook reading, PIM, etc.) on the STANDARD battery.  The biggest battery saver is a registry hack found on QUsers.com which enables EVDO time-out disconnects; without it, the Q remains dormantly connected to EVDO until you turn Flight Mode on or reboot the phone.  I saw a significant increase in battery life.  Note, this modification is not for those who use Wireless Sync.  For those who are concerned, pick up a car charger from Amazon.com for $8.99.  As for performance, the Q is SPEEDY, particularly if you disable the Key Tones (under Sounds in Settings) and if you use a Registry editor to increase the GlyphCache (again, see QUsers.com). The performance of the camera is excellent for a camera phone and, in solid daylight, the pictures are truly print-quality (with fuzziness of course, but printworthy nonetheless in 4x6).Overall, I have owned many mobile devices and love almost all of them; none of them have been as much fun to use as the Q, and none have seen the amount of use I get out of the Q (largely due to its size and ease of transport).  I highly recommend it to everyone who is not seeking a full-fledged mobile Microsoft Office editor; also, I recommend it to those who are at least somewhat tech savvy.  It requires a litte bit of work, but so did all of my devices.  Please do your research before slamming a device for not doing what it was not meant to do!
first off if you're looking for a hardcore pda to manage your business or whatever, this may not be what you are looking for so do some research first before posting a review that this isn't the PalmOS that you can run your corporate office out of.This is a smartphone, and it lives up to exactly what I thought I would get out of it. The functionality and design and weight are perfect for gadget hounds and the feature set is a good step up from a regular phone meets mp3/video/photo player meets a simpler office need interface. The audio quality both on calls and during playback is really surprising and crisp.PROS------ - lightweight and great design- - excellent audio quality for a smartphone- - advanced voice recognition and other features a great bonus- - great introductory priceCONS------ - battery life. check with Verizon on the extended battery. right now they are offerring a deal on it for like $19.99 (reg $60.00). Also remember the usb that comes with the phone to jack into your computer can be used to maintain the current charge level (not recharge the phone).- - pocket pc applications must be purchased and seem to run $19.99 each whereas I see people saying palOS ones are free etc. I really only needed the streaming audio station one and maybe 1 more for what I do with it so it wasnt a deal breaker for me.- - does not come out of the box with an SD ram unless I was missing something !- - maybe its my area or throttling but the ev-do connection seems slow for $40 a month.= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =SOME CORRECTIONS FROM REVIEWS ABOVE!= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =- someone listed there are not recurring events in the calendar and it sucks. This person did a.) not read the manual or b.) not play with it enough. At the end of the calendar entry form there is an occurs: option to select the item as a weekly, monthly etc re-occurrence- someone above listed you cannot save email attachments and it sucks. Again this person did not a.) read the manual or b.) play with the synching in any way. The wizard guides you through setting up synching and to save an email attachment simply mark that mail with the attachment to save it and the next active synch it will be saved to the Q.Personally I'm glad I got it so far and did some more research rather than blindly listening to what some of the reviews here said.
This seems to be a frequent issue with many of my recent purchases, out of the box few of my recent toys are up to spec.  But after a some well spent minutes at [...] everything is good again.As with my Axim X51V, and Olympus E500 SLR, TRD Supercharger, these things need tweaking out of the box for them to work as one wishes.After making the mentioned changes this device not only flys but it has made up for itself many times over.I am shocked that nobody has mentioned its Bluetooth PC Remote, you can control the mouse/desktop/powerpoint/mediaplayer using your Q via a bluetooth enabled PC.I find myself traveling frequnetly attending lectures and presentations mainly by industry leading professionals.  Yesterday our VP was presenting to a large room and got VERY bothered by the fact that the admin did not have a wireless controller for the slide show he was presenting.  20 minutes into his 2 hour presentation we had a break, and I wirelessly connected my phone to the bluetooth laptop and offered him its use.  Not only was he grateful but blown away (I am known at the office for my tech savy, but its always nice to see its practical implementation in such context).Just had to share that..Other great features are its blazing EVDO connection, it is just as quick as my blackberry from work when browsing the web, and the interface handles webpages better then my BBERRY does.The Bberrys interface was much snappier out of the box but by applying a few quick tweaks from qusers.com its within competition.Somebody mentioned the rubber flaps are weak, not true, they are the same flaps that are used on my E500 Olympus SLR camera, and my brothers 2,000 Canon SLR.And with the recent updated from Motorola you can wirelessly (bluetooth) tether it to your laptop and you can access the internet on the road!!These are the main topics that I felt were not covered at all, everything else you will find in the other reviews..Also this may even replace my Axim X51V permanently.. time will tell Ill update this again in about a month.cheers
I've had a Smartphone for about two years, so I'm not one of those people who didn't like the "Q" because I expected PocketPC features on it.  I switched from Cingular to Verizon for service reasons, and the Q seemed like the closest phone to the Audiovox SMT-5600 that I had and liked.  It was definitely wider, but thinner, which seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.In my opinion, it turned out not to be.  The phone was really too big to carry in a pocket easily.  Once I decided that I needed to carry it on my belt, I decided to get the XV6700 instead.  It's a lot thicker, but it has a slide-out keyboard with much bigger keys, plus a stylus/touchscreen and the PocketPC features.  I'm very happy with that choice.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell that phone for Verizon (though they have the Sprint version).Other things I disliked about the Q:- The keys are impossibly small.  I used a small blackberry for a long time and was fine with it, but some combination of the size and the feel of the keys made it very hard to use.- There are no dedicated keys for phone use.  The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first.  Dialing a number on the Q is just plain hard to do.  Finding the * and # keys is even harder!  Finally, if you need to find any letter equivalents of the number keys, you're out of luck unless you've memorized them all.Good luck with whatever you purchase.
-- The screen clarity is exceptional, much better than a PDA I own.-- It's not cheap. Verizon unlimited data -- on top of a phone service -- is $44.00. If you have 900 minutes and unlimited data you may be paying around $130 a month. Also, be aware that although Verizon advertises "unlimited broadband" it isn't selling unlimited broadband. The agreement's fine print includes prohibitions against streaming and downloading large files. You can't use this a substitute for a cable modem/dsl connection if you stream heavily.-- Battery life is no good. I bought two extended batteries, which I use full-time. The extended batteries change the shape and size of the Q but, honestly, I don't mind. Plan on buying extra batteries right away.-- The sound quality is excellent. The best I've ever had.-- The Windows software is a little buggy. Weird things pop up every now and then, but nothing that gets me excited. I haven't upgraded yet.-- Cool thing: The voice recognition actually works with the bluetooth headset. If you are walking in the wind there may be issues, but I've found the voice recognition to be surprisingly responsive, not perfect, but usually good.
I'm a full time student, I work full time, and am involved in an industry where I always have to be connected. I use the internet on my phone constantly, have to keep up-to-date contacts, and use the calender as my main planner.I've had the phone since August 12th- so I'm almost at the two month mark and I've had VERY few problems with the phone.My main pro's and con's-PROS:+The phone is VERY lighweight and compact- its less cumbersome that my previous motorola flip phone which was just a year old.+The extended batter provides a good, full day and a half- two days of battery life.+Instant Messaging Application is great and convinient, AND the IM's don't count as text messages.+Keyboard is functional and easy-to-use. It's hard to use with one hand, if you're a text-while-you-drive kinda person (god forbid), but it can be done, nonetheless.+The phone works just fine. I haven't had problems hearing anybody or having anybody hear me.+Screen is great. I bought a screen protector and there are no scratches and it's very easy to clean.+The scroll button and "back" button on the side is a nice feature+The home screen convinently shows the links to the most previously used applications, and also shows the date, time, number of messages in your inbox (text and voicemail), in addition to showing your next appointment.+It is easy to use, and I DO use it. I also looked at the Treo 700 and for the price, the Q was the obvious choice. One thing to be mindful of, though. You can view word, excel, pdf files on the Q BUT unlike the 700 you cannot edit any word or excel documents.+Verizon's Ev-Do high-speed wireless network is great. While there is no wi-fi on the phone, this feature definitely compensates. I have no problem browsing even large webpages. Make sure to get the unlimited data plan if you are going to spend any amount of time online, though- which you should be if you buy this phone- because a data package is REQUIRED.+Speakerphone is clear and loud- works nicely and theres a one-touch button that enables it as well.+Camera takes nice clear camera-phone-quality pictures.CONS:-I bought a 3rd party calender application, "Extreme Agenda", and it would not load or install properly. Waste of 25$.-The processing time is a TAD slow. Not a real problem for me at all, but not razor sharp.-Price - data plans are expensive through verizon. There are only a few available and with a 1000 texts per month bundle, insurance on the phone,  the data plan(unlimited),  and minute plan(1350 anytime), the total, with tax at the end of the month is always upwards of 130$.-1 or 2 calls dropped here and there. Really not an issue by any means- may have been lost service. Has happened only happened twice in two months.-Voice Record function sucks- the quality of the sound isn't very good.-3rd party applications are a bit expensiveIt's a great phone- durable (unfortunately i HAVE dropped it once or twice, but no real scratches or damage), sleek, and functional. Definitely the best cell phone i've owned.
Having previously owned the LG VX9800 (one of the best phones EVER made) for nearly a year, I was hesitant at first to switch over to a PDA/Smartphone format...but I'm glad I finally did.  The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go.  Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset.  This phone, however, is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible.  It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare.  The speakerphone is of good quality, so if you don't have a headset and don't like pressing a PDA to your face, phone conversations still come through very clear.  Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features, but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times.  The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q doesn't have dedicated number keys, unlike the VX9800.  Also, the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open.  Those are my main gripes about the phone, but overall the positives outnumber the negatives.  The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen.  Speaking of the screen, its very bright and crisp...though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging.  As I stated at the beginning, the Internet features are oustanding.  I have Verizon's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live, I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player.  In fact, the Q multi-tasks like a champion: One time I was listening to a streaming audio feed, surfing the Internet, and sending a text message all at the same time without a trace of hesitation from the CPU.  Non-Internet applications like Pocket Streets and Trips also run smoothly.  With a gadget like the Q, laptops are suddenly looking more and more like desktops.
All these people complaining about the phone are clowns.  The following are the reasons why.  They are expecting something that the phone does not promise.  They want a blackberry device, but purchase this instead?  Where is the logic in that?  Also, it should be noted that this is a Smartphone, not a PocketPC.  However, people are constantly complaining that their PocketPC applications will not install.  Of course they will not install! They are not the same thing!  Thats like someone complaining that their DVD player wont play their VHS tapes.  I also see people complaining that their device freezes, or locks up.  My device did that also.  Then, I called verizon wireless, and the tech reps were very helpful.  They made a phone call to the local verizon store, and told them to replace my phone with a brand new one.  The new one i recieved worked like a charm, and never once froze.  Unfortunately, my phone was stolen from me a week ago, but I love this device so much, accompanied with Verizon's service, that i actually bought another Moto Q.  It is true, the battery life is short if you push the tool to its limits, there is no denying that. However, what exactly do you expect? This is a cell phone and you're browsing the internet, reading E-Mail, Chatting on MSN Mesenger, taking photos, video clips, listening to MP3's, Watching movies or shows on Windows Media Player, and maybe even playing games. The fact that this little device can do all that on a small battery is pretty impressive.  All the nay-sayers are just expecting something that no phone can deliver to this date.  Lastly, Motorola has just released a firmware update for the Q giving the device improved bluetooth support, SMS-to-Email functionality, and Dial-Up-Networking, just to name a few.  I almost forgot.  "B. Lim" complains that the phone no longer fits in the holster with the extended battery.  This made me literally laugh out loud.  His Moto Q is not fitting in the holster, because the screen-side goes into the holster, not to be confused with the camera-side.
I think the style of this phone is what sold me on it, well that and I was about $100 short of what the XV6700 costs :)  I would give this phone a 3.5 (why don't they allow half stars on here??) In all honesty I wish I could give this phone a better rating.  But, from my week or so with it, it's mostly style and not a lot of substance.I will start with the consIt's a Smartphone and NOT a PDA phone, it can do a whole lot more then a regular cell phone, but next to a PDA this is a semi-toy.  I think Motorola isn't saying "smartphone" and people see it and think it's a Treo.No touch screen, no Smartphones have them, but it would make things a whole lot easier.  Can you even select/cut/paste text from a web site? I can't figure out a way.  For over $400 bucks spent (wasn't eligible for upgrade) I expect a bit more powerit's butt slow, I did the "speed hacks" which I found online, and they did help, but it still takes forever to boot up and some of the programs seem to sit there and think before they open.contact section is a joke, there are almost no configuration options. I ended up spending $30 bucks on Photo Contacts Pro 4, which does what the phone should have done out of the box.this ties in to the last one, you can't use mp3's as caller id ring tones, it will allow you to set an mp3 as the default ringer, but not for people in your contacts.  Photo Contacts Pro solves this, but again, I shouldn't have to spend money to do basic things.surfing the web is hit and miss. Some pages don't display right (the screen is small) and some do.  And some of the ones that do, you can't navigate well because I don't see a way to select buttons. Something the scroll wheel could and SHOULD DO!My screen fades to white and requires a reboot at least twice a day. I am going to be taking it to the Verizon store to see if I need a new phone.  From some Googling, I see there are a bunch of people returning the phones due to problems that make the phone unsable.The phone has some pros.the size & shape are very nice.  Asthetics is a personal thing, but a lot of people seem to love the looks of it. It feels pretty solid in my hand, and it only took me a few days to get the hang of using it 1 handed, even to text messagethe screen is great, it's not as big as I'd like, but it's very colorful and the text is easy to read.the speakerphone is decent.  I am very hard on phones when it comes to judging the speakerphones.  It's not nearly as loud as a Nextel phone, but it does the job much better then any other cell phone from Verizon I've used.  Ringers are plenty loud, and at max volume it doesn't crack, or hurt your ears.  Sometime a Nextel can.Battery life - a lot of people have been complaining about this, so much so Verizon sells the extended one for 20 bucks.  I honestly think with the battery size and the screen size, the phone gets acceptable battery life.  I bought the desktop charger so I can charge both batteries, get data connectivity, and have a nice little stand for my sweet looking phone. So battery life is no biggie.phone is easy to use up against your ear, nobody has complained they can't hear me, and I can hear everybody fine.depending on your stance, the fact the phone doesn't have Get It Now, may or may not good a good thing.  I kind of wanted to get some of the 3d games, oh well...For everything I dislike, there's something else I like. The phone is far from perfect, but it's got the looks, and seems to work resonably well.
I was very excited a couple of months ago to finally be able to get out of my Nextel contract that my wife and I had.  I decided I wanted a smartphone, I had my eyes originally set on Cingular and the BB 8700.  But with Amazon you cannot port your number and that was a big deciding factor.  I chose to go with Verizon and with the Q.  I just wanted a phone that could sync with my work Outlook calendar, was not looking to use email.  I found out that the Q would do that.After a couple of months having it, it is a decent phone.  Signal strength is pretty good.  I just moved and my old house I could only get 1 or 2 bars (my wife's E815 had full signal) but my new house I am getting full strength.  I especially enjoy the Bluetooth for my headset while driving and the IR port for syncing my Outlook calendar from my work laptop which has an IR port.  The screen is nice and crisp and the camera takes decent photos.I do agree with other posts about how it seems to take 5 "clicks" to get something done.  Very annoying...I also do not enjoy the lack of home screen layouts.  None of the layouts that are pre-loaded I enjoy.  I do not know how to program in XML to get one the way I want to layout. One thing that does drive me crazy is the battery door.  It is made of this cheap, flimsy plastic.  You would think with a high quality phone like this it would have a better quality plastic or even possibly metal?  The corners constantly pop out.So all and all, it is an alright phone.  I can't beat the price that I got it for and it does want I want it to do.FYI- you do have to order the phone with the data package, but you can always CANCEL it when you get the phone set up.  Amazon customer service told me that this is not a violation of the terms so you are not docked the $250 for the price of the phone discount.
When I originally got my Q in August, I had a love-hate relationship with it. I loved the features and style, hated the fact it only worked on occasion! It crashed, it froze, it was a disaster. I even had to replace my first phone within 2 weeks of arrival. But after installing the software update (available at the Motorola website since late August), the phone has been almost flawless. All applications work as intended, the screen is a delight, signal reception is much better than my previous LG phone (and my non-updated Q), and the bluetooth interface works perfectly with my Acura HandsFree Link. It is amazing to get fast internet, automatic e-mail downloading, and a solid phone in a package this small. I would not have reccomended this phone 3 weeks ago, now I do it without reservations.
Let me start by saying that I've had a Blackberry since 2001 and am addicted to e-mail and the mobile web.  I actually worked in the mobile industry for 4.5 years and was involved in applications, handsets, and mobile access.  So, naturally I compare this Motorola Q to the string of Blackberry's that I've used.  I thought that this would be the right combination to make me switch to a "smartphone."  I have to say that after a month of use, it's not quite ready for prime time.  It's a great phone (great reception, pretty good speakerphone, etc.).  As far as a data device, it's ok.  The big complaint comes down to...  It's not very intuitive to use.  The user interface can be frustrating at times.  Which controls do I use (is it the roller button, the back button, the toggle, the push button, the home button, the 'off'' button...).  The applications are not consistent in how they are used and thus frustrating.  As compared to the Blackberry (even the 7130e on Verizon, which is a horrible phone, reception wise), which uses a consistent user interface across applications, it takes awhile to get used to things.  It's hard to tell if it's the immaturity of the Windows Mobile operating system, Motorola's implementation, or the immaturity of the developer tools, but likely a combination of all of the above.  One really annoying quirk is the roller button keeps going into adjusting the headset volume (in a loop) when you're trying to navigate mail.  The other big complaint is that the mail interace is a data hog if you want it to push mail to you (it doesn't seem to actually push, the phone polls the network using your data allocation).  If you're going to use mail at all, get the $49.99 unlimited plan.  You'll burn through the 10mb pretty quickly.  I used 4.1 m the first day (realize there is some set up overhead, but it was still amazing).  Didn't use 4.1 m a day on my blackberry (ever) and I receive over 200 messages a day.I've only used it a month, which is good and bad.  I wanted to give it time to get comfortable and second nature, before I rated it, however, it took me a month....
Or maybe not.  The good news is that for less than $200 ($100 if signing new agreement) this phone offers one of the best values in the current batch of "smart" phones.  The bad news is that you will be paying alot more for VerizonWireless services.The phone offers most standard features which you would expect such as Web Browser, Outlook, MS Office, Multimedia, etc.  It has a nice design with big screen.  The phone's talk quality is very good.  I use Goodlink to synchronize the phone with my company's mail server, which works nicely.When comparing to the Treo, Q's biggest weaknesses are the lack of touch screen and the inability to edit word docs and spreadsheets (the Q can read them but not edit).  These features are not that important to me, but some of my coworkers find the touchscreen feature to be very useful.  The standard battery lasts only about a day, but the extended battery lasts at least a day and half with moderate/heavy usage.My biggest issue with the phone is the keys.  My thumbs are too big to type accurately, so typing a 100 word email sometimes takes much longer than it should.  I have been using Tmobile's SideKick for a while and it's ALOT easier to type on the SideKick.VerizonWireless pricing is another concern, since this phone is a VerizonWirless exclusive I believe.  The standard 900 minute plan plus unlimited data totals about $110 before taxes.  After adding on $15 for a feature which allows the Q to be used as a broadband modem (Older Q models will need to download the latest patch first), $10 for 500 text messages, and $6 for insurance, my total monthly bill comes out to be somewhere north of $150.  If you are concerned with the cost and your company is not reimbursing your wireless bills, I suggest giving up this phone and use another carrier as similar level of services could cost $40+ less.Compared to the Sidekick, the Q lack a free, basic sticky notes utility, which I use all the time when I need to lookup airline and hotel reward numbers.  Goodlink does provide such utility but it's not free.Overall, I have been pleased with the phone so far.  I tested the download speed when the phone is used as a modem and I got about 385kbps download speed and 56kbps upload speed.  When using the phone as a modem though, you will also use up your airtime.
A lot of the reviews here are negative for a good reason: If you love a new product so much, are you going to spend time raving about it on random websites? No, you're probably going to be using it. I read this reviews, was nervous, but bought the phone anyways because everyone said it has great call quality- something you can't find in most phones with a QWERTY keyboard and windows mobile.So I've had the phone for about a week now. Setting it up on the network was tough because I ordered it with overnight shipping and Verizon didn't have me in their system yet. After calling customer support they had it on in an hour. After syncing my blackberry one last time I installed the active sync software and all my appointments and contacts were downloaded easy. I don't use outlook, I use gmail since I use 4 or 5 different computers depending on the day, so after setting up the POP access emails were downloading easily. Almost too easily. A glitch with gmail means any email I send from the web, also appears in my Q's inbox. Its annoying, but any email I send from the Q also appears in gmail so I always remember what I sent other people. with my work email account using SMTP I have no problems. If you do use outlook or something similar on your computer, wireless-sync will "push" emails to your Q. For me, it checks every 15 minutes which is often enough but not instantaneous. Like I said, all emails I send from gmail appear on the Q so that eats bandwidth. No problem if you have unlimited, but I don't. I set the Q to only download headers. If its important I then download the whole message (only another minute to wait) and if its not I delete it, and deal with it on my computer.The main reason I bought this phone over the HP Mobile Messenger, another Blackberry, the SDA, and the other sliding QWERTY phones is the call quality. My Blackberry sucked, thanks in part to TMobiles crappy reception. Verizon is clear as can be. People are excited they can finally understand me when I use my cell, and since almost everyone I know is on Verizon, its all free calls. So the phone is great, speakerphone isn't bad, but most speakerphones are less than ideal. You do get some noise in windy environments though.Controlling the device is a little odd since I'm used to the Blackberry which had a trackwheel and back button on the side. The trackwheel works the same, but the other button doesn't. There is also a back button on the front of the Q and the two act differently sometimes. I still haven't figured it out. The home and "end" keys also have similar functionality. There is a dedicated messaging key, and camera key which is nice. Again, since I'm used to the BB I'm not used to using the "back" button for delete- where the delete key on the BB was, is "enter." This just takes time. Another nice thing is "check names" like outlook. When I compose a message I just type in the person's name, and then it will search after i hit send and I select the final recipient. Or, I can type the name from the home screen, select, and then select the type on contact method. Last annoying thing about messaging- a popup tells you when a message is sent. I KNOW a message was sent- I sent it.So that's how the Q fares as a communication device. As for PDA-like features the calendar is standard, nothing special. I haven't downloaded apps but since it is Windows I'm sure there are many. Included games are solitare and bubble breaker, which are addicting as any games. I haven't used the internet so I can't comment on that, nor have I used voice dialing. One thing I do like about the Q is that I can assign pictures and ringers to individuals contacts- something the BB was without. Camera is great, I just spent half a day going around downtown and the pictures are awesome for a camera. Not professional, but I'm not a photographer by trade.Another feature that I love about this phone is media player. I bought a 1GB miniSD card, and filled it with songs and used a pair of bluetooth stereo headphones from an old HP PDA and it works like an MP3 player. Audio does skip at times, but not too bad, and that has to do with BT not the Q- I've had the Q play as a radio in my office and it was fine.Some bad things: the battery does suck. Some people complained you had to charge it everynight. I've charged every phone I've ever had every night. This one won't make it the day if I use it as an MP3 player often. I plan on buying the docking station and an extra battery. The station can charge my Q AND a second battery. So, I hook my Q to my belt, and slip the battery in my pocket, switch them halfway. Its a small price to pay for the sleekness of the Q. Other solution: buy the extended battery and have it stick out a bit. Other annoying thing is that the phone isn't completely customizable. Granted my BB had two themes- Tmobile and BB, but with an open operating system like windows I would expect to be able to choose what appears on my homepage and where.Other problems posted here:-Freezing- It has now and then, not daily, and its not the end of the world to pop the battery out. I've found that since I turned off the device at night it doesn't freeze. Let it rest!-Processing speed- It takes time, sometimes, especially the camera, but nothing really aggravating. Just take a deep breath and its ready.-Closing apps- I couldn't find a way to close the apps that appeared on the quick launch bar (which I assumed to be a taskbar) My friend showed me the task manager and that only a few programs were actually open (media player, msnserver, quick list, remote API, solitare, and task manager) which only took 30 out of 50MB of RAM.screen off center- Yes, but doens't bother me.Bluetooth didn't work - works fine for meNo Office Editing - Don't use it, doesn't bother meSecurity code only numbers - don't use itsignal strength - never had a problem. I'm actually very happy with the signal since I came from tmobile which would loose signal once I went inside. Verizon works almost anywhere- even in basements and elevators (although barely).Can't input numbers in call - not true. I've called and used numbers for voice trees fine- verizon voicemail requires you to punch in a numeric password which works fine too.Screen stays on- to the guy that wrote "you have to hit a button to see the time, and then it stays on until it times out" I'm not sure what you were expecting. It saves battery life by turning off.Price of verizon- I'm paying what I paid for the blackberry, plus I now have extended warrenty and insurance about $80 (I have 10MB of data a month, whereas I had unlimited for BB)"Spoofed" email address- I've had no problems getting flagged as spam, I think it was how that guy had his spam filters set- that's your problem buddy, not verizon, and def not the Q. Your Q is not given a specific email address like my BB was so it appears to be sent from my gmail. No problems with that here...BB "smart complete" better than Q- perhaps, but I turned it off on my Q. With a key for every letter I don't need the phone to figure out what I'm typing like the BB 7100t did (two letters per key) I just type it out."Extremely Delicate" - I dropped my Q on pavement crossing the street the first hour I had it. (I put it in the holster the wrong way) Minor scratch on the corner, but still works fine.Hard to feel vibration - I almost jumped out of my chair at work when this thing started vibrating on my waist- and that was just an email!Loud error beep - haven't heard it.All in all, the negatives you will read on here and other sites are the minority. I'm very happy with my phone. If you have any specific question email me nf515738 at gmail dot com
I wanted out of my contract with cingular and the Q was just the motivation to make the jump to verizon. I wanted something PDA-like but not a treo (I have a palm and well PalmOne's OS has not really evolved). I wanted something that wasn't too pricey and at 199 the Q worked. The basics are great (i can make calls, the person on the other end can hear me, the speakerphone works well)and the price point -- also great.However the screen is bright but barely seeable in bright sunlight (which may be a bit of a problem considering it's portable and people are prone to make calls -- outside). I find myself often looking for shade to see which contact is highlighted or which app is highlighted. The battery fully charged barely lasts 6 hours. The extended battery which I purchased after realizing this fact, lasts a robust 9ish hours. Of course the problem I have is that it's not like I am talking for a considerable amount of that time --- generally my day consists of a few (maybe 3 or 4) calls, that last a few minutes each (maybe 7 or 8 minutes top). I find myself rushing home, hoping the battery will last until I can get home and charge up the phone.Some minor qualms about the Q are the covers for the miniSD slot and headphone jack, the button sensitivity and the lack of software (the version of windows mobile 5.0 used on the Q is a hybrid of the windows mobile OS used for the treo et al). The covers for the slots are crappy and will probably break off soon. The buttons are really sensative, I have to be careful when it's in my purse or pocket as a slight brush results in the camera coming on with the flash or random dialing from the contact page.Overall -- I've seen worst but the Q hasn't lived up to the hype and I hope there are some serious improvements in the work for the GSM version.
If you get this phone there are a couple of things you need to do. First get the software update from the Motorola website. It will greatly increase the usability of the phone andf fixes a lot of the bugs that are present in the OS. Also, VERY IMPORTANT! DO NOT use Verizon Wireless's Wireless Sync and Activesync at the same time. If you start to use Wireless Sync then the Q will disable Activesync. This is because if you use both together and enable Activesync in the Wireless Sync menu, YOU WILL DUPLICATE CONTACTS. So if you even run Wireless Sync once from the phone, you need to go into Wireless Sync settings and enable Activesync in order to use Activesync.
My phone was fully charged when I left work yesterday at 4 pm. I then talked on a call for 37 minutes.  I did not do anything else.  The phone was dead this morning at 7 am.It is dead every morning unless I remembered to charge it.  It is completely usesless for morning commute business calls because it always dead and I don't always have access to a plug.I am also irritated that I have to keep car and wall chargers with me at all times.  I have never had a cell phone die like this.I still like the PDA features in the phone. It is light, slim and fits in my front pants pocket. It is very easy to type and download email, check my calendar, news, etc.  It is top-notch for managing my work and family life.Thus my only complaint is the battery.  I would give it a five star rating but for this very big issue.  I am now going to try to contact the kiosk vendor at Costco where I got it, Verizon and Motorola to see if one of them has a solution.  I should not have to waste my time to resolve this.
I am writing this review from my Moto 'Q' so that should tell you a bit about the power of the 'Q'. There are some really great features.  I purchased the 2 gig minisd memory and have everything from movies to music stored on here. It plays every music file (except apple format) but .mp3, .wma, and even .wav are clear as my pc. I even got the sterio adapter and have over 500 tunes I can listen to by plugging this puppy into my amp! I compress and converted video files to .wmv format and watch videos on the plane. There is also some great 3rd party software I put on this, and syncing to the pc is a snap. (now i use this as my laptop modem) I could go on and on about the features, email, im, sterio bluetooth, any song I want as a ring tone. I just don't know how this little device can do all of theese things! Laptop and ipod manufacturers beware, the price on this is way better than a laptop and why buy an ipod when all it does is play music... I get to surf the net, call my buddies, play games, and when time permits get a little office work done too. Call quality is better than my land line. If you can buy one for $100, do it!
I use it more for business than personal use. Here are my findings.1) Syncs with Outlook - I keep all my contacts and schedule on my Q. Sometimes the sync conncetion doesn't work, though. Puzzling. Update!!! Now that I am running Windows Vista, it syncs flawlessly every time.2) Great screen - Not as big as a PDA screen, but big enough, and the quality/clarity is top shelf. Easy controls mean you don;t need a touch screen.3) Great sound - Superior as a hands-free speaker phone or for playing music. Headphones are still better, but this speaker is nice when you need it.4) Lots of accessories - I have a leather case, 2GB sd card, and bluetooth headset. That just scratches the surface. Also bought the hi-capacity battery.5) Email. Supports POP and Gmail (from my experience).6) Battery life not so good with standard battery. Needs a charge daily. Keep a wall charger and car charger nearby to ensure you can juice it up when it is low.7) Expansion options/versatility - Can be used as a GPS device with upgrade (not too expensive, either). Can be used with a Slingbox to watch TV. Nice!!!
After 6 months of being using the Q, I believe I would've been better with a Palm Treo 650-700. The Q looks great and feels comfortable in my back pocket, but, the software is confusing, the keys so dificult to find ( specialy if you are almost 50 yo). Now lets talk about all in one funtionallity, I still cannot find a comfortable compatible headset for it to play my music, the bluetooth ones are lousy, big and the quiality terrible. The inear wired ones are not compatible, and the mini usb offered by some internet dealers simply don't work and do not even think about an adaptor. So I still carry  my Ipod . If I could start all over again I will stick with the treo... What Motorola was thinking...and please don't make me talk about battery life......bad....
At first I really liked the Q.  I was using the Treo 700W because of its compatibility with corporate outlook and the Q has that same compatibility but in sleek, slim package.But then the battery problem became painfully apparent.  It would not even last a whole work day with around 90 minutes of phone calls and auto synch set for 15 minutes.  So I trotted down to Verizon to get the extended battery.  This worked, but now the phone was so bulky that I was better off with the Treo.So I returned the Q and reactived the 700W (which is not great on battery life but far better than the Q).I would keep the Q were it not for the battery life issue. It is less fully functional but I think overall a better package than the 700W. If you only need to have it check your e-mail every few hours, and you do not make many phone calls, this is a great choice. But until the battery issue is sorted it is hopeless.
As everyone says - battery life is extremely terrible - especially if you surf the net from Q. I have gotten pretty good speeeds connecting from Q to the internet - but I noticed that battery starts fading after 30 mins of continous internet use.Q performs as well as any other cell phone out there. It is just that the hype has gotten way over what reality is. Reality is that is a pretty decent hardware with a software that can really get you frustrated from time to time. It is annoying to see messages pop-up indicating microsoft has a problem with the device - Can we send information to debug etc - ON your cell phone. I had a blackberry 7100t before from T-Mobile and I still think the intelligent text completion is much much better in the blackberry than Q.Bluetooth device recognition for headset worked well. I also downloaded syncml for doing some corp server sync up and that seemed to be good as well. Ringtone and picture customization seems to be prety good as well. When you are in bluetooth mode - voice command gets activated on engaging which I thought was nice.I DID return the first device that I got as it was buggy to the max - the second one that I have for the last 1 week - seems to be holding up wellBottom line -test your unit real well.Carry a charged battery all the time - when you are not on Q - keep charging (either through your computer - through the USB or in your car).
I bought this phone last week, played around with it for a few days, and decided to return it for a couple of reasons. The Q was my first Smartphone ever, and it looked like a good first step. While I was impressed with the Ev-DO network, the phone's operating system is laggy, therefore accessing the internet quickly becomes a problem.The phone's design is pretty nice, although a little too wide in my hand. I really did like the slim profile of the phone, but I was afraid to keep it in my pocket for fear of damaging the screen. However, when you strap on the case for this phone, which is virtually required due to the delicacy of such phones, the phone loses this razer thin width. While the phone felt relatively well put together, one scrape, drop, or depressing of the screen will have you filing for insurance (and you must buy insurance).While the Q can surf the internet, schedule a meeting, keep track of your contacts, and many more things, it does not do any one of the functions especially well. The contact list was sluggish and entering a phone number was considerably harder than it should be. Additionally, the Q is a Smartphone and not a PDA. It comes with no copy/paste functionality, no touch screen, and mediocre scheduling features. For a phone that has a QWERTY keyboard, the lack of copying and pasting is fairly ridiculous.Overall, it is an alright phone, a mediocre planner, and an average internet browser. I have since gotten the Palm 700p and am loving every minute with it.Pros:Slim profile, nice keypad, pretty sharp cameraCons:Low battery life, annoying sluggish operating system, extremely delicate.
For the price, the Q gives you a load of features in a small package.  The keyboard is great for entering info for contacts, notes, email, and txt messages.  Not having to worry about a stylus all the time is nice too.  You are limited by the Smartphone version of Window Mobile 5.0, but for my use it is perfect.It will sync with multiple PCs without all the hubbub you get from a Pocket PC.  This helps to get your contacts list all together instead of one set on your laptop and one set on your PC.My favorite Windows Mobile application, Avantgo, works great.  All the function it gave me before.  This is a must if you travel.  You are able to have the news, sports, and other sources of information brought to you.I have been able to convert my videos and DVDs to run on the Q. This works great on trips so I don't need to lug out my laptop or a portable DVD player.  I can have 2-3 movies and some music on a 1GB miniSD card.I have been searching for new applications that have been designed for he Q and have been pleasantly surprised at the number that keeps growing.  I found a program that let me keep my account register on here instead of keeping a checkbook (I don't write checks, just keep it for the register) with me.  I have also found language programs that give you translations for common phrases.  If you are a XM or Sirius subscriber, you can install a third-party application to stream from the internet.  This is great, but will keep you charging it up.I use the extended battery and have the standard as a backup.  This is the only problem.  If you use the data package for push email, talk on the phone for a while and use the unit for scheduling, you will need the extended battery to keep from having to charge it every day.My last note here is that a few people have complained about the limited features compared to a full blown Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 5.0.  You have to understand going into this that Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone Edition is a less functional version. This is so that you can have it on a phone and still have the great core functionality, which the Q has.  If you think there is too much on a Pocket PC phone, this will be the one for you.
I have had the Q for about 3 weeks now and have played with it, installed apps on it, modified the home screen, read tons of reviews and forums on it and bought a screen protector for it.All in all, its a great smart phone with a few improvements to be made on it.- the media player is choppy at times and I will have to assume that this is a bug.- the system itself is a little slower than I would like but bearable.- the plastic casing just plain SUCKS. I will assume that plastic was chosen to ensure the light weight, however, I think aluminum is the way to go and is much more sturdy.  For example the RAZR.- battery life is something of a challenge.  even the extended battery will only give you about 12-14 hours with moderate use.Other than what I listed above, the phone is great and I am still fairly happy with the phone.TIP - Try to find any defects with your phone within the first 15 days.  After that, VZW will give you a refurbished phone if you bring it in after 15 days.
I guess I like it because it does what I most wanted. I can listen to music and recorded talk shows via the mono bluetooth ear piece. I had the Chocholate for awhile, and it required a stereo blue tooth for the same thing, but I just need one small earpiece to listen to recorded radio shows.I like how easy it is to synch with my pc, and I like the ability to carry various media files on the minisd. It is an easy thing to move files from the PC to the Q. I will look for third party software to make it easier to switch between programs instead of having to wade through the various paths. I wish there was some good software (like SPB for the pocket PC) that would make the home page more customizable. I have only tried two third party programs and neither one of them really impressed me by adding a lot of functionality. THere was one that was supposed to monitor my data usage, but that has not worked at all, since it still says zero bytes used. For the time that I actually spend using them, this has the potential to replace my ipod and my Zen VW......if it only had a radio!I like the feel of this phone and the buttons are not too small for me.I have not learned any shortcuts to access various programs, but the unit really needs some. I like that it is small enough to fit into my pants pocket. I wish I could control more features via the bluetooth ear piece, at least more than on/off/volume.My only COMPLAINT is the price for a data plan from Verizon....which is outrageous. Other than that, I really wish it had an FM radio, then I would not care so much about the data costs.
I purchased this for one day and returned it the next. I wanted to replace my Treo 700P with Sprint because I was frequently getting dropped calls where I recently moved to. The Moto Q attracted me because I saw it in a store and loved the screen and thin design. Too bad that's all it has going for it. The EVDO was nowhere near the speed that Sprint offered. In fact, Verizon was even slower than the non EVDO Treo 650 that I previously owned. The worst thing was that when I dialed my home number to check my answering machine it would not recognize my code. If you call any number that prompts you to press a number for anything, the phone is designed is such a way that you cannot input numbers after you make a call. Verizon tech support did not know how to fix this. I had to call Motorola tech support and they told me to switch a TTY setting. Well I did and it didn't work. Then they told me that it was the area that I was in. I am in Los Angeles. How could this be happening in such a large city? Another bad feature was there is no manual control to shut off the display. You have to set the display to turn off after a certain length of time and when you want it back on again you have to keep hitting the center button. If you set the phone to go off after 1 minute and you want to check the time, it stays on for a minute. Nuisance and bad feature. So I'm back to my Treo 700P and just dealing with the occasional dropped calls until I move again at the end of the year. I will say this about Verizon, with the few calls I made with the phone I never had one dropped call and it worked well in my apartment where my Treo did not. One last thing, Verizon is outrageously expensive. Over twice what I was paying with Sprint. 450 minutes with Verizon was $40. I am paying $35/mo for 500 minutes with Sprint. My daytime minutes with Sprint is 7A to 7P. With Verizon it's 6A to 9P. What a ripoff! EVDO with Sprint was $15/mo. Verizon charges $40/mo and that was their special at the time. It's normally $60/mo. As bulky as the Treo is, it is still the best phone out there. I have the Palm OS version. I didn't like Windows at all on the Moto Q. Took forever to boot up...typical Windows.
I started out with the Treo 300 and have tried each model since, and 3 diff pocket PPC models, all w Sprint.This device is the best device from a form factor and interface perspective, but I fear it's not ready for prime time.Mine has started to freeze 5 to 10 times a day.  I can not afford that kinda of spotty performance since I depend on it for my business.  It was fine for the first 3-4 weeks then it started to crap out with greater and greater frequency.To be fair I have the Goodlink software installed, and that might be an impacting factor.This phone is new.  I have always known that one of the problems with being a pioneer, is that you end up with a lot of arrows in your back.  I don't mind a certain amount of early adopter pain, but I have to draw the line when a device starts to adversely impact my professional propductivity.I do have a great deal of confidence in Motorola based on past experience.  FYI: they have set up a toll free line for Q users:877 331 6456, x2216Good luck fellow pioneers!
I have been holding out on replacing my simple LG phone with a Smartphone. The reason has been I just didn't think the technology was there or the price was low enough. Finally I think Verizon has stepped up to the plate with the Q. The phone was $199 with the unlimited plan (which you will need and can vary from $50-70 a month).Since the phone has only been on the market for a few days they are still working out issues, but once you get this thing connected Wow! It's great! Also if you need help call Verizon's Tech support they were great everytime I called.First off there are 2 types of Email technology integrated in the device and you should choose how you want to use them. For instance I'm using the WirelessSync software (a push technology) to connect to my Corporate Lotus Notes email. The software is running on my laptop and if I get an email at my corporate email account it will push it to my Q no matter where I'm at in the world (of course I have to have a cell phone signal). The negative to this is my laptop has to be up and running with this software. It's nice if I need to run out during the day and I want to make sure I don't miss that important email. WirelessSync can be executed by schedule or you can do it from the home screen on the phone. Email that comes in this way goes to the Outlook E-mail Folder.The other option is to set up POP3 accounts within the Q. This is a pull technology. I set up my gmail account this way and the Q check every 30 minutes to see if I have any new emails in my gmail account. You can set it to check more or less. But keep in mind if you check more you can not receive phone calls while it is check (at least that is what the tech guy told me on the phone when I called). Another tip for you Gmail users, the incoming server of pop.gmail.com is fine, but on the outgoing server for some reason you have to state the port: smtp.gmail.com:465I spent about 4 hours on that :)So keep in mind if you decide to do both of these do not set up a pop3 in your wireless sync. I did that initially but then on my first sync I found out I had duplicates. I keep only my work email in my wireless sync and my internet email in my pop3. There are lots of options with the software it's just a matter of working through the ports on the device.One other tip I have is make sure that the email account you are trying to add is currently working. We were trying to add a yahoo account and found it wasn't the Q that was having the problem it was yahoo's server that was down for maintance.Oh and of course since you have access to the internet you can just go straight to a website...like gmail and just log into your account if you really want to get started fast.Some of the other features that I love...the 1.3 megapixel camera! I wasn't expected that at all and they take great pictures (as long as your subject isn't moving all over the place)! It has an IR beam that I can send it to anything that has an IR beam as well. It even has a flash! Granted you have to turn it on before you take the picture, but still extremely cool.There is also a software package call ActiveSync and this is how you get new software and music to your Q. It's best just to use the cable with this. I tried using the IR but it didn't really work that well. One thing I will say the third party software out there is OUT-OF-DATE! I have found nothing so far that I can put on this. My recommendation is to get the trial and it will tell you right away if it is an older version. I've tried 2 games off the sight they recommend Handango and both were 2 old and they locked up when I tried to play them. To get out of them I just hit my house button and then uninstalled them with my ActiveSync software. No harm.In addition I purchased a 1GB miniSD card and ripped a few of my cd's using windows media player. I used 96kbps and transferred them to the Q using ActiveSync in the MyMusic Folder. I then went into my Q pulled up Window Media Player scaned for the music and WOW it sounds GREAT! It plays through speakers (there is a volume control on the right or you could connect your ear buds on top).We also bought our phones from the Verizon store and with that we got a 15 day trial on the phones. If we came back within 15 days we got the extended batteries for the phones at 60% off! We did that since the batteries are normally $50. Not sure if all Verizon stores do that but it wouldn't hurt to ask if your in the market. I would recommend getting the extended life battery.By far I have not even come close to listing all of the features, just the ones I'm excited about. So again just to summarize...this is an AMAZING phone (and to be fair computer). If you are looking for all the bells and whistles this is for you. It really is like a mini laptop that you can talk on. This really is a great phone, but I don't think it will be for everyone.
Just got the Motorola Q for Christmas.  So far, at first glance, I am very satisfied with it.  This is my first PDA/Smartphone, so I can't compare this to other ones currently out on the market, but on its own, it is perfect for what I need in smartphone.Quick view benefits1.  Keyboard2.  LCD Screen is large3.  Look and feel is very good.  Thin and light4.  Funcionality seems excellent5.  Seems simple, but the speakerphone has worked very well so far.  Sounds great.6.  Hooked up a nice Motorola BlueTooth wireless earbud which works very well.Negatives1.  Battery life2.  email accessability.  I am having problems getting my gmail account synced to it.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I know it is compatible with gmail, but my efforts are failing so far and Verizon Help 1800 number had no answers.  Not sure if this is the phone, my mistakes, or gmail.  I can send email from the phone, but cannot receive it.outside of the email problem which I hope can be resolved, the phone is fantastic.
3.5 stars.  I was very excited about the launch of the Motorola Q, since I was completely over my clunky, boring Blackberry for some time.  I thought that the Q would solve my "Blackberry problem" of being able to read attachments (in plain text format), but not being able to edit attached documents or compose and email documents from scratch.  How wrong I was!  Don't get me wrong - the Q does have a lot going for it: (1) a more attractive form factor than ANY Blackberry or PDA-phone I've ever seen, it's slim, light, and looks as much like a phone as a smartphone can; (2) it runs Windows Mobile, which is infinitely more attractive and familiar to me than the Palm OS or Blackberry platform.  It's also pretty strong on the "fun" factors, since it has a cool internet browser, Windows Media player for your music files, and a built-in digital camera.However, the Q's main shortfall--the inability to compose/edit documents--was a deal-breaker for me.  If, like me, you plan on using your smartphone as part of a mini-mobile-office, and your job involves heavy review and editing of documents received via email, then you might want to look for alternatives to the Q.  If you're a Windows-over-Palm person, the Palm Treo 700w may be a good alternative that has document composing and editing capabilities.  (I'm opting to get a laptop instead of a Palm 700w, given its memory limitations).  Or, if you are wedded to the Palm OS, there's always the Palm 700p.  That said, if editing documents is not as important to you as simple emailing and messaging, then the Motorola Q may fit the bill.
This phone looks good on paper, in person, and in my pocket, but it was a huge hassle to use compared to a Treo. First, everything runs sluggishly and it takes a long time to do anything. The Treo has less memory but runs much faster because it is better optimized, and more importantly, has a touch screen. With the touch screen, I can click on links, buttons, etc., even with my finger, which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible. I thought I received a defective unit so I had it exchanged...the second unit was just as awful. Finally, the Q's keyboard looks better and is bigger, but is harder to use -- the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow, sometimes keypresses don't register (while Windows Mobile is trying to catch up or something). I wanted to like the Q but came away utterly disappointed.
as a former treo user an now a q owner i have to say this is the best pda/phone out there.  As a verizon employee i can say that this is the most stable pda we have.  Of course there's always a few phones that are defective but overall this phone has had the fewest warranty issues out of any pda. For every Q that happened to be defective I can show u six treo's with much worse problems.  It might not be as customizable but its easy to use, straight forward and works.  As far as BT...so much better than any treo, motorola voice dialing is far superior.  Phone has not frozen unlike the treo's which would freeze with a text message.  As more software becomes available allowing more customization i think that this phone will be perfect.  I also use a blackberry as my work line so i know my PDA's.  Being able to view attachments and the camera puts it above the blackberry.  If you want a good pda go with either the Q or the Blackberry.  The Q still has a better phone thoughi have read the other issues and have seen them...for the XP not recongizing the Q that is an active sync issue that happens randomly even with the treo's or 6700.  Microsoft does have a new version that fixes that free download, do need to uninstall an reboot before re installing.  Alerts can be silence you have to be patient, the menus are hidden, i've had it for a month and still finding new options.  Battery is still better, but the extended is needed.  Just like any device EVDO and email drain battery fast.  Email service with POP3 accounts can be less than perfect...but then again its a free online account.  just like home computers sometimes a simply re-install fixes things, or a soft reset.  The "profiles" are for sound quality and volume not for ringer control.  Most q's have answers that are easy enough.
I have had my Q for about 2 weeks now.  I love it!  I use it for receiving my e-mails (which was as easy to setup, as any other e-mail in outlook.)  I used it as a modem, simple!  The phone is fun.  I use the Internet too.  The voice recognition is also neat---I can say numbers and it translates pretty good.  With my old phone, I had to record the name and it would search for that name when using voice recognition.  The Q actually translates to the number or searches the contact list without having to record anything.  The only thing that is not that great is that it deletes the e-mails after a week or so.  I would like a touch screen, but I don't miss it.  The heard the treo 700w touch screen isn't that great anyhow.  That was the other phone I considered.  I love it!
Thin, light and packed with useful features...and the voice quality of the calls is amazing. The keyboard is probably the easiest to use that I've tried. The keys are space a little farther apart than Blackberrys and easy to hit. Response is quick on the internet side and the camera works beatifully. I wish the battery had a longer life to it, but I've been using this phone so much since I got it I may be overdoing it. I think I'll check out the extended life battery, though. I even saw envy in the eyes of the IT guy at work when he saw my new phone. No problems so far, and I'm happy with my choice of the Q.
First off, this is a great phone for many reasons. Read the five-star reviews if you want a glowing perspective. I agree with aspects of all of them.If you are coming from the Treo 600/650 series, however, which allows you pretty much complete control over the phone's behavior, has fairly strong vibration, AND is a decent PDA, this phone will frustrate you to no end.Example: Let's say the only time you want this phone to make a (speaker-based) noise is when a call is coming in. Sorry - not possible.If you have your phone set to make an audible ring, and you DON'T want it to give you an error beep (which is incredibly loud) when you make a trivial "mistake" in the complex user interface, you are out of luck. I tried turning EVERYTHING off but the ring in the "Normal" profile, and I still get the error beep. It's louder than the ring, by the way - and does not seem affected by any volume control.The frustrating thing is that there are actually phone settings for turning off various alerts. E.g., "Warnings," "Questions," "Exclamations." All of these are set to off (you'd think an "error" would fall into one of those categories), and still I get thunderous error beeps. Note there is a vibrate-only mode (called Meeting) that doesn't beep for errors, but then you're stuck with its wimpy vibration. I can't feel the Q vibrate in any pocket. Maybe if I carry it between my teeth I'll be okay.Note that you don't actually have to make an error to get an error beep. Example: Enter an address in the browser, and press the RETURN key instead of the "Go" soft key. Both navigate you appropriately, but hitting RETURN gives you an error beep. It's like your phone is saying to you, "You hit the wrong (yet completely intuitive and fully operational) key! BEEEEEP!!!"Also, when you insert or remove the power cord: "BEEEEP!!!" Plus, in typical Microsoft style, you actually get a full-screen dialog when you pull out the cord. "Charging is complete!" it tells you, with a button to dismiss the message. "Um, yes - I KNOW it's complete. I just freaking got out of bed and unplugged it. But thanks for scaring the life out of me."If a calendar is important to you (as it is for most PDA users - probably the sole reason to cary one), I'd steer way clear of this phone. The interface for accessing, viewing, and creating appointments is cumbersome at best. Also, it's missing key functionality: E.g: I get my hair cut every other week; my cleaning service comes every other week; There is no way to set a recurring appointment for every other week!If you want a phone that's a real PDA, get the treo 650 or 700, even though it's heavier and fatter. I can only speak for the Palm OS version, which is excellent, usability-wise. After using this phone, I'm now nervous about the 700w - considering that phone and the Q both run on the same company's software.Needless to say, I'm returning mine.
I bought the Q in mid-july. By September 20th, I am working on my third phone. It had worked fined for about the first two months, then one day, it was powering itself off at random times. I sent it back and got a new phone, that within two days would freeze, not allow me to access email, and eat the battery in about half of the time as my first phone. I am on lucky number three now, that seems to work so far. Microsoft's active sync, does not sync contacts, photos, or calendar...three of which i use daily, which made transfer of information a not so fun task. Like the title says though, when it works, it's a great phone.
I have had this phone for over a month now.  I have repeatedly done Master Resets with no luck.  Here are the problems with the phone:1) Signal Strength.  You can be holding it in the same spot for 5 minutes and go from no service to 3 bars.  I live in NYC and with all of my prior VZ phones I never had a signal issue.  This results in 10% of my calls being dropped.2) Battery Life.  Every post here is dead on.  I bought the extended battery and I maybe get 1 full day of life out of the phone.  I use the Outlook client and it works ok.3) Freezing.  The phone freezes and just shuts itself off.  This happens once a day without fail.  It is not just me, 3 people in my office have this phone, all 3 freeze.  You have to pop the battery out to reset.  This is intolerable.This phone has a great screen and form factor, but it feels like someone forgot that it should work first and look nice second.Do not buy this phone.  I missed my return window by 2 days b/c I was out of the country.  Do not make the same mistake as me.
Before this phone, I had only LG, the latest being the vx6000. To put simply, I was blown away by the capabilities included with the phone and the opportunity to do much more. Data plan is kind of needed to take full advantage of EV-DO network and push e-mail, but Verizon's got to take the price down so most people can afford. Also, the larger battery is a must for serious users, especially if your using the data network. And anyone creating lots of movies and pictures or downloading content into the phone should consider a MiniSD card. I'm on my second one (1st had an irreparable software glitch) and very pleased, despite the lack of Wi-Fi (but imagine the battery life then.)
Well i bought this thing for my wife even though my gut and the review i read said don't.I should of listened one or the other.Don't get me wrong it looks the part and when it was'nt misbehaving it got great reception and so far as i know it never dropped a call.That has everything to do with Verizon and nothing to do with Motorola and if it comes to that it's not as if Verizon is exactly bargain basement prices either.  I would'nt want to give the impression that the Q was broken all the time because it was'nt.It is just buggy ,it sticks, freezes, and generally misbehaves;leastways the one i got my wife does. Which equates to me getting it plopped in my lap every time it does which is more than slighly annoying after the second or third time within the first two weeks.The bottom line is fix the glitches,windows is well windows and fix the stupid battery.  OH ,just as a footnote,as i understand it,when you call tech support or customer service they are supposed to know more than you do so beware of bum advice if you do have to call.
I just got mine today, but so far so good!  I used to use a T618, so this obviously has a lot more functionality that I'm used to, but I'm already loving it.  Screen is beautiful, UI is pretty intuitive, so far nothing wrong at all.  Speakerphone sounds great, people say they can hear me really well.  I beamed all of my contacts via IR from my T618 into it, and that went fine too.Also, for a guy who has sworn to never wear a phone on a belt-clip, I was happy to discover that it easily fit into my jeans front pocket.  It's a lot smaller than I thought it'd be, actually.Overall, it's great so far.  Verizon also had a deal where I could try it out for 15 days and return it for a full refund, which would have been nice if the reception in my apt. was bad.  Luckily the reception is terrific, though!
I loved the idea of this phone.  I ended up returning it due to terrible battery life. Also, there are many bugs in IE and the Email client.In addition, Verizon's EvDO network seems slow on this device.
I have been using Q for two weeks. Q is best style and convenient multimedia phone for me. Whenever my daughter (11 months) is fussy while eating. I just play the Madagascar or Baby Einstein for her by Q (in flight mode). She will immediately calm down. She really likes it, and Q is so light and thin, so she can easily handle it. Now she can view the pictures on it by herself.In addition, it is most stable smartphone so far for me. I tried Treo 700w before and it has to be reset 2-3 times everyday. That's the reason 700w has a reset button on it. For Q, it only happens once when I was using Explorer.From features and price points of view, I didn't find a phone that can beat Q now.
When the phone is working its great..but you can charge it all night and it will die the next day just sitting a few hours...I do not recommend this phone....I think there is a big coverup going on..this phone is flawed.  And of course the goofy microsoft OS.  Unbelievable. I wanted a "phone first" and email/web device 2nd..when the phone is on its GREAt..but to pick up your phone and find it dead(car charger will not bring back to life)...i am sorry but that is a major problemo.6/25/06 UpdatePhone Died again today..USB will not charge it.  Luckily I had miscalculated and was on my 15th day of activation.  I waited a half hour in a Verizon return line...I order to keep my same number I needed another phone to activate on the spot.  I bought the Treo 700p(not the W!)...within an hour i was walking around the mall amazed by the intuitive smart interface..and the speed...really..it costs more but is well worth it..I sure don't miss that Q.But now that I am not a Q owner..I wonder if I will still get my share of the Class Action suit when it is discovered that Motorola sold a lemon to millions of people.
I have been using the Q for about three months, and have been very disappointed with its ability to function as a PDA-replacement.  It's not a good product, and Motorola took a lot of shortcuts with the interface.Things that annoy me about the Q:- Number lock.  It doesn't automatically turn on the number lock when in a field that would typically have numbers (i.e., fields for telephone numbers, dates, and times).  You have to manually switch from letters to numbers on the keyboard.- New numbers.  If you want to add a phone number to an existing contact from your call log, you must manually scroll through the list of names, rather than typing in the same (and having the device search your contacts).- Lack of Notes.  It doesn't have the Notes program that is standard in MS Outlook and other Windows CE-enabled devices.  I use Notes for tracking lists of restaurants, books, and wines so that I have them when I need them.  Not so with the Q.- Navigational functions.  It's hard to get to the desired program quickly.  For example, if you want to get to your e-mail, you have to go through a menu that lists all messaging functions (i.e., text messaging, multiple mailboxes).- And, just to reiterate, the battery and keyboards also have problems.  Enough people have covered those issues already, so I won't expound on them.Some might think I'm being nit-picky, but I think these omissions in programming are unforgivable.  Given the level of sophistication in PDAs/smartphones these days, you shouldn't have to work this hard to perform basic functions.
I have had my Motorola Q for a week now and it has been my favorite phone i have ever had. I have had an Nextel i60, i95, i730, i860, and the i870. The i860 and i870 were great phones, but service made them act as if they were bad. So i got rid of Nextel and went to verizon with the q. The Verizon service is great, i get service EVERYWHERE! Texting is quick and easy. The Q is the coolest handheld device i have had. Windows Media Player is great for your playlists of videos and music. Internet Explorer can sometimes be faster than my computer! You can download media files from the web just by clickin the link. Installing and removing apps are easy. The phone is overall very easy to use. It is just like a computer. Now here are the goods and bads.good- service- web- media manger/player- camera qualitybad- e-mail- scrathes pretty easily- batteryThe only interal problem i have is the e-mail. I spent 2 days trying to set my aol e-mail up and when i finally did it successfully, i could only recieve mail and not send. also i suggest getting a leather case or rubber skin glove because the clip tends to scratch it easily. if your gonna use this phone every minute of the day, i suggest geting an extended battery because i am one of those people and the battery will only last 15 hours if lucky. If you leave the phone idle most of the time and just recieve and send phone calls it can last for 2-3 days.this phone is awesome i give it 5 stars and i wouldnt mind having a 2 year contract with it!
My manager bought one of these so I've been working for 3 days now on trying to get it to sync with his outlook email.  First I got it to active sync...except it refused to see or sync his contacts at all.  Nothing I did would fix that.  Then I tried to setup his wireless sync instead and that was even worse.  I got some errors on setting up the software that appear to be software corruption or security-related.  Verizon 1st level support couldn't help except to tell me that I couldn't use the wireless sync software with Office XP sp3 so I installed Office 2003 but that made no difference.  Now I am waiting with a manager who is very unhappy for an engineer to call back in 24 to 48 hours.  Personally as a computer support person I would never buy the Motorola Q but of course I'm stuck supporting it.  Verizon... you really like to make life miserable for us networking guys, don't you?!***Update***2008:  I eventually solved the syncing problems after escalated finally to the hardware manufacters engineers.  A security change to the network was the work-around.  However over the next year or so of supporting this Q and several other ones bought, ran into multiple software, sync, updating, and physical problems with these phones.  Often had to send a phone back to the vendor for exchange multiple times to get a working phone.  The features of this phone might be nice but it really took many hours out of my work week to support them and keep them working - really a drain on time away from actual Network & PC support.  I could imagine that an owner who doesn't have a computer support person to turn to for help would quickly become frustrated and upset with the Q.
I'm on my 3rd Verizon Q phone in just 2 months. The operating system appears to be unstable as well as the phone. Both the software and hardware appear to be untested. The other Q phones I've had both got to a point where they were unable to boot.The times when it is functioning it's ok. It checks your email for you and you can browse the web. The camera is decent.Now I will spend another 30 hours configuring my latest Q replacement. I'm crossing my fingers. If it dies again I will be looking at a Blackberry.
Hi,  I got the Q a week ago, reset it a few times had various other issues.. But fairly happy with the phone..  But... I left the house this morning with a full charge (9 AM), went to lunch at 12:40 and the phone was working fine (full battery charge) - showed it to a friend at lunch, and was trying to bring up Internet Explorer...  It couldn't connect to any sites (2 bars) - I said OK, fine and left it alone..  By 2:30 the phone was DEAD, no signs of life, removing the battery, nothing...  Attempting to charge it on USB - NO LUCK - (it appears to respect the USB protocol of not drawing any real power until the device tells the host it needs power - something that should be done in hardware/firmware..)  I was able to get it to come up with a car adaptor.. Got enough charge on it, and I was able to transfer it to the USB.  (First attempt failed, went back and charged it until it stopped beeping)  Now, it is sitting there "charging" - but burrning power to keep the display on, backlight on, and the CPU running to display an image of a stupid battery 'filling' - which is totally useless (if you are going to show me something, tell me how full my battery CURRENTLY IS), but worse, is likly burning 20-50% of the power it is getting from the USB!  I don't think a super large replacement battery would have done ANYTHING for me - except extend the time till it died, maybe as much as 4 hours.  My guess is that it locked up while transmitting at full power or something...  They say standby of 238 hours or something, but I say better charge it daily, and don't count on it after lunch..Other than a few really dense things like this, the phone seems pretty good and I like it.  I like the idea of a phone and Pda together.  -Chert
First smartphone ... I'm addicted.  Had it a few weeks now and it has never crashed or even had a hiccup.  There are a few very minor things I don't like, but those are problems with the Microsoft OS, not Motorola.  My understanding is that there is a software update coming to solve most of my gripes.  But like another reviewer said, I use it all the time.  It looks fantastic and the screen is amazing.
Pros:Slim form factor and weightCons:Lack of outside LED's, Screen visability in sunlight, ergonomicsAs for my opinion on the newly released Moto Q phone (from Verizon Wireless), my action speak louder than words.  I have just sent the Motorola Q phone back to Verizon for a credit.  While the form factor is great, the ergonomics of the phone and software present many critical shortcomings for me or any real PDA Power user to adopt.A few of my observations are:-Absence of ANY LED's on the outside of the phone require you to check the phone too often as opposed to glancing at it to know if new emails, calls or text have come in (as is the case with Blackberry and Treo).-Screen visibility in bright sunlight is poor-Battery life is terrible, half day best case with limited voice use.  There is a higher capacity battery available, but not interested in investing more in a problematic phone.-Software Bundled with Q is simplistic and lacks any level of elegance, especially true in email and photo management.  Number of key strokes to do anything seems high.  Third party software should address some what in 60-120 days.- Absence of any 'hard keys' makes certain regular functions cumbersome.-Too early for reasonably simple Apple Mac Integration (Missing Link and PocketMac are working on software), will need to be revisited in 60-120 days.  Users of PC's not an issue.-Plastic construction of phone leads me to believe that the phone will not endure day to day use very effectively.  After a few short days in my pocket (no keys or change of course), paint finish showing signs of wear.-And last but not least, a few other annoyances: NO LEFT HAND SHIFT KEY, seemingly poor memory management, unstable mail client.......Hard to believe that Moto is positioning this phone to attract current Treo and Blackberry users, based on price and function seems like a great PDA for someone who has not owned one based on size and weight.  I feel that the next rev of the phone will be worth reconsidering, but unlike the first TREO, this phone will be more of a headache for an early adopter, especially a Mac User than it's worth.
I started out loving this phone, and the form factor & screen are definitely great.  However, after using it for 2-3 months, I now *hate* several things about it:1) The keyboard.  This is the second Q I've owned, and on both I've had keyboard problems (sticky keys that won't type, phantom keypresses when pressing the 4-way pad).  Also, on the personal gripe side, I found the rounded keys less easy to type on than the flat Blackberry keys, but others may disagree on this2) Software.  Sometimes the software crashes, like when I'm answering a call.  Sometimes the buttons take me to the wrong app (again, this may be keyboard-related).  In general apps can be slow to load.3) Battery.  When in low-signal areas, the phone tends to run-down really quickly.4) Keyboard.  Did I mention the keyboard is really baaaad??
I can't be happier with the phone and my feelings seem to be summed up in other reviews, but they all seem to not know one important piece of information. I worked on one stage of the product's development which I will not disclose, but I had to understand the guts of the phone's software and I shall say this.In Windows Smartphone, the memory allocation is such that after a certain amount of time the applications release their memory for other applications to use. This is sped up if you open more programs and demand more resources. The purpose is that it effectively eliminates the need to close any applications, and in fact you will get the best performance if you do not use the task manager to close programs unless they are causing faults. So basically, don't worry about it and just have fun, the OS takes care of most of the details and it's not your standard "PC" type OS.Personally, I can't believe I ever lived without this phone, and I can't get enough of the "Audio Enhancement" accessory that is shipped with the phone.
Phone quality is tinny- by that I mean choppy- weak. With the reccomended bluetooth it is even worse. Speakerphone is not as clear as I expected it to be. MP3 and streaming quality- not at all as good as the tmobile SDA (which is overall worse than the Q). The batter life is not great. Every time you shut a program you have to go to task manager and stop the application from taking up ram- weird.
I bought the Q to go with our iMuffs Wireless Headphones and I was surprised how well they work! The sound is great, the controls work from the headphones so I can pause and skip tracks without touching the phone, and pairing and configuration was actually easy! Just select Bluetooth, then Stereo Headphones. It even detects that the iMuffs can be used as a normal phone headset and asks if you want to pair it for that as well. There were no drop-outs and the range was pretty good. I've tried other phones that are supposed to support Bluetooth Stereo or A2DP (I work for Wi-Gear, the makers of the iMuffs), but this is the first good experience I've had right out of the box. I even like how the media player works since you can have it running in the background and still go about and use other applications. Since there are controls on the iMuffs themselves, you can even start playing right from there without even switching to the music player first. Now that's easy!After using the phone for a while, I have found a few things that annoy me (such as the keyguard) and I have had to reboot it a few times already. But I'm just psyched to finally have my music wirelessly from my phone. With a 2GB mini SD card in there, it's great.
this is THE phone.  its like the razor and the blackberry had a baby.  it is what blackberry and the rim people should have been doing instead of arguging over money and rights. now microsoft listened to the needs of the average blackberry user and put all the bells and whistles in a .45 thin smartphone.the screen is dazzling, and what this baby does blows your mind.you can send and take photos, watch videos,and listen to mp3s.it has 128/64mb of memory.  most smartphones have 16 to 64mb.  and its exspandable. imagine if you put a 1G in there...blow your ear off!!!  just kidding.it has bluetooth, push to talk, and the much talked about EVDO.  that means it can work over wireless networks. you don't have to have be near a wifi hot spot to get broadband speed.  you have your own.when i got this bad boy in my hand, it was like christmas morning.  the only place to get it is at verizon.com or your nearest verizon store.the major drawback:  the calling and data plan, very pricey.  but if you want a phone that acts like a laptop, this is the phone to get.  if you can.
I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q. This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is "spoofing" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to "white list" (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct "From" and "Reply-to" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both "From" and "Reply-to" fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this.
I have used Blackberrys and Treos and I figured I would try the latest and greatest...the Motorola Q. Boy was I wrong. Sure it is slim and has good audio quality. But the battery is absolutely horrible. Maybe a day of standby. And now three weeks in, the device simply crashed. Now the hassle of getting it replaced......don't do it.......
The phone is beautiful and slick.  The display is gorgeous, keyboard easy to use, and call quality is superb.  Unfortunately, Windows Mobile is a most retarded piece of software.  Things that should take one key press take 3-4 and the menus and commands are completely counterintuitive.  Motorola should write their own software or have a serious talk with Palm!
I've spent a week now trying to get this to synch with my office computer. Our network support staff couldn't get it to synch. Motorola tech support blew me off when I called. The CD's included were supposed to help me learn the software, but even that software failed. It was supposed to take me to a web page, I believe, but it kept saying it couldn't access it. The documentation is written generically, like they couldn't be bothered to write documentation specific to this device, so it's hard to figure out how to do what you want.I've had a Palm Pilot and an IPAQ. Software on the Palm Pilot was the easiest to use. IPAQ was pretty good, but the battery couldn't last through a whole meeting. But even that software was easy to use. The contact list on this one is bewildering. I entered my husbands work and cell phone numbers. But only one number showed on the display, and when you click, that's what dials. So I had to go down to one phone number for every entry. And then there are entries in the contact list for administrative things like minutes used. Makes no sense. So even if I could get it to synch, I don't like the software.Bottom line. I HATE HATE HATE this phone, and am exchanging it this week. Now to figure out what to try next.UPDATE: I turned it in and got the TREO 700P, which I love. The software on the Treo is so much easier to use and understand, and it has a lot more functionality. I did have to call Verizon to get help setting it up, but it went quickly. (I did ask if they were getting a lot of calls on the new TREO, and he said no, but they were getting a lot of calls on the Q).
The Motorola Q is a pretty amazing device.  The Treo 700w I use for work is a brick by comparison.  But, as with any initial release, its going to have its share of problems.  So far, the only two I've encountered are poor battery life and the fact that it runs Windows Mobile.  Frankly, why anybody would CHOOSE to run any version of Windows is beyond me.I've just purchased the extended battery from Verizon, and while it somewhat alters the slim, clean look of the Q, I'm  hoping it solves the battery life problem.UPDATE:  The extended battery is AWESOME.  Now, I can honestly say that this device smokes the competition!
The moto q looks beautiful and is, overall, a great concept.  I am a heavy phone and light PDA user.  I do actually use the pics and videos as well as texting, email and scheduling features a lot.  While all of these things are good in general, in classic Microsoft fashion, the software has issues, glitches, crashes and instability.  My phone is a bit too slow and easily confused when moving from one screen to the next.  The internet surfing is amusing at best, completely useless at worst.  Have you tried customizing the ringtones yet? Why does it just "beep" or "vibrate" about every 30-45 minutes?  Why can't I make it stop?  If you don't mind HUGE lies about battery life and slight underperformance as a pseudo-PDA, then it's a good phone with a few additional capabilities.  I do like it and knew what I was getting into when buying any kind of 1st generation gadget.  Here's a tip:  TO ALL ENGINEERS WHO DESIGN A DEVICE - GIVE IT TO REAL PEOPLE TO USE IN THE REAL WORLD AND LISTEN TO WHAT REALLY WORKS.  Just ask the makers of the Palm or LG...
I may not be a good person to review, cuz Im pretty technical, and really deteremined. So everything I've wanted to do with this phone, I've been able to do. Combined with the light weight and sleek look, I'm satisfied. But I could see how the average user would have problems taking full advantage of it.
My wife had this phone for a few days, then all of a sudden, we couldn't get past the 'Verizon screen'!  The system completely 'froze up' to where nothing could get it to operate and perform calls or other functions for which it was made.  We took the phone back dissapointed.  Apparently, judging from other negative reviews online, Verizon is having some issues with some of these phones!  How they can release a product to market without extensive and relevant 'real world' testing is beyond me.  This reminds me of so many 'buggy' and problematic versions of Microsoft 'Windows' being released over the years that made one's computer crash, freeze, etc.!  Anyway, if Motorola perfects the 'MotoQ' in the future, we may look at it again.
as a former treo user an now a q owner i have to say this is the best pda/phone out there.  As a verizon employee i can say that this is the most stable pda we have.  Of course there's always a few phones that are defective but overall this phone has had the fewest warranty issues out of any pda. For every Q that happened to be defective I can show u six treo's with much worse problems.  It might not be as customizable but its easy to use, straight forward and works.  As far as BT...so much better than any treo, motorola voice dialing is far superior.  Phone has not frozen unlike the treo's which would freeze with a text message.  As more software becomes available allowing more customization i think that this phone will be perfect.  I also use a blackberry as my work line so i know my PDA's.  Being able to view attachments and the camera puts it above the blackberry.  If you want a good pda go with either the Q or the Blackberry.  The Q still has a better phone though
I guess technically, this phone is pretty good (slim, large screen, shiny, bad keyboard - hey, three out of four isn't bad!). What impedes it is MS Pocket Windows, or however it's called: menus are illogical, things that were so easy to set up on my previous Verizon phone (LG) are either difficult or impossible. Most importantly, e-mail is not "pushed" to the phone - instead, you have to log on every time (sometimes you have to type the password, often the login fails for some reason, from time to time the service is not available etc.). Even when you manage to 'log on', you don't get complete messages, but just the snippets - if you want the whole message, you have to request the rest of it, with the same procedure as for getting the message list.The phone charges increadibly slowly if it's on while plugged into the outlet - I event thought it cannot recharge like that at all (wouldn't that be a great feature!). Very different from Verizon LG.
I just got this wonderful little tool but found it a bit overwhelming.  It may be my age but slowly I am getting the hang of it. Verizonwirless Have been very helpful once I get to a point of frustation. Because I purchased it online I now need to take it to a Verizon store to have my contacts transfered to the Q
copying this from another review "I loved the idea of this phone. I ended up returning it due to terrible battery life. Also, there are many bugs in IE and the Email client. "This is not a good phone. it brakes, its slow and if i have to turn it on and off one more time!Its just not worth it! Get a gmail account and a regular phone if you need e-mail that bad. This a first gen product that will one day work but right now 500$; what a waste. I paid 200$ and I think I got a good deal. It has wayyyyy to many problems and settings. One alarm clock? , msn only, can't hook up to your computer because windows xp does not know what it is, and other than that it a great phone and it will keep you working an extra 20 minutes everyday!Also you have to love mirosoft becuse thats all that works on this phone.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE WILL RETURN JUNE 15 2006...OH, i order one on line and it came in the mail BROKEN! so i have had two :)
original verizon smartphone user (two years ago), bb 7250 user for 1.5 years. always used extended batteries w all devices. always synched w exchange server. bluetooth.synching twice an hour, maybe an hour of voice calls, keeping bluetooth headset paired,  max of about 10 hours which is slightly worse than the bb 7250.sound quality much better than 7250, dropped calls in weak areas about same. (acceptable).keyboard somewhat awkward cf to bb, espec no left shift key, but acceptable.microsoft "direct push" synching not available for this phone yet, so for server synching (hosted or your own) gotta use the dumb sms initiation method. that would be a cost issue if you received a lot of mail since vzw only gives you 2,000 free sms for this, but battery life is the real limiting issue.btw, vzw plan wont give you free within vzw photos and sms if you take the 2000 free sms for data synching. dumb.bb 7250 great messaging, awful phone. will give treo a try, but suspect cdma and bluetooth are battery drainers no matter what.
I had been waiting for months for this phone to replace my blackberry 7100. I wanted something new, modern and cool. I received it. Unfortunately it comes with another loser from microsoft. With the blackberry, use was intuitive, items well organized and layed out. Sure there were limitations, but you easily adapted.  This phone makes everything take 1-2 extra steps, but then, those same steps might not work the next time.  I can go feature by feature, but let's just say, you shouldn't have to work to use a phone/pda. If you go with the Q, remember very hot, quite a bit bitchy. Choose your relationship
This phone has very poor signal strength compared to old verizon phone. and poor voice quality. battery life not good, alarm clock doesn't work.
Just a short note to say that if you use AOL and/or ACT 2006 contact management software, stick with the communication devices you have.  Do not buy the Motorola Q.  AOL email is not coompatable with the "Q" and neither is ACT 2006(you can't download any database).  This took me hours on the phone(with INDIA!) discussing this with Verizon, AOL and SAGE, the present owner of the ACT software.  The problem is being worked on but the only advice I got from any of them was,"Just check back on our website occaisionally and we will post when the problem is solved."  I think maybe I should change to another phone company--YA THINK!  Very frustrating as I spent hours on trying to like this phone.  Very frustrating.
No complaints so far.  I have had this phone about a month and it is great!
The LG VX8300 is the latest offering in the market for do-(almost)-it-all cell phones.  It combines all of the standard phone functionality with music and video playback and phone, making it a media powerhouse considering that it's such a portable, affordable package.  The next step up would be a smartphone, but at significant extra cost for the addition of more well-rounded PDA functions.THE PHONEThe first thing you'll notice about the 8300 is that it's a great-looking piece of tech - stylish and modern yet also subdued enough that it won't embarrass you in business settings.  Some pictures make it look black, but it is actually a deep metallic pewter color.  It's roughly the same size (3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9) as LG's other recent clamshell phones, although a little slimmer for easier pocketing.  It feels solid but not heavy at 3.9 oz with the standard battery.  The plastic case feels softer than prior models, so it may be more susceptible to scratches and scrapes over time.  There is a leather case for it, but I doubt you could bear the idea of covering up this good-looking unit.The 8300 runs on Verizon's CDMA all-digital network, so coverage may be an issue if you live in rural areas.  I've been a Verizon customer for years with LG digitals and never run into any dead spots around town and while traveling, but check Verizon's coverage maps on their website beforehand.Voice clarity is superb, both for you and for the person you're calling.  The 8300 has speakerphone capability, but amplified through the external audio speakers, it tends to be so loud that it may distort - set your volume appropriately low.The phone has a wide array of conveniences, including numerous handy voice-activated commands (send messages, check voice mail, look up contact, examine wireless account, etc.), one-touch calling, unique rings and photo IDs for different contacts, an address book with room for 500 contacts, and so on.  I'm a huge proponent of the voice-activated commands, and while the 8300 is very easy to set up, the long-term downside is that instead of matching up your command with your own prerecorded voice as prior models did, this phone tries to actually phonetically "read" entries from your contacts list and find a match that way.  So, if you have unusually-spelled names with silent letters in your contacts list, the 8300 will have a tough time making a match.  Plus, when it repeats the name back to you, it generally mangles the pronunciation, making that form of caller ID undesirable.  It's too bad that the contacts list doesn't have a separate "nickname" field so that you could accurately store the contact as say, "Mike Krzyzewski" but have the voice-activated commands look the entry up as "Coach", for example.If you're obsessive about ringtones, then you'll be disappointed with the default offerings.  They play back with great quality, but they're pretty boring.  Verizon clearly wants you to go to their GetItNow service to purchase the latest and flashiest ringtones.  It's not documented in the manual, but it is possible to use MP3s loaded into the phone as ringtones.The phone supports Bluetooth v.1.1, which makes it easily compatible with many wireless devices like headsets/earpieces.  You can also use this to wirelessly transmit and receive contact information with other Bluetooth devices.THE CAMERAI bought my first digital camera about five years ago - a 1.3 megapixel Olympus for about $350.  Now, for a fraction of the price and space, the 8300 delivers that same picture quality.  It's also got additional features that make the results actually worth viewing/printing, including flash, white balancing for a variety of lighting conditions (no more washed out or oddly-tinted phone pics), a four-position digital zoom, and night mode.  There are also some capabilities for having fun with your photos such as special effects (negative, posterize, etc.), self-portrait capability using the external screen as a viewfinder, and a timer.  You can take pictures from 160x120 thumbnails all the way up to print-quality 1280x960.The camera can also take videos, although the quality is predictably choppy and the largest clip that can be sent via email is only 15 seconds.  Like any of the phone's media, larger clips can be stored to the phone's internal memory or onto an optional microSD card and then copied to another device or PC.Photos taken can be used as contact IDs or wallpaper on either the external or main screen.  Both screens are breathtaking in their brightness, clarity and resolution.  They never fail to register the initial jaw-dropping compliment when someone sees the phone for the first time.MUSIC PLAYERYou can't really say MP3 player because the 8300 wants to only play files in Microsoft's .wma format.  This is because Verizon wants you to use their VCast online music store.  I purchased the Music Essential Pack with my phone and was sorely disappointed in this - the VCast software wouldn't load (it kept trying to roll me back to Windows Media Player 10 even though I'm on 11), the USB cable kept losing connection (crummy driver software), and the headphones were just so-so.  I recommend instead investing in a big MicroSD card and using it to store and transfer all of your music, photos and videos.  This is clearly the easiest way to load information back and forth between the phone, although Verizon won't tell you that since it cuts their overpriced music store out of the loop.  And if you do prefer MP3s for playback, the 8300 may not be configured out of the box to play them, but it's a simple change to make - just search the web for instructions.The sound for playback is very good, again considering that it's not a dedicated music device.  The external stereo speakers are on either side of the clamshell hinge and they pump out a lot of sound for their size.  The 8300 has a very good ergonomic feature in the form of player control buttons (play/pause, fast forward, rewind) on the outside face of the phone.  So, you can keep it in the palm of your hand rather than flipped open while listening.BUSINESS/PRODUCTIVITYThe 8300 comes with the standard roster of business apps dumbed down for cell phone usage:  calendar, world clock, calculator with tip macros, etc.  At this time, I haven't found an easy way to sync data back and forth with any desktop apps like Outlook or Notes.  There are open source apps on the Web like Bitpim that can do this, but the 8300 is currently too new for that software to handle.  That gap should be remedied soon.Verizon offers wireless broadband via an EV-DO network that includes most major metropolitan areas and airports.One exceptional add-on that Verizon offers is VZ Navigator, which turns the 8300 into a GPS-driven navigation device.  You can purchase the add-on either monthly if you do a lot of traveling by car or even day-to-day if you're just taking a short trip.  It works well, looks great, and really boosts the usefulness of this unit.CONCLUSIONThe LG VX8300 combines a great phone, a camera that's actually useful and some pretty cool media capabilities into one compact unit.  There are of course some trade-offs for each, but the convenience of only having to carry one slim item in your pocket is invaluable.  It really is a marvel for the price.PROS* A very clear phone with many convenient features like voice-activated commands.* A 1.3 megapixel camera capable of taking pictures you'd actually have printed thanks to 1280x960 resolution, flash, and color effects.* A good-sounding music player that, when combined with your own library on an optional microSD card, puts hours of entertainment in your pocket.* Bluetooth capability for wireless add-ons and communication with other devices.CONS* Incompatible with existing accessories - get ready to buy new chargers, sync cables, etc.* VCast music store is overpriced and not easy to set up (just get a microSD card and use it to store/transfer media instead - no problem).* Initial selection of ringtones is pretty dull - another attempt by Verizon to squeeze extra charges out of you.* Some of the external buttons are awkwardly sized and/or placed - people with larger hands may cramp up after prolonged periods of use.
I just switched to Verizon after using Nextel and the i730 phone for the last two years. I purchased the LG VX8300 phone after quite a bit of research. Both here and on other websites. This is my 3rd cell in the last 4 years and my 2nd flip phone.Overall I am very impressed with the performance of the 8300. Every phone has some features that are not liked or are not implimented well, but I believe that the majority of the people that select this phone will end up liking this one.Reception/Clarity of Call: I would say that it is good to very good. Verizon to Verizon calls seem to be clearer than other calls. Land line calls tend to come in very clear while cell calls tend to be slightly broken up at times. Reception in my area (Tampa, FL) seems very good. I generally get service in areas that I didn't before with Nextel. I was also advised that Verizon users should perform a Cell Tower update every month by punching *228 and selecting option #2 since this gets you the latest tower mappings. Option #1 will perform software updates, however, I have no idea if these will over write any hack's that people make to their phones. As a phone, this gets a 8 on a scale of 10.Ease of Use: I would rate this at about a 7 on a scale of 10. The manual is not written to enable you to get started quickly. It took me a few days before I figured out that the CLR button is the back button for the menu system. Knowing that really helps alot. The menus are well layed out and the options very clear. The buttons on the phone seem big enough and are easy to depress. The phone seems solid, but light. Overall construction seems sturdy. The LCD screens are very clear.As a MP3 player: It's no iPod. The sound is satisfactory, but not great. Most people should be satisfied though to use it as an emergency player. Those of us that have MP3 players are still going to use them, but in a pinch or if you are caught somewhere without your MP3 player this is a good alternative. If you plan to use this feature at all you definately need to pickup the Music Essentials kit and the microSD card. There just isn't enough on board memory to hold many songs. BTW, using this as a MP3 player drains the battery quickly.Battery: I have what I would consider to be light cell phone usage. I get roughly 10-20 mins of calls on my cell every day except on weekends. So my total talk time is roughly 1 to 1.5 hours a week. Playing even a few songs or browsing the web drains the battery quickly. I estimate that I get about 2-3 days between charges with this usage. This is pretty much on par with what I got on my older i730 and my old candy bar phone.VCast: When I purchased my phone (Aug 2006), you got one month free of Vcast service if you selected VCast when you purchased the phone. The VCast service also encludes Web Service (which you can purchase separately if you don't get VCast for $5/Mth). My original plan was to only try the service and kill it after the 1st month, but I decided to keep it after the 1 month trial. VCast DOES use your airtime minutes, so if you find that you use this feature a lot, then you might want to upgrade your plan. I use mine about 10 minutes a day to pull down news clips, weather reports and sports clips. It's a great way to use unused minutes toward the end of the month so long as your careful not to leave yourself to close to the end of your minutes and go into overages. I had the web service on Nextel, but hardly used it. With VCast, I also find that I use the Web service as well. For me, it's worth the extra money.As a camera: It's no great shakes as a camera. But for occassional use (taking a picture of a item in the store to later show to your spouse or taking a picture of some problem to show to a service man) it's fine. You can also take short video clips, but again other than for embarrassment/cute effect, it's not all that great.Customer Support: I found CS to be very, very good. Everyone was very polite, cheerful and helpful. I do suppose that some of this was due to the fact that I was a new customer, but overall I would have to say that Verizon's support people were excellent to work with.Accessories: No real Must have's. Some accessories that you might want are the music Essentials kit (mainly for the USB to PC cable) and a microSD card (purchased on the web for $40). The extra storage on the SD card is essential if you plan to either use the camera function or to play music. Bluetooth headset if you need to be able to use your phone without having to use your hands. Holster or belt clip if you don't like having your phone in your pocket. Extended Battery if you talk in excess of 60 minutes a day and use the phone as a music player or play games on the phone.Negatives: Not many, and most of them are minor. The rubber covers that cover the headset port/usb/power port are not attached to the phone so when you remove them they are easy to get lost. My old i730 phone had these covers attached to the phone so you could easily replace them when you were not using the ports. The phone tends to get slightly warm after about 10 minutes of use. It's not uncomfortable, but you do notice it. If you have the phone flipped open and recieve a call, you get two screen options, quiet and ignore. Pressing either disconnects the call. You have to press the SEND key to take the call, not exactly intuitive. The phone has a option for large fonts, but they are only available when you send text messages and type in phone numbers. You are stuck with the smaller font for the contact list which is fine if you don't have a problem with farsightedness and don't have your glasses on. Font size on both LCD windows are also quite small. The phone has a limited set of ringtones, 9 are bell variations and 6 are song variations and none of them are that good. If your not fussy about ringtones, you should find at least one that is okay. If you are, you are not going to be happy with the default set. As I mentioned the manual is not great, it takes some effort to find some answers. For example, there was no picture or mention on how the microSD card is inserted in the phone (it turns out you insert it upside down). So be careful when putting your card in the slot. The card is fragile and you don't want to force it.Hope this helps someone.
This is the fourth cell phone I have had over the years.  I've previously had Samsung, Nokia, and NEC.LOOKThe phone is really nice.  It's a dark grey color.  Both screens are in color and everything is easy to read.  It has large buttons that are easy to push, too.RECEPTION/SERVICEI recently spent the weekend traveling all over Ohio and I had great service everywhere.  The phone connected every call quickly and never dropped a call.  I receive every call and text message that is sent my way.  Every caller is very clear and easy to hear.  The reception is fantastic.VOLUMEEvery phone I have ever had or ever talked on, I always wished I could turn it up louder.  The ringers were always too low even on max and the callers always seemed too quiet.  On this phone, I have to turn the volume down to medium.  If I turn it all the way up, I can still hear the caller loud and clear, I just need to hold the phone a foot away from my ear in order to avoid breaking it :).  So I love the fact that the volume is loud.  The ringtones are also super loud.  I can hear it ringing in my bedroom when I'm in the basement or in my car when I've got the music blasting.PHONEBOOKNew numbers are very easy to add.  You can go to your contact list and add a new contact that way.  You can type the number in like your going to dial it and save it that way.  Or you can go to your call list (dialed, received, or missed) and save a number from there.  You then type in the name, and you can save up to 5 numbers per entry.  You can set a speed dial, a group, a ringtone, a picture, and a text messaging alert for each contact.  You can type in a letter or a part of the name to access someone quickly.  It takes just one click to get into your list of contacts.TEXT MESSAGINGBy default, it is set to Abc (I hate it, but every phone is).  You can change it to Word (T9 predictive text), ABC, 123, or Symbols.  Sending a new text and responding to a text is very simple and easy to use.  You can also easily send pictures (and you can add sound to the pictures) or you can send a video clip.  All are very easy to do.  You can also send each text message to up to 10 different contacts.  Quite nice if you want to send out a bulk message!!CAMERAIt has a nice 1.3 megapixel camera.  The pictures look pretty good for coming from a phone.  You can change the shutter sound to: silent, normal shutter sound, ready 123, or say cheese!  It has a self-timer and a flash.  You can turn the flash on or off and it will remember your setting, you won't have to turn the flash on every time you want to use it.  You can the option to save or erase any picture you take.  The button to access the camera is on the right side of the phone.  Press once for camera and twice for video.  You can also adjust the white balance and the brightness as well as the resolution and color mode (color, sepia, b&w;, negative, solari, vivid.  There is also a night mode which you can set to on or off.  And you can decide if you want the front screen to also act as a camera.  Nice for taking self portraits!  And its really easy to save, send, and erase every picture.  When you go to view you pictures, they show up as tiny thumbnails so you don't have to deal with filenames and such, you can just see the picture.  But you can rename them if you wish.MUSICYes, this phone  can play MP3's.  Verizon will tell you that you can only play Window's Media Player files because they like to try to scam you for money.  Just go to menu, hit 0, enter all 0's  for the service code, and scroll down to 11. Music Setting. In there, select MP3 Enable.  Viola!  I got the Music Essentials kit which comes with a USB cable to hook your phone to your computer, the software you need, and headphones to use with your phone (regular ones won't work).  You can then upload MP3's onto your phone.  It has a forward, backward, and play/pause button on the front.  I haven't tried to use the MP3's as ringtones yet but that would be a very nice option.RINGTONESThey suck :).  But if you don't care about ringtones, then no big deal.  I really hope that you can put your MP3's on your phone and use them as ringtones.  Or there are website out there that let you make your own ringtones from your own MP3's.  I was too lazy and just paid the $2 a song for the stupid Verizon ones.  But the three that I got all sound great!CUSTOMIZATIONYou can set the clock to multiple different ways.  I set mine to digital because its really big and easy to read.  The wallpapers aren't too bad either.  I found one with bubbles getting big and little floating around and its pretty cool.  You can also customize the menu.  Mine is called "Pulse" and I love it.  It looks really really neat.  You can also change the color scheme.So.. you can change the front wallpaper, main wallpaper, front clock, main clock, display themes, front banner, main banner, and big font/normal font.  You can also change the power on/off sounds, alert sounds, and keypad volume.  You can also have a different ringtone for caller ID, no caller ID, restricted calls, and all calls.  Needless to say, you can basically customize the phone to look however you want.BATTERY LIFEI use my cell phone as an alarm, so I have it next to my bed everynight.  So I just plug it in while I'm sleeping.  I've never tried to let it go multiple days.  But it has a full battery at night unless I spent the day taking tons of pictures/videos.  I also have a car charger which is quite nice.OTHER FEATURESIt has three separate alarm clocks, that you can set to go off just one time, to go off daily, to go off Mon-Fri, or just on the weekends.  And you can set it to any ringtone.  It has a calendar with reminders, a world clock, voice commands, a notepad, a calculator, an EZ Tip Calculator, security (password protected), customizeable shortcuts, and more!CALLSWhile on the phone, you can access basically everything on your phone.  You can access your contact list and the menu.  So I suppose you could send a text message while on the phone if you really wanted to!  You can also record while on the phone and listen to it later.  Or possibly send it as an attachment to a pix message.SPEAKERPHONEIt is loud and easy to hear.  I'll drive with the phone on my lap while chatting on speakerphone and I can hear the caller great and the caller can hear me great.  It's a nice feature and there is a button on the phone to turn it on and off.  An icon shows up on the bottom of both screens when speakerphone is on so you won't accidently have speakerphone on and not know it.I basically spent countless hours researching every single phone Verizon had to offer.  So many phones had so many complaints and this one seemed to have the least amount of them.  We bought 4 of them, one of each person in our family, and I got my boyfriend one too.  All 5 of us love the phones.  The buttons are big and easy to push, the phone is very attractive, the reception is fantastic, the volume is very loud, and the phone is very simple to navigate while having a lot of cool features, including a nice 1.3 megapixel camera!!  The removeable memory is also a nice feature, as well as buttons for the camera, volume up/down, and the voice commands!!Don't waste time browsing other phones or trying out a cheapie -- they are no good, I've been there.  Even my boyfriend (who is 24) and swore he'd never get a cell phone cuz he hated them loves it.:::::::UPDATE:::::::*I am still loving the phone.  I have figured out how to default T9 (Word) text, or whatever else you'd like defaulted.  I have also purchased a 1 gig microSD card.  I just stuck the card into the adaptor and stuck that into my computer.  Transferred some songs and pictures and had them all on my phone! Why buy the LG Chocolate when the VX8300 can play MP3's too?  My only real complaint is the lack of a service light.  I have no idea if I have a missed  call, a voicemail, a msg, etc without lighting up the phone.  But in comparison to the other availabilities, it is a minor flaw.  Every other detail of this phone way surpassed every other phone on the market.  I wouldn't trade it for anything.
This thing is just great.  Have had it for about two weeks now and am very impressed with it in just about every way.The sound quality is excellent for both parties.  The same holds for this phone when using speakerphone.  This is definitely a feat considering the electrical requirements of a loud, clear speakerphone.  It also allows for very good pickup so the person you're talking to won't even know they're on speakerphone.  This phone has two great speakers which boast a remarkable amount of sound (even in the low-frequency response range, surprisingly).  When you download or transfer MP3s, you may notice the sound actually comes in stereo (two-channel) output.  This makes the songs you play sound even better.The camera is also quite incredible.  Its ability to take 1.3 megapixel shots is uncanny.  Definitely better than my first digi-cam.  This is without a doubt the first and only phone camera I have seen that takes pictures actually worth saving and printing.  Even the RAZR's VGA resolution doesn't touch the 1280x960 resolution.  VGA is 640x480, which computes to a mere 0.31 megapixels.  This is exactly 4 times more pixels per shot!!  You can full-screen your shot on a computer and still retain full screen quality.Many other great features abound, including the MicroSD expansion slot.  I have a 1GB MicroSD card in the mail (do not confuse with MiniSD which is actually much bigger than the pinky nail-sized Micro card).  I will then be able to get several hundred songs on here for free, rather than paying $15/mo. for verizon's lame VCast service which only lets you download songs they specify.  Another irritating thing about verizon is that they limit this phone's bluetooth capabilities.  They do this so that users cannot share ringtones and pics for free in a peer-to-peer manner -- you must get it through the network, which requires the monthly fee.  However, this phone has more bluetooth profiles enabled than any other under verizon.  Play/pause, next, and previous buttons on front side allow you to choose music with the thing shut - VERY cool.  Also, cool flash UIs - this phone actually allows you to change display themes, not just colors.  This means entirely differently operating menus and the works.  Finally, the interface is very condusive to easy use.  It gives supreme functionality without making anything confusing or overwhelming.  In other words, if you are a power-user interested in implementing all of this phone's features, you will be happy at how much there is and how easy to use.  On the other hand if you are someone who just wants the essentials (1 phone number per contact, etc.), you won't be confused by an over-complicated interface design.The only complaint I have is regarding the service (Verizon).  The phone itself is phenominal and hasn't given me one problem.  It features top-end technology in a very attractive unit.  I just hope I don't bust it in the next two years, although i probably will, lol.
So it's time for a new phone. I see tons of ads for the Razr and it sounds like a heck of a phone so that is the first phone I check out. Hmmm, looks great, very stylish. But, I don't care for the way it feels in my hand. So I go online and start checking out reviews for it and other phones. Someone suggest the LG VX8300. I check this out. Wow!! It may not look quite as stylish as the Razr but it's a great, feature packed phone. And the reviews tend to be much better than the ones for the Razr. So I got the VX8300 and couldn't be happier with it.Yes, Verizon cripples it in numerous ways but there is lots of info on the net to get around this. I love this phone. Great reception, call quality, music sounds decent considering the size of the twin speakers. The odd size headphone jack is a problem but Amazon sells a Headphone Adapter for $3.99.The 1.3mp camera is great compared to older phones with vga. No, it won't replace your brand new 7mp camera but the pictures are clear and look good.The phone comes with mp3 playback disabled but it is simple to enable. Follow the instructions given by Ron in his review. It works and doesnt harm your phone in any way.Get the micro-sd card.There are many places you can get a card at a much lower price than Verizon. With it you can transfer music and pictures from your pc to your phone and vice-versa. You can also play your videos from your pc but you will need a conversion program. I use "3gp converter". Search the net for it. Put the videos on your flash card and show your home movies away from home. Keep in mind that the screen is tiny and not meant for a large audience. But it's great for its size.Yes, the ringtones that come with the phone leave much to be desired. There are many ways to get new ones, both free and paid. Once again, search the net.[...].
I agree with most of the comments by other users here.The one area with which I have had problems is the voice command function.I bought this phone for my wife to use while she commutes to work 40 miles each way on the interstate highway. I wanted voice command so she could use it "hands-free".  I bought her a bluetooth ear piece for this purpose, also.Since I am my wife's "IT support", when we got the phone home, I set up the bluetooth and tested it using voice commands to call my home phone and one other contact.  This seemed to work fine.Now, however, when my wife uses voice command, the software hardly recognizes any of her commands.  My wife does not have any kind of accent, nor do any of her contacts have difficult-to-pronounce or weirdly-spelled names.  One of the ones it has problems with is "Ed".  No last name, just "Ed".When I try it, the voice command works perfectly, including "Ed".  Verizon tech support told me it was because I was the first voice the phone heard when voice command was used for the first time.  I don't know if this is true (It wouldn't be the first time I have gotten bogus information from any tech support.)There is the ability to train the Voice Command in the Tools-Voice Command-Settings menu, so she did that and now it works better, but still not as well as it does for me.Therefore, I would caution users to not test the Voice Command software for the first time if you are not the primary user of the phone.
I decided on this phone after months of research, and have been quite happy with my purchase. MP3 playback is great, and you can forget about paying for the Verizon music kit- just get a MicroSD memory card instead. They're suprisingly cheap, and the phone handles cards up to 2gb. You just stick the card in your computer/reader, and use it like you would a regular flash drive.  After you drag and drop your mp3s into a folder and put the card back in your phone you're good to go. You can do this for pictures (and videos!) too, and won't have to worry about running out of space.The primary reason I got this phone was for the camera, and it works beautifully. While you can't expect the world of a 1.3mp camera, it does an admirable job at taking photos with decent sharpness, color detail, and clarity (see my "customer image"). I'd recommend shooting at the highest resolution and then resizing by 50% in a photo editor for optimal quality. You can also turn off the shutter sound, as well as take photos while the phone is still closed.Another great feature is the GPS navigation option. While the extra $10/month or $3/day seems pricey at first, it's well worth it. It's extremely handy when you're trying to find an address (especially in a city with hard to see street names). It'll also automatically recalculate your route on the fly if you miss a turn.Battery life is great, and you'll get several days of regular use out of it (talking, web surfing, etc) without having to recharge.On the downside, Verizon doesn't support much in the way of open standards- so you don't get any java programs/games, and can't run the full featured mobile gmail program or the opera web browser. That's by no means a dealbreaker though! I highly recommend this phone.
Almost everything our spotlight reviewers, " Ronald M. Cronovich `Ron'" and "D. R. Jeanclerc `Reader, Listener & Obsessive Observer'", said in their reviews is dead-on.  I just have a few things to add....1.  I need to emphasize just HOW annoying it is that Verizon is becoming increasingly rigid about their phone options.  I had the LG VX6100 for 2 years and my ears were trained to know who was calling according to the ringtone playing.  I pick up the 8300, and they have the worst selection of ringtones that are just different types of bleeps!(If you really want to create your own ringtone - press down the Voice Memo button on the left side of the phone.  You can record up to 1 min of whatever sound you want.  Start recording the song about 1/2 sec before the point you want to record and stop 1/2 sec after - the phone tends to truncate the "edges" of the recording.  Then, send a MMS to your phone - cost is $0.25 - and save it as a ringtone.  Again, the phone seems to truncate the end portion by another 1/2 sec here.  It may not be the best quality sound, but for $0.25 I don't mind getting a customized ringtone!)2.  On the 6100, I could still hear the vibrate mode when someone would call.  With the 8300, it's not as prominent.  For some, it's a pro, for others, a con.3.  I don't like that I do not have the option to have a simple looking menu like I had on the 6100.4.  In the 6100, sms was a bit different, too.  Before, I had to click twice from the point I put in the number I was texting, to get to the text body area.  In the 8300, as soon as I hit enter after putting in the number, it goes directly to the text body area.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I'm just not used to it.  I've sent many blank smses, ("pages"),so far because of doing that.I do like that I can send the same text message to numerous people at the same time.  That saves time.5.  The last thing - don't buy the Motorola Bluetooth H500 'kit' from Verizon.  They tell you it's a great Bluetooth, but they are salesmen and working off commission, so can't really blame them.  The H500 hurts the ears, is incredibly weird about pairing with this phone, as well as battery life fluctuations, and falls off if you bend your head down.  For the same price, get a Plantronics 510!  (Has much better reviews - google it.)  I am telling you here because if you get this phone - you will most likely go into a Verizon store - where they will tell you that, a.) the 8300 is the best selling phone AND b.) the H500 package is an awesome deal and a great Bluetooth.  Take it as you may.The phone is good, especially since I am not paying $100+ for it.  I just wish we could have the option of stripping what we individually didn't need, and keep things we really do want.  But, that's asking for the impossible!*Note -  I really like Verizon Wireless.  I've had Sprint, AT&T;, Cingular, watched people with T-Mobile and Nextel.  Every wireless company is essentially the same - a business, duh.  With Verizon, the bells and whistles may cost more, but the coverage I get makes up for it GREATLY.  I have made and received calls in buildings where no other carrier really works.  And for the most part, customer service is comparable.  Maybe not in store, but def phone support.UPDATE:  As of December, I have had this phone for 3-4 months.  I still say it is an OK phone.--I STILL am not used to smsing and keep sending blank smses - you know how it is - physical memory is hard to break!--I don't like how I can't put the phone on vibrate from the side buttons.--I was having this problem where I couldn't make/receive calls/smses/etc after 8pm for three nights in a row but the next morning, my phone would work.  I think it may have been a tower problem.... Anyone else experience this?--I wish I had my "quick alarm" option as before on the 6100.  It was very convenient to quickly click on 10 minutes or 3 hours of alarm time, plus it gave me 4 alarms to work with instead of the 3 I have here.--I wish a little bit of backlight would stay on for the front lcd so I wouldn't have blind my eyes looking at the time.--Phone is bit slippery for me BUT it has been good to me without a cover and does not scratch easily.***I like that I can turn the volume/vibrate mode off except for my alarms.  VERY convenient.***I like my "custom" ringtones, mainly cuz I get to choose what to record and it's a fraction of the Vcast cost!  The sound is clear enough that I can enjoy them.***I like that I have less dropped calls than everyone else on different networks.  That makes me very happy!***I like that the side buttons on this phone are not as susceptible to changing my ring mode as the 6100 was.  My phone does not ring suddenly when I know I put it on vibrate.
If you're looking for a top-notch piece of equipment that is first and foremost a good phone, but doesn't sacrifice some fun features, this is the way to go.  I spent quite a bit of time comparing this with the Motorola RAZR V3m, and decided on the LG for some very key reasons: 1. Better battery life 2. Brighter screen (though smaller than RAZR) 3. Camera WITH flash (not great, but it's there) 4. More comfortable key pad 5. Externally accessible MicroSD slotThe above elements combined with the fact that, hey, the RAZR isn't that "cool" anymore since everyone's grandmother now has one, led me to go LG.  After also owning a Motorola V330 GSM phone that I did like, I am so far more impressed with LG's quality.The VX8300 is a little large compared with some phones these days, but it feels a bit more durable than phones like the RAZR and KRZR.  The gun-metal gray is also a very stylish color.I have not found any cons to this phone yet, though many people complain about Verizon's propriety operating system and locking out some basic features of the phone.  These things don't matter to me, as pictures and videos can easily be PIX messaged off the phone or saved to the MicroSD card (which you will have to purchase separately).Now, if you're all into ring tones, wallpapers, etc., this phone or Verizon in general, may frustrate you.  However, if you want a good product with good features and excellent reception and sound quality as well as ring volume, I strongly recommend this phone.And buying from Amazon is the way to go, particularly if you want a one-year contract without getting penalized on the price of the phone.Also, my encounters with Verizon customer service have so far been excellent, and I have not waited on hold for long when I've called.Note: Be prepared for a large first-time bill if you do buy a Verizon phone from here.  They will charge you for a partial period starting the day the transaction goes through, then a full month in advance in addition to your activation fee, if it isn't waived.
I've had this phone for about a week. At first glance, it was so many lightyears better than the free phone T-Mobile had given me that I was overjoyed. Then I noticed some flaws. I'll summarize this as a pros and cons list.PROS - Fabulous reception. The last time I had Verizon it dropped nearly all the calls at my house, so I was taking a big chance switching back because of the phone. Even with 1/2 a bar the connection quality was excellent. I heard everyone much more clearly and everyone noted that they heard me better as well. And, in NY, Verizon has a better overall coverage area, so I was happy. So far, so good.I personally liked the way this phone feels next to my face and in my hand better than either the Chocolate or the Razr, but that's a matter of personal preference. For me the deal-killer with the Chocolate was the lack of speaker phone too.I also like the way the phone book is set up. Everything seems intuitive and well thought out in general.So far, so good, but the cons are a definite annoyance:CONS - 1. Horrible battery life. This phone has a battery life like phones of 5 years ago. You need to charge every night, even on standby. Don't forget to get a car charger and keep it with you with this phone. This is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone, especially compared to the Nokias my friends have.2. Horrible voice-commanded calling. I have yet to get this to work on the first shot. I bought a family plan so my elderly mother could use this - just push a button and say "call..." so she could call without having to figure out how to use the phone. I'm sorry that's not going to happen with this phone.3. Iffy speakers - if you make them loud, there is a lot of distortion, but if you put them on medium it's fine.4. Mp3 disabled - this goes under the general Verizon greed issue, but if you go to Ron's review, you'll see how to enable it - and you'll get annoyed when you see right on the phone that the "mp3 disable" is checked off. I enabled mine, so far so good.So, if all you need is great reception definitely get this phone. This phone has the best reception of any phone I've had. Judging by other reviews, this isn't the case across the board, but my particular phone gets good reception and has excellent voice clarity on both ends.And, beware, you CANNOT port your number and still get the equipment discount with any service provider on Amazon. However, there is a plus side on the Verizon end. You don't have to get bogged down in a 2 year contract anymore with Amazon either! That was good for me because I wasn't sure about the reception issue. So, I just called and emailed everyone with my new number, which is actualy easier to memorize than the other one was. I wrote this in a review that wasn't published, so lets see if they let this one slip in to this one. If not I'm complaining, because customers should know this before deciding whether to buy.So, overall I am happy with the general things about the phone, but LG needs to address the voice command and battery issues especialy with this model before it will get 5 stars from me. I can live with any other little annoyances.
This is a great phone with lots of extras.  The other reviews are correct, the speakers are loud and clear.  You do need a special adapter or special headphones to listen to music.  You can get certain blue tooth headsets that will allow you to listen to the music through them.The main reason why I wanted to write a review is because you do not have to pay for verizon's music to listen to it on the phone.  A Verizon Wireless store will upgrade the phone to the newest firmware version and you can play MP3s.  Then you can use a MicroSD card with MP3s on it.
I got this phone about 10 days ago, an upgrade from my LG 6100, which I didn't want to part with but it was starting to look shabby after less than 2 years.  The 8300 does more than what the 6100 could do, of course, but I am not into VCast or downloading ringtones, music, etc.  I just wanted a better camera because I was sick of the somewhat blurry pix from the 6100.  And I didn't want to move into the blackberry realm. The 8300 is not as easy to use as the 6100 in terms of accessing text messages.  I liked the shortcut buttons on my old phone.  This phone has shortcut buttons to things you will be charged for, like get it now, on-line and vcast--but there is a nice looking calendar short cut.Pros:1. same or better speakerphone, with a designated speakerphone button2. same tools from the 6100 (calculator, tip calculator--both extremely useful)3. voice recognition dialing (no charge--I switched from Cingular because they wanted to charge for that capability)4. better camera5. battery charges very quickly6. I'm excited about what I can do with the micro secure disc (maybe put music on there without downloading it)Cons:1.  More buttons you have to press to get to certain lists/functions2.  not a big ringer selection, but it had the one I used to use, so I'm happy.3.  no cover for the camera like the 6100, but no cellphones have these--I'm worried about scratching the lens up in my pocket.4.  cant have phone ring and vibrate together like the 6100.Trying to pick a new cellphone is always challenging because it's such an important tool that becomes a part of your life.  I feel confident the 8300 will be fine till the next best thing comes along next year.
I guess I should start off my saying that I've had to pair this phone to my old Imac, running OSX 10.3.9. On top of that, I've read (and witnessed) that the standard bluetooth file exchange has been removed as an option. That said, I've been able to find some other methods that will allow me to1 Pair the phone with my Mac2 set up my own ringers3 Sync (sort of) the phone's calander, with my gmail calander (iCal file)4 play my Mp3'sWith my set-up, and you'll have to do some internet searching to figure out how to do this, you'll likely need, at least, software for file transfers (free online, rhymes with witdim:), a MicroSD card ($), a card reader for you PC (very cheap), and if your computer isn't already bluetooth capable (as mine wasn't), a bluetooth dongle (do research to get the correct one). I did this all for about 70 bucks. The phone was free, so I guess it was worth it.Ok, so in the end, because I was able to do all this with some effort, I think it's a great phone. If you do nothing to upgrade it, I'd say that it is probably a decent phone, with garbage ringers. I would have to guess that Verizon did this so that you'll buy some through VCAST.I'd give it 5 stars if not for all the work I had to do to get the phone to work the way I want it to. So there you go. Be frustrated, then enjoy.
When my previous phone broke I just wanted a phone that made calls. However, these days it's difficult to get a simple cell phone. I was originally afraid of getting a phone with so many features because the phone software becomes so complicated that the basic phone functions become problematic. A previous phone crashed more often than my computer operating system. Fortunately, this phone has lasted six months without any trouble.
I love this phone. The ring tones and graphics in the phone when you buy it are decent. The phone is easy to use. I like the short cuts and the button placement. The only semi-negative thing I'd say about the phone is that the speaker phone button is right under the clear button. I text a lot and have hit the speaker phone buttong instead of clear a dozen times since I got it yesterday. I did a lot of research into the other verizon phones and I chose this one. I can't really comment on the extras like v-cast because I don't use them. My mother got the lg 5300 b/c it was free with verizon and it didn't have the extras that she did not want. That's a good phone too. My favorite things about this phone:*You can choose to have a picture come up on the outside when someone calls.*It is user-friendly.*The speaker phone and ring tones are LOUD if you want them loud.*It is inexpensive no matter where you get it- amazon or verizon.
I was a little skeptical about reprogramming the phone to play MP3s but found out from another blog that this is no longer the case.  Within the last month or so, LG quit disabling the MP3 player function.  I purchased a microSD card and reader from Amazon and dragged music to the music folder without a problem and without using the V-cast music essentials kit.  Playback is just great.  If using a hands free headset, music pauses during the call and resumes when you are finished.
I've had this phone for about 1 1/2 weeks and it's been great. I almost switched from Verizon because of dropped calls with my last two phones (most recently a Samsung SCH-A670), but so far I have had no problems at all with this one. I've really enjoyed playing around with the extra features (music, videos, wallpapers), especially with the help of Bitpim. The camera is excellent for a cellphone--much better than my old Samsung. My only complaints are that it's a little bigger than I would like (probably because of the built-in stereo speakers) and that there's no "vibrate and then ring" feature (but I was able to solve that by adding a few seconds of silence to my ringtone and then uploading it to the phone). Also, it took a little work to get the "Music Essentials Kit" to work, but thanks to some tips I found on the web it's fine now.
I just purchased this phone about two weeks ago and LG has pruduced another great one!  This phone is small but easy for someone with big hands to work, has a good camera, great battery life, and great reception.  If you've had LGs in the past this one fits the bill.  I've had the 6100 and 8100 before and this one is just as good.  It also has a good speakerphone.  Highly recommend.  I was looking at the Razr or Krzr but when I talked with the Verizon traveling sales guys this is the phone they all use-along with their families so that must say something.
So I'm pseudo-techno-geek. I love the tech, but ultimately give into the practicality.  That said, I needed a new phone for work and the geek in me immediately was drawn to a myriad of phones that had good gadgets (mp3, camera/video playback, bluetooth, etc..). The more I looked, the more I had to prioritize my needs.  I wanted a phone that had good clear connections and had MAN-BUTTONS!Pros:-Good sized, easy to use buttons-Average call quality-Average menu setup-Includes 1.3 mp cam/video-Ability to onboard video to the camera...but if this is important, go with a 240x320 display phone (like the Cingular 2125). Res is too low on this phone to be pleasing to the eye.-Limited Bluetooth (can't move files)-Can play music-External speakersCons-Need to do 'special code' to activate use of MP3's.-Poor music file management and access.-Can't use speaker phone while it's flipped close...ever.-Video quality is poor.-Limited Bluetooth (can't move files)Over all I'm very happy with Amazon's excellent pricing and service in getting this phone to me. Verizon's service so far has been solid. The phone is just about everything I expected, but I'll probably upgrade in a year something jazzier.[...]
First of all if you have an unlimited budget for the cell and can afford all-inclusive service plan don't read any further. Otherwise my experience will hopefully be helpful. Also, as it is Verizon-only-compliant cell phone it'd be fair to evaluate VX8300 and Verizon together.- In general the phone seems to be ok but calls do occasionally drop.- Menu has some hidden/intrusive options i.e. you press the wrong button you get charged.- Bluetooth functionaly is converted to Verizon's needs. There's no conformance to the Standard.- Be aware of Verizon plans - no rollover minutes, free national in-calling turned out to be valid for calls from other verizon customers only- customer service is ok at least you don't spend a lot of time on hold but non of the problems were ever resolved.Pros:- Sleek design- Micro SD card slot- Camera- Reception (yes, so far it's better than T-Mobile or Cingular).Cons:- Verizon's service plans, surcharges and inability to understand that 1.99$ per ringtone looks not just pure funny but shows the company treats its customers as retards.- Intrusive menu- Cramped bluetooth- multiple hidden codes and locks in various phone menus.Summary- always read the small print!- quest for the perfect cellular provider continues.
The phone works well.  Excellent service from Amazon.  However, working with Verizon has been painful.  They activated my phone with a new number on the date it "supposedly" shipped.  I say supposedly, because it was a postal holiday.  I called them when I got the notice re the new phone # and explained that I wanted to port my old # over.  No problem, he would take care of it.  However, the phone came with the new # and - I'll save you the painful details - it took about 2 hours total on the phone and a trip to the local store to finally get my old # ported over with "only" about 1/2 hour of non-coverage.  Now I've received my first bill from Verizon and it includes a $35 activation fee which was supposed to be waived with a 2 year contract and a bill for coverage starting from the supposed ship date rather than received date.  Sigh...  Verizon said that Amazon has to credit the activation fee.  I have dealt with some really nice, helpful people from both Amazon and Verizon, as well as some not so helpful ones from Verizon.  However, be prepared to spend a LOT of time on the phone trying to straighten out the details.
Good phone. Call quality is good. Speaker phone is not great; many times I had to ask the other party to repeat.1. My previous Nokia had a feature to warn me whenever I hit a button that involves extra charges (like browsing etc.). It also has an option to turn this feature on/off.But, this LG doesn't have any such feature to warn me. There are at least three or four menu options which, as soon as selected, will happily start data exchange which may result in extra charges depending on your plan.2. Contacts can be grouped into Family, Friends, Business etc. But, whose bright idea was it to limit 10 contacts per group? Hello?!2a. You can't assign arbitrary text to contacts. Nokia had a note field where you can jot down anything you want. Had been useful to store street addresses for some of them.3. You have seen other complaints about Verizon here. Most of them are true and Verizon could be a little bit more graceful (OBEX/ring tones/warn if extra charges).4. Has a lock feature to keep young ones from making calls; but, this is not same as Key Guard; still 911 is allowed to go thru (lock feature can be enabled by pressing # for 2 seconds which three different Verizon associates were unaware of and one of them owns this phone.)5. Another user has explained below how he takes a picture and then immediately transfers to memory card. There is an option to directly store pictures (and other objects like music, video) in memory card instead of phone.6. Somehow I feel that there is only limited option you can configure. People who fine tune their gadgets may be disappointed.7. I still haven't figured out how to configure email. I select email option and it starts connecting right-away.8. Voice commands works surprisingly well. But, when a contact has more than one phone stored, by voice command you can only call the default number.Even though I do not plan to switch carrier (have had Verizon for more than five years now) some how do not like this phone (and the way it has been programmed by Verizon). Most probably I'll return it.
I got this phone a week ago and love it.  Intuitive menus, easy to hear, good reception.  I wonder if some of the negative reviews here are even about the same phone.  I know reception is very  place specific but this phone has reception better than my old Samsung 650.  The menus are very intuitive.  I love to be able to take pictures wherever I am and assign photos to my contacts.
I've been using VX8300 for a few months now and must say I am VERY disappointed with the phone. The call quality is poor (compared to much older Samsung phones that are being used in the same location), with many dropped calls. Advertised Bluetooth and MP3 player functionality is either crippled or not accessible. Specifically, Bluetooth doesn't support receiving/sending phone numbers, pictures or ringtones from other phones, doesn't support synchronization with a PC. Makes you look stupid when all of your friends can share photos over bluetooth with much older phones.I found that out after I bought Bluetooth adapter for my PC. I also wanted to use the phone as an MP3 player and bought a 1Gb memory card for it, formatted it using the phone and put a few mp3 files on it. The phone refuses to play those, giving an error. There may be a way to fix it, but there's nothing about this in the manual. What IS in the manual is how to buy music, ringtones, clips from Verizon. In fact the phone menu is designed is an ad brochure with "GET PIX" and such being the most prominent choices. The rest of the menu is very inefficient. For instance, to set a wake-up alarm (something I do quite often), one has to scroll away from "GET PIX" to "Tools" (?)  section, pick alarms and then go through a couple of additional screens where the time can actually be set.I've switched from a 2yr old Sony Ericsson phone, and it amazes me that 2 years down the road the top phone from LG and Verizon is considerably worse than what I had. I have fewer features, it's a lot harder to use and sound quality is worse. After Sony Ericsson, LG VX8300, with built-in stereo speakers, huge letters, clunky navigation and poor functionality feels like it was designed by amateurs.
I bought this phone as an upgrade to the LG VX6100 from Verizon.  I liked the color, style and size of the phone but after using it for a little over 2 months, the call quality and reception are very disappointing.  I hardly ever dropped calls in my second floor apartment building with the 6100, but with the 8300 I am dropping calls like crazy.  People are trying to call me and many times the phone doesn't even ring..I just hear the chime that a call was missed after it goes into voicemail.  Also I experience dropped calls frequently with the Bluetooth headset.  Some other things I don't like is that the external display window goes dark as soon as the flip is opened to make a call, so you can't see the time.  The speakephone is loud enough but when it reaches a certain volume the phone vibrates and rattles so you end up having to keep it at a rather low volume.  Keypad is nice, internal screen is very clear and bright.  I don't know about the MP3 player and memory card since I haven't got around to messing with it.  I am seriously considering selling this phone on eBay and trying a Samsung instead.
This phone is great! It has a great look on the outside, and it's features are even better on the inside. I love the mp3 player. I don't use V Cast because it's a waste of money because I already have many songs. I use a microSD/Transflash 512 mb. and it works great! You can listen/view/transfer music, pictures, and videos. The phone is not mp3 ready out of the box but get instructions online and your set. I've learned that to transfer songs, you have to convert songs to wma. I've tried that and it works on the card, but when I transfer it there's an error and it won't play. It's not a big deal though. I love this phone and I strongly recommend it.
It is hard to love a phone in 2006 that cannot sync with your computer out of the box. A 500 entry phonebook is nearly useless with keyboard entry.I have a Macintosh, the phone has a Bluetooth connection and I have to buy a USB cable and load another piece of software to load my 230 Address Book entries and my calendars. This is not acceptable when I compare it to my (outgoing) circa. 1999 Eriksson T39.The LG VX8300 is bigger, less user friendly, and (frankly) less attractive. Without Bluetooth connectabilty to my computer it is less useful. My 15 day warranty has 14 days left.
I just got the phone today and it's taking me forever to set it up.  The manual doesn't give the correct directions.  It doesn't have a quick reference to use voice dialing. I had to look it up on-line.  I put the cd in and it doesn't give me the option to ask me if I want to start, pause, or exit so I had to reboot my computer(at work).I know I should wait till I get through the set up before I complain but I hope this isn't a sign of how absurd it's going to be to set up Vcast, bluetooth and actually use the phone.
I love this phone, ive only had it for about 3 weeks, but it gets great reception everywhere. you can make and receive calls with zero bars, it has a microsd slot for up to a gig of music(but i think the 2gb microsd cards will be in stores by the end of the year) and dual color screens, you will need to reenable the mp3 player though, because verizon only lets you use vcast music. and it doesnt have the annoying red color theme that plagued the 8100s
I recently switched from t-mobile to verizon because my husband always complained about my phone, and how he couldn't understand me.  He was looking for a second phone in addition to his nextel, so we decided on verizon because of their excellent coverage area, and we got a large shared plan. I chose this phone based on it's great reviews, and I finally have everything I've ever wanted in a phone.  Here are some things I love:You can assign a caller ID picture and it shows up on the outside display too!Everything is very customizable, from colors and displays, wallpapers and sounds.I can assign a different ringtone to anyone I want, and it sounds amazing.The camera works really well, and it also has lots of options to change brightness and quality.The menu was different than I was used to, but I think in the end it's actually more user friendly.The audio quality of phone calls is outstanding!  everyone can hear me, and I can hear them.I've made one call to verizon tech support with a question, and it was the best call I've ever made to a customer support center. The person was friendly, helpful, and did a perfect job helping me with several issues.Here is my one compaint.  I was told in the store that I could get on verizon wireless online and download ringtones to my phone. Not true.  On this phone you have to access the Get It Now ringtones through the phone and browse them that way.  All this and it uses up your airtime minutes while doing so. I could browse music for hours before I find what I want in a ringtone, and I was not happy about having to use my minutes to do so.  Plus it is so much harder to do all that on a phone as opposed to on a computer.  Just another way for verizon to make a buck I guess.  My solution?  Make my own ringtones. If you have any audio editing software, you can take an mp3, select a small clip of it, save it that way, and then email it to your phone. When you open the message you can choose as an option to save it as a ringtone! It's great!  I think you can even use voice recordings as ringtones.So in conclusion, I love this phone, and I just hope I continue to get good service with Verizon, and that I continue to find ways around the things I don't like.UPDATE:  I've read that not everyone with this phone is able to make and recieve ringtones in this way.  Apparently verizon had disabled the phones capability to play mp3's.  Yet my phone, as well as some others who have it are able to play mp3s.  Weird.  I guess I lucked out.
I just got this phone in the mail today. In less than 5 minutes from opening the box I had the phone activated and called a friend. If you know how to use and activate phones it's very easy to start using the phone. I Love the menus, options etc. Overall, I can see I'm going to love it way more than the phone I upgraded from, which was two years old, and I loved that phone too!
The phone is reasonable however it can be tough to hear sometimes.  The earpiece that I bought through Amazon.com is worse.  I can't hear much of anything through it.  I like the features but doing simple things isn't as intuitive as with my last motorola.  The phone gets about a 3 and verizon gets a 1.  Only because I can't give them zero.Whereas the phone overall is decent, I will say that the service I've received through verizon is the worst I've ever had with a cell phone service.  THe signal is good, but trying to get these people to honor their rebate commitment is like pulling teeth.  After spending about 10 hours on the phone between Amazon.com and Verizon, I am probably going to cancel the service altogether.  Tmobile has better service and I never had a problem when I called htem up.  I've spoke to about 7 service reps at Verizon and most of them are rude and some will hang up on you.  I was warned when I switched that I'd have a problem if I ever needed to call Verizon and they weren't kidding.  It's been a nightmare.
I have had this phone for almost a month now (buy one get one free deals). Works GREAT!! Very user friendly controls and fits perfectly in my hands. It has loud speaker, decent camera and bug free software.The receptoin is good but not great. The only downside is that it only works with the digital network but verizon reps told me that they're converting/adding many more digital towers around the country and will retire analog towers.Get this phone!
The phone is great!  Great!  Plus, I did some research and was able to override some features so that I can create custom ringtones for free. Just google search the phone and visit the forums.Overall, I love this phone.
This is my first phone and it's great!  It is a little confusing to use sometimes but after having it for about a week you get used to it.  The battery last a long time as well although it can get hot so I would not recomend having it on all the time.  My dad has bad hearing but even he can hear when it rings from the next room.  The voice command is a little messed up but I can deal with that.  The camra isn't all that great but it works and the services is good considering I live out in the middle of no where.  Getting music isn't as easy as some make it out to be.  You have to be in certain areas in order to get songs big cities mainly.  Overall its a great phone.
If you have read any of my other reviews with cell phones my history begins with a VoiceStream Nokia(throwback bar style phone), Nextel i1000 Plus, SprintPCS Samsung VGA 1000 and T-Mobile Sidekick II, VZW Samsung a330, VZW Motorola  v710, VZW Treo 700w,VZW Motorola Q, VZW Samsung A930, VZW LG 9800(the V), and now  VZW LG 8300. This phone embodies style with the gun metal coloring and it's thinner than its previous version the LG 8100. Coming from a mini typewriter and 1 Smartphone and 1 PDA and various other mid sized cell phones, I think this phone is awesome. I love that I can still access Wireless Sync with my email and calendar(Get It Now catalog) to the phone and also Backup Assistant or WS my contacts to my phone. Then leaning towards the entertainment side....I have a MicroSD card with 89 songs and then 125 pix and 10 videos that I can transfer and use from phone to phone without a glitch. On top of everything the phone is VZ Navigator capable which is a life saver for a person with limited directional skills. For those who think you need the Vcast Music Essentials kit to get music on the phone, this isn't necessarily true. All you need is a Memory card reader and a PC that has a USB port, a memory card and you're good to go. On top of everything, a feature on the phone that is beautiful and not really discussed much is that this phone supports Bluetooth stereo headphones. I have the Moto H20's and they work like a charm! Plus even if you don't download music, V Cast Music is a great add-on! Imagine being in Best Buy and you see a CD that's packaged great and looks like it could be good music, all you need to do is launch V Cast music, search for the title or artists' name and sample the music before you buy the CD. Although, V Cast purchased from the handset can be a bit pricy @ $1.99, the benefit is that you get 2 different versions. One for the phone and one for the PC! However, if the music catalog is downloaded on your PC and you just want to sync to the phone later, you can purchase music at only $.99 just as you would in any other music store(Rhapsody, iTunes, MSN Music). V Cast, when you think about it, is really a great feature to have because all you need is a Verizon account and you don't actually have to have a V Cast capable phone to purchase the music! Then on top of that beautiful feature, you have V Cast video where you can actually watch live perfomances of artists (of course live but pre-recorded) and download music videos and watch video clips of some of your fav shows RIGHT ON THE PHONE!!!!! You want a laugh? Comedy Central! You want to see Flava Flava? VH1! You want news? CBS! You love Lupe Fiasco? Download Kick, Push video! What phone or cellular company offers this type of entertainment at the push of a button and all at your fingertips? Nothing in life is free but when that new song, artist or CD comes out and you're friends are clamoring to get off work to hear it....You've downloaded the entire album within a couple minutes :) Sweet!
I have had this phone for a few days now and I love it. The only bad thing about this phone right now is the fact that there is a very limited choice of accessories. But this is not to big of a deal, I will just have to wait till LG and Verizon come out with the stuff I want for this thing.
I got this phone as a gift for my birthday. It is my first cell phone (never had much use for one), and it looks rather expensive. People have already noticed my phone and asked to look at it. The features are great and the setup was easy. I didn't consult my manual more than a couple of times. The only downside is the awful ringtones. I had to pay a couple of bucks and now my phone rings to AC/DC's "Back in Black."
I bought this phone just yesterday. Like most others was totally floored when i first saw it but I did not know what was in store. First things first. A phone has to be phone first. This phone will not pick signal even on the interstate. I stay in proper Atlanta and hence the signal especially from verizon should never have been a problem. Its been 12 hours + and I still dont have  a signal. I am returning this phone to get something more basic and useful.All the cons are as follows:1) Also THE PHONE IS TOP HEAVY! A person with small hands will find it difficult to operate the side buttons. The font on hte main screen is small.2) The font is small for the screen. Cannot make is large enough for those who are used to seeing cell phone for time.3) Pathetic ringtones.4) Not many short cutsI was using a Nokia before and that phone is intelligently designed.
ITS A NICE PHONE EASY TO USE BUT VERY BAD BATTERY LIFE YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT EVERY NIGHT!!
I got this phone a week ago.  I am Dallas with T-Mobile service.Call Quality: Very GoodBluetooth:  Motorola Phone Tools cost a lot of money and will not put recurring calendar appointments with end dates into the phones calendar.  I have used XP bluetooth support to upload a few images.  That is very easy and fast. i haven't used a bluetooth headset.Usability:  The menu seems a bit slow and complex.  The keys are okay size, but there are too many of them.  Also, my old Nokia had the "back button" on the right and the "select" on the left.  Moto is the opposite.  I constantly hit the wrong one.The speed dialing is odd.  You press speed number followed by # key.  This just brings up the phone book entry.  Then you have to press the call button.  There is also a press and hold speed dial function for buttons 1-9.Speakerphone:  This seems to work well.  It is quite loud.Battery life: very good.  It seems it will last well past a week on the full battery level without a charge (if you aren't talking).  On recent 1 week vacation I charged before leaving, never turning off the phone.  After one week the phone showed 2/3 battery level. I talked about 2 hours during that time frame.
Pros: Bluetooth, mp3 support, USB connector, nice large external displayCons: Internal screen is just ok, software is just ok, voice quality sucks.This phone had exactly the features I was looking for. I don't use the camera on the phone I have now and did not want to pay for another camera phone. The bluetooth worked well. The ability to use mp3s for ring tones was great. The phone has a mini USB connector for data transfer and charging. You'll need to pay for the Motorola Phone tools if you want to charge it from your computer (Windows XP). It will charge just fine with no software on a Mac. Coming from a Sony Ericsson phone, it took me awhile to figure out where things where on this phone. The handy date book and calculator were buried under settings->tools. The menus and buttons are highly configurable and after spending a few hours customizing it, I had things set up where I found the phone usable.Where this phone fell flat was on its most basic function, talking to other people. Incoming calls sounded muffled, like the other person was talking through a pillow. I had to just about yell so other people could hear me. The same was true using a bluetooth headset. I didn't want to be the loud talking cell phone guy, so I returned the phone. I was at the end of my 14 days, so I did not elect to try another one.If you are considering this phone, try it out in the store and be sure to make a call on it. Try the same call on your current or another phone to make sure its good. I noticed the difference immediately when I went back to my old phone. If motorola gets the voice quality fixed, this will be at least a 4 star phone.For the Apple fans out there, iSync does not support this phone as of this writing. You can hack iSync to get this phone to work.For the Salling Clicker fans, Clicker does not support this phone as of this writing.Update:I decided to give this phone a second chance and got a new one.The 2nd v195 I had worked better, but still had problems. The sound quality was much better. The voice dialing would recognize me. It would also lock up the phone sometimes.Round two resulted in reception problems. The 2nd phone was at least one bar lower on the signal strength then another v195 in the T-Mobile store. I also tried dialing my v195 from a Nokia 6103 in the store. I never did receive the call.This phone still has potential, it just needs some Quality Assurance back at the factory. Maybe Motorola can take the two bad ones I've sent back and make one good one. If you are serious about this phone, be sure you buy it from a place that is easy on returns.
I got this phone to replace my home landline, and so far, I have zero complaints/issues. The battery life is exceptional, and here in the Philadelphia suburbs, T-Mobile provides great service. The call quality is outstanding, and the phone is comfortable to use. The build quality seems very good, so if you're looking for a no-nonsense phone, without the bells and whistles, this is the phone for you.Update:At about 2 weeks into ownership, I can confirm that the phone continues to work flawlessly. The only very minor "con", is the bottom usb/earphone jack cover. You have to wrestle with it a bit to move it aside to make room for whatever you plug in. Rather than deal with that, I found a great deal (on that popular auction site), on a spare BT60 battery w/desktop charger. I just swap batteries in and out of it, as opposed to plugging the charger into the phone. Other than that though, still 2 thumbs up!
I got this phone to avoid all the bells and whistles of the camera phones. I just wanted a simple phone to send and receive phone calls. This is not the one. The reception is terrible. I live in a moderately sized city and have a 3 mile drive to work near a major interstate. My phone dropped calls near the major interstate and did not work in most buildings. Forget using it while shopping in a mall or a Target. I was never a big fan of Motorola and decided to give them a second chance. I would not have purchased this phone again. It also seemed to have problems finding the T-Mobile signal and would roam to Cingular. I have also noticed the battery does not last as long as they claim. I would say about half what is stated is more correct. The phone's features are also cumbersome. There is a lot of button pushing for not a lot of anything. The phone list does not let you place numbers that you call at frequently at the front. They are alphabetized no matter where you want them to be. There is a speed dial but it requires as least three button pushes and who wants to have to remember just what number is what person (I have enough to remember). The only plus is the Bluetooth - that is if you can get a signal to use it.
I purchased the Pink Satin Razr v3 back in August `06.  I upgraded from a Nokia 3595 to this lovely little piece of technology.  This was a careful buy as I read every possible kind of feedback on the Motorola Razr from many different sites.  At best, the reviews were mixed from other users/critics.  But for me, this phone is working out great.  I'm going to touch on a few points (negative and positive) about this phone.What Amazon doesn't add in their product information is that this was something manufactured overseas for use in Europe and China by the looks of it.  What tells me this? The charger that was manufactured for non-american voltage as well as the advertisement slips and instruction booklets in the product's box that are in both english and chinese characters.  I immediately went into panic mode when I saw the charger's plug but, noticed the little white US adapter which is nothing more then a piece you hook onto the prongs that have the correct voltage plug to fit into your outlet at home.And what I haven't been able to note in any reviews for this phone is that if you're buying this unlocked like I did, the only compatible providers are T-Mobile and Cingular since they use SIM cards with the GSM network.  I'm sure there are others internationally but, these are the only american providers I know of.  As for the SIM card in your current phone, just slide it out and slip it into your new phone.  Just make sure to copy your phonebook to your SIM card before doing so.  You may have to tweak the network settings to make sure they are compatible and functioning correctly.  Your mobile phone provider should appear on the screen once you've finished.The cons with this phone:-When porting your phonebook over from another phone, the Razr breaks down each number into an individual entry.  So even though you may have had 3 phone numbers for your husband or Mom in one efficient entry, this phone's does not have that organizational feature.  On the flip side of this, you can put the specific icon next to the entry in the phonebook like the little mobile phone, house, office, etc.-It's easy to get the large screen and flat keypad greasy from the oils in your skin. I find that it's enough just to wipe it off with the corner of your shirt gently should it get cruddy.-The flat keypad could be annoying for people with thick, large fingers.  I personally have no trouble with this.-No MP3 player.  Or any other fancy bells and whistles for that matter.  Honestly, I don't think this is bad since you can buy a nice MP3 player from Apple or one of the other manufacturers that have decent space for thousands of songs rather then what you are limited to with a cell phone.  I'm not a big fan of "all in one" gadgets since it tends to degrade quality.Pros:-It's quite aesthetically pleasing and sleek, no matter what color you purchase.-The camera.  It's not a fantastic camera, so if you're a photographer by trade you will know it is awful by professional, digital standards.  But if you're like me, you just use it to take impromptu silly snapshots of friends, things, pets, etc.-Volume.  Seriously, I do not know how people find issues with the audio.  My hearing is rather questionable but, I can hear my callers unless their provider's coverage is less then great.  Any calls made from a normal phone are also sharp and clearly audible.  And the Ringing Volume is a lot louder then my Nokia ever was so I'm satisfied.  You have to bear in mind that a provider's area of coverage (or lack there of) will effect your phone call and how well you can hear.  It's not always the mobile phone.  I think people make the mistake of where they put the receiver of this phone since it is very small.  And if you don't have it in the right spot at your ear, you will hardly hear a word.-Price.  The unlocked models have become reasonably priced. So if you have wanted one of these, now is the time to buy one.-Bluetooth Technology.  End of story.On a side note, I just purchased the H500 bluetooth head set in magenta since it seems close enough to the shade for me.
The purchase went smooth and it was a great deal. My wife love her new phone!!!!
I just got my M600i from Amazon.  As soon as I opened the box, I was disappointed to see that:1) The keyboard is QWERTZ and not QWERTY!!!2) The charger is not a US charger. It has round prongs. However, an adapter is provided for US plug. OK, this is not so bad, but I'd prefer to not have to deal with an adapter since it's another thing that I can lose.After I played around with it, I found a few more things:1) Apparently this M600i is an Asian version, probably imported from Singapore. On the timezone setting, the original value is Singapore. And also on the language selection menu, the choices are UK English and Chinese (written in Chinese characters).2) On the text entry setting, there's an option for Chinese virtual keyboard3) There's an annoying floating palette that provides what I think is different mode of entering Chinese character. This palette shows up during text entry mode.4) In the tools menu, they have an application called "Lunar Calendar" which is some kind of Chinese calendar5) There's a dictionary application and there are only 2 translation available: Chinese to English and English to Chinese.I wanted to flash the firmware and install a generic English language firmware.  I used Sony Ericsson Update Service (SEUS), but SEUS said that the phone already had the latest firmware. I've been researching Sony Ericsson and Symbian forums but haven't had any luck.So there you go... now you know better than I did. For me, the killer is the QWERTZ keyboard. This phone is going back to Amazon.
Pro:El diseño es elegante, todas las funciones PDA normales, lee documentos de Office y PDF bastante bien. El browser de internet esta bien. El uso del jog dial y la pantalla tactil, permite manejarlo con una sola mano.La interconexion con la PC de escritorio es facil y puedes cargar tus fotos, videos y musica sin muchos problemas. El color y brillo de la pantalla es bueno.Contra:No trae camara, el inicio cuando se enciende es incomprensiblemente lento, iniciar el browser y otras funciones tarda demasiado, una vez iniciadas las funciones ya trabaja normal. Se reinicia de vez en cuando el solo. Si abres muchas funciones a la vez termina inhibiendose.En resumen el estilo y presentacion es muy buena, si nunca te ha servido la camara de un telefono movil (porque nunca las fotos salen con calidad aceptable) y tienes un poco de paciencia al encenderlo, pues..... compralo!
This is a great phone, unfortunatelly it is not EDGE as stated in the product specifications it is a 3G phone what it means is that is a UMTS phone, this capability is not fully launched in the US territory, be aware!!
This is a great phone. The only issue i have is that i cannot get my service provider settings in it for internet browsing. If someone can help it would be greatly appreciated.
This thing does everything a razr can do, but without all the software bugs. Alao, its design is far better, its not so long and wade, it slips right into your pocket because there isnt an antena or sharp edges. Its also very durable, I'v dropped it twice and it still works perfectly, and whatever material surrounds the metal casing is virtually scratch-proof, so it still looks great too.
This phone is super sexy and has awesome features.  It does a lot more than your typical razr phone, I love the voice feature of just being able to say what number i want dialed and it will dial it.  No need to program your voice for each name or number, It just knows!  The only flaw with this phone is the battery dies SOOO fast!  My old phone held a full charge for about 2 days before the battery starts to die, with this phone, the battery is dieing after about 12 hours.  Would I buy this phone again?? In a heartbeat!
The unlocked 6233 is a great phone with only one drawback for US users. It was not fully compatible with Cingular's voice mail system.  For some reason the voicemail indicator light would not register when there was a message.  When it did work it would not register when the message had been deleted. According to both Nokia and Cingular the software for the phone is not updated yet for this Cingular feature as the phone is primarily made for European and Asian 3G and GSM networks.
I really like this phone..  its cute, its little, its perfect for a young woman.  I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth, but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone..**the ringer on it is SUPER quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  i'm grown accustomed to "listening" for the vibrate feature instead.i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list.i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable.sound quality is good, on both endsi dig it.  im sure you will too.
I've been a sprint customer for over three years and have owned three sanyo phones; Sanyo 8100, Sanyo 8300, and the Kantana. If you're coming from a mulitimedia phone like the Sanyo 8300, the SCP-6600 Katana may be a bit of a disappointment to you. The Katana just doesn't have all of the bells and whistles as a multimedia phone. The Katana has no built in flash which is needed for taking half decent pictures with a camera phone. It also has no camcorder or media player. But then again its not suppose to. It's basically an attempt by sprint and Sanyo to satisfy the consumer cravings for the popular RAZR phones that are available through wireless carriers like Cingular, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Cricket and a few others. It's obvious by looking at the Katana that it was inspire by the Razr, which does not have MM functions either. On a feature note I would have to give the Katana a one besides doing the simple things like making phone calls and downloading ringers and screen savers there's just not much more you can do on it. Aesthetically the Katana is not that much of a beaut. However, it is for the time being a bit different looking so for (except when compared to the RAZR) that I'd give it a four. For the lack of a decent camera and camcorder I have to deduct two more points which brings rating down to three stars. Oh for those of you who are interested in bluetooth the phone is bluetooth capable.
I got this as a gift, its too thin for me. I"m not into the credit card sized phones.  Picture quality sucks, its hard to manage it.  the menu buttons are inconviently placed, such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling.  its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone!
I was with Sprint for almost 10 years, all told. I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too! Trust me: avoid Sprint at all costs! I should have!
When i first got this phone, i was really happy with it. i thought the features that came with it were great, and really worth the price. ofcourse, there comes a however: three days after i bought it, the camera has a major malfunction. everything i try to photograph (indoors/outdoors, day/night, white/black)comes out with a very annoying red tint. the pictures are all monotone. just red and white.  i called "customer service" psshhh. they told me to reset the phone settings... didnt work. then they told me i  should just send the phone in, and they'l diagnose the problem and repair the phone, if not replace it. i figured why not... but then they tell me it could take up to a MONTH from the day i send it out with my own bloody money. this would not be a problem if i werent leaving to college in a bloody week. now i have to have someone send it to me in college once it arrives at my NJ residence. if you want a good phone which comes with a good headache, get this phone.
A very nice product. I have the phone for three months and it has preformed well. TMO is a good company to do business with.
I bought this phone last month and it is a really good phone. It's not too fancy and not too expensive, I'd definatly get this phone if you want something less expensive that works great!
Please note I'm reviewing both the Virgin Mobile service here and also the Oystr phone.First the phone. I've had Virgin Mobile service for 2.5 years and have been using an old Audiovox flip phone which is very small. Lately the buttons on the Audiovox are getting a bit dodgy and my eyesight is getting worse too (I'm 43) so I wanted a phone with a bigger, brighter screen. I've been waiting for Virgin Mobile to have some decent phones and I was excited to see this Oystr phone available at such a decent price.However I discovered that you get what you pay for. To me, this phone was only marginally acceptable. First off, the phone seems very buggy. Sometimes the keypad backlighting comes on, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the screen remains lit througout a call (that surely accounts for part of the battery problems people have been reporting), sometimes it doesn't. Setting the backlighting to turn off after 7, 15 or 30 seconds made no difference on my phone; it always turned off after 2 minutes or so -- when it did not stay on throughout a call. The messaging is buggy also -- to give one example, the automatic capitalization works after a period, but not after a question mark or an exclamation mark. This latter bug doesn't seem limited to my particular phone. I emailed Virgin Mobile about it and they emailed me back to say they replicated this on their Oystr also. How it is that a phone aimed at young people doesn't have good SMS software is simply astonishing to me -- it's not like this is a new technology. I've been using SMS-equipped phones for years in Asia, where most people send SMS messages more than they make phone calls. All of these bugs were giving me a queasy feeling so I decided to switch to the Nokia Shorty, which I am much happier with. Nokia has, in my opinion, the simplest and easiest to use cell phone software. The sound quality of phone calls on the Nokia compared to the Oystr is far superior, in my opinion.This phone seems okay for someone who really wants a flip phone at a low price. But if you use your phone or SMS messaging a lot I think you will find the annoyances of this phone rather great.Now let me talk about the Virgin Mobile service. I think it's very good overall. I have a special set of circumstances -- I'm often working outside the US for months at a time. Therefore it seems a waste to me to pay a large monthly fee for a phone which I will not be using perhaps half the year. Virgin Mobile's service fits the bill perfectly. So far as I can tell, this is the cheapest large and well-established cell phone service. If you want a cell phone only for emergencies, to keep in the car, to use when you arrive at or are picking someone up at an airport, etc., then I think you can't beat Virgin Mobile. The minimum you can pay with them to keep your phone in service is $80/year -- and that $80 goes toward call time. You have to add $20 to your account every 90 days to keep your account active. Then minutes are 25 cents/minute for the first 10 minutes on any one day, and 10 cents/minute after than first ten minutes (Virgin Mobile does not actively advertise this deal anymore, but it is still available if you ask them or search carefully on their website).In contrast, Net 10 seems cheaper -- 10 cents/minute all the time -- but you have to pay a minimum of $150/year to keep the service active (this is as of Sept. 2006 -- plans change frequently, of course).In addition, Virgin Mobile's customer support is exemplary. Every time I have called them with a problem, I got a knowledgable person who spoke English fluently and was very helpful and friendly. Their website is excellent and easy to use. I explored switching to the Net 10 service when I discovered the Oystr was such a poor phone -- Net 10 has some nice phones available. But calling their customer service was a nightmare. It seems clear to me they have followed the trend toward outsourcing their customer service to offshore call centers in order to save money and it was very difficult to get basic information about their service. Net 10 as well has a reputation (do a search on Google) for having a difficult time switching a phone number over to their service. I decided not to risk it and just stay with Virgin and the Nokia phone. I'm glad I did.Overall I give Virgin Mobile very high marks for their service, but poor marks for the phone selection. I do not know why they do not offer one good solid higher-end Motorola or Nokia phone to attract more adults (and smarter people) to their service. I hope in the future they see that they could reach a whole new market with their good service if they offered phones not just aimed at trendy high-schoolers but also at (slightly) older folks too.
Okay, so all the bad reviews for this phone almost made me not buy it. However, I needed a phone, and this one had nice features, and texting is cheap, so I went ahead and bought it, figuring I could return it if I didn't like it.So, the first thing I notieced is that it is a nice phone. It is a perfect weight, comfortable to hold. The white case has a pearl-sheen to it, and is solid feeling. It is a study and tight phone, very durable. The screen is 128 x 128, and it looks muay nice. I've seen $50 phones with screens of lesser quality. You can change the brightness and contrast. I lowered the contrast one level, and it looks nice and crisp.The phone is easy to navigate. It played with it for two minutes and figured out where everything was. It has the standard virgin mobile graphics [pig with wings, donkey, dragon, robot, etc.] and they aren't distracting or anything. The menu's are easy to navigate and see. The fonts are clear and easy to read, not cramped or odd colored. It comes with 4 backgrounds: swirls, diamond pattern, skulls & roses, and multi-colored eagles. On their site you can download more for $2. The phone comes with themes also, and you can download more.The ringtones are nice. They've now added a 'Euro ringer' because the older generation didn't like the superphonic [song] ringers. The Euro ringer sounds like a normal phone, but just a tiny bit more fancy so as to not be boring. You can download hundreds of ringers on their site. I currently have Super Mario Brothers theme. The sound quality of the ringer has improved, it sounds loud and clear. No more tin box or static sounding.The text imput is simple. You can disable auto-text and what not, and typing is fast. It is simple to navigate email, text, and inbox. Speed dialing, one touch, etc. can all be enabled, and they are simple to use. You can change sounds, including 'text recieved' alarms. You can add signatures to text messages, and graphics. The phone has both text AND picture messaging, even though the phone doesn't have a camera. Texts are cheap compared to most. A standard text is 5 cents both ways. However, even on the prepaid plan, you can sign up for a monthly texting plan [while keeping your prepaid plan]. You can get 1000 text messages a month for $9.99. Not a bad deal, best you will find for texting anywhere, especially for prepaid.Web browsing is simple and easy to navigate. With one press of a button, the phone will pull up the number of minutes you have remaining. You can do this 5 times a day for free. If you are low on minutes, you can register your credit or debit card or paypal account on your Account through their site. If you check your minutes and it is low, then you can simply enter a dollar amount to refill, hit OK, and you have added more minutes. Very simple and convient; very nice since you don't have to go to a store to buy a card. All minute plans are 18 cents a minute no matter what, and this includes tax.Oka, onto the matter everyone cares about: battery life. With the first Oystr's, battery life was terrible. Beyond terrible. Maybe 10 hours if you were lucky. Luckily, after so much complaing, VM has corrected this problem. With the older phones, the backlight stayed on constantly, even when the phone was closed, which drained the battery. Now, you have more options. You can go into Menu > Settings >Display > Duration. By default, the backlight will remain lit even when the phone is closed, though the screen goes off and the backlight dims. The purppose of this is so that if it is dark, you can see a faint blue glow coming from your closed phone, making it sylish and easy to find.If you wish to stop this, go into Duration and select disabled. This will disable the backlight WHEN THE PHONE IS CLOSED. When you open the phone, the keys will light up just like normal. The difference is, the backlight NEVER stays on when the phone is closed. Battery life goes back to the stated 7-8 days. The only thing is that when the phone is open, it takes a full two minutes for it to dim. So that is two minutes of talking when the  phone will be using a little more juice. But it doesn't make a huge difference. If you purchase an Oystr, do what I said [disable the backlight] and the phone still stays lit or the battery doesn't work, you ahve been sold the older, not-thought-out-too-well model. You need to contact VM and get them to send you a new one.Reception on this phone is good. I'm yet to have a call dropped. The calls go through fast. Since you can pull up reports on your minutes, you don't have to listen to the robot tell you how many you have left. The sound quality is good. I can go into the very lower level of the school library, which is all stone, and I still get reception without a problem.Rates on this prepaid plan are very nice, especially when you take into consideration the reception quality. Pay by the minute is 18 cents always. Texts are 5 cents always, both to send and recieve, UNLESS you want to sign up for the monthly texting plan [1000 for $10]. You can sign up for the text plan WHILE remaining on the pay by minute plan; VM is the only one with this. Another thing I like about VM is that I can switch between monthly plans and prepaid plans as often as needed. With other prepaid plans, once you switch to a monthly plan, you can't go back to pay by minute. With VM you can.Overall, I really like this phone. It was dirt cheap, $20, and it is NICE. If it had a camera, it would be perfect. It is strong, crisp, has an Xcellent screen, nice downloads, good ringer, has song ringers which are also unheard of for a prepaid cell at this price, has excellent and strong reception, on-demand minute statitics, instant minute purchasing, etc. I hightly recommend this phone, as long as it is the newer model.
My husband and I have been pre-pay cell phone users for about 5 years now, we were with Trac-Fone, the only reason we left Trac-Fone was because we got tired of carrying around a heavy phone and for some reason the flip phones available through Trac-Fone didn't work for us, we never had a problem otherwise with Trac-Fone or their customer service, but because I wanted a flip phone I decided to do some research on other pre-pay cell phones out there.A few weeks ago we decided to go with Virgin Mobile Audiovox 8610 and were basically happy with the phone except the 1 complaint that many have expressed, the sound of the ringtone was way too low, other then that we were happy with the signal and customer service.I decided to buy my mother a pre-pay phone and saw the Oystr on the Virgin Mobile website, she's not a big cell phone person either and we just wanted to get her the phone in case she needed it for an emergency, I got the phone and charged it and was amazed how great this phone was, the ringtones go to level 7 whereas the Vox 8610 go to level 5, the ring was so loud that I had to put it down to a level 3 for her and that's still loud, so I was happy about that, also this phone is easy to program and the speakerphone worked great, this phone also offers voice dialing, just program it and all you have to do is press the send button and say Home or whatever you choose and it dials it automatically.We loved this phone so much that we decided to buy 2 more Oystr phones and are returning the Vox 8610's. We were able to buy the Oystr at Best Buy for $29.99. I can't find anything wrong with this phone at all, the outer shell is hard and seems less susceptible to damage, the ring is very loud, we get a great signal, and the phone notifys us if we have a voice mail message. You can also send text messages and browse the web with this phone but since we're not interested in that I can't comment on it.You can also download ringtones etc. for this phone. I can't say enough good things about it, for the price we paid we got a really great phone. Virgin Mobiles customer service has been awesome also, we had no problem changing over the phone from the Vox 8610 to the Oystr.
at first, the battery charge didn't last the entire day. the screen stays lit up EVEN THOUGH THE PHONE IS CLOSED. it NEVER shuts off. so i just changed the setting, battery stays charged all day. PENNY TEXTING is awesome! just 9.99 a month for 1000 messages. this is the easiest way to stay in touch as a family. way cheaper than calling and wasting minutes. unlimited plans are awesome too as nights start at 7pm. perfect time for my 12 year old to get home, do homework, eat dinner, and then call her friends. OH you can also text message to a land line and the message gets read to you AND you have the option of replying to that message! that feature has come in handy already. nice, simple, no frills phone with a plan to match. you can also earn up to 75 bonus minutes a month just by watching some ads on the website. it's called sugar mama, try it!
To my surprise, this phone has a bundle of features.  You get 4 ringtones to start and the phone is loud.  Additionally, the phone has about two dozen sound-effects tones for all the features and alerts that come with the phone.For example, there are 5 sound-effects for flip (lid) open and flip close.  There are a dozen sound-effects and vibration for message alert, page alert, voicemail alert and missed call alert. There's also an option to remind.My favorite is the "missed call alert" that's set to "vibrate and remind."  When someone calls, the phone will ring, however, if the caller hangs up, the phone will vibrate 3 times after the last ring.  Really cool if you have your phone in your pocket and didn't set the vibrate to on. Other features include: voice-dial,  Speaker phone, 4 alarms, voice memo, stop watch, tip calculator, calculator, scheduler and a Countdown Timer.  I love the timer cuz you can set it count down from as much as 99 hours or as little as 1 second.For those who are counting the minutes during a call, there's also a "minutes alert" that makes a beep 10 seconds before the next minute begins.The phone feels very lightweight but durable.  It has an attractive shell and the buttons inside are pretty well layout and the display is crisp and clean.  Oh I forgot to mention that there are screen savers, wallpaper and color screens to choose from as well.I have no problem with the batteries pooping out too soon so I guess they have fixed the battery problem.  To save battery consumption, by default, there is an "energy saving mode" for the display and keys set to on and durations set to "7 seconds."  The instruction says that the display will dim slightly at the set time.  However, I noticed little difference in the brightness (or dimness) of the display, however, the keys do turn off at the set time.On the other hand, when I turn off the "energy saving mode", the screen becomes very very bright.  After the set time (7 seconds) the display dims to the level of brightness describe in previous paragraph and the keys turn off.The reason I am mentioning this is because most of the cellphones I've seen have display dimmers that are so dark you can't really see anything once the dimmer kicks in.  This phone actually have a dimmer that's bright and yet, in my experience so far, saves battery consumption.I don't think I've mentioned every feature of this phone but for the price, I give it 5 stars!Oh yea... I thought I would miss the front subscreen but I don't.  I no longer have to worry about scratching or dirtying the shell anymore.  :D
I have been a V.M. user for almost 3 years with NO problems whatsoever. I recently bought this phone just to get something different from the trusty Audiovox I had used forever. It had been dropped,kicked, frozen, drowned and generally abused for over a year and NEVER failed me. Another reason I bought the Oyster was that it was cheaper than the battery for the Audiovox.(That phone is still available for $49.00) The only negative is that was not very loud. If I get half the service from this phone as the other, I'll be very happy. This one does have better graphics, however. V.M. customer service has been the best, although I only called them twice, so maybe I just got lucky. Who knows. 1 last bit of advice: stay away from the monthly plans if you can. It may cost you more per minute, but,if you use yours like I do, it won't be a big deal.
We excitedly bought the Oystr phone for my teenager in late July, activated it, charged it, etc.  It never held a charge for more than 36 hours.  We tried a charger from her sister's Kyocera (different model) phone.  Still no charge.  Returned it to Target, and exchanged battery for another Oystr battery.  Still no charge.  Finally returned Oystr phone with replacement battery to Target and exchanged for another Oystr phone.  Again, tried to charge 3 times using the 3 Kyocera chargers we now own.  THIS PHONE WON'T HOLD A CHARGE MORE THAN 24 HOURS!!!  I got on the internet and found that LOTS of people are experiencing the same thing with the Oystr phone.  It's obviously NOT the battery, NOT the charger...IT'S THE PHONE!
i switched to the VM oyster from tracfone because TF was soo expensive and the phone had no features. i like prepaid because i am a 19 year old girl that has RUN UP A BILL OR 2 BEFORE... i went to radio shak to buy a kyocera k9 for my brother but they didn't have any so i got the oyster. i read the package and was so impressed that i got one for myself too for only $20 each. (my TF was also $20)i LOVE the SLEEK LOOK of the oystr and the color scheme(and the name too!). the features of this  phone that my candy bar nokia tracfone did not have include: speakerphone, internet access, large colorful lit number pad, color screen, cheaper minutes (i pay by the minute 18 cents, TF was 33 cents), screen saver, the option of adding money to the phone with a credit card(with tf you have to use a card which means going all the way to the store), graphics, simple volume adjustment, and my favorite...NICE LOUD MUSIC RINGTONES! i have purchased ringtones including: T.I., Missy elliot, "chain hang low kids", 2PAC, and "sippin on syrup" by 36 mafia.you can also choose celebrity messages for your voice mailbox. (its cool to have the yin yang twins answering my phone!!!!!)basically this phone offers WAY more PERSONALIZATION than my former TF.my TF's battery lasted A LOT longer than the oystr's does but i just always keep my oystr plugged up and take the cord with me if i go someplace.i also like it when i tell people how much i paid for it and they say "WOW". (The cheapest flip fone you can find!!!) i prefer flip phones over candy bars because they look classier:)IN CONCLUSION i think it is a good basic phone and you just cant beat the price! and the price of the minutes is good for me.
I was with T-mobile for a year but the reception nowhere near as good as virgin mobile.I couldn't make calls in stores or anywhere in almost any building.With Oystr i can actually go down into the basement and have 3-4 bars.The style is sharp but no faceplates for them...yet?.Overall i love it and the service.
overall a decent little phone for if you just need something for basic use.  the quick-key funtioning is awkward and not intuitive if you're used to say, a nokia, but you get used to it.unfortunately (as many have noted) the battery is garbage.  even brand new the properly 'trained' battery only holds a charge for about 8 hours and offers less then 2 hours of talk time.a decent phone for a kid or someone who doesn't need advance features - but keep a charger handy in the car, in the office, at home, etc.
The phone is cute looking and some of the features are OK but what good are those if the battery life is sometimes less than 24 hours?  The longest the phone has held a charge for me is 36 hours and that has been on standby!  The screen light does shut off as far as I can tell when the phone is shut so I doubt that is the problem.  I originally had sent back the battery thinking is was bad but it looks like the phone as a whole is bad.  Don't bother!!
Battery lasts about 36 hours from full charge to shut down, making no calls. Specs say standby time 8 days. I called Virgin support about it - rep says "8 days is if you leave it turned off." Not very useful advice. This is not specific to my particular phone - I got one for my dad at the same time, and it has identical battery life.
I have been with Virgin for several years and decided to upgrade to the Oyster from the K7. I found that with a "soft-sided" purse, I would accidently turn on my K7; the Oyster's hard cover keeps me from doing that.  I don't use my phone very often and have the minute2minute plan - which is now down to $.18 per minute.  The only problem with Virgin is lack of coverage in our area.  We have mountains all around us and our highways are not on the "beaten path" therefore we have large areas that are not covered by Virgin or most other plans. But for 99 9/100ths of the time Virgin is great
This is a real bummer because this phone has the features I wanted but there really is some sort of issue with the battery.  Mine would only last 24-30 hours although the box says 200+ hours of standby.  I'm on my second phone with the same problem and will be returning it today to get something else entirely. I've talked to both Kyocera and Virgin Mobile about it but no one wants to acknowledge there is a problem.  Virgin Mobile customer service has ranged from outright rude to pleasant but unable to solve the problem.So just don't bother buying this phone or know that you're taking a risk if you do.  And if you have this phone and are having trouble, please call Virgin Mobile to complain and maybe someday they'll get around to fixing it or making it right.
I bought two of these phones for my wife and I on Friday. We had our phones on for only one day and the batteries went dead. Neither of us even used the phones to talk on! That means the standby time was only approx. 15 hrs.! A decent user friendly phone otherwise. VM could have a good thing going here, but they refuse to do anything about the battery life of this phone. I called and told them my situation, and they said to take the phones back for a refund. I asked if VM plans to do anything in the future to fix this problem and he said no, they are only 20.00 and you get what you pay for. He then recommended the VM Snapper. I couldn't believe my ears! VM better make this right or they will loose many a customer over this lemon.
It's a decent-looking, but feature-poor (feature-weird?) phone.  The problem with the battery life that most readers point to is because there is a fault in the flip-cover that will turn on the LCD screen and leave it on when the lid is closed.  I traded one in that had an average 8-hour battery life.  My current one isn't so bad, but the 36-hour mark noted elsewhere seems pretty accurate.The default wallpaper choices are ghastly, the screensaver is a joke, and only the most pristine and simple ringtones come through clearly.  I had a Nokia shorty, and thought I'd "upgrade" to this phone when the Shorty's battery got dodgy.  Color me educated, because if the mood soon strikes me (and I feel it will), I'm going back to the Shorty and its 6-day charge.  Plus, I kind of found the flashlight handy.Some final things: The menu/button layout is one of the most confusing affairs I have ever laid witness to.  The web-browsing for balance, etc. is slow and inaccurate.  Plus, FOLDED, it's bulkier than the Shorty.
I bought two of these phones, both got less than a day and a half of stand-by battery life.  Called Virgin and they said that early models were OK, but there's a bad batch out there now.  Buy the "Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone" instead, it's comparable in size and features and its stand-by battery life is much closer to the 7 days advertised (and you can easily get an extended battery if you need even more time).
I have this phone and I have to charge it every single day. I've ran out of battery in the middle of conversations a number of times, it is horrible. It has a poor signal also. I wouldn't recommend this cellphone to anyone.
Well, I just got this phone today, black friday, so I'm not to with it yet, I may be off on a few things, but I think I understand the basic point this phone gives.Pros:-Nice white outside-Amazing buttons, very easy to press and dial by feel-Great size-pretty good screen size, could have done better, but its overall good.-good features on the phone, voice recording, games, okay graphics, could have done a lot better on that one though.-voice number dialing! i love that a lot, since my last phone, the nokia shorty, did not have number dialing, only namesCons:-No outside caller id, this phone would have been great with it-Battery, well mine is okay, i konw a lot of people have said that the battery is bad, but mine seems to be doing okay at the moment, I'll follow up with that in a few weeks.-the middle button, with all the features and arrows is quite small, it is hard to press also.-graphics are not very good either.the screen savors to choose from are butterflies, a hot dog, eyeballs, and some random worm things?the wallpapers to choose from are some multi colored parrot things, a dimond pattern that is light blue and pink, roses, and yellow, orange and purple swirls.there are also 4 different ringtones to choose from, they are okay.- some things are confusing, like how to voice dial and other things.Overall i think this phone deserves a 4 outta 5, only because of the lack of good graphics, battery life, no outside caller id, and it is sometimes confusing to find what you want to do. I wouldn't reccomended this phone to a 40 or 50 year old male business man, it's not really for them. This phone is good for teenagers, and young adults. And with the wallpaper, screensavors, and ringtones, it seems more of a female phone over a make phone, in my opionion.
With all of the mixed reviews on this handset I called Virgin Mobile Customer Care to get the real scoop.  This handset had trouble with the battery life when it first launched but this issue has been resolved for quite some time now.  So I went ahead and purchased my very own Oystr - I've had it for about a week now and love it! The color is cool - more of a pearl shade and who can beat the price of $17 for a color flip phone!
I just took this phone back to Best Buy. I had the same battery problem and mine quit accessing the network about a week ago. I could still call but no XL. BB let me use 29 credit on an 8610 cause it was past 30 days.
I have had my Oystr for a few weeks. In general it performs well: nice loud ring and earpiece, clear microphone, contacts (address book) easy enough to use, display is colorful and sharp. Earpiece volume is easy to control, even in the middle of a call, with buttons on the side of the phone that fall naturally to hand. It does not support AIM (instant messaging) or picture messaging. It is a real bargain at $30 including shipping. The keys are mostly large and easy to use, except I find the Back key to be a bit small but still usable. I have not used the speakerphone or web browser on the phone so can't comment on them, except to say that I prefer the Oystr's dedicated speakerphone button to the menu-based Nokia system.It took me a while to find out how to put email addresses in the phone book for use in text messaging. It doesn't say in the product manual, either, but if you just keep pressing the down button (the one just below the OK button on the 4-way controller) you go through several possible phone numbers for a person, then get to both email addresses and web URLs.The battery life is disappointing, which is why I gave the phone just 4 stars instead of 5. I think that the firmware controlling backlighting and keypad lighting is buggy. The main screen's backlight stays on all the time the phone is open, and I don't think it should. Even worse, the keypad lighting was on all the time until I disabled it from the settings  --> display --> backlight --> duration menu. Until I disabled this I got only one day per charge, even with no use of the phone. Now I get at least two days, maybe more, but I don't like to run it down all the way so I am not sure how long it would really last.I didn't like any of the ring tones included with the phone. So I invested $2 in a new one that I like very much, "Old Telephone 1". Obviously just a matter of taste; I like a loud, natural-sounding ring. I didn't much like the default wallpaper or screen saver either, but disabling the screen saver and changing to plaid wallpaper made the phone much easier to look at.Virgin Mobile has increased their offerings in both by-the-minute and monthly charges. I am a very light user, so the by-the-minute offers appeal to me the most, but their $7/month + 10c/minute offer is also good for me, especially during months when I expect to use the phone almost every day. Sprint network coverage (Virgin's provider) is OK in my area, but be sure to check out your coverage before you get a Virgin phone. There is no roaming allowed, you use Sprint or you get no service.In conclusion, I think that the Oystr is a good basic phone, nicely designed and sized, well-suited for phone calls and text messaging. Its one flaw is buggy backlighting, which leads to reduced battery life. Turn off the backlighting as much as possible and the battery will last a few days, so it isn't a deal-breaker. Compared to my previous Virgin phone, a Nokia Shorty, I think the quality is similar, but the design (flip phone vs candy bar) is better. The Shorty had a different flaw, a bug that would cause it to turn itself off at random times once a month or so, and also a possible bug in the charging system that sometimes caused the battery not to recharge fully. The Oystr's bug is much easier to live with.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!The phone has a lot of great features but because it doesn't hold a battery charge what good is it?We're going back to Tracfone. We're not big cell phone users at all and we wanted a flip phone, and since we don't use the phone that much we didn't pay attention to the battery life of the phone until this past week, twice this past week my husband charged the phone and after using the phone a couple of times for short calls the battery went dead, so he charged it again, within a day he got 1 phone call, the phone rang 3 times, he picked it up and got cut off right away, battery went dead again.Virgin Mobile says this phone has I think an 8 day standby? no way. I called Virgin today to ask what they're going to do about the problem, they offered to ship me the same phone again, and couldn't guarantee that the battery would last longer then it does now.Virgin offered me nothing else to compensate for this useless phone, what good is a phone if the battery keeps dying? I thought maybe I'd upgrade my phone but they wouldn't give me a credit for the useless Oystr phones.I ordered the Motorola V176 today from Tracfone and will go back there. This Motorola phone was available when I was still with Tracfone so that's why I switched to Virgin Mobile. I'm very disppointed in Virgin Mobile and the fact that they won't credit me for 3 phones to upgrade shows they don't care.Sorry for my initial glowing reviews, I had no idea at the time that the battery was going to be such a problem.
It is not perfect ergo 4 stars.  I am not interested in receiving calls as much as making them.  I have the .10 cent a minute plan and since there are no roaming and toll charges it saves me money.  I have found that the battery lasts a long time if you press the red phone until you hear the beep and the phone shuts off.  You get no incoming calls you do not want - then you turn it on when you want to call out - you then shut it off when you are finished calling out.  All in all I am satisfied with my purchase.
This phone has extremely disapionting battery life. I must charge the phone daily if I want to make calls.  The phone is beyond annyoing.  The stated battery life of 8 days (without making calls)is a down right LIE.  I'm going back to the Kyocera Royal, which makes me look like a technological fool, but in this case I must take function over form.
This is a great phone and I've had no problems with the battery life.  The large numbers are great and the phone is very cool looking.  I haven't seen a phone out their similar to this one at this price.  I highly recommend this phone.
This phone has a great color screen, good sounds and animated screen savers.  But, the battery life is only about 1 day without making any calls.  The screen backlight and keypad lights stay on for a long time even with power saving mode turned on.  I wouldn't recommend this phone to someone who doesn't want to have to charge the phone once or twice a day.
Okay well, I know im only a kid and all, but still I think I can give a pretty darn good review. Well, it all started when I laid my eyes on the Net10 C139. Well, I ordered it [from Amazon, provided by Target] and well, I heard about it and thought it was nice..and all. So then it was gonna come to me on my Birthday well a bit after [exactly Aug.31.] and the day before I checked. Well, guess what? They told me it would come on September 27, then In October 30, so I decided automatically to cancel it. I went to radio shack, and well my mom showed me the Oystr, and I didnt like it much. Still, I bought it and I really like it.Its very durable, dropped it once not even a dent, and no scratches. I like the color because it does not get too sloppy, and the paint does not chip off. Its hard stuff, and the numbers are easy to press.It has great features. Voice dialing when you say a phone number, calculator, tip calculator, voice memo, and other nice stuff. The design is pretty unique, it does not have a camara, but still, years ago there was not camara, and I would not use it much so it does not matter, plus its a nice economical telephone. I mean you can actually go on this internet thingy and download wallpapers, 'tones, and games [even more!].The reception is really sweet. I live around the mountains and it sounds perfectly. Reaching the people of the virgin mobile company was a bit hard, I waited 10 minutes to reach someone. Still, they are nice people and they are easy to understand. Nice thing was that reaching them was free.Overall, it was really nice. Nice design, but it has its pros and cons. I didnt want to write a lengthy review, but well hopefully it helps a bit. Since I have only had it for a day, cant say much but please look foward to updates!-Lydia
I just purchased the Kyocera Oystr today. Everything seemed to be wonderful until I downloaded two 'superphonic' ringtones for my new phone ('Snow' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 'Plush' by STP). The sound quality of these ringtones is horrible. I previously used the Audiovox 'Vox' 8610, and the exact same ringtones on the Vox sounded great. However, on the Oystr, the ringtones sound very fuzzy and garbled. On my old 'Vox' these ringtones are crystal clear. I now want to switch back to my old 8610, but I am having trouble doing so online. I only hope that I will be able to get my money back from the Oystr. The Vox may not have many special features, capabilities, or extras, but at least my ringtones sound crystal clear.
First of all, pink just makes a Mamalinde happy.  After spending WAY too much time on the phone with Cingular in a long and drawn out "upgrade" request and after being promised the phone twice and having it not shipped as promised, I had about reached the point of switching carriers and stopping the torture.  But, I finally got my phancy pink phone and it was worth the wait.  Where to start?  How about with one thing at a time, which is how I managed the learning curve on this pheature laden phoneAddress Book:  It is huge.  And ... I was able to move the card from my nokia so I did not have to rebuild my address book, and I absolutely love the one button, voice call feature, though there is a limit to how many names can be loaded in.  The button is conveniently located on the right side of the phone, just say the pre-recorded name clearly and that number will be dialed for you automatically.  I use this a LOT.  Recording the name took a bit of practice, but gets much easier.iTunes:  I selected this phone not just because of the color, but primarily because of the built-in iPod.  I am a daily bus rider it seemed to make more sense than the cumbersome CD player that required batteries once a week and the awkward changing of disks - not to mention a LOT more space in my purse.  The download was really pretty easy, but I had been using iTunes on home computer for some time so I had a familiarity with the program.  Sounds as good as the CD player ever did, and the shuffle songs feature gives a nice variety of about 100 songs - way nicer than the CD player.  A phone call will interrupt the play, but then the music will go right back to where it was.  I can also listen to tunes without using the headphones, which I find handy on my morning bike rides.  The speaker is just loud enough but I can still hear traffic and I'm not being too noisy.  The model phone I have will not allow you to take an iTune song and make it a ringtone.Camera/Videocam:  I did not expect to use this feature very much but it has come in quite handy.  Setting it up to be able to e-mail the pictures/videos was a real hassle and there is a charge (but Cingular is patient and persistent), but using the cameras is very easy.  Actually my 9 and 10 year old nieces have taught me everything I could possibly need to know, and have a delightful time making 20 second videos (see mamalinde on youtube for some delightful examples of their genius).  Easy to make a picture into a screensaver too, right now it is a pink peony.Mobile e-mail.  This feature is a good one to have, but a bit cumbersome and slow.  It took over an hour on the phone with Cingular to get this set up but we finally got there.  I get a notification beep everytime I get an e-mail, which is a bit distracting even with a good junk philter on that address.  And the attachments, links don't work on the phone.  It is nice to be able to confirm that an e-mail arrived or to check what may be stacking up when you can't get to a computer.Text messaging.  Okay, get past it.  Not just for teens and young folks, if this gramma to text message, so can you.  Besides better manners than talking it offers a bit more privacy when riding the bus or out in a crowd, and sometimes a reminder in writing is much more effective and can be stored if referring back is necessary.  If your kiddo can't talk right now, you can STILL communicate with them!  The Quick Note feature, where you can store repetitious messages (check e-mail, thank you, ok, call me, where are you, yes and no), this is very very handy and quick.  And sending and receiving sweet nothings with the phella, well, that will keep you young.Ringing/Vibrating.  Using this feature is easy.  Just the up and down sound buttons on the upper left portion of the phone will move you from ringing volumes to vibrate (or silent).IM.  I haven't used this yet.  Hmmm.  Maybe it will be next?Internet.  This can be customized to your demands, mine gives me local weather and news.  I find it hard to search for something specific, but it is very handy to have access to news stories or the weather radar.  Maybe I should play with this a bit more?In sum I have used this phone for several months now and find it quite worthy of a Princess like me.  It has also been dropped a couple of times onto cement, with no harmful effect except for some scratches on the pink paint.  The petite size is phenomenal, especially considering all the pheatures and it's a showstopper too.  Everyone who sees it wants one!
The texturized buttons don't bother me; in fact, they seem to keep my fingers from slipping when I dial. The color is great (getting lots of compliments). Lots of storage for numbers. The camera feature takes clear pics for a cell phone. It has an alarm clock in the tools section, which I like to use when I am away from home. The battery standby time is really long. Several days go by before I need to recharge. This is my first phone with bluetooth; it's easy to use, but it takes some getting used to. The phone has speaker too. I am getting great reception and others tell me that I sound more clear than my old phone. The phone is easy to navigate; you can even program the buttons to have the function you want if the preprogrammed ones don't feel natural to you. The music capability is convenient, the phone came with the appropriate cable to hook up to the computer to download the songs. The screen does get smudgy, but it is very colorful and clear.
First off this is my first review for an item off of Amazon because I felt like the truth needed to be told.I really really really want to give this phone 5 stars, but I can't.  I give it a 3 and that is mostly for its looks.Pros:-Beautful pink metal finish-Built well-Screen is very clear-Itunes works greatCons--The phone's antenna must not be very strong since I keep getting dropped calls, while my husband's brand new Sony w300i has not dropped any calls.  This is my main complaint about the phone.  I drove down two roads today and lost my phone call 3 times.  I had my husband call me when he was driving the same two roads and he didn't even experience interference.  This phone might be great where there are strong signals all the time, but not for the areas with less than 4 bars.-The volume on this phone is lousy!  I can't even hear it ring when I am in another room, so I have missed quite a few calls.-Speakerphone is a joke! In the car, I have to hold it near my ear to hear it at a comfortable volume.  It is okay in a quiet room but I would still like it louder.-Buttons are admittedly awkward even with my tiny fingersIn conclusion,  if you want a phone that is pink, looks great, and plays itunes then this is the phone for you.  If you want a phone that picks up signals well and has a decent call/ring/speakerphone volume, this is not the phone for you. My last LG phone was better than this one and that just isn't right.So now I hope to exchange it, ugh.  I really will miss the pink but I need a reliable phone.
This phone does everything it says it does just fine, but I cannot stand it for one reason--THE BUTTONS. THEY DRIVE ME POSITIVELY  INSANE. The "brushed steel" thing is horrible, it feels like pushing on sandpaper. The buttons are not raised at all, in fact they are RECESSED into the phone! Everything about them is horrible. I hate pushing buttons, and that is the main function of the phone! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OFF THE INTERNET!! Go into a store and look at it and push the buttons before you buy it!!!!!!! If you don't, you will probably reallllly regret it. Trust me on this, I would've loved the phone but for the buttons :(! And they are a big deal!
If you are looking for an mp3 player and don't plan on talking on your phone much, then you may want to check out the SLVR. For the rest of you who like to use your phone TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE, I recommend buying a different phone. I am constantly having to say "what?" "huh?" "can you repeat that?" because of the totally digitized and fuzzy voice quality of this phone.If that's not enough, the functionality is unintuitive. You have to press 5 buttons to dial the previously missed call. 8 buttons to get to voicemail. What?Then of course, other functions are TOO easy to get to. Like firing up the web browser. Yeah, that's one touch and it's easy to accidentally press that button. Of course if you do, you get charged like 20 cents a second - a costly mistake that adds up.But if that's not enough, you can't add information to an address entry without starting over and creating a new contact. It's insane. But if you want to add another phone number, unique ring tone, etc.....well, you can't because you there is no "save" option for the SIM card when you're editing. I bet several of my friends they couldn't save a ringtone to their name. No one could (and these are people who are tech-savvy and all work in the tech industry). This is ridiculous.If I were the president of Motorola, I'd promptly fire the people who were in charge of this last piece of functionality. Embarrassing.Addendum on Jan 14, 2006: Today, I took a picture using this phone and the camera froze and NO buttons work - not even the off button. Now, I'm waiting the four hours for the battery to die (4 hr battery life - one of the few good things about this phone) so that the software can reset. In the meantime, when people call my phone, the message is "The person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls at this time". And so there's no way to even leave a message. Four hours and counting....
I got this phone when I renewed my Cingular service about three months ago.  All I've ever wanted is a simple-to-use, reliable, SMALL phone that I could easily carry around.  I have no use for internet features, IM/texting or a camera in a phone... which is probably a good thing as far as this review goes.Cons:1.) The camera is grainy and extremely limited in function.  If you snap alot of pics with your phone, this isn't the one for you.2.)  My first battery wouldn't hold a charge for even one day.  The second one lasts much longer, but still not as long as advertised on the box.3.)  My phone came pre-loaded with only melody and sound effect ringtones, no "regular" tones that sounded like a phone ringing.4.)  I gave up waiting on the internet to log on, so I can't even comment on it's functionality.Pros:1.)  It's freaking tiny.  As a guy who likes to carry his phone in a pocket rather than in a belt holster, this phone is the perfect size.  I hardly even know it's there.2.)  Signal strength is great.  I have no problem hearing calls, nor does anyone have a problem hearing me.3.)  The interface is really really easy to navigate though you'll have some problems if you got big fingers.So all in all, I'm satisfied with the Pantech C300 because it does the very basic things I need from a cellphone very well, in a very small package.  All the other features are a bit lacking in my opinion and that is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.
I originally returned this phone because I thought it didn't meet my criteria for contact info (more than one phone number, e-mail addresses, notes), but I was wrong. In fact it can store 800 contacts with 3 phone numbers, 2 e-mail addresses, notes and other stuff (the SIM card holds an add'l 250 contacts). So I returned my Nokia 6102i (which was too slow in performance for me) and went back to this phone.Cool features:I love the flash with the camera which you can also use as a flashlight (press the down arrow on the outer left side while the phone is closed).  The up arrow pressed down firmly for a few seconds triggers the camera. One button gets you to your contacts, another button directly to the calendar. The navigation performance is FAST! With the Nokia 6102i, there was a delay in navigating. The vibrate mode (which I use) is powerful. The multimedia messaging performance is pretty good. Sending an image to my email took just a couple seconds. Other cool features are a unit converter and world time.This is the perfect phone to carry around your waist even while jogging. I found a lot of the other flip phones out there were too heavy, bulky, long, or wide.The only drawback for me is how long it takes to turn off and on. It takes 10-12 sec to power on and 20-30 sec to power off. Other than this, I love this phone.
If you want a phone that does a lot, don't get this one.  When I was shopping for a new phone I wanted one that was small, loud, and vibrated strongly.  I had a hard time hearing my old phone (a Samsung x427m) ring or feeling it vibrate in my purse.  I wasn't looking for a phone that did a lot or had bluetooth.  If you have the same requirements for a cell phone as I do, then this phone is a great option.  It's small, it's loud, and it vibrates off the table.Pros:~very small, light, thin~loud~strong vibration~camera (I wasn't looking for a cameraphone, but I like it now that I have it...just don't expect to use it as you would a real camera)~outside screen~you can use the flash as a flashlight...and it's brightCons:~sometimes people tell me they have a hard time hearing me...I find myself having to talk louder than I used to have to on a cell phone~the buttons are small...i often hit 2 at once or the wrong one when texting (not a problem i've had before with other phones)
I have only had the phone for a few months but it seems durable enough to last a long time.I am disappointed that you can't put the phone on speaker phone while you are calling someone and it is ringing. You have press two buttons to put the phone on speaker phone and if you have dialed any numbers during the call you have to clear them out and then press two buttons to put it on speaker phone.  If you don't clear out the numbers it flashes over and tries to dial the numbers on the other line.My other big grip with this phone is that it doesn't delete old text messages when new ones come in.  Instead it says your inbox(or outbox) is full and you have to delete the oldest messages one by one or you can delete all messages.  There is no setting to have it automatically delete old messages and that is a pain.I like to color screen on the outside on the phone so you can see who is calling and that you can set personal ringtones for each caller.  You can also assign a picture to a caller.  The only problem is that it can't be a picture that someone sent you from there phone, it has to be one that you took on the camera.  This is very strange since they are both jpg's and both taken on camera phones.  Pictures that are sent to you are stored in a different place than pictures that you take with the camera phone.  They should be stored in the same place.  Conversely you can set the wallpaper background picture to either type of picture.Ringtones and Games - The ringtones that come on the phone suck.  I know this is because they want you to buy rinetones but they should at least have one ringtone that sounds like something ringing.  The phone only came with one game, again because they want you to buy them.I have used the wireless web to read news and sports scores and it works fine.  You have to scroll allot because of the size of the screen but that's ok if you want a small phone.No bluetooth but I'm not a fan of looking like a cyborg any way.The small size of the phone is one of it's best selling points but it should be pointed out that the small keys make it a little more difficult when sending text messages.  If you send more than 2 text messages a day you should consider getting a different phone.  The keys need to be more like the old Motorola Vader.Even with all the things I would change about this phone I still recommend it over the competition.  I hope the designers work out the kinks in the next model and I will buy it again.Here's a Tip/Trick about the phone: Hold down on the external down button to turn on the camera flash and use the phone as a flashlight.
Perfect if you just need to carry a small basic phone.  Not recommended for folks looking for lots of bells & whistles.Call volume and range is good, especially given the small size.Camera image quality is ok for web photos (VGA 640x480), but this wouldn't be the phone for you if you need to make prints from your photos.  It also doesn't take video (surprised).  No memory expansion slot (mini SD or otherwise).The biggest con was the lack of blue tooth support.  If you need to use a headphone you'll need one with wires (argh!).  If your state has a law on requiring you to drive hands free then this might not be the right phone for you.We bought this as a pre-pay Cingular phone plan but were able to get Cingular to unlock it to allow us to use our old ATT SIM in it.
I got this phone for Christmas. My Nanoo (grandmother) "helped" Santa Claus get this for me. I'm only 11 and my parents aren't too sure about my having a cell phone, but Nanoo pays my bill. Anyway, back to the phone. I really love the size and the camera is great and I LOVE the flash. I love the fact that is has picture ID. It takes a little while to turn it on but not as long to turn it off. The reception is great and the volume is just perfect. I'm a girl and the ringtone (Totally Together) totally matches my personality. In fact, the ringtones are great. Sometimes,like when I'm typing in contacts, I'm trying to hit H and it looks like this: .g  It takes a little getting used to the "back" button, (the "on" button) but otherwise it's great. Oh, I love the call waiting, especially the way it lists who your talking to. It's a little confusing at first, but you get used to it. This is just an allover great phone.
I am 16 years old and I find this phone to be really cool. It is extremely small and anyone can lose this phone if they do not keep it with them at all times. I would advise anyone to buy a carrying case. When I am using this phone, I get numerous comments about the size. To anyone who is buying this phone I would say, "GO FOR IT!".
This is a really great, basic phone.  That's not to say that it doesn't have cool features, like texting, games, graphics, a camera, and besides that- IT'S REALLY CUTE!!!  What more do you really need in a phone?  I am enjoying this phone so far, and I prefer it over the moto razr.
I waited 4 weeks for my wireless service to bring in this phone. Because I'm not a person who cares for all the extra features this is the perfect phone. For those who need something small and sleek this design could not be better.Even my daughter loves the smallness and design. This phone has a flash which can be used as a flash light if needed. Lots of extra features which I dont even use. Was worth waiting for and the price was right.
I love its size and sound quality but if you are big on pictures on your phone you will be disapointed by the low picture quality. I`ll be honest the picture part stinks big time but I still love my phone!
I am 12 years old. I bought this phone, because our old contracts expired or whatever it's called. I personally think that this phone is great! I bring it everywhere with me. It fits in all of my pockets, even my tiny ones! The camera is OK considering how small the phone is! My friends think this phone is so awesome. This phone has great features too! One of the features is that it has a built in flashlight. It is kinda dim, but considering the size of the phone, it is very bright!
I LOVE this phone. I got the Razr and didn't like it. . . so I was frustrated and like "just let me buy that little phone" while speaking to cingular. WELL, This is such a rad weird phone. The graphics are so fun and almost . . . french weird or something, there is a Clown that pops up when you want to take a picture. The online stuff works perfect, texting, downloading games, tones, etc. I love this phone. It's like super "japan" cute animation phone for the kid at heart. . . and I'm sure any teen would like it. I lOVE IT. It's my favorite I've ever had, granted I am very young at heartt. ;) It is a lil power house.
So its time to basically upgrade my service plan and so I decide to splurge on a nice phone without paying anything near 200. I saw the "worlds smallest cameraphone" at a decent price $90 and decide that its right for me, especially since it would be my first camera phone. I take it home, after 1 day, I am completely dissatisfied with the phone. Here's why:1) The camera quality is disheartening, something I should've expected when buying a VGA camera, although I've seen MUCH nicer quality VGA cameras.2)The flash is incredibly weak. It basically defeats the purpose of having a flash. At night time, it literally wont have any kind of effect unless your subject is less than a foot away.3)The entire set up of the phone and its features are weak and severely lacking. I understand that its the "worlds smallest camera phone" but nonetheless I expect more features than a Firefly.On the 2nd day, I went ahead and returned it and got the Nokia 6030.
Too good to be true?  Yep!  You CANNOT port another number to this service contract and if you change your service in any way, they will stick you with a $250 charge.  If you don't care what phone # they give you, then go for it.  If you are just trying to save a few bucks, don't bother.  Time is more valuable than getting this mess straight!
I've had this phone for about 3 days now. I got it to replace my old Samsung A530. Here are my thoughts:PROS:-very light, compact, and small-black glossy exterior looks professional and classy. yes, it does show fingerprints and scratches, but it's not that bad-dual OLED screens are vibrant and sharp. the inner screen is smaller than most other phones, but i haven't found this to be much of a problem-reception is great. haven't had a dropped call yet. for some reason i rarely get more than 2 bars of reception while indoors, but this doesn't seem to affect call quality-ringer is loud with a nice selection of built-in ringtones-earpiece and speakerphone is clear with adequate volume-battery life is amazing. i've had light-moderate use for the past 3 days and the battery indicator is still full!!!CONS:-both screens are very hard to see in bright sunlight, even on highest brightness setting-no bluetooth, SD memory, MP3 player, etc. but these aren't important to me. i just need a slim phone that doesn't have a lot of extra bulk.-camera could be better, but it's a phone people, not a canon powershot!Overall, I'm very happy with this phone and I'll be glad to own it for 2 years. If you need a nice compact phone that performs well, this is for you. I haven't had any problem transferring the phone book. You just have to take it to a "flagship" store where they have the right computer to do it. I took it to a Verizon branch first, and they had a different machine that transferred only the numbers and not the names.Give this phone a try. It's no Motorola KRZR, but it's much cheaper. You'll be happy with it!
Have had this phone for 36 hours (9/25/06)and am being told by Verizon I have to delete all 150+ of my stored numbers and start from scratch (I had an LG 7000 series which I never liked).  Seems there is a software issue and there is no data on when it will be resolved. Phone makes a call from phone book but does not complete the call when your intended answers the phone.  Speakerphone calling seems to negate this defect and if you press the speaker button when the person answers, it seems to work.  Pressing it twice did get the phone to work but not the headset.  Blue tooth headset (Moto H500)paired easily only it did'nt work through the speaker option I may have discovered. Looks like a nice phone, light, easy to use but decision is, is this worth the extra steps, reliable enough to function normally and then left to guess when the software fix is available and just "stop-in to Verizon"? Surely they aren't going to tell me when it's ready. Probably worth it to wait to buy this phone or choose another if you have tons of numbers to enter.  Verizon should have known this, but I'm sure it's a great first time phone or if you don't have lots of numbers to transfer over.
Well I decided that I liked the Nokia brand well enough to try their flip phone.  However word has it this is not a true Nokia phone but Pan-tech.  I haven't received it yet but my research shows that you also can NOT use the PC Suite software Nokia has for most of their phones.  Aaargh.  I do not want to re-enter all my phone numbers.  Most likely this is because the phone is a Pan-tech.  I likely won't keep it because of that but will update to let you know if it seems flimsy or not.Okay.  I tried it out.  The phone didn't feel flimsy and it has a nice battery compartment where the battery is attached to the door.  The drawback was the speaker.  It sounded very tinny with the Nokia phone tune.  I liked it but I wasn't impressed.  The 6236i is great.  The sound the feel.  I'm happy I switched the phones.
Bought this phone yesterday (not from Amazon).Amazing little device with a lot of innovative features. For example, the phone notifies the user of failure to connect to a WiFi network by crashing and rebooting. A dialog box pops up after the reboot to tell me that the phone restarted to "improve performance." Same thing happened when I tried to scan in a friend's business card, tried to fetch my email, take a photo, sync by bluetooth... the list continues. In fact, in just one day the phone restarted itself to 'improve performance' so many times, the performance must be getting really great by now.Maybe a firmware update will help? Downloaded the Sony Ericsson Update Service (2.6.4.9). Ran it on my XP box at work - once installed, it played a Sony Ericsson eyecatch animation, then crashed with a 'java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException', but at least it kept planing the eyecatch over and over. Ahhhh. Tried it on my XP box at home - this time the installer came up with an empty window which stayed empty. No luck there. Finally tried it on an old Windows 200 laptop - this time it worked, recognised the phone, downloaded about 150M of something from the internet, pretended to flash the phone with new firmware. The result - same firmware, and more 'improving performance' messages.The bottom line is - it is a very promising device. The hardware is good, the software is not even a public beta quality - proof of concept prototype at best. Not ready for public consumption in any shape or form. This seems to be a trend among smartphone manufacturers - release the product once the hardware is finished, promise to finish the software in new firmware releases, stop releasing firmware updates as a superseding model is in the works - leaving the consumer with a kind of working device. Sort of. Sometimes.
I've had this phone two weeks.  A few times, when just going through the menus, I've gotten the "blank" screen mentioned previously and wondered "what happened.".So far, I don't think reception with Cingular is quite as good as I was gettng with the Razr.Putting it in or out of my horizontal belt case opens the camara lens twist door on the back of the unit.  This in turn, for some reason, deactivates the "keys locked" feature which is a pain because when closed, the flip open keyboard sticks out from the rest of the phone and the slightest bump starts things happening.FM radio will only function with wired headphones as it needs the wire for an antenna.On Razr, during a call I could push a button to activate speaker phone.  On this phone you must go into a menu during the call and select the appropriate two options.  This seems to be a step backward in functionality.  Sony support confirmed there is no other way.I like the way the software handles contacts, calendar tasks and all other data entry.  Easy to input and access data in a variety of useful ways.For me, the size and weight of this phone is perfect as before I could not accept carrying around the Palm and Blackberry sized units.Ranking high on the list of reasons I made the move was the Wi-Fi capability.  I haven't tried this yet as my router is on order.  If it works, it will be very useful for me.Bottom line, all the phones I've had before have had inconveniences to get used to.  The Sony P990i is no different, but I don't see any show stoppers.I'm glad I made the purchase.  Biggest advantage is total functionality in a good looking "regular" sized phone.  (No question, it is a looker)UPDATE, October 31:  I take everything negative back.  In the last four weeks I've learned more about how to use the phone and have to say it is awesome.  No complaints.
I love this phone. I've wanted a p-series phone for like 4 years now and once i got enough money, i bought it from amazon. Before buying it, i read all the negative and positive reviews about it on this and like 10 other websited. i made myself research for like a month on the phone because i dont just want to waist 600+ dollars on a phone that turns out like crap. But i went for it anyways and it turned out great. It is very easy to use for a pda. Before this i had a sidekick 3. After the sk3 i bought a t-mobile mda, but returned it because it was too confusing. That was my biggest fear buying the p990, but it proved me wrong. I also have NOT been experiencing and random shut-downs or long wait times. It's actually alot faster than my sk3! The screen resoulution is outstanding for a touch screen. the camera is awsome and i love that it doubles as a flash light. The buisness card reader ACTUALLY WORKS! I tested it with a buisness card with a website, e-mail, phone, name, and company name and the damn thing read everything and saved it in the phone book flawlessly. Wi-fi  works great too. I connected to my Hotspots account and the phone performed great. 3G is kinda usless for me right now scince t-mobile dosent offer 3g, BUT! i just read that t-mobile just signed an FCC contract to roll out a 3G network in 07!!! So the video phone with soon come very handy. Overall, its the best phone ive had yet. Great look, intuitivness, and sound quality. It truly is THEE PDA Killer.
After the first day, I was frustrated with the phone (software problems, connectivity) until I updated the software and found further menu's and how-to's. Now it's perfect. I recommend the phone for people who likes gadgets, pda phones, smartphones, etc, but if you're not into that, this phone can get very complicated to use.I havent had problems with rebooting or program crashing so far, unlike some other customers. If you want a hi-tech phone, I recommend getting this.
I bought this item from Amazon when it first listed for $649.99, and after reaading all the negative reviews.I have been using iMate for the past 3 years, and wanted something similar but something that looks like a normal phone. The P990 is just that. All the power of the PDA with a great phone, MP3 player, FM Radio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G, good camera, and if you load the correct software, it makes coffee for you.I have faced some problems mentioned in the other reviews, and the phone has rebooted couple of times. But then again, I am a Windows user :)I connected the phone to my laptop and it synched all my outlook (calendar, contacts, email). The FM radio is great, and the MP3 player is as good as my iPod - and ever since buying this, I find myself listening to lots of music - something that I never did with my iPod, simply because it is there!.I put in a 2 GB memory stick and there is plenty of space there for photos, music and other stuff.If they had released it with a more stable firmware, it would have got 5/5.
I'm a gadget addict, had to have this phone because , on the paper, it's the best phone/pda/younameit that was ever made. Now the TRUTH: This device is full of bugs, it's ssssssslllloooww, it freezes, it's bad news. I had to return mine ( did not buy from amazon). Do your own research and see what people say.Shame on S.E. for releasing this. Like many, I was waiting for over a year for the P990. As I said , love gadgets.JT
Make sure once you get it you download the latest firmware. New Symbian OS is slow. Camera is very good, and the WiFi ROCKS! Excellent wifi reception range. Better than my HP iPaq. So it replaces a lot of gadgets. Outlook sync works fine. Boot time is eternal, but overall a very good next gen phone. Mac users will have to wait for isync to catch up in Leopard to be able to sync with it.
This phone is amazing, the amount of things it can do,The camera is Wicked,the WLAN works amazing, everything is great, the only complaint i have is the slow OS, it is noticably slow from say the p900, but they tried to fit soo much into it, i can understand why. still a great phone and id reccomend it
I've had the phone for a week now. Did quite a bit of research before I bought it. Read all about the bugs and stuff. But I just had to try it out myself. And am I glad that I did! It's been working great for me.The phone came loaded with the latest firmware updates, so I've found no bugs so far. The OS is nice and smooth. The features are quite easy to learn, considering that this was my first smart phone/PDA. The interface is quite user-friendly and visually appealing. It's got lots of cool features, many listed out in this website. Some came as a pleasant surprise, for example, you can transfer your information from you old cell phone using bluetooth! While I was typing this review, a colleague walked into my room and wanted to check out the business card scanner feature. I tried it out for the first time, and the both of us were blown away! :)The basic phone functions are very good as well. My callers said that they could hear me more clearly than on my old Nokia. Speakers seem good for voice calls, havent tested out for music yet.The only major challenge I faced was in installing an email utility. I struggled with Blackberry Connect for a day. Installed it, but could not get it to work. Finally, I installed the Exchange ActiveSync that came free with the phone, and it's been working great.I called SE customer service a couple of times. They took the calls promptly and seemed eager to help, but they had to lookup manuals for every question I had. I was bummed that they could not help me with the Blackberry Connect problems. That's why I'm giving this phone four stars instead of a five.Overall, it's a great phone/PDA and a cool toy!!
Got this phone after a series of combinations of phones, pdas and phone / pda combos tried and tested over the period of past couple of years.  (O2 Xda II, I-mate Jam, Nokia N90, Nokia N80 - just to name a few).  As I had read the reviews stating software problems and bugs the first thing that I did was to load the SE PC software in my computer and then hooked up the phone for a software upgrade. The process takes a bit of time but its pretty automated and even someone with basic computing / IT skills can do it easily.  I have used the phone now for over a month after updating the software and have tried out each and everything, like working with multiple applications at a time, playing games while taking calls and so and so forth.  There have been not lags, no crashes, no restarts! Its working great.Everyone knows about the features this baby has.  For me screen crispness and resolution is also very important.  My last gadget was SE K800i.  Although the screen sharpness of P990 does NOT match up with K800i but it is not far behind as well.In my opinion, P990i is the best phone / PDA combo on the market right now.  Very neatly designed (like its predecessors) for heavy phone / SMS users and for serious PDA users as well.Very well balanced, extremely feature rich, good form factor, nice screen, great connectivity options (WiFi, Bluetooth etc).  If you are out for a combination device, look no further.
I have been using it now for 5 days and I can not believe that Sony Ericsson would release a device that does not work. The phone crashes pretty much every time you try to get connect to the data network (forget about using WiFi throught more than 4 web pages). And yes I do have the latest versio of the software.It takes more than 1 minute to boot this thing up. All applications load with a good 1-2 seconds delay, actually the software on this device is amasingly slow. It is very hard to switch to a speakerphone during a phone call. Email software is really slow and hard to use. It takes 2-3 clicks to tell your email program to go download new messages. Good luck trying to make ActiveSync work - please tell me how if you ever succeed. It does not run Good Technology or a Blackberry software so if you want realtime access to your email - you won't get it.I am not sure who the target market for a device like this is and still quite shocked that Sony Ericsson would release something that is this bad.
i change my phone every 2 month so i ve tried a lot of phones and this is by far one of the worst. it freezes.. restarts for no reason.. applications crashes.. and when you call a computer service line.. e.g. when you call customer service and you have to choose different options.. the phone doesnt register that the line is connected and on the screen is just says dialing and it wouldnt let you choose any options..
I've had the 6945 for about two weeks now.  So far it is performing very well.  Setting up the email took a while to figure out.  If you are like me, you hate all the clutter and useless software pre-installed on these devices, so it took me a while to clean up the view.I don't use the Outlook Sync function, but it looks like it works well.  The auto-sync function is something to be aware of.  The first time I did auto-sync it wiped-out my contact list on my PC and replaced with the few contacts on my sim card.  Luckily it only deleted the contacts to my outlook delete folder so it was easy to restore.  Here are some PROs and CONs after about two weeks of use:PRO:1) Wifi or Cingular GPRS email works well.  You will have to set up two different accounts - one for your Wifi and another for when you are using GPRS, but that is easy to do. The reason you should do this is so that when you are on Wifi you can send via the Wifi server instead of the Cingular GPRS wireless network.  I have set up both a work and personal home email account (both POP3).  Looks like this device can handle several more email accounts if necessary.2) Internet explorer works very well.  This is not a lame mobile web browser that strips down sites.  It is the real deal.  Websites look just like they do on your PC or laptop - only smaller.  You can customize the view pretty easily.  Favorites folder is easy to set up and the address bar is easy to use.3) The screen is very nice.  I find myself using both the built in keyboard and the on screen touch pad.  Both work very well.  Resolution is very good.4) WM-5 is very nice.  I've used the Work and Excel programs so far.  They are essentially the same as on your PC.  Why anyone would want to use an iPaq to edit a DOC or XLS file is beyond me, but if you need to do this you can.  I have not had a chance to use the Powerpoint viewer yet, but I'm sure it works as well as Word and Excel.5) I purchased a 1GB mini-SD storage card.  That is very easy to pop in and out.6) You can use MP3s or WMA files as your ring tone - that's pretty cool.7) The device is very solid.  Not as big as you would think.  Fits well in your pocket or on a belt clip.  Looks like it will hold up well.  The pen locks in the side and is also pretty solid.  Not like the Treo, which I've heard is very fragile.8) And now for the Phone - It works very well!  I was surprised because most people complain about the phone quality on these devices.  I find the sound quality to be as good as my RAZR.  The Cingular Sim-Card can be swapped in and out between my RAZR and iPaq, so if I am going to a sporting event or bar I and dont want to bring the iPaq I can just swap the sim-card right back into the RAZR and it works.  I had to call Cingular and get them to change my phone to the iPaq.  This was purely for data.9)YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE THE "Treo Package".  Don't let Cingular sell you that extra crap.  I simply added the MediaNet200 package for $19.99 which gives you unlimited Media + 200 text messages a month.  That is plenty of text messages and the unlimited data gives you all the web surfing and emailing you can do!10) GPS navigation is pretty neat little function.  You have to download the maps from Microsoft Pocket Streets, but they are free.  The GPS sucks battery life like crazy, but if you are on the road in a strange city this can be very helpful.11) Windows Media player works just like your PC.  I added about 750mb of music, so the device is actually an MP3 player as well.  It has an external speak or you can stick in headphones (be aware, using the media player sucks battery life).CONS:1) I'd say the biggest con is the battery life.  If you are on just GPRS/Phone with stand by (no talking, emailing or surfing) it will probably last about 2 days.  However, using the phone or emailing cuts that down to about only 12-14 hours.  If you set up the WiFi as well as have the phone on, your battery life is about 8-10 hours.  If you also have the GPS and Bluetooth on, I'd say 5-6 hours.  My advice is to not use the GPS or Bluetooth unless you really need them.  And, if you are going to be on WiFi, leave the device in the craddle.  The USB charging is very slow but the AC adapeter chargest the device to full in about 2 hours.  YOU CAN PURCHASE A BIGGER BATTERY - and you probably should.2) Cingular does not support the 6945.  You will have to tell them you have the 6925.  I called HP - they are identical except that the 6925 is Cingular only and the 6945 is unlocked for T-Mobile as well.  Obviously Cingular wants you to buy the 6925 instead, but the 6945 is the same.  If you call Cingular for support, just tell them you have a 6925 to avoid even having to explain things to them.3) The ring volume is not that loud.  But, it does have vibrate.4) Do not buy the leather case that Amazon sells with the device for like $[...].  The device comes with a belt clip that works just fine.  If you want something nicer, go buy it in person....All in all this is an excellent device.  I use to carry a cell phone and my laptop on the road - now all I need is this.  Again, you can swap your sim-card in and out, so keep your old cell phone for times when you don't want to carry around the iPaq.I only gave it 4 stars because of the battery life.  That can be fixed by purchasing the more powerful battery, but that will cost you extra.  Also, the device is pretty expensive relative to the Treo or Q or Blackberry.  None of those devices have WiFi though.
I bought this phone after dealing with the new SideKick 3 from Tmobile.  As much as I enjoyed using the SK3, it was a huge brick to talk with and the camera was horrible and they did not improve the screen.  Hence I got this new phone and can still take ten times better pictures with it.  Same megapixels but the sensor in it is higher quality and the screen is very crisp and bright.  Emailing pictures is as easy on the SK3 and the overall quality is amazing.  Signal range is great too, no dropped calls.  Charges very fast!
This phone has the features that any good phone should have. It weighs 2.8 ounces and even with the battery installed it feels extremely light. Though it is very small in size, the keys are not tiny. The keys are arranged and  spaced fine. When closed, this phone has volume up and down key and a camera key accessible on the outside. It has a nice dark grey body with a shiny black background for its screen and camera on the outside. When closed, you can turn on the camera using the button outside and take a portrait picture of yourself. Following are the Good and Bad points about this phone.The Goods-Very light (2.8 ounces), slim and small (3.9 x 2.0 x0.6 inches). Not too small either. Has a sleek finish.-Quad band (850 MHz;900 MHz;1800 MHz;1900 MHz) International Phone-Bluetooth wireless-Sound quality, clarity and reception is really good.-MP3 player that supports MP3, WMA, and ACC formats.-1.3 MP Zoom Camera with video recorderYou can use video recorder in two modes. Default mode records clips upto maximum of 10 sec so that you can e-mail them instantly. If you use second mode you can record clips longer than 10 sec but of course limited to the  memory available in this phone (max 21MB). You can choose to record video in different formats. You can also choose to save picture in different resolutions. Camera and video quality is really decent.-Zoom voice feature. I really liked this feature as in noisy environment or in a place where your phone is not so close to the actual speaker, you can turn on this feature and the phone's mic acts a lot more sensitive and you can hear the speaker very clearly even if speaker is situated farther.-Picture messaging-Voice Notes-Voice activated SPEAKER INDEPENDENT dialing.This phone has a voice recognition software that attempts to recognize the name of the person you want to call and then connects to that person. When the phone is closed you can use multi purpose button on the headset by keeping the button pressed for more than 2 sec the voice recognition software activates then you can give any phone command or calling command to call anyone from your contacts.-Speakerphone on this phone is loud enough.-Sends and receives instant messages with Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, or ICQ-Software interface in this phone responds pretty quick. There is a grouping feature using which you can group your contacts and assign a particular ringtone to a group.-Phone is High Speed EDGE data transfer capable. I did not use this feature so far.-SAR (Radiation rating) is nice it is 1.07 when close to ear and 0.9 when you wear it on body-Phone book on the phone can hold generous 1000 contacts with 5 numbers for each.-T-Mobile MyFaves capableThe Bads-After using this phone for a while I thought of adding this point: This phone has a camera button on the right hand side. There is no lock for this button. So it is very easy to accidently press this button. Sometimes you do not realize and the camera could be on for several minutes eating away the battery life.-Just 21 MB of internal memory. Samsung could have been more generous for this quality of phone.-No memory slot. Personally I don't need memory slot as I use my iPod for music and other data that I want to store. However considering the fact that most other hi-tech phones of this quality do come with memory slot, Samsung could have provided one for this phone.-Phone displays date-time, signal and battery strength on the outside but only for few seconds and then the screen goes blank to save energy. If you are used to seeing the time on the front LCD this phone does not provide the time on the outside unless you press volume key for more than 2 sec. That is if you keep outside volume key pressed for 2 sec the outside LCD shows the time etc again for few sec and then goes blank.Overall in my opinion this phone has really useful features that any good phone should have. I was not big on the points (Bads) this phone lacked in. If you are looking for affordable, small, very light, quad band, bluetooth phone with camera+video+mp3. This is just the right phone!
I upgraded from my Motorola V180 to this camera phone because I upgraded my plan to have the myfaves feature. My review is a little comparison to my old phone considering this is my first Samsung phone.Appearance- Thin and lightweight. Keypad is big and easy to press. You won't be able to change menu screen.Battery- It charges quickly, but it also drains quickly. Maybe it's because it's due to me playing around with the camera.Call Quality- Clear calls.Camera/Video- My first camera phone, and I have to say that it's pretty decent. I still have to figure out all the camera settings. I added photos of my cats if you want to see picture quality. When I transferred them to my computer it came out a little dark. Not too sure if this happens to all camera phones. There is no flash, but you can use the nighttime mode. Video playback is decent too.Games- There are four games. Forgotten Warrior, Freekick, Arch Angel, and Midnight Pool. I don't use them.LCD- Very bright screen. Light will dim and turn off after a minute of idle time. Outer screen light will not be on when phone is closed. It's a drawback since I like to see the time displayed on phone at all times.Music/Video player- I don't use it, but there is one downloaded video that came with it. It doesn't have a memory card slot so I don't think you'd be able to save a lot of files if you're into that kind of stuff.Phonebook- Customized ringtones for callers must be saved to phone. A number that is saved to phone and SIM will have double entries. Lots of extra spaces to put email address, work #, picture ID, etc. under one name.Sounds- Vibration and silence mode can be turned on by pressing just one button. My old phones used to ring and vibrate at the same time whereas this phone will only vibrate first and then ring. Speakerphone is soft though, and you have to click twice just to turn it on.TXT/IM- I hate using T9 form, and unfortunately it's the default setting and you won't be able to change it. It's very tedious to make 3 clicks to put it in normal mode everytime I create a message. 200 messages can be saved to phone while only 30 is saved to SIM. I think it all depends from the settings you saved from your old phone. IM is great.Voice Dial- I do not use it.Other- Downloading files is very quick. Sometimes there is too many clicks just to do a task like deleting a file or message. Transferring personal made ringtones from computer to phone can only be saved as an alarm tone. It was also disappointing that I had to buy more ringtones and games for my phone as the SIM did not transfer my files from my old phone. It has a stopwatch, timer, unit conversion, and tip calculater that my other phones lacked. You can set the calendar on the front of the screen if you want to.If you like a basic camera phone, then this is good for you. To me the pros outweighs the cons so I'll be sticking with it.
I held back from buying a Samsung T609, knowing that this phone would soon be released.  The functions are almost identical, and the new form doesn't disappoint - sleek, thin, yet feels sturdy and works great.  However, they took out the microSD memory expansion slot!  Why the tradeoff, Samsung?  Beware if you're looking to use its MP3 functionality or to make good use of its 1.3MP camera: with only its 21MB of internal memory at your disposal, it won't hold much.
I've had this phone for about a week.  I've used Samsung phones before, but my last phone was my first Nokia.When compared to the Nokia, this phone is......smaller, slimmer, lighter, prettier...not as battery efficientThis is the first phone I've had with Bluetooth and I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to transfer contacts from Microsoft Outlook.  One glich was that the phone didn't display the numbers correctly on all screens.  I had to open each of the contacts on the phone and click "save" to get them in the right order.As previously mentioned, the four way button isn't programmable so there's no way to change the right button from voice recording to anything else.  I used the calendar on my Nokia often and was able to access it in one click.  The Samsung requires five clicks.The voice dialing is okay, but you've really got to enunciate.  For instance, it has trouble with the difference between Sarah and Karen.  Using last names helps.The Samsung is a media player which is great, except that the memory is not expandable.  You'll only be able to add a few songs to the phone.One feature this phone supports that I've never seen before is the ability to use one of your voice recordings as a ring tone.  That's fun because I had my girlfriend record her own ring tone.
First off, this phone is very thin and light. It is hardly noticeable in my pocket and has a cool design. I have tried the 1.3 megapixel camera and am pleased with how it functions in comparrison to my previous phone the Motorola V360. The calls seem clear, the signal is strong and it has been pretty reliable.The drawbacks in my opinion are1. The external screen is always off. It only stays on for 3 seconds after closing the phone. However, while charging the phone it stays lit up the entire time. I like to check the time and look for missed calls/messages on the external screen but this phone does not allow that.  There is not even an external button you can press to light the external screen back up.2. I have a hard time with the Samsung Text message software. Perhaps I am just used to Motorola's UI but I find it more difficult to text using this phone.3. I agree with other reviewers who stated that it seems you must do several click throughs to accomplish certain tasks. To delete a message you have to click several times.Overall This is a good little phone and I think any samsung fan would be very happy with it.
ok, this is a sturdy phone, and I loved my e635 very much but didn't like how the slider phone screen gets scratched so I opted for this flip phone.  I figured by now they would have the menu system flaws worked out, but it's only gotten worse (did Samsung even try using this phone!? They truly are the king of non-intuitive menus and their manual is next to useless):One of the hot keys for the camera is on the side of the phone.  Now, under normal circumstances when the phone is closed I would expect these external keys to be disabled, but that is not the case, so I end up with a bunch of pictures of the inside of my pocket!!!  This is an AMAZINGLY stupid design flaw, and I can't find any way around it!  A note for another reviewer, you can clear your default picture location (go to camera-left soft key-6 go to my photos-options-5 set default destination) so at least it won't upload them and charge you and will only save them to memory, I had to do this on my e635 as well.There are two soft-keys on this phone at the top, the one on the left is for the menu which makes sense, now the one on the right should be for the phone book as it is on the e635, however instead it is used to access ... t-zones?!  What the heck?  I don't know about you, but I go to my phone book infinitely more often than t-zones.  At the very least they could have at least made this key programmable.  The phone book however is directly accessible via the down key when you first open the phone.One cool thing about t-mobile is after 3 months you can call them and get your phone unlocked.Is t-mobile so hard up for cash that they use phone TRICKS to nickel and dime you out of your money?
I have to wonder if anyone actually TRIED using this phone before it went into production.1.  The maual leaves a lot out on how to use this non-intuitive phone.2.  In order to see address book you have to press menu, then scroll to phonebook and click,then scroll to contact list and click.3.  The voice recognition never lets you "teach" it your voice.  It's less than useless.  More often than not, the coversation goes like this.me:  Call Janeit:  Do you mean Jane Doe?me:  Yesit:  Do you want home or mobile?me:  Mobile.it:  Did you want home or mobile?me:  MOBILEit:  I'm sorry, that is not a valid listing.The camera button is on the outside--clever if you WANT it on, but often I end up taking pictures of my chin or my pocket.  Then, before you can go to the main screen, it asks if you want to send it to My Album (at an additional cost).  On that screen, you have the choice of clicking on My Album or Yes or Option.  When you click Option you are given a new menu, which you will have to scroll to the next page of to find Delete! Now you're ready to make a phone call--if you can find the number!In many parts of my town there is little or no signal, even though T-Mo says there should be.This phone is a nice looking piece of garbage.  Too bad it took me more than two weeks to figure that out, with their lousey manual.  It's mine now.
To be fair, I upgraded to the Razr from a Nokia 6101, so all my opinions are based on a comparison.  In 3 words, there is none.  This phone feels sturdier in my hand, is more user-friendly and has a louder earpiece than the Nokia.  It comes with about 30 preset ringtones instead of Nokia's 5 or so (each lamer than the last) so I won't waste hours online trying to download a better one.  The screen is larger and brighter, the battery cover is easier to remove, and the camera takes better pictures.  What really bowled me over though was the text messaging program.  Nokia has a "predictive" dictionary that nevertheless requires you to type out the whole word, and 5 times out of 10 "predicts" the wrong one.  Moto's dictionary predicts the word before you finish typing, giving the option to skip to the end, and even displays 5 or 6 other options at the bottom of the screen to choose from.  Brilliant.This phone has probably made me a Moto customer for life.
The Motorola Razr V3 is a wonderful piece of technology.  T-Mobile works great with it.  I get great reception basically everywhere.  Not only is the  Razr a good looking cell phone but it also has amazing battery life.  The speakerphone is nice and loud.  Overall the Razr is a user-friendly camera flip-phone with a pleasing appearance.
I keep waiting for at least one of the numerous complaints to happen to my phone, but alas, I keep waiting (thankfully!). I have dropped it, twice, from a short distance however, but it did not break right away like other people have claimed. The interface is great, Motorola has one of the better ones. It has all the options I want on it although there are a lot of them and it can be confusing at times. However, if you use the manual you'll get the most out of it. It sounds great and has good reception. I also like that it is wider then most phones so I don't have to press it to my ear. I can hear fine with just a corner of the phone to my ear which is a lot more comfortable. As for T-mobile service, I have been with them for 4+ years and have never had a complaint. They have they the best plans and the best customer service.
I just got this version of Razr V3 (a myfaves model) as a replacement for an older silver V3.  This phone restarts (reboots) when it is receiving, reading, or deleting certain text messages.  Motorola and T-Mobile cannot figure out why. This is my second pearl gray of this model, both exhibited the same problem.  I am receiving a third from T-Mobile soon, hopefully that one will work.
This mobile phone replaced a Nokia 6270 I bought approximately 6 months ago (I have reviewed that phone on Amazon also - please read the review if you are considering purchasing that phone).  Here are the highlights of the 3125:Pros:(1) Design is excellent -  The phone is thin enough to easily fit in pants pockets without being obtrusive or feeling heavy.  Buttons located on the exterior of the unit require sufficient force so that they aren't accidentally activated while handling the phone.  While the exterior is low profile and slim, it is also textured with small ridges in strategic touchpoints (sides, back battery plate, etc) that enhance your grip.  Nice touch.(2) Screen - Very clear; graphics quality is excellent.  I have not used the browser function yet, but it appears the screen resolution would provide a decent experience.(3) Keypad - Well designed despite the lack of independent buttons.  I'll have to admit, the 'sheet metal' implementation of buttons on the RAZR is what turned me off.  It felt like buttons would be accidentally pressed and the design would not wear well, but the Cingular 3125 seems to have struck the right balance.  Keys are easy to use and have good feedback.(4) Menu system - Straightforward for a Windows-based phone with such a variety of features.  It is never easy to pack that many features onto a menu structure that fits intuitively on the screen of a cell phone, but they've done a respectable job of it.  My biggest hurdle was pairing a Jabra headset; I didn't get that a 'menu' function on the bottom of that feature would reveal Bluetooth pairing options, but it added a whole layer of new functionality.  Seemed a bit unituitive, but maybe I was just didn't get the paradigm in my first couple tries.(5) Reception - Comparable to other Cingular phones I've used; seems to be effected by the same weak spots.(6) Battery life - A pleasant surprise!  I talk a lot on my cell and two hours of calls had little effect on the battery (down by 1 bar).  My Nokia would have been nearly drained.(7) Contact synchronization - I use a Mac, so this is more involved than it would have been if you are a Windows user.  Still, I downloaded a synchronization package from the internet (The Missing Sync) and it worked very nicely.  Contacts and appointments worked very well.(8) Headset - I bought a Jabra BT headset to work with this unit; it worked very well.  The only issue is that the headset begins to experiencing skipping and choppiness if the phone and headset are out of line of site.  For example, if the phone is in your pocket.(9) Responsiveness - I've owned PDAs and Smartphones before and I was always displeased with responsiveness of the interface.  This appears to respond well.  It lagged a few times, but it is tolerable.Cons:(1) Needs more themes out of the box.  I don't use MSN, though that is the most attactive theme that comes with the phone.  The Cingular theme is functional and looks decent, but you could reasonably expect something a little flashier considering that they got everything else right with this phone.(2) This is reaching a bit, but it comes with a 128MB SD chip.  Considering the multi-media functionality, this is grossly insufficient.  I'm a bit of a purist, prefering a separate, higher quality camera rather than one integrated with my phone, but I realize an integrated camera+phone is attractive to a lot of people.  Between photos and music, you'll eat up 128MB before you know what's happened.(3) Ring volume is a bit low.  Out-of-the-box, the ring volume is a bit difficult to hear if you are in even a moderately noisy environment.  I have not yet found a way to increase ring volume.(4) Difficult to see missed call indicator on external display.  The dark external display with the blue clock is undoubtedly a cool feature of this phone, but as soon as the backlight times out, you have to activate the light to see a missed call.  Not a big deal, but a bit annoying if you are used glancing at an external display to identify missed calls.  Definitely not a show stopper.Notable:(1) As I pointed out, I use Macs, not Windows, so Windows Media is useless for me.  If you manage your songs and photos in Windows, I suspect the built-in Windows Media functionality would be a big plus for you.(2) Outlook integration looks very nice.  This phone is going to be great if you use Outlook and your e-mail is hosted on Exchange.  I'm a bit jealous.Why not 5 stars?  If it interfaced with a Mac out of the box, I would recommend it without hesitation.  I totally understand the target market of the phone is a Windows-enabled corporate workforce and in that area they completely make the grade.  Still, this is a review, right?  It is all about perspective!  Not to worry, third-party software fills this gap!
I had an older Nokia cell phone, which was reliable but didn't have very much connectivity and the phone info was always becoming obsolete, and I had a PDA. I used the phone for emergencies, travel on business, and little else. I used the IPAQ PDA to keep up with calendar and appointments and to read ebooks, but it was bulky.The 3125 has changed my life, and makes more information available constantly than I would have believed possible. It is also a great device to use "one-handed" when you are carrying something in the other.I've owned mine a week, and it has already dramatically changed how I use my cell phone. I now tend to use it in preference to my home "land line", and its light weight and great design make it easy to keep with me constantly.This is well on the way to replacing both the phone and the PDA. First of all it is a Windows Mobile 5 implementation(and most importantly from my perspective), you can can quickly synchronize seamlessly with your Outlook 2003 contacts, calendar, and tasks. I doesn't seem you can edit a task, but everything else is wonderful. You don't have to buy any special software or adapter, and this phone recharges from the USB connector.Voice quality is much improved over my previous cell phone, and also reception in marginal area. I have the Cingular Internet Service (Edge Network), and it amazes me that it is readily available anywhere I've been--even when the signal has been weak. It won't ever be my preferred mode of surfing the web, but to find a business or restaurant or quick map in a strange city is quick and easy.Here's the other key feature for me that was a wonderful surprise -- the keypad. First of all, I have large fingers, and blew off the Blackberry and new IPAQ phones once I handled them because the keys were just too small. I didn't even love the numeric keypads of most cellphones. However, these keys are flat, large, and give good tactile feedback. You know when you press them, and you don't do it accidentally. The T9 method of text entry is surprisingly easy to master and fairly fast, so you don't miss either a keyboard for limited typing or a stylus. The directional selector that substitutes for a mouse is similarly quick and effective to use.The small screen means I won't be reading Ebooks on it, but otherwise, I have found the visibility to be very good except in extremely bright direct sunlight. Also, I selected "large fonts" in the setup, and find I can read the "contacts" and similar information WITHOUT my glasses. What a pleasure that is. The bluetooth implementation is also good.All in all, I have found this to be a really great design. I have a lot of gadgets, but there are very few which have impressed me as much after living with them.
Great phone! I've had it for 3 weeks and have no complaints. I've been living without a cell phone for a couple years before I bought this one. My wife and I were sharing a Motorola E815, but she usually carried it. On the few days when I did carry the Motorola, my pockets were overloaded because I also carry a Palm Tungsten E2, from which I manage my appointments and track my tasks (to-do list). My Palm also allowed me to play free, downloadable talking books from the library using pocket tunes.I was attracted to this Cingular 3125 because it combines the ability of the Palm (sync with Microsoft outlook, play talking books and window media files)  with a phone.  The 3125 is very small and flat, in comparison to carrying my palm and the Motorola. It fits in the pocket very easily, and I carried it that way for a while until I found a nice generic case at compusa that fits on my belt. It's the "foneGear #00409" model.Battery life is very impressive. I charge it on the weekends and it runs all week, though I do turn it off at night. As a teacher, I consider cell phones intrusive. Because I'd rather talk to people around me face to face, than talk through an electronic device, I only make/receive about 3 calls a day, and I didn't buy the data package. Getting this phone without the data package took some doing. Everyone, including the cingular stores, cingular online and even Amazon wanted to force me to buy the phone with the data package. This means it would have been $40 a month for the line, and an extra $20 to $40 a month for the data package, for a total of around $80 a month. For a guy who was living on a limited teacher salary, and was used to no cell phone at all, that was unacceptable.I work on computers for a living, and I pack my laptop around, so there was no need for the stupid data package. Finally, I found an online store that would allow me to buy just the phone for $150 (no rebates involved), as long as I agreed to a 2 year plan at $40 a month. They are a large national brick and mortar store, think: "bb".The phone is very well put together from an engineering standpoint. The hinge is tight, all the buttons work, it's a very understated design, all black, and that suits me fine. The camera works, but it's nothing to write home about. I have a digital rebel xt if I need to take serious pictures. As others have mentioned, the screen quality is excellent. I'm new to windows mobile, coming from the palm operating system, but so far I'm very impressed. I love the ability to explore the operating system, just like it was a flash drive when it's tethered to my laptop. I couldn't do that with my Palm as it has a bizarre folder structure. Windows Mobile also has a very cool feature wherein it remembers what functions you've use recently and presents you with those icons on the "desktop", just like my laptop does off the start button. It also works as a modem for my laptop, something Verizon had disabled on our Motorola.I thought I would miss the ease of text entry coming from my Palm, but the t9 text entry system on the 3125 is amazing and very fast. Another nice function is that when you start entering numbers to dial a call, it jumps into your contacts and call history and makes educated t9 guesses at who you are trying to call, searching both numbers and names simultaneously.The only software I've added so far is the Papyrus software which improves on Mobile Outlook and allows me to more precisely set alarms on appointments and tasks. I also bought Facade, but uninstalled it as it seemed unnecessary. Windows Mobile has an excellent system of setting up sound profiles such as silent mode, and normal mode. Everything is customizable regarding whether it vibrates and rings, or vibrates, then rings, and whether or not an appointment alarm will ring, vibrate, both or neither. I was also easily able to copy in an mp3 file from my laptop to use as my custom ring tone. It's  simply drag and drop with windows explorer from the laptop.As I did not buy the data package, I can't comment on all the fancy connectivity stuff like doing live email and internet surfing on the phone. If I need to, I can do that stuff through the "pay for use" option, or "pay by the minute" as it's called. I got online once that way and it worked, but seemed pretty slow.  The phone has a decent onboard antenna. I live way out in the country on a peninsula in Puget Sound and cell phone coverage can be very spotty here. Verizon has the best coverage out here, but they don't sell this phone, and they have a reputation for dumbing down their phones capabilities so you have to buy more stuff directly from them. I'm happy to report that my 3125 does work here at the house, if a little spotty, so it must have an above average antenna. It works perfectly in Tacoma, even inside my office, which has no windows and is buried in a concrete building.I bought a 1 gig micro sd card locally for $60 and now have my music collection on the phone. You definitely don't want to be swapping cards a lot as it's fairly scary accessing the slot. When you slide the cover off the phone, note that the Sim card slides out to the left out from under the metal band, they don't tell you that... I guess you're supposed to be able to figure that out but I was afraid I'd break something on my brand new phone. To access the micro sd card holder, stick your fingernail under the top of the metal holder and lift gently. It hinges at the bottom, though it's not obvious unless you use a magnifying glass.All in all I couldn't be happier with my new toy. If this changes, I'll update this post as time goes on.
I have used smartphones over the past few years, including the Palm 650, Motorola mpx220 (a predecesor flip smartphone), IMate Jam, and the Cingular 8125. Now I have the 3125 with which I am very pleased. My contract was up and it was time for a new gadget, so I decided to go back to a flip smartphone. I loved the 8125 for its QWERTY keyboard, and other smartphone/PocketPC functions, but I found it to be too bulky. The 3125 is a great alternative and different from the ubiquitous RAZR.This is my primary phone (no land line here), so my first prerequisite is that it functions well as a phone. Sometimes when companies try to pack too much functionality into a phone, its the call quality that tends to suffer. I live in the Metro DC area and have been generally pleased with radio reception, clarity, and battery life. I conduct regular 1+ hr conference calls on this phone using a Cardo Scala 700 bluetooth handsfree, and have had no complaints from other attendees of poor call quality. There have been occasions where I've placed or received phone calls that start out as "squawky", and I've had to either call back, or the other party calls me back. Then everything is fine. I don't know if this is attributed to the phone or to the network, as my friends using different phones have experienced the same thing on Cingular. Lately, I have not experienced this problem at all.I haven't fully maxed out the battery life.  The phone charges via USB. I work with a laptop, so I tend to have the phone synced via USB most of the time if its just laying around.I haven't used the Windows Media Player for this phone, so I cannot speak to that (it just eats battery life anyways.) The unit does come with a stereo earbuds.I like MS smartphones in general because they sync seamlessly with my Outlook (upon which I'm heavily dependent.) I find it so much easier to manage my contacts/calendar/tasks via Outlook and to sync/carry the info around on my phone. I've tried other phones which require proprietary software to interface with Outlook. It can be a pain to manage. So much simpler to just sync via ActiveSync.I do use the web-browsing functionality to check my work email via the phone's Internet Explorer with no probs. Google has a nice Java midlet that lets you access your GMail without having to go through either the Cingular XPressMail program or through the smartphone's MS Outlook.Having gone from the 8125 to this phone, I quickly embraced T9 texting (since there's no QWERTY.) I found the transition from QWERTY to T9 to be fine.The camera delivers pictures that are very clear and crisp. No complaints there. Its a camera phone, so I don't rely on it as a primary camera. It serves well to capture those random moments in your life. You can access the pictures by connecting your phone to your computer and using ActiveSync to browse the phone folders.I gave this phone only 4/5 stars because of the following:Quirk 1: The phone syncs/charges via USB cable, but the end that attaches to the phone is not your standard USB device connection. It is proprietary to this phone. With the IMate Jam and the 8125, you can sync/charge using a standard USB cable (the same one that you may use for your mp3 player, camera, or other USB devices.) Its just mildly annoying because its just one more cable amidst the existing sea of cables. I don't know why HTC took this step backwards.Quirk 2: This phone does NOT support the MS Outlook Notes function! There is a function on the phone to create voice notes. You cannot create notes on your desktop Outlook and then sync them over to your phone. This is very annoying because I used this function quite a lot with my 8125. I use it for shopping lists and other silly reminders. My work around this is to create notes under the TASK function. Not very pretty.All in all... a great phone despite the above minor shortcomings.
I love the idea of a smart-flip-phone.  I even like that it doesn't have a tiny little qwerty keypad to fumble with.  The size of this phone is perfect.  Call & sound quality are above average.  The speaker phone is loud and sounds good.  The 3125 feels solid and fits the hand just right.  Maybe it's just me but I have a hard time finding the right buttons on the keypad without looking.  It would be nice to be able to feel where you are.  The screen looks great although customizing the desktop is limited.  Unlike other versions of windows mobile, you can't create or download themes.This phone is very useful as a productivity tool.  You can sync it with outlook via cable and it also offers, for free, Xpress mail service which will allow you to check your e-mail and calender when you are away from your pc.  In addition to business, I have gotten in the habit of entering all of those details that my wife tells me and setting reminders on the phone.  This information also syncs back to your pc so that no matter where I am, I'll get a reminder about those little details and therefore I don't get yelled at anymore.This phone works as an mp3 and video player.  Many video formats don't work.  I'm not sure if it's because of codecs but It doesn't allow you to install codecs.  The sound quality is great with the included earpieces but it doesn't have a standard earphone jack so you can't use any other earphones.  The video quality is poor and becomes distorted when you change to fullscreen.  I wouldn't expect anything more out of a flip phone.  The built in video camera is useless because the videos come out blurry unless you have a very still subject and it's well lighted.  It takes decent stills for a phone.Programs are occasionally slow, particularly if you are running more than one program.  I am disappointed with the internet speed.  Since this phone was recently released, I don't understand why they didn't make it 3g capable.One big complaint that I have is with the micro sd card.  It is often unrecognized.  I have to turn the phone off, open the back cover, re-seat the SD and sim cards and then power it back on.  I suspect that the connection to the card is lost just from the constant movement that happens when you carry the phone.  This happens every 2-3 days.  My phone is only 3 months old and I wonder if the problem is only going to worsen with age.I recommend this phone for someone who wants to sync with outlook, while being able to listen to tunes and play games on the go and who wants a unique phone to show off.  If you want a great phone but don't need windows mobile, consider the LG CU500.
This is an amazing phone.  Being able to sync via Outlook and run Windows Mobile apps on a flip-style phone is perfect.I was skeptical at first because I was afraid the Windows Mobile OS would be buggy.  However after using this phone for a couple weeks, it has proven to be much more reliable than I originally anticipated.This phone offers the best of both worlds - a nice compact flip-style phone you can put in your pocket that can run Windows Mobile.The only thing I wish it had was 3G data speed.You get the most bang for the buck with this phone - I highly recommend the 3125.
All in all a very good phone but there are a few things that can cause major problems. First, don't carry it in your pocket if you don't have to. I found out the hard way that the heat from your leg will cause moisture to build and very easily ruins the flash memory resulting in the phone completely freezing as soon as the start-up process completes. The compact design with so many features makes the phone very sensitive to anything outside of room temperature. Luckily it happened to me within 2 weeks of getting this phone and Cingular was more than compliant in replacing it for me. Also, DO NOT use a microSD card in it. Upon putting it in, the phone will ask you if you want that to be your default storage drive. But that's all it will ask. Then one day down the road when you turn the phone on, a message will pop up asking if you would like to format the newly found memory card. It's a trick question because no matter what you select, it erases everything on the card and corrupts it turning it into nothing more than a very expensive piece of plastic with shiny gold bars on the back. I know what you're saying. "Just put the microSD into the full-size adapter it came with, insert it into your card reader and re-format it with your PC." WRONG! Upon finishing the format process, Windows will tell you that it can't format the selected card. And please don't think this is an isolated incident. Two others I've talked to had the same thing happen. I'm just the only one posting it. AVOID THE MICRO!!! Just follow those two guidelines and everything will be just fine and the phone will operate with ease.
Although this phone has so many great details that are mentioned in other reviews, I could not believe the cheapness of the plastic!This phone could have been just a GREAT design and durable as well as I especially like the clock on the cover.  Instead, Cingular offers a phone that cost over $300 with all the bells and whistles and terrific technology ....with plastic like a kid's phone. I couldn't believe it and when I mentioned it to the reps on the phone, they stated that all the customers were saying how disappointed they were.I mean, how much more would it have cost Cingular to spend a few bucks for quality materials? If you drop this baby even once, you had better kiss it goodbye...
I love this phone it looks great but if you have t-Mobile the t-zones will not work the phone does not accept long settings so you will not be able to use t-zone. Also this phone does not have a micro sd memory slot even though the description says it does. Also sync this phone to a PC is challenging, you need to install the software several times to get it to work. If you just want to use it as a phone it is a great phone but all the extras don't work unless you buy a Verizon phone.
This phone sucks.  The software is slow, especially when the phone is loaded with lots of pictures.  The buttons are clumsy to push, especially if you have big fingers.  Ergonomically you would do better with an older model Motorola cellphone.  The buttons on the side are laid out in a manner that when you handle the phone you frequently  tend to change the ringer to off inadverdently.  That is a real design boo boo.The RF section is, however, pretty sensitive and stacks up well against any other phone in terms of talk distance and reception.Don't waste your money.
Okay, first of all, the review down below which states this phone is only for homosexuals is complete garbage. I'm a heterosexual male and I think this cell is AWESOME!! I've gotten loads of compliments from people asking where I got it, and it also functions as a good cell phone and isn't all about the look. The only problem I have is that when you're trying to sign onto AIM, or download ringtones, photos, etc, it takes FOREVER. Some of the instant messages don't even go through. However, if you don't care about that, by all means, add to cart!
I work for a cell phone company and when I saw this phone and then one of my guy friends said, Wow, that would look good on you!, my ego took over and I had to have it. Having never owned a Motorola cell, I am still learning it but it has been wonderful. The camera resolution is very good as well. I feel pretty much like I'm "all that" when its in my pocket in its gold leather case with my Dolce & Gabbana "DG" charm hanging out of my pocket. Or when its sitting on my desk in my office and it draws a crowd. I also purchased the "gold" DG blue tooth. Not only is it cool because how many blue tooth units are gold and have DG on them, but the call quality is awesome! I LOVE IT!!
for $375 this phone is outrageously pricedonly 1.3MP? how much memory does it come with? Where is stereo bluetooth support? This phone lacks the A2DP Bluetooth profile for stereo bluetooth headsets. For a phone that's over a year old, this is seriously too expensive.the only reason why im giving it 2 stars is for the dolce & gabbana name on it.just take a look at the sony ericsson w810i for example, 2mp camera, 512MB memory stick, upgradeable to 4GBs, and no i am not paid by sony to say this.this is just some old phone with D&G;'s logo slapped on it. It's not hard to find a better phone.
Why would anyone pay so much for some retarded looking phone when you can get one for free at any carrier. Amazing how utterly shallow people are that they have to have some  ridiculous pimped out phone that they will just replace in six months or so. Grow up people!
This phone is gorgeous.  I am not sure why anyone would say it is ugly -- quite to the contrary, I get frequent compliments on it.  It's absolutely adorable.  I also have the pink Razr, and I switch the SIMs so I can carry whichever phone suits my mood that day.  All of my contacts are totally portable.  Fun!
I use my phone for my life! I mean I travel I work I talk I download text and my planner OMG I would be lost without a GREAT phone! I have to say I was worried at first to buy but, heck if I didnt like believe me I would of returned it! I get so many comments oh where did you get the that phone? I never seen one that color? "THATS JUST HAWT!" So I have never heard anyone tell me ugh why that color please this colr shines pink pss thats what I got my daughter. I'm 30+ yrs old I want style and this phone is style! Now i talked about the looks lets talk about the use! The phone loads super! It has no trouble downloading files for work or play! I love this phone @ Thumbs up!
At first sight, i found this phone to be extremely attractive. I mean, what else could you ask for but a Dolce & Gabbana RAZR!?! Considering this phone is comparable to the original RAZR i wouldn't dare spend this much on a simple phone, but I guess it is the thought and concept that counts... gold rules!
Let me be frank I bought this phone because it looked good. It's beautiful and very easy to use. I usually buy a Nokia. The problem is my phone's battery stopped working in the second month. So I bought a new one. Then people started telling me they can't hear my voice well. So I couldn't talk to them for long. Plus my ear hurts more while using it then using my last phone. Also the golden D&G; sign is starting to become silver. I concluded that this phone isn't for me and just bought a Nokia. If you want a phone everyone is going to ohh and ahh over then this is the one for you. In my first week about 25 people told me my phone was gorgeous. But if you want the phone that will last longer then a few months consider what happened to me.
I love the gold color!  Too bad I just bought a black razor last month.
This phone truly is amazing. I researched phones a ton before actually receiving this phone, and let me tell you that no review does it justice. It's a beautifully designed phone. The camera is okay for a phone and the buttons are a bit slippery, but you can customize almost everything on this phone (sounds, fonts, colors, etc.) It's small and I don't see any problem with the earpiece volume. My last phone was a Sony Ericsson K790A and the call volume was worse, although if you're used to a loud volume you may be disappointed.The most annoying part of this phone is that the phone makes an annoying beeping sound with every single button you push (menus, text messages, dialing - literally every single button). You can turn it off, but you have to turn off ALL keypad sounds in order to do it. Not a big deal, but I really liked the dialing voice that actually pronounced the number you were dialing while you were dialing, but alas, it has to be off to avoid the headache-giving beeping noise.Overall I would recommed this phone to anyone. It isn't the most feature-rich phone on the planet, but if you like customization and having a very cool-looking phone, this is the one!You will get a lot of compliments with this phone, and in my opinion the white is such an improvement over the black. It looks extremely clean and it's different than any phone out there. I wish I knew how many compliments I've gotten in the week I've had it.
I loveeee loveeee this phone! The white is much much cooler looking than the black, and it has everything on it! It has a camera, recorder, video, and mp3 player. you can even get a microSD chip and put your own pics,movies, and songs on it! it is sooo cool. the ONLY annoying thing is that if you don't have the ring volume on vibrate or silent, every button you push makes the phone beep. but i like it soooo much otherwise. none of my friends have white, or slider phones. you should deffinitely get it because it is GREAT! =D
Make sure you get the correct US or international version.US version 850/1800/1900Asia/Europe 900/1800/1900
Our aviation business uses cell phones quite a bit to stay in touch in the US and Canada.  One missed call from the right customer can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in missed revenue or commissions. (Although, believe me, most of our deals are not on this scale!)We chose Cingular due to their size after merging with ATT, but I was quite frustrated in the phones they offered.I quickly grew disenchanted with their Motorola phones and their poor reception....and believe me, it was the phones - not the carrier as many people had different Cingular phones and were getting good reception.  Problem was that these phones just didn't have all the features that I wanted.I really researched the phones and although the Nokia 7610 is only available online right now in most areas, it had all the features of a "Smart Phone" without all the bulk of a Blackberry.The Nokia 7610 is a medium-size phone that has Bluetooth AND USB connectivity to the Web, text messaging, a GREAT camera, to-do lists, several clocks for different time zones, a voice and video recorder,calendars, and a LOT of games - although I don't often play them.  It has EVERYTHING that I wanted - especially the great camera and the BEST reception with Cingular that I have found.  To date, I haven't read a single review that really COMPLAINS about this phone.  Finally....I've discovered a truly great cell phone.  Just be sure that you buy the leather case for it (forget the awful FlexiSkin one that leaves the screen totally exposed) as you won't want to drop this one!
100% . A wonderful phone from nokia. All S60/Java apps/games run perfectly. Highly recommended.
The Z610i is a very hard phone to rate. This phone attracts majority of its viewers because it (obviously) is eyecandy. This phone boasts its sleek look, OLED external screen, and its built in chrome mirror. The downside of this phone is the fact that the External LCD screen is smaller than you think, the 2megapixel camera is a bit weak, no flash,  and the side buttons are hard to press. This phone gives you many great features though, the speakerphone works great, the battery life on this phone is about 7 hours talk time and 2 weeks standby, the bluetooth functionality is great, and there are many addons that this phone can use. If you are ordering this phone, it is not going to be slim like the Razr, Katana, and their competitors but its not too thick either. The phones features are comparible to the A900, A920 by Samsung so don't expect a futuristic phone. On a side note, Sony Ericsson does make a Bluetooth WristWatch that acts as a Caller ID/Music Controller for the phone. In conclusion, the Z610i is sure to attract many peoples eyes and is a perfect phone for those who want to be able to listen to music, and like to talk a long time.
the z610i is a stylish, 3G cellphone with video call capacity and a good media player (nothing to envy the walkan phones). Althought the M2 memory card is expensive, it comes with a 64MB card and 20MB internal memory.The surface is clean and sweet, very fashion, but is a magnet for fingerprints and can be scratched easy.The 2MP camera is not that good, no autofocus or flash/led. It does not comes with headphones.Overall, a good phone for women: good and basic.
Pros:- Exclusivity. Nobody has this phone/color combo.- Killer looks. The glass front is mind-blowing. Photo doesn't do it justice.- Killer size. Left to right it's thinner than the RAZR but slightly longer and slightly thicker front to back.- Sturdy. This is where it shines. When you close it, it feels like a luxury car door. Very solid; lightyears ahead of the RAZR.- Sound quality is top-notch. Excellent reception.- Camera is actually very, very good. I was very, very surprised.- Works with all my old RAZR accessories.Cons: (barely justifiable to even call them that)- A couple of the included games/java apps were in Chinese.- The phone language. "Centre" instead of "Center", Personalise instead of "Personalize" - Not really a big deal. Must be a UK English vs. a US English thing.
This is a great phone.  What impressed me most about it was several things.  One was its sleek design and feel.  If you liked the RAZR, this phone will really knock your socks off.  It's not quite as wide as the RAZR, which makes it easier on the hands, and it's solid construction makes you feel like you're holding a quality product.  I love how it snaps shut after you finish a call.  It's satisfying.  Two, it has better reception than the RAZR, or at least it seems that way to me.  I don't have any data to support this claim, but I have fewer dropped calls on this phone, and the volume is much better.  I don't find myself pressing the phone against my ear like I used to do with the RAZR, which is really nice.  Three, I dig the MP3 and multimedia features.  I popped a 2GB card in the phone and loaded about 50 of my favorite songs and about 75 family photos in it.  It's great because now I can set the phone alarm to wake up to my favorite songs, or set ring tones to whatever tune I  have loaded on it.  Also, I setup a playlist and listed to it while jogging the other day.  I was most impressed.  I also created a family album on the phone and showed it to friends in a slideshow format.  It was funny.  Rather than complimenting me on my beautiful family, they focused their comments on the photo quality of my phone.  I was like, dude.  Anyway, if you like cool phones, I totally recommend this one.  Yeah it's pricey, but from my perspective, it's worth it.  One last comment.  I'm a Cingular customer and they, if you haven't noticed, haven't offered the KRZR K1 phone to their customers yet.  Well, that's okay.  You can still use this phone on thier network.  All you have to do is take the phone out of the box, pop in your old SIM card from your previous phone, then call Cingular and ask them to activate it.  They will ask you for the IMEI number located on the box and within minutes, you will be connected.  It was a snap.  Enjoy!
Everything about this phone is fantastic.  It feels great.  Has terrific features. I had no prolems with the micro sd card the other reviewer had.  I too was able to just insert the card and go.The voice recorder is very good, the camera is outstanding, and the video recorder was also very good.Wish it came with Spanish, French, and German languages as well as English.Don't be fooled by the Verizon version of this phone.  Get the unlocked phone.  The Verizon has a lessor camera (1.3 instead of 2), can only handle a 1GB sd card instead of the 2GB, and only has 4X zoom instead of 8X.  There may be other differences as well but, to me, these are significant.
I received my phone 2 days ago and I have not been able to put it down!  The quality is very good.  I have TMobile and have only had some slight issues with the phone.1. For some reason it says Cingular on the main screen instead of TMobile.2. I can't receive picture messages (I think I have to set it up again).3. The games are in Chinese and the keys have Chinese letters/stroke symbols.4. Impossible to keep it fingerprint free without constantly wiping it down.That's about all the negative.Sound quality is great. Best I've had. Music sounds great. I haven't had any issues with the memory card as the other person previously posted. I popped in a brand new 1GB MicroSD card and it recognized it right away.All in all I give 4/5 stars.  If you always like to have the newest/best then I'd say buy one now.  If you can wait, I'd say wait until you can buy a true US version of it
The sheer artistic perfection and asthetics of this phone almost belie it's functionality - it is not just another pretty face. What prompted me to buy it besides it's cosmetic appeal is the dimensions. The best-selling RAZR was tad too wide for me to use one-handed due to it's width. The KRZR - [I have heard two different pronounciations of it: "Krayzer" and "Cruiser" - I lean towards the latter] - is taller, but narrower and fits like a tailored glove. Sound reception is great, additional features are superb (8x zoom on a 2.0 MP camera; up to 2Gb additional capacity by adding a Micro-SD; stereo Bluetooth capability, E-mail access, Web browser are my favorites). This unlocked GSM phone enabled me to pop in the SIM from my existing provider and go from there, and I am really looking forward to when I travel with it, obtain pre-paid SIMS for other countries, and pop them in and go...all that after listening to hours of music on it's mp3 player on the flight over. This is an advance in the technology of smaller and finer electronics, which seems to be one of the most heavily concentrated areas of technology as of late, and we are just starting to scratch the surface - but what a dent the MOTOKRZR has made.
It is a shame that Motorola build such a great phone, but no driver for it.  The Motorola Phone Tool software 4.0 does not support this phone. Go through live Internet update to version 4.35, still no driver for it.  Tried Motorola web site, there is no driver download for this phone. Contacted Motorol support, they say they setup a special support line 800-972-1837 for this KRZR phone.  Called that number and opened case with them.  Three days later, on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours, still could not get the driver.Motorola suggested to pay Verizon to enable the Internet services, then sync the phonebook that way.  We are not ready to pay Verizon $50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age, you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download.  Not with Motorola.  I guess they afraid LG would look their support material and making better phone than Motorola, so they would rather hide the driver in their grandma's mattress -- even their own support engineer could not find that driver....
I bought the KRZR last Saturday.  The same evening, my screen began blanking out. My screen was very dark and seemed to have some sort of shortage.  I took the phone back to my cell phone company to have it replaced. As I was waiting, another customer came in with the same exact problem!Its a great phone with awesome features! My advice is to wait and see if there is a recall on these phones since its so new!
I received the phone two days ago and remarked on the beauty of it and its overall good design.  After charging and setting the phone up I was pleased so far.  The next morning I started to go to work, picked the phone up and it shut off completely. After trying many things to fix the problem it was useless.  Tried to contact the the seller, Exotic phones.con which is listed by Amazon, I think I been had.  The phone only left my house once, in a box.
The KRAZR is a disappointment.  I just received this phone yesterday from Amazon.com, only to find out that it cannot take the 1GB MicroSD Card from my Motorola V360.  It just keeps blinking !Removed Memory Card! when the MicroSD Card is in there.  It blinks so much that it is nearly impossible to maneuver the buttons through the phone book or other menu options. My V360 accepted the MicroSD Card just fine when I checked to see if the problem was just my MicroSD Card.  The KRAZR won't even recognize that there is a card when you check the Storage option in the phone settings menu.  It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.  If it wasn't for the MicroSD Card issue, I would not have any problem with it.  If you are intending to have this phone, wait until Motorola comes up with a fix or a recall.
I bought this phone for it's beautiful color and design and am happy with it for the most part.  I also have a MOTO RAZR and have been comparing the two.  So far the main thing I don't like about the KRZR are the voice dialing.With the RAZR, you can train each person with a Voice Name in the phonebook.  Then press the right button and say the name, and it automatically dials that person.The KRZR has no such feature (at least I haven't found it yet) and does not seem to recognize names, and if it does, you have to press several buttons before it will dial the correct person.  Not exactly what you need if you are trying for hands-free dialing.The other negative feature when compared to the RAZR is that is actually feels heavier and the controls are smaller and harder to use with my big fingers.Other than that, probably a great phone.  I'm still trying to figure out what it can do, so am having a learning curve issue.
Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz.  It is not.  Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz.  Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz.I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not.
Just received it this week.  Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90).  Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae).  The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage.  The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket.  Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?).  As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds.
this is the 2nd SE phone after T637, and this phone is just betterusing it with T-Mobile, it works pretty well as phone and modemvoice: the strongest part, the best sounding phone I ever used in 6 years, the speakerphone is OK, not so loudreception: another strongest part, with T-Mobile, it can get some weak signal when all other don't get signal at all; however, the antenna is located at the top back (where the loop is), touching this part will lose receptionoperation: typical SE style, pretty easy for SE users, 3 dedicated buttons: web, messaging, taskcam: excellent, even though it doesn't have auto-focus like K750 and K790, it looks pretty good, even it's better than nokia 6270bt: very easy to use and pair, with pc suite installed, file transfer and sync is just a piece of cake, the transfer speed is 300-400kB, this is the maximum of bt 2.0 speedscreen: the main screen is pretty bright, even I have to set the brightness down, animated standby screen is simply cool; external screen, however, is monochrome (it maybe a plus when using outdoors, the main is barely viewable under sunlight), it display info only, it's a kinda inconveient when doing self-picaudio player: I seldom use it because it doesn't support ogg vorbis, which I mainly use, streaming audio supports real only, no shoutcastconclusion: this phone is a pretty good phone for the price, quad-band is a must for Cingular users, fast EDGE modem for web and tetheringscore: I give it 95/100, there're some consrare memory card (M2), and it's not hot-pluggablelack of ogg vorbis and shoutcast supportno default USB mode (always asks when plug in, kinda annoying)
I've had my share of cell phones.  Before getting the LG CU400, I had a Sony/Ericsson 500A.  I loved that phone but S/E's Customer Service stunk!  (Because of a SyncManager database error, they said I had to reinsall the O/S to fix the problem!  Yea, right!!!)  The LG CU400 has a progressive ringtone.  Right now, you can't change that.  From what I understand per LG, Cingular made this an LG-requirement of their phones.  It's annoying when I hear someone else's phone do that, especially when no one answers the phone!  It doesn't have a quick-lock feature (that I can find.)  The Contacts are laid out in a wierd way (to me.)  Name1/H, Name1/W, Name1/M, and so on.  (H=Home, W=Work, M=Mobile, and so on.)  I don't know if that's because the data was on the SIM and isn't 'loaded' into the phone, itself, yet, or what.  I do like the location of the speaker button - a one-touch feature.  When the phone is closed, pressing any button on the side will display the date/time.  It's not in color - No biggie.  It's a PTT (Push-To-Talk) phone.  (I didn't buy that capability ...)  When you dial a phone number, the numbers are pretty big.  It has an external antenna.  My last phone had an internal antenna.  I didn't buy insurance in case I drop it and it breaks, or something.  It's possible that can happen.  It's not a Razor but it's thin.  The internal display is very clear!  I let the fully-charged phone run out the battery and, twice, it's lasted only 4 days with very minimal use.  Your call history is a couple of buttons down the menu-path, no biggie.  The speaker gets fuzzy at about 4 out of 7 bars.  You can't accidentally take pictures of inside your pocket or handbag.  I don't use the download capabilities of the phone for anything.  I don't IM.  I just use the phone as a phone.  So, I'm not going to comment on those features.  The 'door' that needs to be opened for charging is very flimsy!  I can see it breaking off very easily.  You'll want to 'turn' it 90 degrees UP to get it out of the way of the charger-cable.  There's no holster, yet, because it's so new.  There is a data-cable that can be used from another phone, so I'm told.  Be sure to ask about the peripheral hardware BEFORE you buy in case you need to have it right away.  All the peripherals may not be available yet.In sum, it's not a bad phone.  The ascending ring, the external antenna, and the fuzzy speaker, so far, hold me from giving this phone a Rating of 4.  It's above average but I don't think it deserves a 4.  I'll try the phone for a while and then try the Samsung C417.  It's all about tradeoffs.
I bought this phone to replace my wife's ailing RAZR. It has Cingular 3G high speed data, Push-to-talk, and a good feature set. The size is just slightly thicker than the slim RAZR phone form factor. My wife seems to actually like the slightly bigger size because it is easier to grasp and use. The menus are decent and the sound quality seems above average. The battery is also quite good thus far. It also sports bluetooth and a nice speakerphone, which means loud ringers and a good, strong vibrate alert. All in all-this phone seems to be a winner for the price. If you want PTT in a slick package from Cingular, look at this capable phone, the V365 or Blackberry Pearl!
Plus points:- Great form factor. Never thought I'd like a Samsung before- Nice display. Will need a screen protector though.- Stable. No crashes, no lockups yet.- Bluetooth etc works without a single hitch- Switches between 3G and Edge seamlessly- Great sound quality. Also looks like there is better background noise reduction with this phone. (maybe a network feature. new vocoder?)- very lightweight. Lighter than the Verizon Q.- Decent camera. 1.3 MP with some cool effects.- Barely feel it in my pocket. Awesome.Cons:- Top of phone gets pretty warm against the ear during a long conversation (scary)- Wierd connector. Why can't Samsung go with a standard Mini USB?? Losers.- No wired earphone/handsfree with the phone.- Keys may be a little too close, for some people- How about a GPS chip in the next revision?- Can't enjoy the music unless you really get a stereo bluetooth headset.-Great phone in all, the shortcomings look more like trade-offs for the most part rather than defects. It is in my opinion a even call with the Q and if the Q came out on any other network  besides Verizon, I would seriously have had a tough call between the two.
Cingular has shown its commitment to the Windows Mobile platform in releasing the Samsung i607 BlackJack Smartphone.  The BlackJack sports 3G data, superb voice quality, a full QWERTY keypad, a brilliant color display and Windows Mobile 5 with Direct Push via Microsoft Exchange, Service Pack 2.  It's thinner than the Motorola Q, sexier than the Treo 700 and gets reception in the remotest of cell hell holes.I've been getting near 1 megabit of bandwidth on Cingular's 3G network in the Little Rock, Arkansas market.  The voice quality of this phone is on par with most other bar phones on the market today.The only drawbacks are (a) it lacks full MS Office, and has a viewer package instead.  I can't imagine how anyone could actually edit a Microsoft Office document on their PDA, however... I'd have to be pretty desperate and (b) no touchscreen, but uses a wheel instead.It's about half the price Cingular is expected to charge for the Treo 700w, and has 90% of the functionality.  Direct Push works beautifully from my company's MS Exchange server, and battery life is better than most Windows Mobile phones.  Using the new (supplied) 3G SIM card, dropped calls from SIM card failures seem to be a thing of the past.  I highly recommend this smartphone if your company is committed to the Windows Mobile platform.
This is the first smartphone that I've owned -- and what a great introduction!  Since my last phone was a RAZR, I was spoiled by the ultra slim form.  With this phone, it fits just as comfortably in my pocket as the RAZR, but with 10 times the power and productivity.The only thing missing?  Wi-Fi connectivity, but it probably would have resulted in a bulkier phone.Also, the phone didn't come with a traditional instruction manual, just a "Quick-Start" guide, so there has been a lot of trial and error with this phone, especially with regards to shortcuts and navigation.  If you're unfamiliar with smartphones (like I was), it might take some time to get it all figured out.  But that's been part of the fun!Overall, a wonderful phone - superb sound quality, decent camera and just fun to use!PROS:-Thin-Full QWERTY keyboard-Excellent call sound quality-Fast 3G internet w/ full web browser-Plays Mp3s-Micro SD slot for extra storage-Alarm works even when ringer is silent!  (Takes some tweaking and, Yes, this feature is a big deal)-Comes with extra battery that can be charged without being inside the phoneCONS-No Wi-Fi-Battery drains quickly (still better than the Motorola Q from what I hear, but should be charged daily just to be safe)-No 8mm headphone jack (Why do cellphone companies keep doing this!?)
I have to confess that this is the first PDA cell phone that I've purchased even though I work in IT for a living.  I've resisted the crackberry for as long as I possibly could.  But no more...I did try out the Treo 680 and found it to be dated.  I remember using the Palm OS back in the late 90's and the Treo is still using it.  The Treo graphics weren't as sharp or crisp either.So I ended up with the Blackjack.  And I have to say that I'm really enjoying it so far.  The battery life was an issue or so I've read but I've found a way around it.  Just turn off the Bluetooth and you're fine.  Bluetooth eats the battery.  And while I work, I just keep the phone charged via the USB cable.  I have not had a battery issue since.That being said, the navigation controls are a little bit cramped.  I do find myself hitting the wrong button at times.  The OS is a little bit slow at times.  That's life.  Nothing is perfect and nor is this phone.  But it's pretty darn close.  I like the OS a lot.  I found out how to drag and drop files onto my phone.  I've got a 2GB micro SD card in here and listen to music at the gym with my phone.  I love being able to tweat pieces of the start menu just by using Windows and the USB cable to browse out to the phone.That being said, I'm very happy.  I've ditched my PDA and I walk around with my contacts 24/7.  Sending email from the road is a snap and I'm in touch more often than not.  I'd recommend this phone over the Treo in a heartbeat.  Can speak to the Blackberry but I will say the color on this phone is sharper than the Blackberry Pearl and 8730.  I also can't say whether this phone is better than the Cingular 8525.  It just looked too big compared to the sleek Blackberry.
I have had cingular service for a long time now.  I have also had my fare share of phones, lately everything from a razor to a blackberry.  I love the blackjack.If you dont need all the extras stay with something like the razor.If you are looking for a phone that can do just about anything go with the blackjack.  I bought it after having a blackberry for a year.  The blackjack blows my blackberry out of the water.  It does everything my blackberry could do and more.I use my new blackjack with my Mac and it works perfectly with the aftermarket software "the missing sync".  I highly suggest this software if you are mac user with this phone.All in all this is the best phone I have ever had with cingular.
I have a Blackjack, and would echo the comments of the other reviewers that it is in most respects an excellent phone - although having coming from the Treo / Palm world, the Windows Mobile UI seems hard to use and confusing.I just want to make clear, however, that this phone doesn't run Java based Google mobile apps like Gmail or Google Local well, and constantly asks for permission to connect. If you care about running Java apps like this which require a data connection, then until Cingular fixes this problem, this phone is not for you.
All and all It's not a bad little phone, The sound quality is good, reliable reception in places where other phones drop out... but there are some bugs.1. If you're going to connect it to a laptop to use as a modem via USB, beware it won't charge from USB and will deplete a fully charged battery in an hour or so.  I'd shop for something else for this application.2. Seems a little squirlly when switching between activesync and modem mode, or from 3G to Edge; sometimes I loose imap email connectivity, not sure what's causing this - maybe something I'm doing wrong, but can't find anything in the documentation.3.  Difficulty when connecting to websites that require a logon such as ebay or web email.  For somereason it does something to the logon info.  I'm still troubleshooting this too.  Have heard others having similar problems.4.  User manual is pretty brief and sketchy, doesn't provide a lot of info like modem setup and troubleshooting, error codes.  Samsung and Cingluar websites don't offer a lot of KB help either.Maybe Samsung will fix some of these bugs in a future firmware release.Otherwise it's a pretty slick little phone, the slim design fits easily into a shirt pocket, the buttons for answer and hang up are big compared to other keys and easy to answer.  Nice little toy.
I will say that the most annoying part of a cell phone is the latency associated with navigating the menus, browsing the web, etc. My razr is so slow to go through menus, to cycle through contacts rapidly, browsing the web is a chore. I get so mad waiting for the phone to react even though it only takes a few extra seconds it will sometimes miss key strokes and is just painful to use when it is so delayed.The blackjack is not as bad as the razr and navigating the menus is pretty quick. There is occasional slow downs if memory is low and you try to do something that requires several menus to go by in rapid succession (for example ending a call and then quickly pulling up contacts to make a new call will take like 5 seconds). HOWEVER, web browsing on this clunker is very very slow. Even with 3G the latency is horrible. You can expect very slow responses when going through multiple pages/frames, etc. If you want to download large files, it goes very fast. If you want to browse the web as quickly as on a computer, the blackjack is no way going to make you happy and it is quite frustrating in the number of pages that have to be refreshed/reloaded in order to load since many times it hangs.Using the Gmail app to check my Inbox takes about 40 seconds from main screen to seeing new messages but the amount of data (3G or EDGE or GPRS) is very small, the phone just can't process the data fast enough and the network's latency (or the phone's networking latency) makes this a very slow process.This is due to the phone, not the 3G speeds. The phone just doesn't have the computing power to load web pages quickly and make browsing the web the same as on a computer with just a smaller screen. It also doesn't come with a flash player which makes many websites have problems.Also I live right in the middle of Philadelphia and sitting on my couch I go from having 3-4 bars of 3G to four bars of EDGE even though I haven't moved. The 3G coverage is not consistent and the phone seems to pick it up when it feels like it.
I'll echo the two previous reviews.  I love the clarity and brightness of the screen, and the many thoughtful features.  It takes a while to get used to the tiny keys which are harder to use than the Blackberry or Treo products, but eventually quite usable.  The scroll wheel is a big help and the back key really helps, once you figure out where it's likely to take you.  The menus are NOT as user intuitive as they could be, however, and I hope they'll revise them in a future iteration/upgrade.  They could have given more interesting choices in the included ringtones.  One fabulously annoying thing: the LOUD whooshing sound they included for the "turn on" and an equally noxious sound for the "turn off" of the device.  And all the other sounds can be changed or muted or added to, but not these.  You just can't get rid of them and that makes it astoundingly embarrassing when trying to turn your phone off at a meeting or in a conference.  This was simply stupid designing by some committee somewhere.All in all, the best sound quality of any phone I've yet had; a great form factor which is easy to hold and deal with, and easy to use synching with Outlook --- if you have just your own computer to deal with.  When dealing with Microsoft Exchange Server -- you're out of luck unless you have a great IT tech (as we do) who after an hour of fiddling, found a document by googling that gave a work-around so we could synch with our Outlook, Calendar, etc.  However, it will only synch with your 'personal' calendar and since we've got a company wide calendar and a personal, it would be helpful if one could synch with two calendars as some phone/pda's can currently do.I recommend the phone most highly.
I've had the Blackjack for just over a month now - and I love it. I've had several phones in my time, but this one takes the cake. Not only is the battery life great, but the phone came with an extra battery and a charger (for the second battery). If my phone is low on battery power, I just switch out the batteries! Obviously you can charge the phone directly as well.The screen looks great and the camera actually takes great pictures (better than any camera phone I've owned before - even other 1.3 megapixel cameras). I highly recommend this phone. SamSung has really proved themselves this time.
I am going to purchase a Blackjack as soon as my Nextel contract expires... I have been using an iPaq for a PDA.  My question is... and this is directed to those who have used Windows Mobile before... - is the Pocket Outlook in the Blackjack the same as the Pocket Outlook in any other PDA using Windows Mobile?I have a database loaded in my Ipaq that I can sort based on company names (in a list) and need to make sure I will not lose this functionality with the Blackjack.Also... is everyone using one of the Media Bundles for their data service, or do you have to use Data Connect (which I think is more expensive and does the same thing)?Thanks
I love this phone its rly cool when u open and close it it makes sounds lmao! it has a 2 megapixel camera wit flash, mp3 plyer (u can make the songs as ur ring tone not lke i-tunes). The fone is very sleek and is lke the size of a krzr. If you are ordering tjhis from the US then you are one of the first b/c they only sell them in Japan right now and its goin to be a ehile untill it gets to the US market. The downside is that when u install the sim card u need to rly press on it to go down and u also need to buy a mico card to store songs and stuff( but it u have a slvr use the one that they gave you). Over all i rate this fone 5 stars b/c of its quality and function.
This phone designed for the tween set is good in theory, but the company's terms & conditions, which are not clearly spelled out anywhere obvious, get you to keep dumping money into it, even if you're not using the minutes.  I had activated my phone over the summer, but never used it.  When I went to give it to my daughter to take somewhere, I was puzzled when I tested it and was told that was not a valid phone number.  Apparently, once the minutes are activated, you have 90 days to either use them or buy more, after which the minutes expire.  To reactiviate, you have to purchase a new SIMS card at $25!  This was supposed to be mostly for emergency use, I certainly don't need more minutes every 90 days.  I plan to wait until my kids are older and  will see more use out of it.
You cant go wrong with this phone for the price...it has so many up to date features..Camera, Video Camera, Mp3 Player Bluetooth, Edge, Up to 1 Gig of external memory...keep in mind it doesnt have a 1.3 megapixel camera with a flash like others...also the Bluetooth is the 1.2 version not 2.0...it doesnt have a voice recorder..no external color screen..its black and white...also the internal memory is only 5 Mb ..one other thing if you use a Motorola phone you know that to switch the ring preferences you have to press two buttons at the same time...and even though this is the case some times the ring preferences can change without you knowing in you pocket or purse...this is one of things Motorla hasnt changed since the last models...but again...you cant find a phone with this many features and that performs this well for this price on the market today..Motorola is the cell phone leader...continues to innovate and change the market...one word for you...HELLOMOTO
