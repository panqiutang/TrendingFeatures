I was given two i730's, use one on Boost Mobile. Loud speaker phone,loud ring tones, GPS works well, quality of phone calls is very good.All though the phone has been discontinued, batteries, etc should beavailable for quite awhile.
I have had this phone for 2 years and have had no major problems with it.  The only drawback I have found is that the screen can get scratched up pretty easily even when the clam shell is closed.  Great phone, I would recommend it.
I have had this phone a LONG time....it has been excellent.I recommend it to anyone
I had this phone for 4 years and just gave it away for an upgrade, which turn out to be a mistake.  The ringers are loud, very sturdy especially if you place a leather cover on it.  It may not be a MP3 player with all the BELLS AND WHISTLES but the radio is a great feature that others "wish they had".  I've owned nothing but Nokias and have never had any mechanical issues with their phones.  If your looking for something basic (radio, phone, ringers, text and some internet) this is a very dependable phone, despite the small display/keypad.
I've never had a problem with my PM-8200, I've owned lots of cell phones & been with lots of different carriers too. Sprint has been a pleasure to work with, and my phone's been a truly flawless performer. This truly is the Swiss Army knife of old school flip phones, the only gripe I have is that you can't get EvDO access with this phone, but that's not the fault of Sanyo or Sprint, it's just an older phone. But still excellent non the less !
The Palm Treo 600 has worked flawlessly since day one - if it would work with the CDMA system Verizon is on (the only service I get at our new house) I would definitely keep it, but its on GSM with Cingular/ATT which has incredibly poor service in my new area. If there is any service available this phone will pick it up where others wont. Add to it all the features this smartphone adds and its a great piece of equipment at a now killer price since the new models have emerged (& are having problems this older model doesnt). IMO you cant go wrong with this phone, and I have 3 other friends with the sale model that love it just as much.
I have always liked palm products. We use them in our business and they do save us a lot of time. I purchased this product to save myself from having to carry a palm and a phone.The good:Very loud ringer.Plays MP3's with a mini sd card and free player ava on download.com.Nice looking and feels well made when holding it in your hand.Uses Palm software for 100's of software titles.Keyboard is easy to use.The Bad:No properly functioning alarm clock. One can be purchased for $20!!!Has a huge delay when answering a phone call for the caller to hear your "Hello"Case is "slick" and is easy to fall out of your hand when talking.Charging system is junk. Broke 1st day It arrived.If phone falls just right it is broke beyond repair.I truly loved this phone but it just is not a real business phone. It does what it is supposed to do, but can not stand up to the slighest drop or "real world" hazards. I have an el-cheapo phone that has been through a war and still works and cost $49. For the original price of this I would expect the same. I would recommend buying another phone, as the quality is really bad.
exact product at an affordable price w a smooth transaction
I got this phone over three years ago. It doesn't have many features, but it has worn like iron and that matters more. The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, "What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)
I buy this phone few days a go and have a good signal, fast charging and good sound.I have some problems with the backup battery and with the main battery, but only need change the both and phone works great.The phone is sheap for all applications installed in the phone. I recomended.
I got this phone a few years ago when it came out. At the time, camera phones were the coolest thing in school, and I thought this phone was useless. Now, years later, I'm still using it. This phone doesn't have many fancy features, but it works fine for placing a call and text messaging.Also, charge it to full and you're set for at least 3 days. I have run it on the last battery bar for 4 or 5 days before without any trouble from it.The most amazing thing to me about this phone is its durability. When I first got it I thought it felt cheap, and I was sure it would break quickly. I have dropped it many times on concrete, let it sit in water, dropped it in mud, and on one occasion it was hit with a sword, and yet I have had no problems at all with this phone. Simply put, this thing is a tank.If you don't need all the fancy functions like cameras, computer sync, speaker phone, and all that, this phone is fantastic, especially for the price. It won't ever fail on you.
I've had this phone for nearly three years.  During that time, I can't deny that it's had its flaws, but they have been largely overshadowed by the excellent service this phone has provided me with.  However, for the sake of this review, I'll detail the main annoyances:-No speakerphone-Call logs display name only and NOT the number.  Very inconvenient when trying to quickly call people back.-Can only send SMS messages to one recipient; no mass-texting.  Works with MMS, but is a hassle.-Volume can be a little low, though this is only occasional-Occasional quirks (resets randomly?  very occasional)Now, for the good parts:-Good sound quality (to my ears)-Excellent battery life-Snappy performance (I've used my fair share of unresponsive phones that are a pain to use)-Well-built keypad, good tactile response (great for texting)-Decent camera-Calendar and other apps work greatAnd here's the most amazing part for me:I've dropped this phone numerous times onto hard cement.  It's been all over the country with me, in pockets, backpacks, left on the ground in the snow, and it's even gone swimming with me in a fairly filthy lake.  That's right:this phone survived a swim in the lake, as well as  a subsequent drying cycle in the clothes dryer.How many other phones can you say that about?  This phone Will.  Not.  Break.  Period.  Way to go Samsung!
This phone has several problems:No speakerphone.Volume control on the outside does not control audio volume; it controls keypad volume -- who needs that?There's no standard jack for downloading photos; you have to buy theirs.
I've been with T-Mobile To Go for 2 years or so now. Started carrying one when I started cycling with my daughter. The coverage in the Atlanta area is great, and I've had few problems when traveling. On the rare occasions I've had to visit a T-Mobile store, they've been most helpful, even to the point of directing me to other merchants for cheaper products!Most amazing thing about To Go? Free "T-Zones." This service lets you browse select web sites (CNN, ABC News, ESPN) AT NO CHARGE! As a Red Sox/Patriots fan living in Georgia, it's a great way to keep up with scores, etc.If you are a casual user like me, with the odd two minute call here and again, this is a great service. No daily fees. No roaming. Like the ad says: straight up prepaid.My little secret for affordability? I have an Amazon Visa card that gives me $25 gift certificates as rewards. I use these to buy refill cards. End result-free air time.If you do go w/ To Go, do yourself a favor, and load up $100 worth of minutes immediately. This puts you in the GOLD level, all your minutes are now a flat $0.10 per, and they don't expire for a year. From that point forward, it doesn't matter what denomination card you buy, the rate's the same.I've had such good luck with T Mobile to Go, I got one for my daughter (11 years old). You can find basic To Go starter kits ultra cheap at various big box retailers. If you want a phone with more features, Amazon has them at good prices.FAIR WARNING: If you're a heavy texter/talker, stay away. Texting used to be free (to receive), but now it's $0.10 to send, $0.05 to receive. And obviously, if you talk a lot, you'll burn through minutes like kindling.However, If you're a disciplined occasional user, it's tough to top T Mobile To Go.
Be warned. I found the hard way! Purchased $25 T-Mobile Refill Card a month ago. Tried to use it today, T-Mobile rep says the card is void. A call to Amazon rep and here is the response: Prepaid cards are non-returnable, non-replaceable, non-refundable. Amazon will take your money and has no obligation to show anything for it. Consider yourself warned. I am not buying any cards from Amazon again. Full me once, shame on you....
T-mobile does what it says 25 phone you get 25 dollars.
This is my type of phone service. Just spend the $100 ahead of time, and you are covered for a long time. Your airtime usage is instantly reflected on the balance, which you can check directly from the cell phone, so there are no surprises. The plan is simple and there is no contract to sign. No need to balance the monthly usage nor juggle with roll-over minutes.Except for free long distance, it does lack most of the features a regular monthly account has (free night/weekend minutes, free mobile to mobile etc.), so it's not for everybody. But if you use less than 100 minutes per month, this plan is hard to beat.
I don't believe you'll find a better value in prepaid wireless minutes anywhere.
Switched over from tracphone.  Been very happy with both the new phone and 1000 minutes for $100.
This seems to be the best prepaid deal out there. With no daily charges and a flat 10 cents per minute is what has kept me going for 2 years now.Being a very light user, monthly plans just do not work for me. Also, I hate paying daily charges or 25 cent that other carriers ask.T-Mobile prepaid coverage is thinner than others, but it works for me. Overall, I just love it.Cons: No data plan. Internet is very limited to a few news sites that tzone exposes. I wish I had an option for Internet usage, even with a fee like $10 a month. Tmobile does not have 3G anyways, yet.
This prepaid plan at 10 cents a minute is hard to beat. In fact my unused minutes also got upgraded to this rate.
You guys actually can buy this $100 refill card on ebay for like $90... that makes it 9c/min
T- Mobile is TrrriiFFccc!  Reliable, and once You place a $100.00 amount on Your account, there after You continue to get 15% more minutes and even putting $10.00 You minutes expire in 1 Year.
This is the best deal on prepaid cards. I prefer prepaid because I don't utilize my mobile a great deal to justify a monthly plan.
Had T-Mobile prepaid for about 5 months before I had to switch.  Aside from billing disputes and questionable charges for prepaid minutes, T-Mobile is horrible on several levels.  Coverage is terrible and customer service has been a nightmare (I suggest you record your phone calls).  I now have Virgin and the difference is immediately noticeable - 3-4 bars  of signal strength as opposed to 0-1, the phone actually rings now when I get a call, and text messages arrive instantaneously rather than a week later.  So, if you like poor coverage and customer service, I highly recommend T-Mobile.  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
This is an awesome phone. I have owned it for about 2 years now and it's actually my second one! I cracked the screen on my first one (my fault) and I had to get the same one. I can watch 2 DVD movies or listen to music all day long without worrying about recharging. A 4 GB SD card works great on the phone. I cannot imagine living without this thing. A++++ product!
This is my first smartphone, and let me say, I am really liking the functionality of it. I bought it mainly because I have been looking for a phone that I could use as an mp3 player as well, and for only $80, its a steal. I also love texting with the full QWERTY keyboard.I almost didn't buy this phone after reading some of the reviews. However, the 2 or 3 reasons I read that people didn't like it for, were in fact incorrect.1. Yes, the ringtones that come with it are virtually inaudible, but it does support mp3 ringtones. If you add an mp3 to your media library(from your sd card) it should be in the ringtone section. Or what I did, after you have installed activesync on your computer, just go to the folder that holds all the default ringtones, and upload your ringtones there. They are plenty loud, actually they are louder than my Razr V3 ringtones. No problem hearing them ever.2. Size. Everyone says this thing is massive. Its pretty big, yeah. But it is no bigger than a Sidekick 3. In fact, I bought a Sidekick pouch for it, and it fits perfectly, so if sidekicks are too big for you, then dont get it, otherwise, size isn't a big deal.Only kind of bad thing I can say about this phone is its battery life, and it's not that bad. I listen to music about 4 hours at work, and at the end of my  9 hour shift, It's usually around 55% left. Whats weird is when it finishes charging, and you leave it plugged in, it still drains the battery. Not as fast as if it weren't plugged in, but it does go down.So dont go by the bad reviews on here, for $80, try it out, its easily worth that much.
if you watch this show at all, you don't need to be talked into the DVD.  It's worth every penny if you are a fan...otherwise you can always catch it in syndication now :)
Here are some pros & cons of this oh so handy smartphonepros: 200mhz Intel xscale processor, qwerty keyboard, sd card slot, extremely low price, huge display, MS DOS platform os (windows mobile), you can add wifi, intuitive controls, good external speaker, speedy mail client,ir port for all kinds of peripherals, small for a smartphone (equaled only by the HTC SDA, no need to find an unlocker for it.cons: no camera (just get a normal camera, what's the point?), ugly (who looks at your phone?), does not work without a sim(like that matters), no bluetooth (who uses it anyways?), hard to find accessories(cases, docks, spare batteries.
Good purchase, good buying for the price, but...CONS: pocket Win always is slower and you need to be closing apps to keep enough memory, BATERY! you have to keep charging everyday.PROS: good resolution, excelent idea the expandable keyboard, functionality super, nice apps online like CONTACTS PRO, EPOCRATES (for medics), SKYSCAPE software. Cool you can personalize sound callers, and put photo on it (Ctacts pro soft), good reception, no compatibility troubles using it with Latin America companie`s SIM.Always recomendable, it depends on you if consider better or not than treo.Have fun and try it!!
I got my Voq just about a year ago and have been using it every day since. It has tons of great features and for such a low price, so who wouldn't want to try it out? This a fully-enabled smartphone, with all the applications and such of any other windows smartphone, such as Windows Media Player mobile (I listen to MP3s all the time) and Internet Explorer (if you look it up, you can get internet for only 6 bucks a month!). The included "myVoq" program makes searching for contacts and other items a breeze (it works much like spotlight on the mac). The keyboard is great for texting, email, and, for forgetful ones like me, notes and the pocket outlook calendar. The included SD card slot allows me to take my movies, music, photos, and documents on the go, which can all be accessed by various programs on the Voq's beautiful backlit color screen. This smartphone holds a charge for about 2-4 days for me, depending upon usage - if I just use it for a few calls and the calendar for a few days, it can last for about 3-4 days. But as soon as you start listening to music or, especially, using the internet, that battery starts going down, but you still usually get at least 2 days out of it. The phone gets great reception - not the best, but close. Voices come in and go out loud and clear. This smartphone is comfortable to hold in one's hand and isn't as large or heavy as many reviews might have you believe - it is still large though.Things of note:The contacts feature is crazy awesome! You can input all sorts of info, including a 3rd email, address, etc, anniversaries, birthdates, and even the names of people's kids! And on top of that, there's a feature to add extra "notes" so if there isn't a field you see that you want to write something about someone down in, you can just utilize that. Also, the calendar feature is great, acting much like Outlook on the PC with reminders and all that. Also, build quality is excellent - after a year, the thing still feels practically new, despite the fact that I carry it around in my pocket all day.The two first reactions I always get from this phone are: Man, that thing is huge! and That keyboard is so freaking cool! The phone is fairly large (you'll need to reserve a whole pocket for it, trust me) but all of the features make up for it.Pros:-Full-featured Windows Smartphone-Cheap now!-SD Card slot (regular, not mini!)-"Freakin' cool" keyboard-Sweet contacts - lots of info inputs for people, if you need it.-Awesome, intuitive calendar-Great as a phone, too!-Excellent quality-Cheap internet! (once you follow the easy steps to configure it right)-myVoq search finds everything you need easily.Cons:-No official support because they've been discontinued (but I haven't had any problems yet...)-No camera (I miss this feature sometimes from my old phone, but less now)-No wifi-A little bulky-Charge, for some, may be inadequate (2-4 days)Bottom Line: A phone packed with features and quality, well worth the low, low price it is now (even well worth the $140 bucks I originally spent on it).NOTE: Buy an iPod sock or a Gameboy Micro sock to put this thing in - trust me, it keeps out most of the dust and protects the screen without being too bulky for your pocket!
contrary to what some of the other reviews say, there is no way to make the ringtones any louder as far as I can tell.  I tried to play an mp3 on it and it sounds just the same.  Also, i'm not sure the vibrate function works.  I haven't notice any vibrations from my phone.  and yes it is kinda big.  a girl would not put this in a pocket; it would have to go in a purse.
For a smart phone, it is worth the money.  It might be bulkier and heavier than you might want, but considering the price, I am happy with it.
This is one of the funniest shows on TV in a long time. The cast is wonderful (but I do wish Turk and Carla would call each other something other than "baby" all the time). Keep it going!!
The cell phone we received is perfectly fine. No problems of any kind and the price was very reasonable. Thank you.
You'll laugh untill you actually need medical assistance... and even so... you'll keep laughing
Everything is good. The only bad thing which is more important than anything else, that this phone is unstable. Sometimes it doesn't recieve calls, has some problems with conection with personal computer and so on.I am about to sell it back.
I am surprised at the quality of this unlocked phone. I just slipped the SIM into place and it was ready to go. In Nicaragua it works just simply perfect. The configuration for Internet access was time-consuming though. My friends told me that it rather looks like a remote control but after seeing all of the features they all got shocked. Indeed, it was a smart buy for a smartphone
I found the series through syndication, and have been hooked ever since.  I purchased the 1st & 2nd seasons together.  There are few shows on TV to watch, but if you want a truly funny, intelligent-well written show with a talented cast, who complement each other, this is a show for you!!! My son and niece are now hooked as well.
The second season of Scrubs is just as good and just as funny as anything the first season had to offer.  So, if you bought the first and are considering buying the second, I would highly recommend doing so.  You'll laugh your way through these episodes too!
I love scrubs, and I feel that the second season is a great collection to own. 'Overkill' leads off season two, this episode is a favorite of mine and my wifes. There are some great episodes in this collection, and it has become a goto when there is nothing good on TiVo. Highly recommended.
Quirky humor reigns supreme in the second season of "Scrubs"...Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke and friends truly hit their stride as their respective characters and turn in consistantly solid performances. This is the season in which "Scrubs" earned its place as NBC's successor to "Friends," nicely filling the daunting shoes left by the legendary series. The fantasy sequences are delightfully original and the guest stars (one ridiculously hot Amy Smart as the "Tasty Coma Wife") each seem to have years worth of chemistry with the regular cast. A great season of a truly great show.
This is one of the best shows on TV, and it's great to be able to go back and re-watch the previous seasons. Season 2 is great, picking up right where the cliffhanger left us in Season 1. Scrubs will make you laugh, make you cry, and might make you start saying banana hammock.... buy it!
Scrubs is one of those underrated comedies that deserves a much bigger audience.  The comedy is smart but silly.  The show also has an amazing ability to move quickly between funny and serious, where you are laughing one moment and tearing up the next.  Also, the characters are all wonderful (except maybe the janitor who sometimes gets repetitive) and I especially appreciate the close relationship between JD and Turk.  I just can't say enough about how much I love this show.
I am writing this review after using this phone for almost 4 months.Advantages:1] Price is lesssss.Disadvantages:1] Bulky2] No great looks3] Battery - big issue4] Although it have bulky and tough looks, its not that tough to handle shocks. It fell twice from my hand, and then its speaker and headsets connection has got problem. Loud speaker never works now.5] Has Infrared, No bluetooth - Wireless connectivity not possible.6] After using this phone, I shifted to my original phone (Samsung T810) and then I had to call my mobile service provider to reconfigure my original phone.7] Check the frequencies, because it won't work abroad other than US.8] Am writing this 8th point on Feb 29th 2008. I have trashed this phone after using it for 4.5 months as I had no options left because it stopped working. Go for it if you want to gift it to a small kid who likes to break things, as this phone will automatically break after few months. And better don't scold your kid after its broken because you won't be able to know whether your kid broke it or it automatically got broken.I have read good reviews about this product but I would suggest not to go for this product although its cheap. My best wishes to all of those who are still going to purchase this crap.
I don't know why I never watched this show years ago, but I'm hooked.I mainly bought this season for the "my overkill" episode...It's great
J.D., Turk and Elliott get promoted to residents - now having responsibility for the training of a new group of interns while they continue their own learning.  Heather Locklear appears as a seductive pharmaceutical representative (almost ensnaring Dr. Cox), and John Ritter appears as J.D.'s dad.  Good material.
It is nice phone but it is bulky and outdate. If you want camera opt for another phone.
Ok phone, but there are some snags.  It doesn't support MP3 files for ringtones and the ones with the phone are almost inaudible.  The software didn't load on my laptop, so I can't sync any files.  It's only a pity that Sierra Wireless doesn't provide any more support for this item.  Getting a spare battery or other accessories is virtually impossible.Otherwise though, it sends and receives calls fine.
My dvd box set was shipped quickly and came to me also in quick fashion. It was also in perfect shape. There was no way you could tell I had not gotten it fresh from the store shelf. Only for a heck of a lot less cash. I got Scrubs as a present for my sister's brithday.  She's a huge fan, while I hate the show so bad it's not even funny.  I have to say she's fully enjoyed it and when she saw it her eyes lit up. I have nothing but good things to say about the brillant people who sold to me.
This phone has a major problem!  It has no reset button!  After I had it for 2 weeks, the phone locked up.  Turning it off and removing the battery did no good.  While it worked I really loved it, but how can I recommend it when there is no way to do a reset? Even at $89 this phone is too expensive!
This phone takes some time to figure out things. But still after I read all the manual there are problems I can't resolve. Contacted technical support several times with one answer upgrade the software although the software is the latest version. I can't press options once I call any number. Like if it says press 4 to to do something once pressed it says invalid entry. i switch to my old phone and it works fine so it is not the srvice it is the phone itself. I can't use any phone cards any options useless so far. Still trying to solve my problem.
duuude.. ive looked at this phone before but wasnt sure about it.. but an 80 dollar phone w/windows mobile .. thats INSANE!!!.. this phone is obiously not for everyone.. but if your like me and live on a shoestring budget..haha... well this phone is worth it BUDDIE!!...ive worked in the cell phone business way to long to know that battery life is not the best on alot of major phones,,,especially fully featured phone. so suk it up buy three of them so wen theyre completely gone u can sell them for more.haha...jk... but seriously 80 bucks and some change.. what have u got to lose...  oh  n by the way, some people are IDIOTS!! with phones, .. ya i said it!!..haha...
It sometimes get the calls and sometimes with out reason doesn't. I have to use my old phone instead.
This phone is really cool and has tons of features, but is missing basic features like; easy and quick way of setting the phone on vibrate, ring tones are extremely low and short, there is no way of adding categories or customizing them to your contacts, etc.Update:This phone ended up dying after four months of use.  There was no support or replacements available.  This is the best example of caveat emptor (buyer beware) that I can think of...  Such excellent potential and way ahead of its time, but not worth $5 now.
The phone I got is defective. The calendar synchronization does not work between pc and cellphone. It always reset the clock on the phone. The phone is difficult to use.
it was an good transition i made over internet.got the phone on time and in good condition as described
Item was fine, no problems with it. It just was just delivered on the end of the time estimate scale.
"Its lithium-ion battery is rated at up to 7.2 hours of digital talk time, and up to 380 hours of digital standby time."  The above statement is part of its "Vital Statistics" but the fact is much far from it.  I charged the phone overnight and it showed completely charged, but the power reading recessed from full to only one on the upper right corner indicator that same evening.  I have only talked mostly about 20 minutes that day.  The reception is the poorest I have ever had among other cell phones, including an older motorola model which I used to have.My purchase was for a 'New' cell phone but the product does not appear like a new one. The package came in very poor condition.  The back cover of the phone was open and the body of the phone was not in a plastic bag like some of its accessaries.  There was a carrying case which was made of very cheap plastic and was broken beyond use. Do not be fooled by the statements: "Ships in Original Packaging: This item ships separately and in the original manufacturer's packaging."Last thing I want to mention is that the charger in the first shipment was an european type (round teeth) and one of them was broken.  I called the "Hasslefreecell" company and left a message. Someone called back the next day or two, promised to send me a new one under the condition that I would write a good review for the product.  I received the charger (wrapped around by a rubber band), but it would not plug in the cell phone. I had to call them again for a new one.  The new one came in a few days later.  Now I got this new one which charges but the power only lasts for about ONE day.I ordered this 'unlocked' multi-frequency cellphone for possible use outside of the U.S. I have so far no chance to try it yet I really doubt about that it will work giving so many other problems I have encountered so far.  As a matter of fact, I am planning to return the product and dispute the payment with American Express.BTW, the package came in with the printing of 'All sales are final'. This is controdictory from its ad placed with Amazon.I strongly suggest that Amazon looks into this company and its advertisement and correct any inadequate behavior there.  I like Amazon and don't want to be scarred away by this "Hasslefreecell" company.Buttom line. This has been my worst internet purchase experience and I will avoid buying on the internet as much as possible now.
Phone arrived very quickly and worked completely fine. Have yet to have any problems. Did not ship with instruction book, not sure if it was suppose to or not, but would order from this company again.
Came on time no problems with company.  Refurb phone did not come with manual.  Plugged in SIM card charged up works like a champ.
I was very please with the item and the ship time was great!  Thanks!  Would order from here again!
i've had my phone for over a year now and in that time i've paid to have the screen fixed 3 times - each time for about $50.  i can still receive and send calls (if i have the number written down or memorized) but i can't text or see who called.  basically, this phone is junk.  be ready to purchase a new phone in a year's time if you get this model.
Bought Motorola v220 . After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden. Heard it's a common problem for v220. Everything else was good...
Does what I need it to do..... make calls!  I don't need the other bells and whistles.
I recently purchased this phone after carrying around a hideously out of date Sony Ericson for the last 4 years (but I am a technology cheapie.) Simply stuff your old SIM card into the phone, turn it on, find your network and your ready to go. Now the bad part - while this is a great phone you will not get signal inside your house. Outside - no problem, inside - well, better keep your other phone handy.Overall the call quality is very good.
I had this phone for about 2 years. With most phones that old, the first thing to go is the battery. With all cell phones, reception and dropped calls are dependent on the network and the coverage where you use the phone. Please be aware that is phone is somewhat out-dated as it was released about 2 1/2 years ago. A good phone to start out with.
I've had this phone for 2 years now, and it's performed fabulously.Highlights: incredibly small, a very loud ringer, quite bright screen, excellent battery life, and very good voice quality. Make no mistake, this phone is for one thing only: talking (okay, or texting). The lack of a color screen, camera, any game you want to play, or MP3 capabilities is an asset, in my book.I live in the Boston area and find network quality to be excellent; always a signal. Typically that's the case when I travel as well.This phone isn't for everyone. I purchased it for the pay-as-you-go plan. (I use it relatively little, only spending about $15 every 2 months, on a "20 cents for the first minute, or 10 cents per minute per day that I use 10 minutes or more" plan. I believe Virgin Mobile no longer offers this plan to new subscribers though.)How's Virgin Mobile customer service? My wife's VM phone, a 1-year-old Vox 8610 (still under warranty), just died 2 weeks ago, and after a quick customer service call, Virgin Mobile Fedexed us a new one just 2 days later. Also when I've called with any questions, I've been extremely happy with the attitude of the reps, and their ability to resolve issues.Downsides: the battery did occasionally need to be popped out and put back in when the unit wouldn't start, but that problem has gone away. (Given that the phone was essentially free, this isn't a big problem to me.)The only thing I'd like to be different is for it to have a built-in headset jack. (Also, buying one of the available laptop-to-cellphone-via-USB chargers is a big help.)All in all, it's a sturdy, great little phone.
I have had this phone for a year and a half. Initially I bought it as a message phone, but now have switched to it as my main phone. It has a lot of features for the buck: i like the built in flashlight (it's quite bright), ability to call up phone numbers or set answer profiles using voice activiation (a great feature for seniors), the ability to recall numbers just by pushing the send button and using the down arrows. You can also see missed call numbers contrary to what someone wrote below. It even has a built in tape recorder for quick memos.I think it is a very attractive little unit and fits nicely in your pocket. The reception is TERRIFIC! i've had friends remark about how "clear" i sound on it. a great improvement over my old land line even. I also get clear signals and very few dropped signals.I am on the $34.99 a month plan with Virgin Mobile and that's sufficient for my use. I like that there is no contracts required and you can easily switch plans as your needs change or even deactivate for awhile. I did research before I bought this on amazon and liked the reviews. I have been very happy with the phone and virgin mobile.This phone's marketing is geared for young people, i am middle aged so the ringtones and general marketing on the site don't speak to me. however, i was able to get billie holliday singing "i'll be seeing you" as my ringtone.This is a GREAT value for the money. The phone is well made and has a nice feel to it. I often use it on speakerphone and set it down while i do other things. Easy to use features. It can be used either as a main phone or a 2nd phone.
I got this phone to replace a Kyocera K-9 and K-10. The batteries for both of those phones were not lasting even a day with no usage.The Nokia Shorty gets a much better signal where the K-9 and K-10 would barely find any signal. Voice quality is better, too. The battery lasts much longer, I can go several days without charging, instead of having to plug-in every night.The Nokia has a very simple interface, and it's easy to use and add contacts, etc. There are a few things I would change if I could, for instance, a "list view" for menus instead of showing one item per page.The ring-tones included with the phone are all targeted to Virgin Mobile's target demographic. There are no ringtones suitable for a business environment, but I almost always have the phone on vibrate only.
Great phone functionality wise, but horrible hardware quality.  My third replacement phone just stopped working- one week after the one year (cingular) warranty expired.All three failures were the same problem- the keypad stops functioning except for the end/power button.I guess it is just a form-before-function problem, as my Nextel Motorola i730 (work phone) doesn't skip a beat after 3 years of drops, tosses, kicks, etc...I'm bitter and I have no other recourse than to post a bad review since Cingular and Motorola now say it's my problem.  I'm sure it will hurt them dearly...  LOL
BE SURE TO READ THE FINE PRINT!!! These phones are not made for the US and therefore do not carry Motorola's one year warranty. I bought one and the keypad has stopped working. The phone is less than a year old so I called Motorola. They told me this phone was manufactured for the United Arab Emerates and there is no warranty coverage. The only option they gave was to buy a new phone with a 10% discount. Do not make the same mistake I did.
This phone sucks!!! I am not usually picky about "technology" products. However, when there is a very noticeable difference between my old, cheaper phone, and a new, more expensive one, I cannot help but wish I bought another phone.Here are the things that I hate about the RAZR the most (there are more, but they are things that I can, more-or-less, tolerate:1. It's too slow. Whenever you're scrolling through a list and pressing a "down" or "up" button a multiple times, it still scrolls with it's usual speed, however, when you stop pressing the button, it keeps on scrolling the number of times that you pressed that button.2. Most downloaded ringtones sound terrible when you play them on this phone. Seriously, it sounds as if you're hitting glass bottles.3. I hate the fact that if you assign a ringtone for a particular contact, this phone plays this ringtone when that contact sends you a text message, instead of just a beep for all incoming text messages. This gets really annoying when you're texting back-and-forth with a person. I don't wanna hear that loud ring every minute. Text messages are not usually urgent. A beep will suffice.4. The phone is not loud enough. I'm not talking about the rings. I'm talking about the fact that it's hard to hear the person on the other line.5. This phone doesn't have a notepad (where you can store miscalleneous information) like all the other phones. Now I have to find "creative" ways in which I can store my information, for example, by saving it as a text message draft.6. Not enough memory for old text messages. All other, cheaper phones let you store a good amount of text messages. This one doesn't.The reason I have this phone 2 stars and not 1, is because there are a few things that I like about the RAZR:1. I like the big screen.2. I like the fact that you can put your phone on "Silent" and still have your alarm ring. This phone allows you to set the volume of the rings for teh incoming calls and the volume for the alarm separately.3. I like the fact that you can set up many alarms and then activate them when you need them.
I've had this phone just about six months.  Total disaster. I flip it open and it goes blank. I touch it gently and it goes blank. Sometimes the screen comes back to life, sometimes I have to press the on button for about 2 minutes to get the screen back. Frustrating and useless is what this phone has become. Most people I know who have this phone hate it. I just ordered the Blackberry Curve. As soon as I get it I'm taking the RAZR V3 and smashing it into a million pieces.
This is some kind of cheap Euro knock-off of the RAZR. I previousluy owned one I got with a T-mobile plan and the second I opened this one I knew it was of inferior quality. I've had it four days and in that time the battery icon has been playing up and one of the side buttons just, well, kinda fell off. It's going back.
Phone died after three months, not covered by Motorola or Amazon... I'm out a couple of hundred bucks....  DO NOT BUY!!!!
This really is the worst phone ever, do not buy it.It breaks without warning, weather it snaps in half, the side things holding the wires fall off, or all the keys come unresponsive.If you want the phone just for the looks (which aren't that great) Make sure you get insurance on it, because it will break.I haven't had this brand of phone for a year yet, and I have gone through four.Worst phone.
I don't like being the first to own a new product, so I waited until the RAZR had been on the market for a long time before buying one for myself.  This is by far the best of many cell phones that I've owned.  The keypad does take a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it works very well.  The signal strength is good, the voice quality (sending and receiving) is good, and the four-band feature is good when traveling outside the USA.  Also, Amazon's price was good.  IT'S ALL GOOD!

I bought this RAZR v3 phone in July to go with my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless prepaid service.  The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.  Nowhere can you find out where this thing is made, but the material and fit and finish are excellent.  I'm very happy with this inexpensive purchase.
I purchased this phone from Amazon and it is exactly as advertised.  The charged is 110v-220v type for Great Britian, and comes with a US adapter.  No problems so far.  I have a sim card for US pre-pay service through T-Moble, and the phone works as well as a cell phone plan.  I also purchased a Germany sim card for my next trip in October.Great purchase.  Highly recommended.
I fell for the stylish look of this phone, but regret getting it. First of all, it's not as small or thin as it looks in ads. It's actually pretty wide for a phone, and not that much thinner than your average (contemporary) phone. It has very low battery power. I'm not a big talker and even I find myself needing to charge this thing once a day. I find this unfortunate because I don't feel like I can rely on it if I have an emergency--the battery'll probably die just when I need it most.The menu is not at all user-friendly and many of the options are counter-intuitive (for example, the "select" button for one screen is the "quit" button on the next screen!). In short, it's very poorly designed and apparently Motorola but very little time into this model before mass marketing it.Finally, there are no games and no good rings on here. You have to download everything you want by way of any games or cool rings with both an internet charge and a per-game or per-ring charge.I think this is a good phone for someone who likes a lot of media bells and whistles and is willing to pay for them. But it's not a good phone for someone practical like me.
The RAZR itself is a great phone, however this unlocked version is designed for Europe.  It has a European style AC charger, but does include an American adapter.  I have T-Mobile service and this phone works with it, but I had one issue.  Whenever I received an email it would send me a garbled text message.  I was able to fix it by searching the internet, but it wasn't easy and I don't remember exactly what I had to do.
This phone was a European RAZR.  I am on Cingular and you cannot link to the web on this phone regardless of what you hear.  Also, none of the SIM card applications work because of this.  The lack of web access really lessens the value of the phone.The phone itself works great -- great reception and great battery life.
Have owned two in the past two years and my daughter has another one.  Reliable, inexpensive, practical, easy to use.  Tons of accesories and add-ons.  One of the best, if not the best, Motorola has ever made.
It will FALL APART!I did not put this phone through anything but the normal, daily use required of any cell phone and yet here it is, only five months later, disintegrating before my very eyes.  Truly.  The whole thing is coming apart like a 3,000 year old bird skeleton. The hinge caps keep falling off, the case is starting to warp, the LCD is becoming unhinged, the release button is broken, and the back plate sits crooked.  Again, I have not done ANYTHING to damage this phone.  This was the result of normal wear and tear. Seriously.In addition to it's short life-span, there were plenty of other problems I experienced during normal use.  The "sweet spot" on both the receiver and the mic were so fine that I found myself pressing and sliding the phone against my head to find the perfect angle. If I didn't, people couldn't hear me or I couldn't hear them.  My phone also experienced a lot of electronic interference with random devices in my house (computer, stereo, TV, robot servant) and I would sometimes have to step outside to get reception.But setting all that aside, the most important factor remains:IT WILL FALL APART!!Do not get a RAZR.  Luckily I had phone insurance.  When I called and asked for a replacement the Cingular operator himself told me that they receive THREE TIMES more RAZR claims than any other phone.  He then suggested I go with an LG CU500.  I haven't received The LG yet so I can't vouch for it over my RAZR, but at this point, anything will do.RAZORS are for SHAVING.  I suggest you keep it that way.
This phone does nothing but evoke anger in me. I bought it because of the features is claims to have yet none of them work. For one the manual, boasts you can use a memory card in it, which is false because this phone features no memory card slot. It says it has MP3 playback and all that but good luck getting any of it on your phone. The phone won't even receive E-mails like it's supposed to. I have a bottom of the line phone from Motorola that's two years old and it has this feature. I have no problem with the phone other then that, it looks great and I don't mind the Keypad. Other then it coming with a damaged LCD screen and the issues I listed above I would have loved to keep it.If you plan to use it for a phone and nothing else it's great but otherwise I'd pass.
I bought this product with high hopes at a high price. It did NOT live up to my expectations at all. The phone is NOT a good value for the money. It shuts off randomly for no apparent reason, often makes a buzzing/static noise and drops calls, then restarts the phone. Sometimes the screen turns black and just wont do anything. First phone I have had to replace at some point during my contract. Pictures are not very good quality, although I could really care less about that. Bottom line is do not buy this phone without SERIOUSLY SHOPPING AROUND FIRST!!!
Bah! Worthless! That's not a testament to the RAZR, just a statement about this particular one! I ordered this phone as a replacement for my damaged RAZR and it was sorely lacking in every department. My original RAZR was awesome. I dropped it (into a puddle, shorting out the keypad) and I decided that since it had served me so well, I would replace it with the upgraded V3 model.For one, it is a European phone. For most things, this shouldn't matter but there are a few terribly niggling details that can't be overlooked. Spelling is all British. "Personalise" is spelled with a "z" instead of an "s" in America. It's a minor detail, but it adds up since every bit of spelling and terminology difers from a normal US phone. You won't know exactly what you're doing if you've used US phones and get this phone. Things are generally in the same spot and named similarly, but it's different enough to be frustrating. Additional example: Dates use the European format of DD-MM-YYYY, instead of MM-DD-YYYY.Texting with this phone is a nightmare. The autocomplete draws from what looks to be French, Italian, Spanish and maybe German as well. I didn't want to delve much more deeply into the phone as I was already irritated beyond measure. My family communicates with texts fairly often and to have the ability to type out a quick text message with the help of autocomplete effectively disabled is simply not acceptable on any level. It turns a 20 second message into a 5 minute message, punching in every single letter.In addition to all that, I plugged the phone in via the European charger + adaptor (with my mind reeling that it's not simply a US charger in the first place) only to find that the battery wouldn't charge. I tried my charger from the old RAZR and got the same problem. Spending this kind of money to talk for maybe 2 hours before needing to get an entirely new battery? No thank you.Lastly, the few calls I tested it on gave terrible reception. I'd blame the destination caller if it weren't to a land line and I'd even blame Cingular/AT&T; if the phone hadn't been reporting perfect service.Now, from other reviews, it sounds like many people get good phones via this order system. I will state this: If you got lucky and pulled a working American RAZR from this draw, congratulations. I say: Once bitten, twice shy. No more buying phones this way for me, not until there's considerable more documentation on-line about what's really going to be shipped.I'll be going to Cingular tomorrow to buy a brand new one after going to the post office to return this piece of junk. The reported price on Amazon is actually well over double what the Cingular/ATT website lists the price as, including not signing a contract.
I have a RAZR and find it attractive, thin (which is nice) and unlike some folks find the interface fairly decent.Problems: needs to be restarted every day.  In many cases, going from one cell to the next causes the phone to drop reception entirely. Once you make a datebook entry, you can 't edit it. At least I have not yet found a way.  Sensitivity stinks to high heaven.After my dismal experience with a StarTac, I doubt I will be a Motorola customer again.  Their drop in quality over the years tells me that yet another fine company is headed for the toilet of history.  I will go back to Nokia and be done with it.
I have been with this RAZR for a few days, but it has been working great. Setup is really easy. It has good reception, feels sturdy, and price from Amazon was really good. I have read here some complains regarding the inability to connect to Internet. it does connect to Internet, but you have to ask your carrier for the browser settings, and set it in your phone.  Unlocked phones rules!!!
The Razr is a great phone, and still the coolest phone around, I have no problems with mine, after of course I got the phone to work. It is actually a V3r - so all the software that ships with it does not work because it (the software) is for a V3. The V3r is a newer model (it is "green") and therefore better than just a V3. However, it is for the Hong Kong market so a lot of the short text messages pre loaded is in Chinese. And even if one changes the language to English the messages will still be in Chinese. It took me a lot of research and hours of reading articles and looking for drivers and software to update the phone until I finally got it to work.Once I got it loaded with the right software, it then started to work great. I like it so much that if anything happens to it I will buy anther Razr.
I bought this phone to replace my very tired and worn out RAZR.  I'm a big fan of the RAZRs.  They don't take a beating like some phones, but they're slim and easy to use.  If you are really hard on your phone, I'd recommend a Nextel instead.This package includes a European charger with a US adapter.  It works just fine but the American version is much more compact.
I highly recommend getting the Amazon supplied Razr as it comes with all the accessories and is always new. I bought one of these from Etronics and it was obviously refurb being passed off with new and came only with a charger. Amazon provides the leather case, charger, headset and data transfer cord with CD.
I work with cell phones all day, so I see a lot of cool phones out there.  This phone, while not the top of the line, is certainly a solid phone with a crisp, if low, sound.  It's pretty comparable to the SLVR, which I had before this phone.  (The SLVR's display cracked.)Like other reviewers have probably mentioned, it is a little wider compared to even the other members of the Motorola line (such as the KRZR or the SLVR), and I have to admit it felt a little delicate compared to the candybar phone - it's probably just my experience using chunkier phones.  I equate this phone to the Corolla of phones - it's a solid phone, nice little perks, a lot of people have them, but not the top of the line.I received a British English version of the phone, which is perfectly fine with me, and unlike phones sold in the US, it has a number of different languages available on the phone.  (This is a huge perk for me, as most phones in the US only display English/French/Spanish and maybe Portuguese, but the version I received had French, Arabic, German, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish language support.)Pros:- Slimline casing- Proven and popular design- Widely available accessories- Excellent Bluetooth support - buttons are in no danger of being pushed while in handsfree mode if the phone is closed- Wide keys with raised ridges- Unlocked - can be used with any available GSM SIM - even in other countries- Does not support as many low frequencies as Nokia (which gives a clearer talking sound)- Decent speakerphone technology (but not perfect)Cons:- BREW OS - harder to get applications from the computer to the phone- Does not come with Motorola synchronization software- Older OS and less feature-rich than newer phones, even later versions of the RAZR line.- Web key a part of the dialing pad, right above the call key - be careful not to hit it if you don't have a data plan- Low audio signal sometimes - can be very quiet in a high-noise situation.Matter of Opinion:- Motorola menuing system - please note that this system is NOT the one used by U.S. carriers, which normally flashes their own branded menuing system onto the phone (like Verizon).
I purchased this phone to use on a trip to France. The bonus is it worked flawlessly with my Cingular service in the US. This allowed me to take the phone with me as my US phone until I got to France. I purchased a local SIM card and some extra minutes from a France Telecom store, and swapped out my Cingular card. I was connected with a French phone number while I was still in the store. No more hunting for pay phones. The phone also connected easily with my GPS which provided hands-free Bluetooth calls.My only reasons for taking away a star are that the screen, although big and bright, shows too many fingerprints. Also, if there's a way of consolidating phone numbers (work, home, and cell) for one person under a single listing like my LG phone does, I haven't figured that out yet.
I bought the Razr V3 phone because my last phone (Sidekick) had a broken face.  Normally, on a phone that has the face on the outside (Sidekick) it can break if you drop it, which happened to me.  So I bought the V3 thinking that this wouldn't happen to a flip phone.  Well, 10 days after buying it from Amazon, I closed the phone, only to realize when I reopened it that the face had cracked.  I couldn't believe that Motorola would make such a flimsy face and charge so much for the phone.  When I contacted the seller, they said they had a 10 day return policy and would not give me a new phone.  I am now dealing with my insurance company to try and replace the V3. Overall, this has been a lousy experience that I will not repeat.
I have been using Motorola Razr V3 for more than a year now, I have used it in most of the United States and in many places in Europe as well, it has performed very well. The RAZR V3 is a Quadband phone and can be used on any GSM network in the world.For many fans, there's no dispute; The Razr V3 is the coolest looking phone.  The Motorola RAZR V3 is available in a stunning anodized aluminum finish in Silver, Black, Pink, Blue and Maroon.Motorola's Razr is one of the few cell phones that all nationwide wireless operators support, that is simply because Razr V 3 looks great, offers high-speed Web browsing, and has a vibrant screen. In addition to being remarkably thin, only 14 mm., the RAZR V3 is surprisingly lightweight as well, weighing only 95 grams.The Motorola RAZR V3 also allows the user to download videos from the Internet. The Motorola RAZR V3 has been on the market for more than two years, and still a very popular phone.The amazing Bluetooth headset that accompanies Motorola RAZR V3 has a blue LED to signify call status and a multifunction button to answer and end calls.The Motorola RAZR V3 includes a lot of messaging features which include SMS, EMS, MMS and email. Like many other phones it includes date, clock, currency converter, calendar, calculator and alarm clock.The Motorola RAZR V3 is the thinnest flip phone ever made, a mere 14 mm., light weight and very attractive, however, Motorola should increase the phones memory drastically. The essential improved needed for Motorola RAZR V3 is an expandable memory.If you're looking for one of the thinnest and most stylish flip phones on the market and can tolerate few drawbacks, then Motorola RAZR V3 is the phone for you.
This is a great phone with many great features .It is easy to use and very simple for anyone of any age.I recommend it for anyone who needs a great phone with camera and video.I am totally satisfied.
For the price and the company this is a rather dissapointing phone.  Beautiful design, quite practical due to its size, good battery life but sound is not that good, buttons sometimes need to be pressed twice, camera is of quite poor quality and the memory space for the  pictures  is minimal.  After a few months of owning it, I replaced with a different phone as I was getting fustrated especially with its buttons.I hope that motorola improves their future models.
I have no complaints about this phone.  I have Cingular and to this point this is the only phone that gets reception in my house.  I have had a great experience with this phone so far.  I've had it for about 3 months.
I have researched these phones and everyone wants to give you a planThis RAZR UNLOCKED is the ticket for me..... the perfect price withoutthe structured locked in contract plans.
I have had Razrs in the past, and while the quality was occasionally spotty (screen died etc) the functionality of the phone I loved.  This particular version, however, is completely NOT user-friendly.  I should have known when I opened the box and the charger was made for a foreign power source, with a US adapter.Then I tried to text.  An exercise in patience, of which I now have none.  Although it was set to English there are several language options (Turkish, anyone?) and in English, characters came up with all sorts of accents.  The vocabulary, by attempting to integrate so many languages, is abominable. I should not have to teach a T9 type software program 'what' as in the f***?Next issue... you have to tell it to auto-update the date and time, which it may or may not do.Finally - when I pressed and held 1, normal for voicemail right? it started dialing the first number I had saved.  in my SIM.Love the product design but the software on this phone, while trying to accommodate the lowest common denominator around the world, serves no one.  Pay extra from the phone company or a reseller where you know the product was designed for your particular market.
I like the slim line of this phone.  It fits in the pockets in my purse so much better than other phones I've used.  The extra features I've used are easy to use.Only bad things - battery life is much too short!  That seems to be a common complaint.  The screen gets very dirty with each use.  My makeup rubs off on it & it's not easy to get clean.Altogether, a good phone.  The features are easy to use.
I will never buy from this compnay EVER again.  I called their toll free number as well as their local number and never got an answer.  I was on hold for well over an hour.  Also, you can not reach them via e-mail either.  I checked their website for a link under contact us.... nothing.  Never again will I buy from DataVision!!!!!!
few words only...bought the phone JUST for the looks!!!and its the only phone ive had since 2005, last one broke, as the software...the worst ive ever seen!!!likw its looks, buy it...want performance? well, look somewhere else!
Love this phone. Bought it as a replacement for another RAZR that was dropped one too many times. The only thing I had to do was look online to configure the web browser to work with my provider (AT & T) as it was an unlocked phone. It was easy to find and do, otherwise it was ready to go.
I do a lot of international traveling and wanted a second phone to pop a foreign SIM card into (and still be able to use my first phone overseas at the same time.)I cannot imagine that there are many (or ANY) unlocked, quad band phones out there on the market for less money than this.Reception and call quality are both very good.  The phone has a standard USB connector, but did not come with software for connecting to a computer.  I have seen the software selling for almost no money -- so transferring phone numbers to the phone should be possible / easy.Mine came with a quick start guide in english and a full set of instructions in french.  But, with intuitive menus and a reasonable interface I am not sure that a manual is really needed.

Motorola has priced this phone at a very affordable price. This is an excellent GSM capable cellular phone to use before you upgrade to a higher moresophisticated cellular phone. A highly efficent cost friendly cellular phone from Motorola.
I have had this phone for almost two years now and I like it very much. My wife got a Nokia 6102 that needed to be replaced. I can now get a new phone almost for free, but I do not see a reason to get a new one. It has better reception than the Nokia, the call quality is better; it is louder, and much thinner and sturdier.  The battery life is quite good, even after two years of use. I charge it every 5-7 days or so and use it during the day only. A big plus is that you can rearrange the icons so that it will be harder to accidentally access the web and get charged for it. The Nokia and the Samsung SYNC intentionally make that too easy; the SYNC is the worst in that respect. The only thing that is not that great is that the screen is hardly visible in bright sunlight. The SYNC has brighter screen. On the other hand, my RAZR is a two year old model; maybe the newer ones have better screens.Update: 5 years later, the phone is working great. It served me for 7 years and I will be sad when it goes. The call quality is better than any smart phone that I tried.
The phone seems to function alright. The battery that came with the phone was no good within 3 weeks and had to be replaced. Could have just been a faulty battery but didn't last long. It is a UK phone so the symbols are different on the keypad of the phone. Also my blue tooth headpiece has background noise and a much less capable range than my previous V3 phone. Overall this purchase was middle of the road for me.
The only thing I really like about it is the fact that it slips easily into my back pocket.The worst thing about this phone is the battery life, or lack thereof. I get ONE phone call befor the battery dies. It's really ridiculous. Also, the buttons are not well designed - you have to look at them to dial because they are barely raised and don't line up on straight lines. I used to be able to just press the buttons without looking with my other phone - handy when driving.The button on the side that changes it to vibrate, alarm only, all off, etc., OFTEN changes itself. This is not good because you may think that it's on vibrate, when it's actually switched itself over to "all off" or "alarm only." I've missed some very important calls because of this - the phone just never rang.I don't think I'd buy it if I had it to do all over again.
It's too bad the new phones aren't as good as these were. I loved my Razr's & they always worked well as long as you didn't stumble & submerge it in a lake.....
phone works well with my t-mobile plan but not able to send or recieve picture messages.  the wall charger also needed the US attachment to plug in - but was included
This phone is junk!!!! let it fall to the ground over 12" and it will fall apart, let humidity get to it and it's done. If your an on the go person and want something dependable you want to look elsewhere. I woke up this morning and my phone was dead, number two in 90 days. V3 is junk!!!!
this phone is horrible,i never write reviews but i just had to with this piece of junk.i am so angry at everything about this phone, the calls i have are constantly dropped, half the time i dont get calls at all and its not the service because my old phone had the same provider and it was not close to this bad.the battery is horrible, it dies in 4 hours on me even after i bought an extended one.i will try my best not to buy any motorola products because i am just amazed that they would put such a crappy product out.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have received 2 defective Black RAZRs and am now waiting for yet another replacement that will not ship until after the first of the year. If that one is bad I will ask for a refund and buy a different cell phone.
The phone is great, but when we tried to buy ringtones from Cingular, our service provider, we could not get web access on the phone to download them. Cingular tried several things to get the web access to work, but since it wasn't their phone they couldn't. Everything else works great.
I have this phone since october, I changed my sony ericsson T610 because ring was very low and never got to hear it (phone inside my purse and within its case), so I went for Razr. Totally disappointed, menus are very confusing, camera is poor quality, but the worst is battery time I have to charge it every other day even when the phone is "waiting" (I rarely use it). I replaced the battery with a new original one and is the same. Really, if I could rate it with no stars I would do it.
I went ahead and purchased this item even after reading all those negative reviews. Yesterday night it was working. I charged it overnight and today morning it is dead. Please do a favor for yourself. Go ahead and buy one that comes with US warranty.Read the big print. It clearly says it is not covered by any kind of warranty beyond 30 days.Luckily I have an older phone that I can use while I look for another one.
I liked this phone for about a year. Small good looking a resonable camera phone. Then one day after charging it for a night the keyboard sytopped working. The only soft button that would work was the on/off soft button. After looking on the internet it looks like motorola built a bunch of these with bad seals around the back display so humidity will get to the circuit board. I like the phone but it is not relialable.
i bought this to replace a cingular phone and works well. package came with a europe charger and a cheap plug adapter, but had the manuals and everything seemed legitimate. box wasn't sealed and think the product was manufactured in 2005 but again, everything works well.i miss the nokia UI but battery time is okay and reception seems fine. haven't been able to find a driver for vista yet so haven't been able to charge via usb.i would buy this unlocked phone again.
Pretty, little and smart phone! No problems so far, not even after couple of falls!
The only problem I think with this phone is that it is too fragile. It is not as durable as some of those Nokia models or Sony models... Once you drop this one (even from a height of 1 feet), come back here and search for good deals on cell phones, cuz you are gettin' yourself a new one! Congratulations!!!
A good product overall, slim and nice looking, easy to manipulate. I just regret that some of the details are somewhat less practical than on my more basic older phone. For example I miss not being able to have the vibrating mode followed in time by a ring if the phone hasn't been picked up. Usually the vibration is enough to alert you without disturbing everyone around the place...
This RAZR phone is nicely sized and easy to use.  It is not quite as comfortable of a fit on my ear as my old StarTac, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.  Buying an unlocked GSM Quad band phone offers the ability to travel out of the country and connect in to their networks at very reasonable per minute rates.  Also allows you to access stateside or overseas service without long-term contracts (e.g. monthly or prepaid). Although almost of the entire world is using GSM technology, not all US carriers are GSM.  Surely, T-Mobile and Cingular/AT&T; are GSM and there may be a few others. I would make this purchase again.
I bought this item for my wife as a Christmas present. She's very happy with it.
I purchased the phone for my husband for a Christmas gift.  He is very happy with the phone overall, however, this particular phone did not come with an owner's manual in English.  It came with one manual in Czech and one in Slovakian.  It was a bit of a hassle to go to the Motorola website and download the manual which was around 100 pages.  Even then, having read the manual myself, it does not seem to clearly explain how to use many of the functions on the phone.  We have learned more by just playing around with it.  For example, it came programmed to display military time (24 hour clock) and European dates.  The manual offered no guidance regarding how to change that setting.
I'm sure you have done the research by now, but just in case you haven't, please use caution.  I purchased this phone from an on-line retailer back in December 2006.  I was totally unaware that the phone is NOT covered by a US warranty, and that in most cases the Internet Browser does not work in the US. (or anywhere else for that matter, and cannot be downloaded or upgrades)  In the future, I plan on spending the extra $30 dollars and purchase phones directly from the Motorola Site.  This gives me assureance that ALL functions will work in the US, and I have a FULL one year waranty if something doesn't work!
Yes I know. The Razr is no longer the cooles phone on the market, but I still own this own and likt it. The screen is much bigger than in previous models. The reception is very clear, doesnt drop too may calls either. The camera is namesake, does not take very good pictures. But then again it is not meant too. If you want a phone with good sound quality, reception and small size then get this one. if you want all the fancy gizmos and gadgets in your phone then this is prbably not for you.
I have another razer for my other line and wanted to replace the little cheapy Nokia phone I had on the other and am satisfied with the phone I recieved.
My phone got here in no time. i am completly happy with my purchase. My only complaint is the instructions were in spanish a language i do not speak, but i really didn't need them. thanks for a great gift!!!!!!!!
I bought this phone as a gift, it's very good quality, great features!!!  I even have one myself.
I am very happy with the product. Volume could be better, having some problems seting up to bluetooth hands free.
This is the first "expensive" cell phone I've owned. I love the look, feel and performance of this phone. I mainly use it as a phone, although it has a built-in camera, Bluetooth, etc. Works very well with my service provider (T-Mobile).
This phone is really nice. I've owned it for about a yaer and it still works great. Howerver, this is only for that simple user. The only great thing about it is its shape. It has basic camera, video recording, speakerphone, etc, but, it dosent have features like an mp3 player,radio, high quality camera and stuff like that. If your a simple user and just want a slim and sexy phone just to make calls, and most people already own, then this is a good choice.
The phone has been great but the only problem was that we were sent an instruction book in French.  Unfortunately we discovered this once we got overseas with the phone which is very frustrating.
Took time for the battery to function properly and I considered returning the phone. With time it has become reliable. Patience was useful.
But I tried twice to have the software updated to get it to work with my local service provider, T-Mobile.  The online browsing still does not work.  And as for the voice-activated dialing, I can't get that to work, either.  I have another Razer, purchased locally from T-Mobile and it works on that one.
I am very happy with the phone and the price I paid for it, considering that after I lost mine it would have cost me close to $400 to replace it from the store.The only problem is that Cingular can't set up my picture/data sharing because it's a foreign phone.  I believe mine is from Germany and it's a slightly different version, so my provider wasn't able to set that part up.
It may be thin but that is just about its only saving grace. Next to any current Nokia it seems flimsy and poorly made. Not great.
I have long been a fan of Motorola phones, but had been hesitant to buy one as their software had been lacking.  However, after using various different products (Nokia, LG, and Siemens) I came back to Motorola for the price and features.  Additionally, the international portability of an unlocked quad band phone is very important to me.  I was happy to learn that the Motorola software is now intuitive and on par with Nokia and LG.  I am very pleased with this phone.
The product i recieved works very well. I have had no problems so far and have had it for about two weeks now.
Very reasonable price for this gadget. Loved the functions. Everything is very intuitive on it, you don't need to be a tech-maniac to operate it. So far, it is one of the best phones I ever owned.
The battery is almost insignificant, going from full charge to empty in 90 minutes of use.  Good looking phone, but in my area will not go onto the internet although Cingular never disclosed that and continues to charge for the non-service.  I'm changing phones and providers.
Me gusto en cuanto a diseño pero yo estaba acostumbrado a los menus del sony ericsson qe son mas intuitivos, es mi unica qeja, los menus, por lo demas todo bien.
I will have to say that this phone is the most annoying piece of garbage ever. I think it was functional for about 30 min out of the box new. I picked it up from T-Mobile (Also go with Verizon, TMobile eats it!) Limited Text Messages, no ringtones that are worth while, alerts are constant and repetitive for a drained battery ( Here's a tip motorola - save battery power, STOP THE DAMN ALERTS!) Next, how about a functional T9 dictionary, because the suggestions and predictions that this one makes are like wierd spelled w3ird and of instead of the...home instead of good...and people is puprse....I know that it's made for gooks but still keep your slope grammer elsewhere cuz we don't want it in the USA...bottom line...don't waste your money on any motorola cell phone products because they are a parasitic device hellbent on destroying every last hope of a functional and user friendly Cell Phone.
This is a great phone. My only criticism is that it can be hard to read the numbers without reading glasses. Easy to use.
Look at this:1.There is no way to snooze an alarm, you have to open the flip and browse to snooze, already woke up by doing this.If you press external button to silent an alarm it shuts it and alarm will not be active anymore.2.Side buttons ALWAYS pressed accidentally switching ring style to VIBRATE oONLY or to ALL OFF. Which REALLY annoying because you WILL miss the call!!! What the stupid design!!3. Battery SUCKS!4.NO SPEAKER PHONE - if you are working in noisy locations forgetaboutitIT is Really anoing to miss a call for NO REASON but only the reason that side buttons occasionally pressed switched ring to ALL OFF.
This phone is more than I expected it to be in all facets. I recommend it for all.
I purchased over a year ago from Amazon for 279.00. I need an unlocked GSM phone for travel out of the county. It worked fine but it is hard to position on the ear to hear well. Belt clip that came with it broke right away. There are not any good cases for this thing, and I have purchased a few. The blue tooth worked better with it than the actual phone for hearing well. Camera is as bad as everyone says it is. I don't talk alot so I get 3 days on a battery charge. This works well on TMOBILE but when Cingular switched to AT&T; the phone sounds like crap most the time to the person on the other end of the phone. I have 2 sim cards and the TMOBILE service is much better! Someone needs to just make a phone ONLY. I carry a good camera and own an Ipod I never use. So I use the phone, just as a phone.
This is a fine Cell-Phone for making calls, But If You want to use it to get the Internet grom 'ATT', Forget it!
Bought this for my wife and she likes it. Overall happy with phone but really happy for Amazon service!
I have yet to receive this merchandise and their is no contact info. Please help me AMAZON!
The item has been shiped fast, transaction smooth and nice, satisfied with the item. The only thing is that I don't like the disign of the phone and the usage of it, I like silver one over the black.
NICE LOOKING PHONE, NICE LIGHT WEIGHT, BUT OVERALL THE PHONE IS GARBAGE...I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE RAVE WAS ABOUT.
I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say "Insert SIM Card" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone.
A rating in the NEGATIVE 100, NEGATIVE 110 range would be more appropriate for this phone. I've had this phone for about a year and a half - my husband has one also.  We selected this phone because it was cheap and our needs are simple.  We wanted a reliable phone - no camera, no bells, no whistles.  We could not have made a worse choice.  The phone will work on occasion, then will spontaneously shut off, go blank, or give me some error message - "Insert SIM Card" - when the card has never been removed.  My husband's phone is the same way, so I know that it is not just a lemon that I have.  As a matter of fact, we previously had two others (same model) that we exchanged because they were also garbage.  Same problems on those also.  We wrongly attributed it to the service.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY ANYTHING BUT THIS PHONE!!!!
The durability of this phone is what inspired me to write a review. I have dropped this thing more times than what's reasonable, and it takes no damage. Just two days ago, I accidentally slammed into a desk when I had this thing in my pocket and I when I took it out, the top had become separated from the rest of it. It's in two pieces (being held together by duct tape) and it's still making calls and carrying on as if I had just not destroyed part of its casing. I can't possibly understand the bad reviews for this cellphone; it CAN'T be destroyed, the battery is decent (after 2 years of use I can still get about 2 days of regular use before it needs to be recharged...better than what I can say about a lot of the more recent phones), the call clarity if solid, and above all it's easy to use.I paid $160 for this thing two years ago, and I think I've gotten every cent out of it so far (even though it's in two pieces, I'm not going to stop using it). I have no doubt this little phone will serve me reliably for AT LEAST another two years.
This crazy phone will frequently go from full-scale signal to dropping a call while standing in one place. When it happens, the screen goes blank and there is a 20-30 sec delay as it figures out where it is and gets a signal back. Meanwhile you've lost a call. Could be at the beginning of a call or anytime thereafter.Also will give random errors when looking up a number from the contacts list. Frequently comes back with 'error reading smart chip'. Usually have to shut it off and 'reboot'.It is basically a piece of junk.
We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was "blacklisted".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was "like for like" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!!
I got the phone because it was small but I didn't know I'd be sacrificing so much. The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. I get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing. All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone.
i used to have a different phone then transfered the sim cards with my grandma's phone cuz her phone was too complicated. I tried this phone and was actually quite happy! The FM radio is cyrstal clear (not in car) usually and the camera is OK.One thing I have to complain though, the memory is SMALL!!!! its like 3 mega bytes I think...... I just bought a usb cable for the pc to phone but it was the wrong verion so I have to return it! If you buy a cable for this phone please check what version it is because like ALL the usb cables for nokia look alike.I am VERY impressed on the softwere I got at the nokia website. Its a free program that lets you transfer EVERYTHING from pc to phone. You can do this wirelessly or with a cable (which is what im trying to do) but be aware this phone does not have a mp3 player! The message record sorta suks by the way, and if you set a message as a ring tone make sure it isnt  a bunch of scratchy gatars!Yes I would recomend this phone for someone is isnt REALLY into multimedia but it is OK for multimedia nevertheless
16-Jan-2007Feedback about Nokia 6682 phone based on my personal experiencePros:1) The menu keys are fully customizable  in standby mode. i.e. You can customize what you want to access with the essential keys, when your phone is not in use. Remember when you are in a call, the phone has its own preset assignments to these keys, which I don't think could be customized. So this is only applicable when the phone is in standby.You can customize the left selection key, right selection key, up menu key, down menu key, right menu key and left menu key to your own requirements. Customizing 6 keys for my own requirement was more than enough to quickly access all my favorite menu items.You have a variety of options to choose from in order to assign which key does what.For example I have assigned the keys as follows:  Left selection key  => Camera  Right selection key  => Profiles (where I can choose what is the current profile for my phone i.e. Loud, silent, mild - remember the profiles themselves are customizable. i.e. You can create your own profiles as you wish).  Down menu key  => Contacts  Up menu key  => Clock (where I can set the alarm etc.)  Right menu key  => Phone settings (where I can assign which keys to do which function)  Left menu key  => Call logs  Menu center key  => Gallery (See comment # 9 in cons about Menu center key)CUSTOMIZE your keys!!! Though it takes some time this provides you the freedom you want with the phone and believe me it is worth the time!2) The profiles are customizable (See my related note above) and you can create your own profile. OK, you ask what is a profile? Profile is how you choose your phone's behavior. For example 'Loud' could be a profile where you can customize your phone's behavior for an incoming call, messages, key presses etc. Say in 'Loud' profile you can choose to make the phone ring loud for an incoming call, beep loudly for incoming messages, beep on key presses, vibrate on an incoming call etc. You can create your own profile and assign it your favorite name.3) The phone has a separate 'backspace' key. So when you punched something wrong (Say a phone number) you can simply use the backspace key to erase one character at a time.4) The phone has a separate menu key. To access the menu you simply press that menu key on the bottom left. But since I have customized the functionality of 6 of the other keys (as mentioned above) I rarely have the necessity to access the phone's menu per se.5) Separate 'voice command' key on the left side of the phone. To dial someone by voice, just press and hold that button and then speak the name of the person etc. to call their number.6) Nice camera. The pictures I took have come out pretty good so far. And of course you can use those pictures as a wall paper on your phone.7) Though the keys are small, they are so precise smooth and nice to press, you don't have any problems dialing a number etc.8) Great silvery look9) Of course, a separate memory card slot where you can insert your memory card filled with whatever you want to. Music, pictures, videos and all those nice stuff. How much you store is up to you. Of course more you want to store, you need a higher capacity memory card.10) The hands free that comes with the phone is really good, though it is a bit long and I haven't figured out how to shorten it using the adjusters provided. The stereo effect when you talk is pretty good. You will really enjoy it.11) Of course, the blue tooth. I haven't found any issues with it. I have a logitech blue tooth. It took some time for me to figure out how to use it, but once you get hooked to it, nothing like the blue tooth freedom. I haven't tested the limits of the blue tooth with this phone, but you do get those disturbances once you start moving away from the phone. But that is the price to pay for the wireless freedom I guess. Also sometimes people say that they hear some clicking (or other) sound while talking on the blue tooth set, but that problem isn't unique to this phone.12) Sturdy: Yes, the phone is a bit bulky. But that in turn means that is robust and sturdy, particularly for a person like me, who doesn't really handle it very gently! It fits nicely into the pant pocket.13) Key pad lock: Since this isn't a flip phone, it is essential that the key pad of the phone be locked before you put it inside your pocket. Otherwise you can make unintended calls to random numbers! Locking the key pad is the same as any other Nokia phone. To lock the keypad simply press the left selection key and then press the star key. To unlock do the same again.Note: Because of the fact the left selection key enables the lock feature, you will notice a delay when you use the left selection key to access the functionality to which you have assigned it. This is because when you press the left selection key, the phone doesn't really know if you are trying to lock the key pad or if you are trying to access the menu. After a couple of seconds if you didn't press the star key, then the menu item will show up.Cons: (all cons are of low severity level)1) I haven't figured out a way to 'Auto lock' the key pad of the phone (say after a few minutes of inactivity). I know there should be a way. I will call Nokia to find how to do that.2) Sometimes I mistakenly press the power button on the right side, while trying to hold the phone and the phone switches off!3) Vibrating feature isn't that great. It is just sufficient enough I guess.4) The camera shutter cover is very smooth and sensitive. So sometimes when I put the phone into my pant pocket, it opens because it slides the opposite side. To prevent this, always try to put the phone bottom first into the pocket, since that will mean you will be pushing the camera cover up, which is what you do to close it.5) It is always not obvious that whenever you are in a menu, you can see that there are several options available to you on the top. These options could be accessed by using the right and left menu key to scroll through the options. Though this is a pro, the reason I am putting it under 'con' is that this isn't very obvious, until you notice it carefully or get used to it.For example if you got a missed call from the same number three times continuously, the call times of all 3 calls won't be obvious to you in the 'missed call' history, since it only shows the time of the last call attempt from that number.But if you carefully notice when you are in the 'call log' there will be a 'notepad' like icon to which you can scroll using your right menu key to access all the call history. Here you will be able to get the time of all the missed calls from the same number. I wish they gave it directly in the call log.6) The phone always remembers the last menu you accessed and will go deep into the menu the next time you open it. This could be a pro or con depending on your personal preferences. Say you accessed your 'call log' last time and you browsed through 'received calls', the next time you access the 'call log' it will DIRECTLY go to the 'received calls' page. But this time you might have wanted to access the 'missed calls' menu. So you will have to go back one step and navigate forward to the 'missed calls' menu.It might take some time to get used to this.7) I don't think you can make the phone display to be on as long as you want to do so. It always times out after a few minutes of course for power saving. I guess it has a 1 minute limit.8) I wish they had a separate volume up and down button may be on the side of the phone. Rather you have to use the left and right menu key for that when you are talking.9) The 'Menu center key' is not very accessible, in the sense it is hard to push it down. Rather most of the time you try to push it down, you end up pressing the up menu key or the down menu key. So the 'Menu center key' isn't that easy to access.10) I wish there was also a 'separate loud speaker key', which I could simply press if I want to put the phone on the speaker mode. Unfortunately there isn't one. Hence you have to use the menu key to access the speaker, while talking.11) You cannot initiate the phone dialing directly from the speaker mode. i.e. You cannot access the speaker mode when the phone is on standby. So if you want to be on speaker, you always have to make the call and then go to the speaker mode from the menu.Other notes:Nokia 6682 user guide: [...]How long have I used the phone? 1.5 monthsI will add more pros and cons if I find out more!Data capabilities: I haven't used the phone for much of its data capabilities for which it is known for. So I am unable to comment on those data features. So it goes without saying that I use the phone mostly for its 'voice features'. That begs the question, 'Am I making full use of this phone and its features'. The answer is a loud 'No'. And the question is 'If you are not using the data capabilities at all' do you really need this phone? I don't have a straightforward answer to that question. It depends on your personal preferences. But if you want that option included this is the phone to go with. But even if you only want a great voice conversation this is a great phone.Where did I buy the phone? Amazon.comImportant note about buying at amazon.com : If you buy this (or any other cingular network) phone through amazon.com and you are switching from another network, then note that amazon doesn't provide number portability. For example if you currently using 'T-Mobile' and want to switch over to 'Cingular' and want to buy this phone on amazon.com, then you cannot retain your old phone number. Amazon.com will assign their own phone number once you place your order. After getting the phone, you might be able to port the old phone number (provided you haven't cancelled your T-Mobile or other account) by directly talking to Cingular. But here is the catch - if you port your old phone number directly by talking to Cingular (by passing Amazon.com) then you are breaking the 'Terms and conditions' of Amazon.com, which means you will be required to pay '$250' to Amazon.com for changing your phone number. This is applicable until 6 months after you buy the phone. After 6 months you can change the phone number. But it is a no brainer that no one wants to change their number in 6 months again!Disclaimer:The information I have provided above is based on my own personal experience of using this phone. Individual experiences may vary from one person to another.Have a nice customization!Karthikeyan Arunachalam
For a Nokia this buy waas a letdown for me.  I wish it had some features like my previous samsung piece... a daily alarm, automatic dialpad locking, etc. I'm stuck with it for a at least another year. :-(
Been using this phone over a year and never has a single problem with it even I dropped it several times.
My favorite phone thus far. I use and review plenty of wireless technology and I am glad that this is the one that goes home with me. Synced with my Mac in literally less than 3 minutes.
I hate this phone.Pros: good reception, many features.Cons:Keyboard is tiny and hard to press the right one.Worn out easily near the edge.As heavy as a brick.Very slow bootup.
I have been using this phone over nine months now and I didnt have any problems yet.Bigger displlay is very advantageous. It has good sound quality. Also the mp3 player is good.The phone software is easy to use and comes very handy in adding contacts or sycnchronizing calender from pc.Camera - its ok. You cant really expect much from a phone camera. But takes quite good pictures if there is enough light. The pics are blurry in low lighting conditions.Battery life is good too.Cons - Its bit bulky. Can be uncomfortable to hold in hand and talk for a long time.Doesnt come with auto keypad lock. But the software can be downloaded for free.People have complained that phone hangs, I have faced that problem only once.Overall its a good phone I will give it 4/5 rating.
Only problem I face, is the grip to the phone while talking is not too good.  All the features I want are there, and I am using for almost a year, and still do not see any phone so good.
I have had this phone for about two years now and it is still going strong.  Over the past few months the battery life has started to wane, but I do charge it a lot so that could be my fault.I have dropped this phone more times than I can count, it has gotten wet, it has gotten cold and has never given me a problem.  It does not have a camera or mp3 player and Verizon has stopped providing new ringers for this model--they use to have them, but they stopped about a year ago.The only serious gripe that I have with this phone is the fact that it will not vibrate on silent.  It does vibrate, but only with the ringer at the highest setting, so forget being able to discretely get a call with a vibrate feature.  If it had that feature I would buy another one, but I think I will have to choose a different phone this time (it is upgrade time) because I really like a phone to be able to vibrate without ringing.**note: the listing for this phone now has a photo of another model.  This review was for the now extinct aluminum-clad LG phone.  I have no experience with the pictured model**
This is a really bad phone. My battery door falls off all the time, and then the battery falls out! Also, my phone just shuts down by itself. I've only had this phone for about a month! Don't get this phone!!
My roomate just got this phone because her old one finally wore itself out. This one is sturdy, has good weight to it, and the menu is easy to navigate.the vibrator on this puppy is excellent. i can hear it no matter where it is in the room we share. in her backpack under all her books? hear it. vibrating on her bed? hear it. it's a sturdy little phone.it holds up well to falls. we're in college, come on, we party! it gets dropped and sat on. it takes a lick and keeps on tickin! it's a great little phone. sad part is there's no camera, which her last one had. if you're just getting a phone - it's great; if you've already had a camera phone, you'll feel cheeted.  unless you just never used your camera on your phone.changing the covers is easier said than done. because its an LG, they screw in the top cover and put the tiniest screws under gushy little pieces of rubber. if you plan on changing your phones look, you will definately want to have a small screw driver, one that's just one size above glasses screwdrivers. it's really an odd size and proves to be a hassle.I don't know how long the battery can hold up because she plugs it in everynight. but if you don't want your phone to ring while it's plugged in - this phone also vibrates while plugged into the wall. my phones haven't done that, and i'm a little jealous! what if i don't want to be woken up by a ringer at 4 am? ya know?all in all this phone gets a 4(even tho i put 5) for those little things about it: the camera (which i'm used to one by now) and the cover. LG is a magnificent brand and you should really looking into getting one, even if it's not this one. they are VERY sturdy! i've dropped my LG a LOT and it's just got a few scratches on it. it's good to go!
This is an excellent phone, when it works.  I have had this phone replaced 4 times since I purchased it a little more than a year ago, three times for a faulty "socket?" for the earpiece/headset and once for freezing up when trying to use the camera.  The earpiece for my latest version was dead, again, two weeks after it was replaced and I just don't feel like going through the hassle of waiting for another new one via Fed Ex.  I think it is telling that Verizon stopped carrying this model shortly after I purchased it and every replacement has had to come from the manufacturer itself.  I have only owned LG phones prior to this and was satisfied with all my previous models.  I may even buy another LG in the future--after adequate research--but this one has done nothing but inconvenience me.
After almost 2 years with this phone, I have nothing good to say about it.  The reception has been terrible, the battery discharges within 10 hrs (and that's when I don't use it--when I do talk, the talk time is under an hour), and it's difficult to hear anyone half the time.  Several friends with the vx8100 have had similar experiences.  I guess I was spoiled by my Nokia--and I'll be going back.  I can't imagine ever buying an LG again.
In my job as a landscaping contractor, my phones take a beating.  My previous Moto E815 was destroyed after 6 months.  Im goin on a year with this phone and still no problems.  It constantly gets dropped, abused, and almost run over, but always functions great.  I love the multi color light outside of it and the SD slot allowing me to add infinite music and ringtones.  The battery life on this phone leaves something to be desired, as mine only last for about 1.5 days after a year of use.  Also i notice that others with Verizon can get sevice in places I cant with mine.  But overall the service is consistent, and this phone has held up great.  Full of features and great for those of you like me that have destroyed phones in the past.
I thought this phone was great for about 2 months! I have had it almost 2 years now and There is very little good to say about it. I am on my third battery and it is on its way out. I am on my second charger. I would neverbuy another LG phone! My whole family has different Lg models and they all have the same problem.
I had this phone last year and sold it withing a week. The battery doesn't even last a day on a full charge and I didn't use it once. When i did use it, I had to throw it on the charger right away. Talking on it, your cheeks start to burn because the phone gets sooo hot! i finally just gave up and sold it on ebay.
This phone is designed for just about all the features that verizon offers.  It is perfect for my everyday life, music, video, and has a great camera.  I was a little disappointed to find out that the vx8100 only supported miniSD cards up to 1gb, but now i realize that there is no need for more than that for a phone.  The phone gets great signal, and has the loudest speaker that i have ever heard for a phone.  There are 3 mp3 buttons placed on the front of the phone to allow music-lovers to listen to their tunes with the phone shut.  It is also easy to take self-portraits with a function that allows the camera's view to be on the front LCD screen.There a couple of downsides though:1. There is a very low battery life2. it is considered by some to be a little "bulky" (it seems pretty compact to me)3. Only 15 second videos can be taken (but they are high quality for a phone)4. I have found it almost impossible to get music on the phone without purchasing one of Verizon's "Music Essential Kits"Overall, this a great phone that is geared with everything that you could expect from a Verizon Wireless phone!
I have had the LG8100 Phone for almost 2 years now and its been the best phone so far, the only problem i had was the battary but thats normal it happens with all phones as they get old. I bought a new battary for my phone its works great.
This phone was a little bulky but had fabulous features, particularly the removable memory, great picture quality, comfortable controls, and good speakers (as phones go) that could play mp3s. Then, after 15 months of trustiness, the part of the phone where the charger plugs in was somehow bent or broken and would no longer accept a charge. I had it insured, so for the $50 deductible they sent me a new one. Three months later, the same part of the brand new phone broke off. So if you do purchase the 8100 (which has since been replaced by the slimmer sleeker 8300), do not touch it or breathe on it while it is plugged in.
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more. I had bought a Jabra 350 Bluetooth Headset and it works very well I could hear well with it and other people could hear me. Well about two months later when I was on the headset with people it would cut out...they could hear me but I couldn't hear them and when the other person would come back it would about blow my eardrum out. I thought maybe it was just the Bluetooth so I bought a cord headset well it does the same thing. I've had both the phone and both headsets replaced and still  their is no fixing it. I spend a lot of my talking time on the road so it is very important for me to have the headset work, so I'm very displeased with my situation. I also have problem with it restarting itself whenever it wants. I would not recommend this phone and it makes me mad because I still have 7 months before I can get a new one and Verizon basically told me to deal this one until my contract was up. The only thing I still like about it is it's blue. I also had an older LG model and I had problems with it shutting down too and had it replaced once. I will NEVER buy another LG
I wanted to add a positive review for this phone.I noticed they are all negative.I have had this phone for about a year. I have not had any problems at all with the battery. I did purchase a 2nd battery which I forget to use..If the signal is weak, it's usually where there are a lot of trees...The only issue I have is that I can't figure out the MP3 player...My son downloads stuff just fine with this phone. It can be done without difficulty. I just don't have the time I guess.Overall, I love my phone. If I replace it, it will be to get one with more options like the Verizon En-V.
I purchased this phone to replace a Sony Ericsson T637.  I didn't expect the lack of the 850 band would be a problem, but it was.  Apparently there are many, many fewer 850 band radios deployed than 1900.  I kept getting "Emergency Service Only" warnings even though I was working inside Cingular's Miami, Florida switch.  Aside that, the phone is great.  I ended up replacing it with a quad band W810i which I don't like nearly as much.
The Sony Ericsson K750i has everything you need. It's a world phone and a camera phone, with lots of features loaded on it like a music player the same as the W series with radio. I'm very sorry I have to sell it because the company that I work for doesn't allow camera phones in the office. Overall, the best phone I ever own!
Great pictures, great videos, great phone!I just bought a bigger memory card. The FM receiver is excellent!
the item works good and everything went fine i will always shop at amazon for anything i need these people are really nice i will tell others about them
This cell phone is the best! I've had it since May 2006 and it's just everything I wanted. I have a 1GB memory stick and It's really useful.. you can have tons of pictures and mp3 songs. The audio quality is great and the picture quality excellent. At night the pictures are not that good but it's because of the light...  I'm Extremelly happy with this cell phone and I totally recommend it!
ive had it for 1 1/2 years and i cant wait for the 2 year contract to expireCONS:-the camera often goes off in my pocket and takes 50 pictures of the inside of my pocket and i have to delete them all 1 by 1-on most Verizon wireless phones you can record sounds and use those sounds and sounds people send you as ringtones...not on this phone-this might be an individual problem..on just my phone...but it turns off by itself and freezes in the middle of conversations and txting etc.PROS:-It is a good price for what you get...its the cheapest camera phone made by verizon-its easy to use the camera and other features on the phone, such as the voice recognition, which is exceptionally great for a phone of this price.overall i guess im just sick of it but its a great phone if you want to save money and have a camera so you can more personalize your phone.
I've read some of the other reviews, this is my experience:Pros:1. This is a biggie--durability.  I drop my phone on a regular basis, usually when it falls out of my car onto the pavement when I occasionally forget it is in my lap and then get out of the car. (Okay, no comments from the peanut gallery!)  Nevertheless, my phone has continued to work 2 years later (it probably helps that my husband quickly bought me a case for the phone that remains on the phone even during calls).2. I rarely have dropped calls and haven't had any problems with getting good reception and clarity practically everywhere.  I forget to recharge regularly--my phone recharges pretty fast.3. I saw comments from some of the other reviewers but I have never experienced any high-pitched noises.4. My kids send and receive text messages/pictures/clips using my phone without any problems.5. The screen is bright--I often use it as a flashlight in the car.  One of these days, I will buy a flashlight for my car...6. Did I mention that I found it very hard-wearing?Cons:1. Pictures on the camera phone are fuzzy.2. Outside keys are handy but sometimes  al contact gives you driving mode when you don't want it.3. I wish the phone came with more ring tone choices because many ring tone websites don't support Verizon.It's a good, basic cell phone--not as many bells and whistles as the newer phones and I haven't checked out some of the ones that are included. I bought this phone for phone convenience and it works well.  By the way, I agree with the advice to ask friends where you live about their reception with their phone and its carrier--sometimes it matters in your area.
This phone was a replacement for me after my other phone dove into the washing machine...I can afford Blackberrys etc...But this phone is truly reliable, rugged and has never failed me once. I read some of the other reviews I do not think they read the instructions on this phone. It has a variety of ringers, and ways to silence keyboards, on and off etc..it is loaded with functions even voice activated. I have friends who have this phone and would rather give a child away than their phone. Eventually I will get a new phone...but this phone has been a solid performer if you need great reception and sound, a good camera, internet access, and the type of phone that is sturdy if dropped...and won't let you down this is the one...it is LG's best secret...if reliabilty and performace matter to you this is the best buy in the cell phone world..
Unless you are only planning on making occasional phone calls on this device without holding many contacts or personalizing the ringtone, this phone is not for you, especially at this price. The lack of internal memory prevents you from saving more than a handful of games, pictures, ringtones, or text messages without causing it to lock up due to a "lack of internal memory". There are many better phones available at better prices, especially if you are a T-Mobile To Go customer. If you do use To Go, purchase a terrible phone (like this, only cheaper) for the SIM card, then upgrade to an Unlocked Phone on Amazon. You won't be nearly as frustrated (unless you try to download from T-Zones, which can be a hassle, but I would rather not have this phone and not be able to download) as I have been, wasting my money on downloads only to discover that they won't fit in, even when I have barely anything on my phone. Unless customization and having control over your phone (instead of the other way around) aren't for you, run away NOW!
I bought 2 of these phones from t-mobile a year ago after my daughter's motorola v300 died and she needed a replacement. I actually had to pay for them, and for their shipping, and had to take a 2 year contract instead of my previous one year paln, so definitely not a good bargain. The only reason i did it was because I still have my 400 min. $50 a month plan which nobody else offered - Verizon or Cingular wanted $70/month, so even with payng for the phones, T-mobile was cheaper. Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for. The last statement doesn't apply to the Nokia 6101 though. If I had gotten money back for it it may have been worth the trouble, but i did pay for it, so...The first thing that happened to my kid's phone was the death of the radio. Since she is a teenager this was of highest priority, so we had to return the phone (and pay for the shipping) and get a replacement. The replacement phone has a still working radio, but it's side volume button broke after a few months. My daughter had "customized" the otside of the phone with glu-on pearly stuff by then, so we could not get a replacement. Which is ok because she hates the phone and is looking forward to next year when she can get a different one. Since my Motorola survived almost another year, i just started using the Nokia and I hate it too.1. The call and disconnect buttons are the oposite of the motorola! why? so i will need to relearn new habits every time and get a  new phone?2. The vibe option is useless. And is my daughter's constant excuse for not answering when I call her. And so far I haven't found the vibe and then ring option which was available even through the side button of the motorola.3. I still haven't figured out how to use the speed dial. For now teh phone allows me to assign numbers with the 1-touch dial option (up to nine phone numbers), but will not allow speed dial numbers such as 11 to 99, unlike my Motorola that will give me any number while storing the contact. All I had to do to make a call was dial the two digits and the pound key. Very handy if you are driving.4.the nokia has 8 ringtones. 8!?! If I have 9 speed dial numbers I should have at least that many ringtones to know when some of these supposedly important contacts calls me. I have to look for the collar ID if I want to know how importnat it is to answer the phone call. And none of the tones is acceptable. My pager has a better selection!!! I am not a person who would pay for ringtones, but I may end up doing it, because these are just too irritating.5. The manus are far from intuitive. I never had to look into my Motorola's manual. It was easy to use the phonebook, setup a pictuer as wallpaper, assign ring-tones to contacts, etc. The Nokia is a constant irritation. I have not been unable to asign a ringtone to any contact or phone number not that there will be a lot of ringtone to choose from. There is plenty of options I can't fugure out why they even exist and many options lead to the same screen. Worst of all the phone stays on the last screen you were using even after you close it!!! so if i set my alarm for the morning, i have to go back through all the screens before i can make a phone call, i can't just close and re-open the phone.I don't know if this is how it was designed or t-mobile "crippled" it as many people are saying about other features of the phone.6. And this is pertinent to ALL cell phones. Why on earth wouldn't they come with the cable to connect to the computer? You have to look for the right cable and then it still doesn't work and I doubt it really costs that much since ALL pdas and palms come with one anyway.The only positive thing is that it has better reception than the Motorola and so far hasn't droped any calls. Overall i wouldn't recommend the phone and i see it's not offered through Amazon anymore. If you put bells and whistles do it well, if not just make a generic phone.
I don't really need much in my phone, so this phone is great...it makes calls ;). What I really like about it is the GREAT battery life. I've had it for over a year and on a full battery it lasts for a good 2-3 days. This is a great simple phone.
This phone sucks. Your likelihood of brain cancer will be greatly increased with this phone because the ear plug comes unplugged all the time and in the end, you don't even bother to use the ear plug. Terrible design! Don't know how they could make such a bad design!
My wife and I have owned this phone for just over a year. The phone worked well at first then we started having problems once we entered the 13th month of ownership. The screen would go blank, we were unable to make or receive calls, the graphics (background themes, button displays, etc) change from day to day. I am able to make a phone call but am unable to hear anything unless I use the speaker option.  My wife's phone has had the same problems.  I have gone through master reset a couple of time trying to fix the problem, it works for a while and then starts to haywire again. This will be the last Sony Ericsson phone we will ever purchase.
I opted for this phone over the Razr in May of 2006, because I thought the Razr was over-hyped.  To my dismay, I wish I would have gotten a razr.I am extremely careful with my phones and I've never dropped it until a couple weeks ago.  Regardless, this phone started giving me trouble after having it for only 2 months.  I live in an AT&T; coverare area, yet it frequently drops calls or I couldn't connect to the person I was calling.  The biggest problem I had was that it would constantly freeze and I'd have to take out the battery to reset the phone.  Additionally, for those concerned with pictures, the quality of pictures on this phone are terrible.I did, however, like the bluetooth capabilities with the phone, as well as the arm support that the intenna provided.All in all, I would not recommend this phone to anyone at all - the Razr, although over-hyped, is much better quality.
It works fine. good battery. Ok reception.looks great and enough function. Bluetooth works great with our GPS.However it broke twice in a year. and the camera button was way to sensitive. many blank shoots in the bag.
I actually got this phone at the Cingular store. It has been the worst phone I've ever owned in my life. I read  somewhere that the software that runs this phone has memory leak issues, and I am here to say IT DOES. After the phone has been on for a day or so without being shut off and turned back on, the ring tone starts to skip like a record with a scratch in it, then when I go to my menu of items, black squares appear where the icons should be, the games won't load up and there have been many times when I couldn't hear the caller, etc.Please buy another phone. I still trust the Sony name, but I am weary of their phones after this experience.  Can't wait to get another phone. The Nokias and Motorolas I had in the past never had issues like this piece of s**t.
I love the looks, the form factor, the great reception (more bars showing than any of my previous phones), the MP3 ringtones, and its many other features. It works with the Google Maps for Mobile client, and with the GMail client (these are cool Java apps that you download onto the phone from Google).I had one problem where it would connect to my Prius over Bluetooth when I turned the car on, and then about a minute later, the phone would beep and drop the Bluetooth connection. I eventually worked out the fix - go into the phone's Bluetooth menu and turn on the "Powersave" option, which makes it only accept one Bluetooth connection at a time. Now it works with my car's handsfree mode perfectly.The Bluetooth connection to my Mac works really well, and it was not hard to sync my address book, or transfer MP3s to the phone over Bluetooth.
For a relatively basic flip, this phone has been an absolute disaster. Call quality is great, yet for some reason at around 20 minutes, it loses its connection to the towers, the bars drop to zero, and I get disconnected. Every time.It will often display 5 bars of coverage, drop to zero the moment you dial out and not connect, and then go back to 5 bars.Basically the phone is useless on Cingular unless you have perfect coverage. Perhaps I have older firmware or something, but it is not like I should have to worry about that.
Take it from a klutz....this may not be the fanciest phone in the world, but it can take a lot of hits and keeps right on working. I have dropped it about a thousand times, it has soaked in melted butter (ummm.....long story), AND in been doused with water and it still works! So, if you are a spaz (and you know who you are out there) then get this phone.
I placed an order in Aug, but I didnt receive the phone until now, we've contacted Dealswarehouse several times, but they didnt provide us any solution... Amd after I saw the reviews from others, we are not the only one who didnt receive the item, think carefully before you buy from them. Thank you Amazon provided us assistance.
The phone was great until i dropped it and there's no way to fix the internal antenna.
This little nokia is very compact and light, yet the battery lasts forever.  With a 17 day standby time, this phone has one of the best battery lives around.  Text messaging works well, and you can receive images as well (if you care).  There is no camera or mp3 player on this phone, but it does the basics well.  The built-in speakerphone works great.
Great product...except that one of the two I ordered had a back plate that looked dropped.  They were supposed to be new.
I had this phone as a rental for 10 months in Israel, and put it through hell.  Dropped it, stuck it inside a backpack that not only weighed about 30lbs, but it also got tossed around allot.  Its got all the basic functions that you need, and it's very simple to use.  Personally I'm the flip-phone kind of person, but once I got into the habit of always locking and un-locking the keypad, it took me the same amount of time to get it out and use it to either text my friends in Israel, or the US, and make phone calls to whomever I wanted. Though the best part about this little phone isn't the size, battery life, or its weight, it's the fact that this thing can take a beating and come back for more.
My Nokia 6101 is very good, but clamshells are more fumbly than candy bars, so I ordered the Nokia 3120.  That was a mistake.Unlike previous reviewer, mine was delivered promptly.  Return address on box was Smart Tech USA in Houston, TX. There was no receipt or other forms in the box.Phone came with the battery partially charged, so I could determine that functions other than charging are good.  However, it does not charge. I tested the charger on my old Nokia 2126 and 1221, and that worked, so problem is in phone, not the charger.Package was a Nokia box without a model number. There is a slight bulge, indicating that box was not quite the right height for the plastic tray inside.  Does that mean I am not the first customer to receive this unit?Checking instructions for returns to Deals Warehouse, there aren't any. Site runs you in circles.  I did submit message via Amazon.  At time of this writing, I am awaiting reply.  Deals Warehouse's stated refund policy is not encouraging. I will edit as things develop.9/28/07: Deals Warehouse wrote:"As stated on the return policy page, all returns must be approved. We encourage buyers to contact us before returning any item. Please remove the bad feedback you left for us before we proceed."9/29/07: I attempt to submit A-Z claim, and it malfunctions.

Very unhappy with this phone. It cuts off randomly, but if I take the battery out and reinsert it, it will turn back on.  I have tried using the battery from my previous phone, which is the same model (the number 5 does not work on that phone any more), but the phone still does not work properly.
Tho phone came from Indonesia and the headings are not named the same as Nmerican names. The phone will not update raoming codes, so it is often without service. We have been unable to resolve the issue through our service provider.
I wish I could write something about this phone but I have been waiting close to 3 months for this thing,  where is it.
I got this phone a little over a year ago, and within the first week I knew I didn't like it. It's poorly made, the interface is archaic, and it has literally NO memory for anything but text messages. That was the one good thing about the phone, I could store up to 300 messages at once. The gallery only held about 15 pictures at any given time, and anytime someone sent you a picture, you'd have to delete some from your gallery to even view it. The screen went blank in 3 months, and the darn thing had a habit of turning itself off whenever it wanted. I never abused the phone or dropped it any more than the average owner, but from the get go it was just a piece of...I'd been pleased with every Nokia I'd ever purchased before, so to have such a disappointment in this one was rather shocking. Stay away at all costs.
First a disclaimer. I am an unabashed biased Nokia phone user. They have better reception, better user interface, better reliability, and free PC Suite Nokia PC connection software(read this OUTLOOK/SYNC CONTACTS BACKUP).This phone has a thoughtful alarm sequence and missed call/msg/alarm alert. It begins with vibrate, moves to vibrate+low ring, then vibrate+increasing louder ring, and finishes with occasional side light blinks if you never answer. Very pleasant non-irritating reminder.The Contact Note length has been increased from previous Nokia Series 40 phones about 4 times. This is very nice if you use your phone to add extra info notes to your contacts, a very nice business feature. The PDA features have been expanded with TODO lists, Weekly calendar/appts view, Notes list, and Meeting/Memo alarm types.The GOTO list has been expanded for customizable quick access to your most used phone functions. Contacts, Msg, Calendar, and Camera functions access are fixed on the navigation keys. Nice. The camera is good for email and 4X6 shots in adequate light only. Typical of these business phones.Some reviews on the inet mention this phone is designed to attract the younger crowd because of its side lights and customizable 'electric' face plate option. Well, this may be, but for the rest of us practical users, without the option face plate, this is a very small and thin small business phone with side lights that blink when a msg/call is arriving and blink intermittently forever until you look at any missed msg/call/alarms. NICE!I won't mention all the other features because they are covered in others reviews and are in the specs, so let me just say this is an excellent phone for anyone from the young to the small business person to the less experienced user. It covers most of the bases needed, and in a small, practical, feature laden platform.Did I mention it has three ways to backup your precious and value contact/notes data base, tediously built up over valuable time; SIM CARD on board stores/backs-up to 256 contact numbers, SyncML Client to upload your full phone memory to free online backup/recover sites, and thirdly, Nokia's free PC Suite Windows software that makes your phone appear as just another external storage device you can 'Explore'!You will like it if your heart is not set on an MP3 player and HiQ Camera combination device. More to go wrong so better separate in my opinion.I have been very pleased with T-Mobiles service in S CA. You can use this phone as a no contract GO PHONE for 8.5 cents per minutes when you buy a T-Mobile SIM card and a 1000 minute card as low as $85. If you chatter a lot, then the free nights/weekends/faves minutes with contract and phone makes more sense. Hope this helps. :)
I loved this phone when I got it. It lasted a year and I had no problem with it untill my son threw it in a glass of juice. If only it were water proof, it would be perfect. I've had a selection oh phones since this one and they didnt compare, so as of now I'm waiting on my new nokia 3220. The menu isnt as bad as one person said, and there are short cut menus. Also to adjust the call volume you have to be talking, just push the over button to the left or right. I loved this phone and I cant wait for my new one.
I've had this phone now for two years and I love it still!! It does come with two different covers, and the stencil to put your own background picture. It also has given me great reception no matter where I have been. The battery has lasted the longest. I have even bought other phones and still have switched back to this one. It's durable and completely satisfies all my needs.
I got this phone as a gift for my BF.... He really loved it and I really loved it... I put a pictrure of us together at the back... Another nice things are the lightswhen somebody is calling or when you're talking to somebody.... So far it's been 2 months already and no complains yet from him... or from me..... NOKIA really is the best phone out there........
This was a good deal for the price. The keys take a little getting used to since each square button has 2 numbers on it and they rock either up or down to choose. The earphone volume is not quite loud enough (on max), but I may just be a little hard of hearing. The display is typical but I wish the text were larger in many cases, but again maybe my eyes aren't too great either. The ringer is outstanding; you can't miss hearing it. The battery life is really great. Some of the features are a bit cryptic and somewhat hard to find, but they are there and they work well. So it's a very solid 3-star phone with a few 4 or 5 star bits thrown in.
I fell into purchasing this phone more or less by accident.  I've had it for two years and while it has taken a beating it still works great.  Every once in a while the OS needs a reboot, but that is rare.  The sound quality is good, but at times I wish it were louder, even with the manual volume adjustment.  I also use it for basic scheduling reminders.  This is where I find the originally unexpected lights on the side of the phone to be useful.  In a darkened room with the phone on silent, the lights flash brightly for alarms, calls, txts, and voice-mails.The only reasons why I'm dropping this phone is that I'm moving to an area with poor T-Mobile coverage (not the phone's fault) and I require better email and texting features.
If u tend to drop ur phone a lot.  This phone will not break. It is made to just fall apart but can be easily put together. It does what it should.  other than the light rubber covers tear apart it is just ok but it not nothin special.
This was my first phone. And at first, I loved it. I thought it was the coolest thing. It could light up, take pictures, and make sound recordings. This was a great first phone.However, I've definately outgrown it, but due to certain circumstances in my life, I'm stuck with it. Now the phone seems clunky compared to all those cool sleek phones out there, the image quality is nothing amazing, and it only can hold polyphonic ringtones.Bottom line: I would recommend this phone for parents buying kids their first phone. However, this is by no means a good phone for the experienced cell phone user.** Also, get a deal with Cingular or T-Mobile to get this phone for about $20. By no means pay the price they have in the store and online of $100. Not worth it.
My Nokia 3220 phone is a huge letdown in functionality.  First, I bought it for the camera.  The camera does not allow me to send pictures.  Or my settings, that came with the phone are not sufficient.  This is one of the best reasons to have a camera phone. The 2nd unique feature that I was so excited about was the FM radio function.  My phone does not have that capability either.  Even after sending one back and receiving a brand new phone (exact model as first), no FM function.  Now I don't have options but to contact Nokia direct, which I don't think I should have to do with a brand new phone.  So I am not impressed with this model and do not recommend it.  I was a huge Nokia fan until this phone.
I have had this phone for over a year now.  As others have written, it does occasionally lock up, and it can be a little slow at times.However, I am amazed that there is still nothing that rivals it in terms of screen and keyboard size.  I don't even bother with the included email application, as the web browser is good enough for checking my gmail account.  (note that there is a gmail app, but it only works with normal gmail accounts and not "Google Apps for your Domain" accounts)There are a lot of phones out there with keyboards now, but none is as well designed.  And I don't think there are any phones with this many features that don't require an occasional reboot.Bottom line: for a screen that is adequate for web browsing, and a keyboard that is good enough to write long emails, in a package that looks like an ordinary phone until you open it up, and fits nicely in your pocket... there is no alternative.I would upgrade if there was an upgrade, but I am very happy with it.
THESE PHONES ARE NOT BUILT IN THE US. THERFORE YOU DO NOT GET THE MANUFACTURE 1YR WARRANTY.  I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND IT QUIT WORKING 35 DAYS AFTER I GOT IT. AMAZON WILL NOT CREDIT MY MONEY OR REPLACE MY PHONE. MOTOROLA WILL DO NOTHING!!! BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MANUFACTURED IN THE US.  I WAS TOLD THIS AFTER I HAD PAID FOR SHIPPING THE PHONE TO MOTOROLA FOR REPAIR.  THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE $179 PINK PAPER WEIGHT.
I bought the pink motorola razor 2 months ago. About 2 weeks after I bought the phone it started locking up.  The keypad would not work. Powering the phone off did not work.  I took the phone back to the T-mobile store and was told I had to contact Motorola.  The next day it started working again.  It had intermittant lock ups, and made beeping noises on it's own.  3 days ago, it locked up and is still not working.  I had to buy a new phone.  Motorola nor T-Mobile would replace it.  Both say it has to have been dropped or has water damage, and neither of these is the case.Lesson learned, not everything that is pretty on the outside is pretty on the inside.  Save your money, get a better quality phone.
I had to return the phone because some of the keys didn't work and after 2 hours it wouldn't turn on even though it was fully charged. Item was returned for full credit.
Bought the pink razor for the daughter's b-day, then after three months the keypad froze up.  This phone is made in Europe, so you have to call your carrier to set up text messaging. AND.....it would not pick up Cingular's network around the US when we went on vacation.  Pass on this phone and try a Nokia.
Never allow your Razr to be near fog, light steam or anything that allows it to obtain any type of water. I do not mean, swimmng or dropping in tub. My Girl spoke on the thing for 45 seconds in a steamy bathroom out of the shower and the new thing is now junk. I buy and sell wholesale items for a living and Razr's are now off my list of items forever. Plus the price is never going to drop for unlocked basic models. Samsung & of course LG is all I will now buy and sell.
I had read all the reviews AFTER i had already purchased this phone and there was a lot of bad reviews so it kinda scared me, but i got mine and it works great, i can hear great, the ring tones are clear, it takes good pics. and its cute! ive had absolutely no problems. The ONLY thing is that the screens get dirty fast especially if you wear makeup.
PROS : Sleek and trendy. Fits well into pants pockets without adding a bulge to your side. Good quality camera for a phone. All the features are easily accessible. Excellent sound quality. This is the first phone I have ever had that has an effective voice dial system and predictive text writing feature for text messages. Excellent reception (with T-Mobile). Large memory capacity. Easily attached via USB to computers (you can transfer ringtones, pictures, etc.). Lots of accessories have been made for this phone and they are easy to purchase.CONS : The screen is not easy to see when you are in the sun. My battery life seemed to get shorter quickly. The manual doesn't cover much.
The Moto Razr V3 is the best cell phone I've owned. I have the  Magenta color and its a beautiful shade of pink None of the cell companies in my town even carry this color Razr. It's smooth, and has a nice key pad with a blue back lite. Takes pictures and video's.  It has picture ID so you can see who is calling on the outter smaller screen and the inside larger screenIt also has the ringer assigning feature Has a nice feel to it. All in all this is a classy, smooth, compact phone. Does pretty much everything a phone needs to do and more..  I love mine, and am glad I chose it.
I purchased a Motorola Razr from Amazon because our cell phone carrier wanted over 200.00 for it because it has not been a year since my daughter had her phone.  I got if for 140.00 and my daughter is Very happy with it!Thanks!
I had purchased a Magenta RAZR that was magenta and red/the battery wouldn't hold a charge/there was a humming noise/quick notes were in dutch?? and there were spelling errors. I contacted Ace Digital regarding these issues and they sent me an email the next business day with a prepaid shipping label to return this product for a refund. I was refunded $165.60, out of the $190 that I paid for it. I assume that I was charged a restocking fee? However, I am very pleased that they responded so quickly and gave me a refund. I was very disappointed when I received the phone, but they have redeemed themselves by honoring my return/refund. Thank you Ace Digital.
Wished I could have kept this phone for my daughter, but it was the wrong carrier and she couldn't use it. The phone was in excellent condition and was priced right! Had to send it back, but had no trouble getting my money back! Thank you!
I really love every razr out their, but see here's the problem. This phone does NOT WORK WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. So if you are like me and wanted it and have Verizon, just buy the phone at verizon. This phone is not compatibe with the Verizon Wirless service. You need a SIM card for this phone, and with Verizon, it is computer autherized. Don't waste your money looking for it on Amazon, or on the internet. Save your self at least 200 $ and go to the store or Verizon Online. It is NOT WORTH IT. Other Than that little factor, I totally think you should go for this phone, (if your not Verzon!) but Beware Of the Dreaded Celly Phone.Don't fool your self over the UNLOCKED thing. It really doesn't make a difference.
Even though this phone is older technology, I can receive/make calls anywhere here in Colorado.  Heck, my son was calling me in the middle ofAlaska one summer.  Rugged consruction and simple to use.  Battery life is excellent.  Does not have all the bells and whistles like some other phones.  Would recommend this phone for a starter phone for a teen--it can take a beating and still work.
I loved this phone.  It was the best purchase I ever made.  For four months.Now it randomly turns off (despite being fully charged) sometimes in the middle of calls.  Often, when I flip it open, the screen is crazy (cut in half or bright green or only showing part of the functions).  When it started to do this it was a lot worse, now it's mellowed out a bit (only happens a couple times a week instead of multiple times a day).Apparently this is a problem with all PEBLs, hence the discontinuation.  A woman in front of me in line at the store asked me whether or not I had the same problems with the phone blacking out as she did.  A week later mine started up.  I've also heard bad things about the RAZR too, so I don't think I'll be purchasing a Motorola phone again, despite how cute and trendy they are.I loved all the features when they worked.  I could sync up my calendar and contacts with my mac with bluetooth (altough iCal and the calendar program don't work fantastically together), and the quality of the photos is great.  Also, I really like T-Mobile, their prices and their costumer service.  They are always really polite and I can even get them to be casual with me (I'm big on customer service people not being like robots) and very helpful when I have questions.  My upgrade time is here, so I'm going to get a new phone with them.
This phone is great and durable.  Has every feature that the razor has but won't break if you drop it.  The automatic flip open feature is great as well.  I recommend both this phone and the seller.
I love this phone. I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one. My original one was a free upgrade but after two weeks I was willing to spend £100 on a replacement. I liked it that much.I've now had my PEBL for over six months. I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with. Despite the poor quality of photos I still give it 5 stars because I think it's that good. It won't suit everyone but that's why there are hundreds of different models of phone out there!
I hate this phone!  I have had it replaced 3x because it has broken down.  My srceen went out, there was a constant eco, and the sound went completely out.  I have only had the phone for one year.  Camera clearity is poor, and I used to like the way it opens but now its just anoying.Its cute but thats it.
I love the design, and functionality of this cell phone. From the matte black, smooth clean look, to the one-hand opening procedure, to the overall streamline appearance. It has met, and exceeded all my hopes. I highly reccomend this phone for anyone who uses a flip phone. The camera pictures and videos are of superb quality, clarity, and sharpness. The software that enebles sharing of ingormation with a home computer makes this phone as useful in daily life as folks carrying around their big old Blackberry. I love it and think you will too.
I purchased this phone to use in Europe during a recent trip. I loved it. Very nice form factor, opening it requires only one hand and voice quality was great. Very happy with the purchase. I wish my US carrier (Verizon) had the same phone!
Well, the shape and the style of the phone is unique I would say is one of the best desing for a phone that I'll ever seen but there the phone have big issues like memory, it only have around 8 mb of integrated memory and has no expansion slots on top of this integrated camera is VGA so your photos will have a low resolution and quality, so pretty much is a phone that do his work call and receive calls, with a great desing but right now isnt one of the best around.Gave it 4 of 5 stars because it acomplished his duty
Its a great phone,PROS:I like very much the mechanism to open it with one hand.CONS:The screen is much smaller than the V3 screen.
initially i fell in love with the cool flip of the phone.but this phone has a tendency of breaking (same with my friend who had the same phone, and always happen to all motorola phones with the sound anyway), and i must emphasize that i have always been very careful with my own phones.- first the sound. all in a sudden the sound is gone, and the speaker has to be used if you actually want to hear what the other person across the phone is saying.- THEN! The charging wont work. Not the charger, but the actual phone cant charge.So then my phone is literally disabled.I spent another £25 in fixing the phone.I didnt use it though, just used my other because I really couldn't be bothered with it anymore.Then later when I decided to use it again, it worked for 1 more day, then the sound wont work again. I dont even know whether I should bother fixing it again.I highly recommend you not to buy it!
I am on my fourth Pebl within a year. It seems it either can not take the use or does not liked to be unlocked. I use the phone everyday text/Im/email very often. The picture/voice/video messaging jams when sending so you never know if the other person receives it, and to delete the phone has to be turned off/on. The battery life does not last a full day, thats without talking. The pebl has a good look and the clam shell opening is great. The keyboard is nice, except it always want abort my messages when I type to fast.
I've had this phone for about a year now, and it's not only the worst phone I've ever owned, it's the worst phone I've ever heard about. Physically it's not bad - it's a decent size, has a nice display and an external LCD. However the battery is very prone to slipping lose from the internal contacts causing the phone to turn off randomly; simply putting it in the pocket of a pair of jeans can be enough to dislodge the battery.It barely works *as a phone*. I have yet to find a spot where the signal is strong enough that it won't cut off, even when it has all bars maxed out. The microphone has lousy gain, unless you happen to be in an area with a slight breeze and then it picks the wind noises to the exclusion of all else. I've had so many calls where the person kept telling me the wind was too loud, and there was just barely a breeze!Taking a picture is easy, but then the phone forces you to decide how you want to "store" the picture by making at least two selections from the menu! This is completely ridiculous...how about I take the picture and it just stores it immediately without me doing anything?The phone just acts very weird. Whenever I check my voice mail, and even sometimes just at random, the phone recieves an undecipherable text message with no return address. Read three voicemails, you get three messages. No reason for it, it just happens. Even worse - I've had voicemails that it didn't inform me about for *over a week*! It's very common for it to not inform you about a voicemail for a couple of days. I have yet for it to let me know about a voicemail within a few minutes or even hours of receiving it.If you don't keep this phone fully charged, it will beep nonstop about every three minutes until the battery is really and truly dead. More than once I've had to get up at 3:00 AM to turn the damn thing off. Finally I located the notification options, there are about 20 of them, I turned them all off except the only one that a phone should have - the incoming call ring.Forgot your cell phone number? No problem, it's so easy to just look it up on the phone itself, right? Well, not on this phone - it's buried about five menu levels deep. I finally made the phone wallpaper the phone number so I could see it right away.I can't wait for my service contract to end so I crush this phone with a hammer.
I purchased this phone primarily as a travel phone to europe and the caribean and it hasnt faied me. It has very good reception,easy to remove sim card and its small so that you can silde it in your pocket and not even know its there. It doesnt have all the bells and whistles of a modern unlocked phone to be used in the usa. However if you are a traveler like myself, it is very reliable for gsm networks. The only downside is that you cant store multiple phone numbers under one name but rather have to list the same person over and over if you want to enter home,cell,bus number etc...The screen is all black so it tends to get messy with facial oil stains but big deal....The phone is slick and reliable....best for out of the usa use.....I strongly recommend it.
After my last phone's screen broke I wanted to get an affordable unlocked phone, although I was extremely skeptical. However I couldn't be more pleased with the PEBL. I knew I didn't want a RAZR because I don't find the shape comfortable and I think the operating system is more primitive. With the PEBL, the call quality is great, and the text messaging is not only intuitive but orders the words by your most used, so it makes texting much faster than I had found in the past. The phone is sleek and the matte texture is nice to hold in your hand. The only negative that I have found which I think has been mentioned is that the screen and keypad pick up oil from your face very easily. Overall VERY happpy with this phone!
I bought this phone for my wife and both of us are very pleased with it. Its cute and I personally think that its a lady's phone because of the design.
I'm only wasting time on this review, because I felt like I had to. The cell looks great, but it doesn't works like it looks. The keypad marks on the screen as soon as you are in hot areas. The faceplate has awful quality and has bad signal.
Well when I first got it i was like ohh no what is this, but after a day or so I started really liking it. The assisted flip is really cool yet if you let someone use it warn them or theyll probly drop it. The only sound issue I had was the ringtones. Anytime you switched from silent to vibrate ring loud soft whatever it didnt matter usually after that you have to turn it off and turn it back on to ring again. The reason I upgraded was because it didnt have a memory card slot but other than that it was pretty sweet.
Thank you very much for the phone, it's in a perfect condition, and the one-touch flip is very cool.
This has to be the absolute worst phone in the world.  Menus suck, reception is lousy, it has problems with bluetooth signal quality and is constantly telling me to switch to the handset, the battery life is good for about an hour or two at most of talking, the keypad is hard to use because the directional pad has an awkward shape.  I go this phone for free and hate it!  I will glady pay money to get a phone that I feel is functional.  The only good thing about it is the fact that it has a nice one handed opening mechanism.  Thats it.  There is nothing else worthy of even mentioning of this unfortunate waste of plastic.
No issues.  Performs as expected.  Easy to use and small enough to carry in my pocket.
For the Price It's the best phone that you can buy in a store "In My opinion" it's small, good signal, not heavy, easy to operate, trust me if you want a good cellphone and you don't want to pay a lot BUY IT!!
I have used the PEBL for a year now and I bought this one to replace my damaged one. The one I received works but if I knew it was  REFURBISHED one (which is not indicated anywhere) I would not have paid so much for it. A refurbished phone is not worth $170.
Had the Motorola Razor and it got damaged so I decided to try this PEBL. With the Razor you can use a bluetooth ear piece and just push one button and say only the name of who you are calling. This feature I use all the time due to my hands being dirty at work. With this stupid PEBL you have to say all this junk like name dial or digit dial then finally the persons name. All these extra voice commands are not cool. The PEBL does not ever recognize what you are saying through your compatible earpiece and if it does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped this phone only one time from out of a faulty case on my waist,  wow! it sure dents and scratches easy! I will not be using Motorolas any more, I think they are bad for me.
why would you buy this for $194 when you can buy a brand new one from Motorola for $139?
this phone is very good, great desing, the camera take pictures very clear, if only has a expantion port for increase the memory it will be the best
This is the first unlocked phone that I've bought from Amazon. The phone looks amazing and the motorola logo lights up blue (which more people mention than all of the other features combinded). The camera is upgraded, but its not too much of a difference than the normal ones. The phone is pretty different than what I expected to get. First of all, the amazon phone does NOT ship with iTunes, but comes with the DAP (which I don't consider a problem because the iTunes one has a song limit and this one doesn't). The only things I am dissapointed with is that this one (unlike Cingular's one from the store) does not ship with a MicroSD, but you can buy a 1gb on amazon for maybe $30. It's definitely not for America because it shipped with multiple language manuals and an adaptor for the charger. Stil a pretty good buy because its unlocked and it costs less than the cingular v3i with no contract (it still costs less even if you signed up for a 1yr contract).
I really wanted this phone and still love the design and features.  However, I happened to get a phone with some of the problems other reviewers had noted.  The phone cuts off a lot with a "white face" display and "no service" indicator.  Is embarrassing at times because I drop callers.  Also, the gunmetal finish is beginning to strip in small dots at places and has gotten 1 or so scratches.  I keep my phone in a padded case and am pretty gentle with it.  Also, the charger that came with it was for Europe with an adaptor which seems to have a short.  So I had to buy an adaptor for U.S.So, the above raises the issue of whether the value promised in view of the price charged by the manufacturer is given.
Synopsis:  This phone is sexy, rugged and feature-packed, and highly recommended, if you can look past its few flaws.Detail:  I'm a veteran to the RAZR line, having purchased one of the first black models when they were first released.  I thought the phone was excellent then, but with a few minor revisions, Motorola has brought the RAZR back to the forefront of the rapidly-moving world of mobile phones.  However, there are a few notable exceptions to this glowing report.First, the pros of the V3i model.  The call quality is somewhat better than the original V3, which already had exceptional sound clarity and reception in my experience with it.  Staying with the quad-band format is one of the best decisions that Motorola could have made with this phone- for individuals like me who travel abroad frequently, having a phone that can be used Stateside and overseas is an absolute must.The Bluetooth interface is seamless, but I use a Motorola H3 headset- if you use a headset of a different brand, you could encounter some difficulties, although I've not heard of any.  The camera, now 1.2 megapixels, takes (quite frankly) amazing photos for a mobile phone.  My wife decided to keep the pictures I took of our newborn son, as opposed to the pictures that were shot with our digital camera.  The video capture feature is good too, although I don't usually find myself using this function too frequently.Having the ability to switch to an "Airplane Safe" mode is also a plus, as you can still use the games and MP3 player while on a long flight.  Obviously, however, you won't be able to send or receive calls or data while the phone's in this mode.  The switch between these two modes, however, takes less than half a second.The physical size of the phone is also a major plus.  It's still a comfortable size to fit in your hand, but it's thin enough to easily fit into the front pocket of a pair of jeans.  The fit and finish are top shelf, the iridescent silver outside (seems to change to a smoke and a purple in different lights) contrasts well with the sleek black of the interior of the clamshell.  The outside display is bright and clear, and the interior screen is also bright and easy to read.  The keypad I find to be very good, but some people don't go for the feel of the cut metal keys.  Personal taste, I guess...Motorola's operating system is, in my opinion, clear and intuitive.  I've never found a system to be easier- the only one that's been nearly as easy was Nokia's, to give a perspective.  Icons are easy to interpret, commands are simple to issue to the phone, and with the TransFlash card installed, there's only a theoretical limit to the number of photos or videos you can store and take with you in your pocket.As I mentioned, though, there are some chinks in the armor.  First, the iTunes format is clunky and slow to navigate through.  Your iPod defintely moves through the menus much more quickly than does this phone.  Also, regardless of the size of the TransFlash card you have installed, iTunes limits the number of songs you can store to 50.  I've heard that some later models have this limit removed (or at least increased), but my version caps the fun at 50 songs.  Also, while the external speaker sounds good, I forego using the Motorola stereo headphones due to their poor sound quality.  Obviously, when I'm at the gym or on a transatlantic flight, I rely on my iPod for musical entertainment.Another con is the lack of EDGE or 3G technology on this phone.  Cingular is currently offering a 3G RAZR with many of these features (having iTunes replaced with Motorola's proprietary DAP MP3 player and no song limit), but sadly that phone is a tri-band model.  The download speeds are comparable to a 56K dial-up home connection, but many of us are now using cable or DSL at home, and at work using a T1/T3 connection, which makes downloading data from the Internet on my phone seem slow and cumbersome.Overall, this phone is one of the best on the market today.  I was a convert with the first RAZR, and with its subtle upgrades and refinements, the V3i is truly a worthy successor to the original.  However, with its few flaws, I'm still anxiously awaiting the "perfect" RAZR to be released from Motorola's braintrust.  Perhaps you could consider this the "penultimate" RAZR instead of the "ultimate" one.
Just got this phone and used it for 1 day.  The battery, fully charged overnight, lasted about 8 hours, with about 1.5 hours of talk time.The phone is set up for some asian country.  It was a nightmare to program for web access and multimedia messaging.  The voice interface is horrendous!  The accent of the voice is very thick, and it is very difficult to get it to recogize names in the phonebook.Additionally, the call quality is poor.  It constantly sounded like it was on the fringes of a reception area even when showing 5 bars of signal strength.  I am an amateur radio operator, and am thoroughly familiar with the vagaries of radio operation, and this problem was definitely with the phone.I have had a RAZR V3 for some time now, and the interface is similar enough to be able to figure out, but the phone is going back to Amazon.
I am using the cellphone in Argentina, and I cannot send or recieve messages or see the number of an incoming call. It may be because I'm using it here. The rest works perfectly.
Everything good , nicw work , fast delivery , nice cel , everything i espected
I have the V3i and it is a pretty cool piece of equipment, but I still have not figure out how to use the itunes and other features from the phone.
Ok. This phone is a big disappointment. The menus are horribly difficult to use and not user-friendly at all, even after a while. They simply are not logically organized. It may be nice and thin, which are the two main reasons for purchasing it but i find it confusing. Nokia has the best menus. i thought Ericson was bad but this really tops even them.
I thought I would be getting a phone that was essentially the same as the one for sale in the Cingular store.  When I got this one I found that there was no iTunes player and in fact I could not find any Music player at all.  The speed dial buttons continued to say they were empty when pushed despite the fact that the entries in the address book clearly listed the speed dials as assigned.  Some of the network features did not work - I suspect someone with ability to hack the phone may get this to work.  Charger that came was Large and bulky European version with and adaptor.  Otherwise the phone was fine and funtional as far as I could tell.  Just be sure you understand that all the features may not be the same as a US version.
I agree with the other reviewer that this phone stores the same contacts multiple times. i.e. same name with cell, home, work and email address would be stored as 4 different entries. So now if you have 100 contacts stored on your phone with four different numbers(cell,home,work,email etc), there will be 400 entries stored in your phone. and if you have to browse through then there are 400 entires to go through. Very very annoying feature.Did Motorola ever tested this phone before releasing. I guess not. What a waste of money. I am giving it 2 stars only because I am able to make phone calls with it!
The reviews are generally correct.  However, this phone will not pair with a Mac.  "Some" (I cannot find which) V3is do not work via Bluetooth with Macs according to web postings.  I was able to sync via USB easily, and iTunes also worked flawlessly.  I depend on Bluetooth syncing, however, so was very disappointed.
I just got my V3i at a bargain price as it is now an "old" model. I just use it solely as a phone (not intend to use the music player, dc, WAP, etc.) and find it to be a master piece. It is also a collectable. The battery life is excellent too as opposed to other comments.Get one fast while it is still available on the market.
I brought it last year because I don't want to carry an mp3 player and a phone at the same time.  I was extremely disappointed that when I brought the phone that it does not include itunes and it turns out that there are 2 different versions of v3i- one with itunes installed and another with DAP (motorola's digital audio player.)  I ended upgrading the phone with a firmware which allows you to have both itunes, with 100 song limit and DAP, (just google dmatt).  I got lucky and it comes with a 256mb card, but I upgraded to a FAR 512mb microsd card.  By all means, this does not replace an ipod or anything like that but I am not picky about mp3 players.  The itunes that it comes with is simple at best, and it does not support some mp3 formats and I had to reencode them to make it work.Pro'sLooks the same as the razr v3Allows you to sync with your outlook contacts and calendarbluetooth supportCall quality is pretty goodMp3 with Itunes (not as good as ipod though)Cons:No EDGE supportSometimes you have to reboot the razr because it does not read the memory cardTransfer from pc to phone is slow.
Good quad band phone with digital music player. Need to buy additional memory card to stre though.
Great phone!  I currently use it in Europe and in the U.S..  Amazon delivered it before the estimated shipping date!
I never had a phone give so much trouble as this phone. I brought this phone in October 2006 and it worked well initally, but now (less than one year after) it acts crazy and you press one button the volume goes up and sometimes blanks out totally!Also the battery doe snot hold a charge for any lenght of time. I regret buying this phone. Back to nokia for me.Please note, I am not alone, I have 2 friends experiencing the same problems.
I have now bought three V3i RAZR's in 6 months time and will never buy another one. I let my dad try out my first one and he gave it back damaged. I thought he just handled it rough because the paint rubbed off of the mouth piece area and the screen has a small crack in it. I found out that this phone is just waaaay too flimsy for every day use. My second one was crushed by my daughter and my third one already has a cracked front screen. I have no idea how the third one got cracked, but I tried to protect it with a leather case. I liked the features and function of the phone, but ended up spending close to $600 and still don't have a presentable phone. I recently bought a Samsung Blast because I have had much better luck with Samung (I still have Samsung flip I bought 4 years ago and it still works great, just no bluetooth). If you want a phone sturdy enough for everyday use, look for another phone.
The SLVR L7 (in my opinion) is one of the sleekest, feature-packed cell phones out there. Unfortunately, my provider (T-Mobile) doesn't offer this phone, so I went with this unlocked phone from Amazon.com. The plus is that I had absolutely no problem using this phone with T-Mobile.The down side is that this is a hobbled phone. ALL menu options for connecting a Bluetooth device are not only disabled, but are completely missing from this phone. To add injury to insult, the features that would allow you to connect the phone to a PC via USB are also missing/disabled.I confirmed this through a lengthy call to Motorola's tech support, who informed me that it would be impossible to enable the Bluetooth on the unlocked phone - even IF they did support it. Which they do not.The bottom line is that the phone's firmware cannot be updated to enable Bluetooth. For me, this is a dealbreaker ... especially living in California, where it will be illegal to drive and talk on a cell phone without a headset beginning in January, 2008. Sadly, I have returned this phone to Amazon due to the fact that it does not meet the description for the item. I wanted to write this review to alert potential buyers of this ... if I had known about the phone's limitations, I would have not purchased it.
This phone has great reception, I've yet to have a dropped call in the 2 months owning this phone.  I'm on the phone about 2 hours a day on average and the battery lasts 3 days if I don't charge it nightly.  The screen is bright and easy to read/navigate.  Overall a very good purchase.
My girlfriend gave me this phone for Christmas, and I can't tell you how much I was excited by it. Camera! Video! MP3 Player! Look how stylish and sexy this phone is! I get so many compliments!But after the heady honeymoon days of novelty are over, this phone demonstrates some serious, irritating flaws. Let's look at some.1. The physical design. At first blush, this phone looks great. And it really does. It is very compact, and yet it has a heavy feel, leaving the holder with the sense of "quality." Yet because of this, the phone is easy to drop (more so than other phones I feel). If you want to do "low tech handsfree," i.e. wedge the phone between your shoulder and ear, forget it. The person on the other end of the line won't be able to understand you, and you'll probably just drop it anyway. So it's physically attractive, but not particularly practical.2. Battery life. Not bad at first, but if you own this baby for a few months, the battery life diminshes rapidly.3. User interface. Again, it seems really cool at first. Look, ma, at all the things I can do! But once you get over that, and just want to modify basic things, you realize that the interface is clumsy with a lot of confusing submenus. Bad, bad motorolla.4. Picture quality of the camera. Atrocious, given the price of the phone. Much older phones give you better quality photos. What a joke. The pictures of such poor quality, I don't even bother taking any with this phone. What's the point?5. The MP3 player. Little did I know that I'd have to get special earphones to listen to mp3s on this phone. And again, the sound quality just isn't that great. Considering you can get a "decent" mp3 player for around 20 bucks, there is no excuse that this phone should have such a worthless one. Also, see no. 2, supra.6. Other little annyoing things about this phone. If you unplug your phone from its charger while the screen is "on" the "phone is recharged" message will stay on your screen, where the date is supposed to be. Not a big deal, but annoying. Also, I get blank text messages from a phantom sender every time I get off the phone with the voice mail. I've tried everything, and can't figure out how to stop it--if you know, I'd appreciate the help.In conclusion, this phone is all style over substance. It's a toy, and not a particularly fun one to play with. So if you receive this phone as a gift, great. However, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to buy this phone. Oh, and for all of you gushing over this phone who say "I just got it X days ago," just wait, my friends, just wait.
This is not the latest phone in the market but i would buy it again.  I never did like flip phones and that's why this phone was appealing to me. Straight and thin and actually feels very sturdy.  Almost like metal and not cheapo plastic.  Main features that i like, quad band... so i can use it anywhere in the world, great bluetooth (syncs with my handsfree and gps), as well as has one mini usb connector for car, home, and computer conenction.  This is great because now all i need is one cable to charge and connect all my gadgets.. camera, gps, phone...Do not buy this if you need a music player, good camera, or internet access.  THere are much better products out there.This phone is trendy enough to be cool but not too fashinable that it's uncool.  It's understated.
If you were disappointed like me with your RAZR, you should consider this phone. I wanted to stay with a Motorola phone because I have Motorola Phone Tools software setup to synch with my Lotus Notes contacts and calendar. This makes my phone SO much more useful to me. Its the ONLY thing I liked about the RAZR. When the Verizon store said I could bring it back in 30 days for whatever reason, I figured I had nothing to lose. I am genuinely pleased after 3 days of heavy use.Software: At first glance you will think that its using the same software as your RAZR. But its definitely improved.* The "Say a Command" function is MUCH improved -- and not only because its more polite ("PLEASE say a command"). Its much faster at responding and its  slightly more intuitive at guiding you through a command.* The menus system seems to respond much faster to key entry.* The menus have been reorganized slightly. Items are laid out more logically.Other major differences that I have noticed after 3 days of heavy use:* Keypad buttons are much smaller than the RAZR. No biggie. They were pretty large on the RAZR.* The side buttons are flush and less likely to be bumped while holding the phone (big problem I had with the RAZR). Of course, placement of the lens for the camera is alot less likely to result in a pic of a finger.* While the screen continues to perform poorly in sunlight, the SLVR is probably 15-20% better than the RAZR was. If you haven't noticed, most every slim phone has a dim screen in daylight.* The battery seems to hold a charge significantly better than the RAZR. After a day of use, my RAZR would be on one bar by the end of the workday. I had a heavy use day and the SLVR is on 3 of 4 bars now.The Music Essentials kit and a micro SD card are a must for any music lover. Audio is surprisingly good for a phone. The headset that comes with the kit doesn't carry bass as well as I would like, but its definitely adequate. I plan to transfer audio books onto the phone and listen to them via my car stereo's audio input.Edit: After two months of HEAVY daily use, the battery is still holding up much, much better than any of the RAZR batteries I ever hard.
This is a great phone. I love the memory card option.  The Camera takes great pictures, much better than my old Razr.  I would recommend it!
It's an excellent phone, and by changing the sim chip it can be used almost anywhere in the world, but... the screen is hard to read in direct sunlight.
I like this phone. I was kinda disappointed when i got it, i guess i hyped myself up way too much, its a pretty good phone though. I didn't like the selection of ring tones but i guess thats not too important. Reception is great, everyone hears me fine. Speaker phone is pretty good I've learned to put it on my left shoulder facing up. (if no headset or bluetooth)I'm actually buying it again because my husband loves it. So this is a birthday present to him :)
The popular Motorola L7 cellular phone is one of the thinnest mobile phones in the market.It is very easily slipped into a pocket or a bag. This small phone includes features such as a VGA camera, a large color display , digital audio player and Bluetooth connectivity. The Motorola L7 also features Java games and an e-mail client.The loudspeaker on Motorola L7 allows you to use it in the car while keeping your hands safely on the wheel.On Motorola L7's left side you will find the volume control buttons and the Smart key, that can be assigned to whatever function you may like.The ultra slim Motorola L7 also comes with an Integrated VGA camera with 4x zoom and video capture and playback, but its resolution is quite less and you cannot expect the best of picture technology.  You will never miss a chance to capture perfect moments, wherever they may happen.In the past, Motorola phones were palmed for their short battery life, but the Motorola L7 offers a longer life battery to perform all the functions for significantly longer time.
I LOVED this phone, back when I had the Cingular L7.  The screen is great, awesome features (If you are OK without iTunes).  I bought this unlocked version to replace my lost/stolen Cingular Slivr L7.  I had very poor reception with Cingular in the Twin Cities, MN.  I still love it, but I have decided I need the reception most of all.  Maybe T-Mobile is better with this phone?Please let me know :-)Great phone for staying in the city - Slim, great menus, bluetooth, speaker phone, great photos and a vibrant beautiful screen.
Didn't have ITunes, like the description says. Makes noise even when the phone is off, for example when its charging, it beeps. Motorola phone tools isn't included, and it costs like $30. If you have cingular, you cannot use MediaNet, and after you check your voicemail, you will recieve a text message from no one. EVERYTIME. This phone isn't worth the hassle.
I've had this phone for over a year and this is the best phone I have owned!!!!Pros:The itunes application is ridiculously easy to use and convenient if you prefer itunes on your comp.  But even if you don't prefer having itunes you can use "moto tunes" for same easy fucntionality. This phone is very slim and beautifully designed.  Mini usb and micro sd make it so much more desirable.  Syncing the progs with my comp were effortless.  And transferring data is a breeze. Speakerphone sounds good.  Call clarity awesome (I don't know if that's the quadband or Cingular).  Camera and video capture good even though VGA.Cons:Difficult to see the screen in sunlight. The fact that when you enter different numbers for the same person it creates a new entry. A flash for the camera would be nice.  A little more memory for the handset would be cool.  But with the memory card you can still store things at your fingertips.I am currently awating the release of the upgrade l9, which boasts a fm radio to add to all the other great assets.
If you are buying this phone for Itunes don't, all quadband Slvrs do Not come with Itunes which is the exact reason that I bought this phone, do not buy this phone if you are looking for Itunes.  The phone also doesn't work with T-mobile Internet so I can't get on the internet from it, also you can not download anything such as skins, games, multimedia texts, videos pics... etc, I am very disapointed with the phone and have been trying to replace it with amazon for a long time but they really arn't much help.  Be warned all that you are buying here is a phone that can send texts, talk, and take very poor pictures.  This phone cannot browse the internet if you use a service other than Cingular, I really warn you not to buy this phone, you may as well burn you money.
I ordered my Motorola SLVR L7 (Unlocked) and the battery was defective. I let the original charge on the battery go completely out. I then proceeded to fully charge the battery and it lasted less than a day. I repeated this process and came up with the same results, only this time the phone would not even come on once I plugged it to the charger. Note: the phone comes with a European charger with a US adapter, so that may have had something to do with it. Either way, I'm returning this unit and buying a completely different phone.
I buy it for my girlfriend and she loves it... has almost all functions of the Razors & K1 with extra funny animations. You can increase the storage capacity with an extra MicroSD card of 512MB. the only defect is the screen which is very delicate to scratches so you have to buy with a protective case at the same time. It supports spanish language.
I've had this phone for a couple of weeks, and overall I like it. The customizable menus are a great plus, and it's a nice looking phone.There are a couple of things that drive me craaaazy, though:This is my first bar-type phone, so maybe they're all this way, or maybe I just don't know what I'm doing. When I'm in the middle of doing something, like messing with the menus, and I stop for a second, the screen goes blank. This saves my battery, which is great, but there is no way (that I know of) to get the screen and/or keypad lights to turn on without pressing a button that "does something". If the screen is off I would expect to be able to press a button to turn it back on first, and then have the buttons register when the screen is on and I can see what I'm doing. The screen and keypad also do not turn on when I'm receiveing a call, so I have no idea who's calling and no idea what button I'm pressing if it's dark.Maybe my settings are wrong or something, but this really drives me crazy. Pressing "Clear" will turn the screen on, but it will "clear" whatever I was doing. If I have an incoming call, "clear" will light up the screen okay, but it's a hard button to find in the dark. The side speaker button pulls up a dialogue box which I then have to cancel out of to get back to what I was doing.If I could choose again, I would pick something else.
Anyone who thinks this is a great phone has never used even a very good phone.  Unless, just having a cool blue-lit keyboard and the ability to play mp3's is all you need to call it great.  My previous phone was a Motorola i930 Smartphone with a different carrier.What makes it mediocre?- I bought the accessories package which came with the  Motorola H500 Bluetooth headset.  The bluetooth connection, just from my waist to the headset, often has static.- the phone book can NOT store addresses- on the i930 smartphone, you could list someone as Julie Smith Sue's friend.  You could find this person by going to your phone book and typing  Sue.  this phone book can only jump to the first letter like J (you can NOT go to Ju, the names jump to any that start with U as soon as you push the second letter.  So with the name Julie, if you have 14 friends or businesses that start with J, you jump to the first J and then have to scroll down (or guess that it is closer to go to K and scroll backwards).- if you have contacts listed by their first name, you can NOT look up someone by their last name without going through about 4 menus to get to the "find" function.- the display font is somewhere between 7pt and 9pt, with no ability to change the size.  A typical printed page is 12pt.  I was able to change to a black background with white letters, so it is OK to read.- keys are small, I have to use my fingernail to accurately press keys.- keyboard goes dark after about 30 seconds, so you have to guess where the next button you need is located. . . . that also impacts . . .- the screen goes completely blank after 30 seconds.  So,if you get a message, an alarm, a calendar alert, you can't see it if you were not looking at the phone when it was received.  When you push any key, the display lights up, and you get to see the message for 1/10th of a second.  If you force yourself to ALWAYS push the speakerphone button before EVER doing any other function, like dialing a number, then you can see what was on the display before it went dark.  You may think this is no big deal; but it means if you ever set your phone down, and then leave the room, you must always push the speakerphone button when you pick up the phone, or you lose your reminder / alert.  This also impacts . . .- you can press down on the volume key to go to vibrate mode.  However, one more accidental bump of that key, which happens even in my motorola belt clip, makes the phone go silent.  So, you get a screen message for an incoming call, an alarm, a calendar alert, etc.- You can add several numbers to a name; but accessing more than the first one is a pain. (sometimes the right scroll button brings up the next number, usually not).  What impacts this is - if you loaded names and numbers (addresses are dropped) from your Outlook, and then you add a fax or cell number to someone who is already listed, that number is not sequentially in the phone, and so the number can NOT be accessed by scrolling with the right scroll button.  This was VERY easy on Motorola's i930, and phone types were marked with little letters, like m for mobile, h for home, w for work.  This phone has tiny icons, and if you make something the "main" contact number, you lose all traces as to whether that was home, mobile, whatever.- when I first got the phone with the Motorola Phone Tools (paid extra) I could copy pictures and MP3s to and from the phone; but my calendar and phone book would not sync with Outlook.  Motorola sent me a "fix".  Now Outlook calendar and phone book sync; but I can not put MP3s or photos to and from the phone anymore.- with my previous Audiovox, Kyocera, Nokia and Motorola phones I never found myself saying "what did you say?".  Now that happens at least every other day (I'd say I average 10 to 20 calls a day).- speakerphone volume is the lowest of any phone I have ever owned.- video volume is less than half of what I would get with the i930.  I recorded several songs done by a 100 person womans choral group.  Live they thundered the room.  I stood about 20 feet away to record video (maybe to even use as a ring tone).  When I play these wonderfully full-sounding songs for people, they have to hold the phone near their ear to hear the recording - so they can't see the video at the same time.  The Motorola i930 recorded and played well.What do I like?- setting up the bluetooth was easy, and it syncs right back up when I turn on the headset.  I only use the bluetooth a few calls per week, so I appreciate that it syncs up well.- the menus are customizable.  So I have four functions (most allowed) on the main screen which are things I use often  One item is my MP3 player; but I can no longer put music on the phone.- the phone is small; but not too small.- the screen is decent size.- it has a micro-sd slot; but it is under the battery.  My phone did not come included with a micro-sd card.  Of no use anymore to me since I can not copy pics or music to or from the phone.- the phone is sturdy- the camera zooms in nice - but I can't get the pics off the phone to comment on the quality.This phone does not have any benefits to me over the RAZR and isn't half the phone of the i930.  Before someone comments the i930 costs more, it was free with my last service, I went out of my way to pay $100+ extra to get the SLVR.  I would in hindsight have saved my money and gone with the RAZR or I would buy a different brand if given the chance.
great battery life, nice color screen, I'm enjoying every call I make! Plays more games than my other phone too.
The phone is unlocked, and all the features work flawlessly.  Aside from having to contend with the 220V adapter there isn't much to complain about.  A local purchase of the same product would cost a bit more, but would have come with a memory card and a wired headset.  Those aside I would still highly recommend this buy.  I am getting another one myself, and also buying a SANDISK 1GB card and a Motorola bluetooth headset to go along with it.
GREAT MOTOROLA PHONE.MINE IS UNLOCKED AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT ABROAD.
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.  However, the buttons are really tiny and scrunched together.  Compared to the razr, the slvr's keypad is extremely difficult to use.  I find myself having to hit the keys with my fingernails.  Also, it's extrememly uncomfortable to use for extended conversations.  You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.  It's not the most natural of angles, so your hand gets tired pretty quickly.  This phone has the same look as the razr, but it's definitely not as comfortable to use by any means.
This is a great phone, but it came with not only English letters and numbers on the keys but Japanese too. It isn't that big of a deal because it has English software, but it isn't the software that has iTunes which was one of my reasons for buying this phone. Other than that it's great it does have a music player similar to iTunes and has good picture quality for a VGA camera. It also has good reception. It texts good once you get used to it. It was a little hard at first.
My phone is very good to me, it had great reception and its so slim and slender it fits almost anywhere. it takes great pics and stores a lot with the kodak chip it comes with. I do suggest that if you get this phone you get the scratch resistance protection to go over the screen its very delicate and deserves to be treated with kindness. I have a thress year old who just has to talk on it.. this is a great phone at a wonderful price good luck and enjoy this baby!
I bought this phone with lot of excitement coz of its look and latest cutting edge technology in it.. i used it for 3 weeks and my experince was not good with this phone. i faced a bettry problem , with out any reason battery used to go down.. and some time phone turns off. i charge it twice a day and the same problem existed.Second problem was , the voice quality was not the good and also the ringing options were too bad.. finally i dumped this phone and got my nokia.. Life is easy now.
I used this piece for 6 months and finally dumped it. It freezes for no reason, use the bluetooth, voice dial, sneeze.......... When I use Bluetooth I have to turn of an on the phone atleast twice a day, it just stops working and you will miss incoming calls. What a piece of junk from Motorola.I brought my trusted Nokia and life is easy again.
I have really enjoyed the SLVR L7 Phone because it is not bulky and is somewhat easy to use.  The one thing that disappoints me is that the mp3 player is impossible to use!  I have yet to figure it out.  As a whole, I would say that if you're interested in having blue tooth capabilities on your phone and are not a fan of flip-phones, the SLVR L7 is the way to go.
I receive the phone in a timely manner.  I was just as advertise but I did not get the card and the earphones that you would get if you purchased it unlocked.
This a good phone, however think twice before you go out and spend additional money on a Micro SD chip and specially designed mini USB headphones.  The volume is set so low it is not usable as an MP3 player.
I bought this unlocked phone for a couple of reasons: to try to improve my erratic Cingular service, especially at my house, and to break free from the chains of my contract. On the first count, the phone does no better, or no worse, than my old phone, which is a bit frustrating, but oh well. At least I am not on a contract.This unlocked phone came with a manual in Arabic and a European-plug recharger cable. A converter to US plug was included in the box. Many of the features I have seen on friend's Cingular SLVR's were missing, including the iTunes software. There is probably some way to hack it on there.The camera is fairly decent for a tiny cell cam, it does the trick.All in all, it's a decent phone. For me it's a stop gap until the iPhone arrives.
the phone is an ok phone for its class. i was disappointed with the fact it came with no assessory or memory card or the software cd.
I bought this phone a month back and once in a while it just says SIM not found. Insert SIM - only emergency calls. This is a piece of junk and please stay away from this phone..
This phone is great on looks but has a fewe issues on functionality. It is too late to exchange, or else I would have done so.
I bought this piece being made to believe that it included itunes, since that was what was advertised on the website. It did not.  The phone overall is generally useless.  I actually switched wireless companies so that i could rid myself of this piece of junk.  My advice, do not buy this phone.  Do not buy this phone.  I am actually disappointed in Amazon for carrying and selling this item.
If your favorite brand is Motorola, know that motorola remains the same.
Me $30 Dolar back ? for use amazon visa ?
I needed to buy my mother a new cell phone so I could cancel my account with my existing provider and still keep the same number. I was a Tracfone user a few years ago while I was in college, and I found their services to be good. I went to the store and saw this phone priced very low; not so long ago you had to pay $70 for a Tracfone, and now they have them for less than $20. I decided that since she wasn't going to use the cell phone very much, this would be a good way to go until I could find something else.I bought this phone because it was cheap, and I could get it activated right away. This phone is very basic; most of the features that are now common place are missing on this model. The screen is microscopic; it can only display a few lines at a time. There are no polyphonic ringtones, and it can only hold 100 entries in the phonebook. They keys are so firm that they are hard to press down, and the menus are tedious and somewhat counter-intuitive. It is very sturdy, but also a little heavier than should be for a phone its size. There is no web browsing like there is on other phones. The text messaging feature is really tricky to use. I think Tracfone has good service, but in many ways, this phone feels like a step back from where Tracfone was going to.I have noticed that Tracfone has moved away from using the CDMA network and towards using the GSM network. I don't think that is bad, it just means slightly less coverage overall. Tracfone's service is not bad. I think this phone is a decent choice for someone who is wanting a very basic phone to talk on. It is less than $20, so I can't complain too much. However, if there is any way that you can afford it, I suggest if you are going to use Tracfone's service, go with a pricier phone with more features.
I too had one of the older model phones, and after letting the battery drain to zero I lost everything, including phone number and service minutes.  Tracfone did acknowledge problems with the firmware of the older phone, and they sent me a new one with a postage paid mailer to send back the bad one.  They also gave me 60 bonus minutes of airtime to replace what I lost when the phone lost its mind.Although they did everything right, the customer service is very, very frustrating.  The people read from scripts word for word like robots, which will get you to the ultimate goal of your call but it personally makes me crazy.Technically (and coverage wise) the phone works well, and the price is certainly right.  After several months of buying air time cards, I signed up for a $9.99 a month plan that gives me 50 minutes each month automatically.  That is plenty enough time for a very casual cell phone user such as myself, and is way cheaper than any subscription plan I could find.
I've been a Tracfone customer for about 8 years.  I have two very old phones plus the Nokia I just used for 6 years or so.  It still works well, too!The phone I had before this C-139 was a small Nokia.  It worked well but kept turning on and dialing numbers, while hanging freely in a pouch inside my purses.  This one does not.I like Tracfone because I can buy time for a year and a double minute card and I'm good to go!  My account & tel # stays the same for a year.  And I don't have a monthly bill or a phone growing out of my ear!  Yes, I do not appreciate those (idiots) who yack on the phone while they try to pay attention to their driving, discipline kids,...all the while; turning corners and drinking take-out coffee.  The possibility of them hitting my car while they're arguing with someone or reviewing last night's date scares the hell out of me!This Motorola has been out for a while but I just got it.  It's great!  The color background is much nicer and clearer than the Nokia (mono color and limited light.)They are about the same size.  The Nokia is a little slimmer, but heavier than the Motorola.  The Motorola has grips on the sides and has a gr8 feel in my hands.  It is Bluetooth compatible and the options are more sophisticated and plentiful than the Nokia.  I feel like I went from Bedrock to the 1990's.I know there are better phones out there (without a service plan)...maybe next year we'll get camera phones with newer features that aren't even out yet!  But for now, they do the trick...calling AAA when one of the cars break down.
Beware Tracfone. I regret that Amazon won't let me give them 0 stars. We got this phone for my wife's aunt last December. After 1 year of trying to get this working, she still cannot receive calls. She can call out, but no one can call her. Tracfone support is useless (and generally only marginally speaks English). You also cannot manage the phone or minutes on line. You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything. We're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless. Coverage isn't good either, but who cares if you can't receive calls anyway? There has got to be a better option, because I doubt there are many worse ones.
The phone may work fine but the company managing it is awful!! Get ready to waste all your minutes on 611 calls. (Unlike other companies 611 customer service calls are not charged as actual phone units.)Took forever to get to customer service, which is not properly trained and cannot understand plain English (some do some don't).Charged me for calls not connected etc...Really disappointed.. I lost close to 60 not so cheap units in a customer service call and they did not take care of the issue. I could not make international calls like advertised in their website. Really sad. With Tracfone  you really get what you pay for...that is their motto and that is the reality.... Google tracfone and below the links to the company you will see a webpage with tons of bad reviews and problems with the company.
I've been using the phone for 12 months and it hasn't been as good as I initially thought. Granted, this was a top of the line phone a year ago and it wouldn't have been possible to get anything much better.Gripes: (1) Voice quality is not that clear. A colleague also complained about this. (2) It randomly re-boots, including in the middle of calls. Something seriously wrong here. (3) Photos are noisy although this is not unexpected in a fixed-focus device. (4) The 'slider' form-factor is a pest. I found my previous clam-shell phone easier to operate.Update - after 12 months this phone has now been 'scrapped'. No one in the family is interested.
Cost:I was able to purchase this phone for about $290 unlocked so I could use it with my tmobile to go account.  That seems expensive when there are places you can get phones for free.  I don't talk that much on the phone so I don't use a lot of minutes so my total cost each year (I buy a new phone about every 3 years) is only around $175-200.  A plan at $30/month with a free phone would be $360 a year.Features:The camera phone is very detailed; however the lens is in a bad spot--right where you would hold the phone normally would be blocking it.The video works poorly for motion, but works well otherwise.The MP3 player is pretty good.  Storing the files on it is easy, as is setting up your playlists (4 with 30 songs in each).  The speakers are ok sounding for not having the size needed to get decent low end.  It will also play via a bluetooth headset which is cool.  I found the Motorola stereo headset cheap online (paid about $65 versus $140 I just saw it for in a store).  When listening with these, the music sounds very good.  It also came with a USB set of earphones; but these were too uncomfortable and the cord is too short to be practical (I'm not that tall either--5'9").Another neat feature is the converter.  I thought it would just do currency; but it also does length, weight, volume--very neat if you do a lot of travelling outside the US.As a phone it seems pretty good.  It does not have quite as strong a signal as one with an external antenna; but it is quite good, volume in the earpiece is decent and calls are clear and understandable.The package came with lots of goodies:  A CD-ROM with a file transfer wizard to move files on and off the phone.  USB earphones.  2 batteries, an external charger (handy when using the MP3 for a while--one battery dies, change it with the one on the charger), case to hang phone on belt, USB cable to send files from computer to phone (it will also do it via bluetooth), and the phone came with a couple of long cool videos that I watched, then deleted to free up space on the phone.A very enjoyable experience so far working with this phone.
I've had this cell phone for two months now, and I can say that this is a great phone, with a couple significant flaws. I've been looking for a cheap smart phone for some time, and I have to say this phone meets my basic needs.Pros:- Good looking design, as expected from Motorola- Great versatility. It's many functions add value to the phone. It has everything I was looking for (except full email sync with your computer email client). 2 MP still/video camera, media player (RealPlayer), FM Radio, calendar, bluetooth, web browser, document reader, ... the works.- Linux OS, with Java enabled, which opens a world of possibilities. There are a lot of great Java apps designed for this phone on the internet. Is just a matter of looking for them. My first downloads were the Gmail app (gmail on my phone!) and the Opera Web browser, which is great.- Micro SD slot.- The Real Player is great, it plays most media file formats. And I bought a 2 GB memory card, so it's like having a music player as well.- Quad band, so you can roam almost anywhere.Now, the Cons:- Big con #1: Miserable battery life. I use the phone a lot (for calling, web browsing and it's other functions), and I have to recharge the phone every other day. Thankfully, it comes with the USB cable to connect with a PC, and after loading Motorola Phone Tools, you can charge it via the USB ports of your PC. It's been a life saver at work. This is a major flaw by Motorola. If you are gonna cram so many functions on a phone, you might as well bundle it with a larger capacity battery.- Big con #2: Not so great processing speed. After I read a couple of the reviews here, I though the phone would be blazing fast because of the processor and all, but let me say that I am quite disappointed at it. For example, after placing a call, the phone takes like 2 to 4 seconds to end the call and return to the normal screen. Or after quiting the internet browser, it freezes for 2 to 4 second when it's closing the GPRS connection. Also, the Real Player takes some seconds when it loads a file. It may seem that I'm being a little whiny, but after some time it really gets annoying, specially if you are in a hurry.- The camera, being 2 MP and all, is not so good. You need to have a steady hand, or else you are gonna get a lot of blurry pictures (and the worst part is, if you download the images to your Windows PC, you cannot modify them, because they are transferred as Read-Only, and you cannot just change this on the file's properties. I'm guessing it's something of Linux permissions. I'm still going to look into that). And the video quality is not great as well. I got better videos with my old SE Z520a, which BTW, look great on the A1200's screen.- No full email sync support.- Finally, the screen is a dirt magnet. I have to clean the phone's screen every now and then, partially because I have a very oily face.Although I'm giving 3 stars, I have to say I'm happy with the A1200. Besides those 2 major flaws, the phone is cheap in comparison with other smart phones and has a lot of functions that make it a great every day tool for communication, organizing and entertainment.
It's actually a Linux (yes, it's Linux!!!!) based smart phone. With the help of a 312MHz Intel XScale processor, all software is running pretty fast. Even 3D applications work smoothly because of the Mobile 3D Graphics API provided by this phone. A1200 supports doc, xls, ppt, HTML and pdf files, as well as various picture formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF and WBMP). The realplayer in this phone could play MP3, WMA, RealAudio, MIDI, WAV, AAC and AMR in the background and RMVB, MPEG4, 3GP in full screen mode. And I heard that there even exists a GPS software you can download online for A1200. To sum up, you shouldn't miss Motorola A1200. It's definitely a good choice.
This phone is an exceptional phone. I must admit I was skeptical about buying since it was not really supported in the US. But this international phone is excellent. It's really a good phone, behaves almost like a computer. I like the character recognition where you can write on the touch screen and the characters appear on the line. (available in English and Chinese only). I was also with the real player and music and file storage capabilities. Good phone to buy if you have the cash to get it. The only thing is that I haven't figured out how to connect to the internet but I don't use it anyway.
'Got my Ming in April 2006 as my birthday gift from my husband (a Linux geek).  I simply wanted a "smart phone" that I can write notes and access my email while I'm on the road, a calendar to remind me of my appointments and yes - it must be a quad band as I travel to many countries all the time. Not a lot to ask for right? Honestly I was looking at a Sony Ericsson quad band at that time. But this Linux based Motorolla won my husband over (I'm not really a Moto fan :( - had a bad experience with Moto before - Motos are not 'dummy' friendly). The extra stuff .. camera, radio, blutooth,real player are just added bonus for me; don't really use them much. Oh, I use the Alarm clock daily - I love the snooze function.I've been using it here in the States since last summer and opened a line with Cingular (since its a GSM). The folks at Cingular helped me access the internet so now I can read my gmail and google anytime, anywhere - just don't stay online too long - Cingular's internet rates can leave a hole in your wallet.The pros ? .. yeah just what the other reviewers said. "Ditto"The cons .. lately I found that there are times when I receive a call, only a dead sound would come from it. At first, I thought it was the network's problem but when I switched it off and turn it back on, it was "normal" again. A small mechanical defect. Alas, its not perfect after all. I find the battery life short - compared to a Nokia, but my husband solved that problem - he also got me a spare battery.Another suggestion : REMEMBER to put a protector sheet on the screen - as it will take a lot of beating!!I'm still not a Motorolla fan (thus the 4 star), but this phone has met my requirements. And its sleek looks really does impress - even the Cingular folks.....In response to an earlier comment why its not marketed in N Am.This beauty was created for the Asian (China/HK) market in particular. Thus the name : Ming. Statistically - Asians are the highest users of mobile/cell phones - which they usually upgrade often as new models come out quarterly.I'm kinda sad that its here in the States now...my Ming won't be unique anymore.Enjoy your Ming. Let the Dynasty begin. :)
This phone is simply awesome.  Its like having a phone, a MP3 player and a PDA all in one.  The resolution is sharp and clear.  What I like most about it is the business card capture feature.  Its so amazing because the phone captures the information from a business card 99% of the time and allows you to store it in the address book.  Another great feature is the ability to listen to my local radio stations.  Best of all is I can download my own MP3 files and listen to music whenever I want without need to carry a separate MP3 player.  Its easy to use and understand.  I definitely recommend this phone.
Although I am not a Motorola fun I must admit that his is an excellent phone.  It is easy to use and you do not even need toread te instructions book to learn it.It is different to most other phones as it has a touch screen that you have to use your fingers or the (included) stylus to dial a number or use he menu.  The software is quite user friendly and there is an option to always have the dial numbers on the screen, a function that is quite useful.The pros-long lasting battery-blutooth actually works very well-easy menu and easy to use-top quality screenthe cons-some of the menu requires the use of the stylus or very precise fingers-camera is not as quick in capturing images-only two languages, english and chinese (both mandarin and cantonese)Overall the cons have little significance if you compare them with th positives of the phone.Lastly the design is stunning and if you like flip phones then this could the right one for you
I bought this phone few weeks ago!...First of all the battery life-time sucks!...It doesn't even last 4 continuous hours...In addition, I have such a problem for setting-up the network (T-Mobile)... I called the network and they said I have to call the manufacturer..then called Motorola and they couldn't help me at all suggesting to call my network...at the end...I cannot use the greatest features that this cell phone has... Don't buy it until you are sure your network has support for it!
This phone does everything it is advertised to do, simply and quickly.  The biggest problem with it is getting the data applications (email etc) configured for local service. With a little digging you can find all the necessary information on your provider's website (well Cingular/ATT anyhow)  Reception with the phone is amazing, going places where I have had limited cellular reception in the past, I find much better signal strength.
I was losing faith in Motorola's products progressively over the last 4 years, with three of their phones failing me within a year of buying them. Problems with dropped calls, inadequate call quality, volume jitters, flimsy construction.. u name it.This phone however looks like the one to swing it around. Its an excellent phone for the price, has exceptional call quality, and above average network hold. Can easily double up as a PDA, and features a full html browser, not some sorry excuse for an internet browser on a lot of phones out there. It has a cool tactile feedback system which works well with fingers as well as the included stylus.The camera is really good, 2M to be exact, has a really good player, and speakers to listen to u r music. I am actually surprised this phone was never promoted as much in the US. For some reason the US motorola phones all seem to be based on the RAZR model, not something I am particularly fond of.All in all, an excellent phone to have, with a robust feature set, and something that does what a phone should do very well, make and receive calls.
I picked up the MotoMing from Amazon and i love the phone it does all that i wanted in the smartphone..e-mail, internet access, pictures, calender and more...couple of problems that came with it though...1)the phone came programed in chinese, took me a while to figure out how to change it to english...2)all access internet links and email links are hong kong based links, not usable for me and the help is not quite good enought to change it, got it figured out with the help of a friends smartphone, checked her settings and aligned mine to similar (not same since we use different carriers)...3)the final problem i have with it is the sensitivity of the touch screen, sometime touching my face is enough to shut off a call, putting a screen protecter on it reduced this sensitivity.....Other then these listed problems i love my Ming, small but complete, it is 1/2 the size of other smart phones, i still use my PDA and can link the two of them with the blue tooth connection.....Hope you find this information helpful....D
Love this phone...does everything, and easier than my former Pearl, and my husband's Treo 380.  Great customer service via Motorola for Q/A. ...Easy set-up.  Timely shipping from Amazon.  No regrets trading in my Razor and Pearl on this phone.  Hope it's in the U.S. cell phone companies soon.  Bought another on EBay as a Christmas gift for a techie nephew, and he loves it too.  Has rubberized outer coating and it doesn't slip on surfaces easily.  Battery charge OK, lasts 24 hours with lots of talk time, but it's easy to keep charged between car and home.
My dad bought this for me as a birthday gift in March, so I've had it for 7 months now..I love this phone.  It really caught my attention when I saw it.  The pros of this phone is that I get really good reception with it.  I have cingular and other people I know who have cingular will have no service, while I'll have 2-3 bars.  It is user friendly, and the speakers are clear and crisp.The cons on this phone however included, the screen gets dirty easily, especially when my cheek rests on it.  The clear covering also seems to scratch easily, (not big ones, but little ones)Overall I would recommend this phone, its great for text messaging, and its not too big, to carry around.
I love this phone, in every way.  I was so skeptical to spend so much money on a cell phone.  The day I got it I was so impressed with it.  I think this phone with all of its' features and the touchscreen is worth the money and more.  I could not be happier!
This phone has lots of features but also has problems.  The software is a bit buggy, my calendar alarm started going off ever 30 minutes and the only way to stop it was resetting my entire phone (losing all changes).  Tech support guy at motorola was abrasive and didn't know much - But then that is not unusual for phone tech support.  The phone emits an emf squeal picked up by most computers, stereos and tv's that are nearby about every 15 minutes.  If you use your phone as a watch you will miss not having the time displayed in a little exterior window and of course it is incapable of surfing the internet using wireless networking.  If you are looking to bundle a phone and pda in one unit with a clamshell design there really isn't anything else out there so I guess that makes this unit #1 in it's class.  And at least you have a choice of phone providers without the manufacturer bricking you for choosing the wrong one.
This is a great phone.  No problems so far.  Lots of features.  It can be a little difficult to flip open, but you get used to it and if you are using a headphone you dont have to open it as often.  The only other thing is that I wish the ring volume was a little louder.  It's a unique looking phone and I love the voice command feature!  Great phone!
I am having this phone since oct '06 and it works fine in different countries. I have used it in UK, USA, Canada and India and its flawless.It looks very elegant and everywhere I go people do notice this phone.Feature wise it is very rich with FM radio, 2.0 megapix camera and unique Business card reader which scans the business card and automatically stores the info in the addressbook.Overall very much satisfied with the phone, I wonder why Motorola is not launching this product for North American market.
Phone delivered on time, as promised, and worked perfectly as soon as the SIM card was plugged in.  My hard-to-please, tech-oriented, image-conscious 16 year old was completed satisfied.  That says it all!
I got this phone from Amazon yesterday. It works great. The screen is incredibly bright and the sound quality from the speaker is very loud and crisp. The interface is very intuitive, although it took me a while to change the screen language from the default Chinese. I am surprised American carriers don't have this phone (as far as I know). It has the full functionality of a PDA with appointments, tasks, notes, contacts etc. The included stylus works great for entering text, with a great handwriting recognition software (although I use the on-screen keyboard because it is faster). Reception seems to be stronger with this phone than the Samsung I previously had. It is thin enough to easily fit into my pants' pocket. I couldn't get my Napster songs to play with the RealPlayer that is included with the phone but I am sure Rhapsody songs would play. Plus, I just started shopping for mp3's from Amazon, which of course play well on this phone. The only complaint I have is with the included synchronization software which is proprietary to most Motorola phones. It took me almost 2 hours to get it to work properly. It is clumsy and sometimes hangs during synchronization. It took a lot of trials for it to finally recognize my phone. I also heard that it is problematic with Office 2007 (I use Office 2003 to synchronize my tasks, calendar and contacts). I had a similar experience with an earlier Motorola phone and it was the exact same software a couple years ago.Besides that, I think it is a great phone, the camera pictures are sharp. I didn't work on the video and card reading capabilities yet, but other reviewers suggested they work mostly fine. I also purchased a 2GB MicroSD card from Amazon (around $25, a great bargain), which also comes with a standard SD adapter, and it allows me to store hundreds of songs and pictures on the phone. All in all, a great price for a phone without a contract, and I very highly recommend it.
Great little phone, lots of very cool features. I'm not a computer wiz,and this is very easy to operate. The one draw back is the voice command dosen't seem to be very accurate, but I'm still working out the bugs. Overall Love It!
Fabolous phone, I really like it, It is build in Linux, which makes it faster than the oders... the Touch screen is great... Buy it and try it!!!!
Excelente compra!! muy rápido y eficiente la tienda. Recomiendo 100% comprar productos por esta tienda. Compré el celular desde Caracas, Venezuela y lo recibí satisfactoriamente!!!.
LO BUENO:PEQUEÑO, FUNCIONAL, RAPIDO, MUCHAS FUNCIONES!LO MALO:DIFICIL PARA ABRIRLO, VOLUMEN MUY BAJO, NO SIRVE EL MSN (ESTA EN CHINO), DIFICIL ENVIAR MENSAJE CON UNA SOLA MANO!!!!PARA TODO LO DEMAS!!!! MASTER C...D
Its like a palm. Works well, nice applications format. Battery life is good.The only defect it has it is dificult to open, but overall its an excellent phone.
The phone is very nice and look cool, I buy 2 one for me and one for a friend.... I decide not to use it after a few hours become the phone tools not Synchronize with Outlook 2007 calendar and task.my friend don't have the to Synchronize with Outlook and he like the phone very match. one of the coolest tools is "presentation card scan" that field automatically your contact list.I give it 4 stars because of the lack of compatibility with Outlook 2007 that is essential part for a smartphone.Just for a note: I understand that the sync problem is only with outlook 2007 in Outlook 2003 there are no report about this problem. (my luck (: )
I edited my previous review and starts with recently added review:Beware, There is no valid warranty for this phone if bought in USA. So there is no use of registering the product also. I contacted the Motorola customer service, and they replied (after a month) that this phone is not eligible for US warranty.Everything below is what I wrote before:This phone is packed with a lot of features and certainly meets various user  expectations. But some of the things I found in my phone are not pleasing:1) Low Battery life, 2) Low volume (when calling/talking), and peculiarly regular/normal voice level when alarm or ring-tones and click-tones like when you navigate).Other than that, I noticed that the first time, you switch it on (after opening package), everything we see is Chinese and I had to search the web for some instructions to choose blindly some unknown letters on the screen to convert the language from Chinese to English - and a great relief.Lastly, I don't see any software updates -- probably the phone is sent with the latest software tool.So it covers most of what we want. A good buy if you already bought, and if you are thinking of buying, compare battery life and volume of other phones with this.Regards,Sooner
I've neved had a phone this great! and it came to me just when my PDA was already passing out. Totally recommended!! stylish, versatile and compact. great combination!
the Motorola Ming is an AMAZING phone, but to everyone out there who texts at all, this is not the best phone for you.. I had this for 2 days and finally decided to take it back and get a different phone with a keypad. Other than the texting though, its an amazing phone
The phone is ok. However, the battery is a joke. You will need recharge it every night. J&R; includes a (paid) bulk adapter to fit american standards : a minimum movement of the adapter and the charger will not work while you believe that your phone is getting power ! The bulk adapter is useless since you can simply remove the european plug and use the two pin plug that originally comes with the charger. The Motorola Phone Tools is another joke: simply does not recognize the cell !
This is the best telephone I have had. Is really easy to use and to understand
This Motorola A1200 Ming, is my best friend, I know it since 1 week, and really Forget my Moto V3.
Nice phone,I like a lot but ..Yes always a "but"... In the sunlight, the screen becomes slightly useful...But still very good phone, strength signal, the battery last two days in full use. I recommend it
good the product is surprising, really single that good for the people whom it likes to go to celebrations they have to have you take care of since he is very delicatefor that reason I give 5 stars him

This is a great everyday use phone. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the newer Nokia phones, like integrated WiFi (with VoIP integration) and GPS, but it does very well what is designed to do. I use this phone with T-Mobile with their unlimited Internet plan (using EDGE).Pros:The build quality and materials chosen are top notch. The plastic cover doesn't look and feel cheap, like many other (some expensive) phones out there. I like the fine leathery touch of the battery cover, which provides a good grip of the phone in the hand.The internal screen is large, with plenty of pixels and colors. Most of the apps look very well. With Google Maps for example it's very easy to read and discern the details.The phone' sound quality is superb. The earpiece is very clear, and the microphone and voice processing hardware inside the phone makes the other side hear you clearly. The loudspeaker is fairly good too, although I'm not using it very often.The Bluetooth software stack is perfectly compatible. My car's Bluetooth implementation is very picky and works only a handful of selected phones. The Nokia 6131 phone is not listed as a compatible phone for BMW M3, but it works just fine with it, while the fancier and more expensive Nokia N80ie phone does not.The included radio is pretty cool when you're bored, although it requires the included proprietary headset to work (it uses it as antena).Google Maps and GMail work excellent on this phone. They don't come with the device, but they're just a download away from Google.The phone's camera does a fairly decent job with well lit shots. It also takes videos, which is pretty cool for a phone. Just don't expect the camera to replace your point and shoot or DSLR.The ability to use MP3s as regular ring tones is a huge bonus. No more buying ridiculously expensive ring tones from your phone company, when you already own the music. Just take the song you want, edit out a 30 second portion of it that is suitable as a ring tone, convert it to MP3 and upload it on your phone. You could assign different ring tones to different people, so you can recognize who's calling you.The phone now has MacOS X compatibility, with the latest 10.4.9 release. It synchronizes your address book over Bluetooth without any problems, including the people's pictures. When somebody calls you, his/her picture appears on the external display. The picture is scaled up however, making it look a bit ugly. I guess Apple needs to allow for higher resolution pictures to be set in AddressBook.Cons:As many other Nokia phones, the phone cannot use a regular headset, it only works with the proprietary Nokia headset. This is understandable, as the headset is stereo, and doubles as an antenna. It would be nice however to have an extra plug for regular headsets.The package does not include a MicroSD card. Not too bad, they are quite cheap, but you should be aware of this if you decide to buy the phone.The camera shutter button is on a side, and it's very easy to press it accidentally while the phone is in your pocket.Setting up T-mobile Internet on the phone could be a pain. You could find instructions online by googling a bit, but it's not the same smooth "just works" experience as on the N80ie.--Overall, I think this a great phone for everyday use. It is replacing an aging Motorola phone, and so far it's been a refreshing change. I highly recommend this phone.
I've used the Nokia 6131 phone for 2 months, it has a great feature set and I initially thought it'd be a good phone - beware of reviews posted after only a few days of use.Battery life is abysmal.  With bluetooth, etc. enabled, initially I was getting about 1.5 days of useful life.  After 2 months, with bluetooth disabled and all power saving features set the phone won't last 24 hrs between charges.The phone will not work with a dead battery even when plugged into the charger.  You must wait until the battery has sufficient charge before the phone can be used.  And charge time is slow - charging while driving 45 min daily did not get or keep the phone fully charged.  You'll need to plug it in to the charger every night.Unlike other phones this phone does not charge when connected via the USB cable.  And the USB cable is proprietary - you cannot use a standard mini-USB.The Nokia-proprietary stereo headset left earbud stopped working after 2 weeks.  The radio and mp3 player do not support a bluetooth headset (mine is mono - not sure if a stereo bluetooth headset would work).  So for me, no NPR or audiobook MP3s on the bluetooth headset.The lid of the phone presses the "0" button when very little pressure is applied.  Take it out of your pocket and you'll have to clear the "000000000"'s before dialing.  Oh yeah - those 0's also took your phone out of its power-saving sleep mode and consumed valuable battery life while you were not using it.The flip-button is neat but I handed my phone to a friend to call home, didn't tell him about the button and when he opened it without the button - crack, the cheap-o latch broke.  It should have been designed to work ok for the button-uninitiated.I've had great success with other Nokia phones but this one is a failure. I expect they'll get flip phones right at some point but I'll be using another brand until then.
This is a high quality phone, with excellent voice quality.  Battery life is great.The camera and video features work exceptionally well.My only quibble with it is that the camera button is easily pushed while the phone is in my pocket.
My girlfriend bought a this phone 2 months ago, and from day one complained about the battery life. I thought she was exaggerating but she got so sick of it that she ditched it in favour of my older nokia. Just yesterday I decided I'd try out the 6131 for myself, because I'm partial to new gadgets.I started the day on a fully charged battery. By 1pm, after a total of about 30/40 minutes of phone calls and about 5 or 6 SMS messages sent and received, along with about 10 minutes of playing Sudoku, the battery was showing as down to a quarter of its full life. I need my phone all day, so I promptly switched back to my Sony Ericsson K750i.The *appalling* battery life of this phone renders it almost unusable as a day to day phone. I'm surprised this phone ever got released into production by Nokia. Generally I'm a Nokia fan- I like their user interfaces, although I am a bit less gone on their phone design in general. But this particular model is a failure in my opinion.Other bugbears about the phone:No micro SD card included as standard. Just seems a bit cheap to me.Camera button on the side of the phone is easily activated when the phone is in your pocket, draining the battery even more quickly.Non-intuitive interface at times, e.g. when sending messages you have to scroll down 3 items to access your contacts. Not a deal-breaker, but an annoying niggle not present on my last NokiaPositive points:Quite a nice clamshell design.Easy to use, big keys
I bought this phone to use when I travel in Europe.  I've been very pleased with my experience thus far.  It's true that the device devours the battery - make sure you're prepared to charge it every night, or buy a second battery.  My favorite feature of this phone is that you can set it to vibrate and ring at the same time - probably sucks up more of the battery life, but I'm less likely to miss a call this way.  I wish my LG could do this!This device comes with a UK-native plug and a US adapter.
This is by far the best phone I have ever used.  True to Nokia's reputation the voice quality is fantastic.  This phone has so many features I just can't imagine wanting anything else - name the connectivity and it has it, name the option, it's there!  If you want a small, light, pseudo PDA then this is the phone, from push to talk to calendaring and light email this is it, add to that seamless global usage and what can I say....
I love this phone.  I love this phone so much that I'm on my third one!  No there was nothing wrong with the previous two other than they went for a swim in the ocean - I work on a boat so it's a hazard of the job!  I have always liked Nokia for their ease of use, and rarely have I had to pick up the manual to find a function on the phone.  I digressed slightly with a 'hand-me-down' Sony Ericsson for a couple of years which simply wouldn't break - although I hated the layout of the menu and functions I didn't want to spend unneccessary money on a new phone.  I eventually managed to wear out the keypad on it and that was a good enough excuse to return to my first love - the Nokia!I will say that the only downside to this phone is the robustness - or lack of - of the exterior finish.  I have had problems with the matt black finish delaminating & often the first thing to get damaged is the mini screen - which gets  scratched very easily.  If you can handle your phone being anything other than pristine - which face it - they all become after a few months then you will be extremely happy with this stylish, compact and generally cool phone.The other bonus about this particular version is the relatively good price for an unlocked phone - which if you are familiar with then you will understand.  Plus being Quadband means it is usable practically anywhere - even in the outer islands of the Bahamas where they still use some antiquated TDMA system!Enjoy!
all the good things you will read in others reviews is absolutely right.big botons to dial, great reception, the push to open boton, terrific display, extremely well designed menu, easy and intuitive to use...simplythe best cell phone I've ever had.that's  something you will not regret to buy...
This is a good phone. Many of the complaints I read about the phone were true. The camera button is not really thought out being on the side. I have many pictures of my pocket. The volume adjustment is a little funky. But overall it's a great little phone.Hope this helps.
After using my previous cell phone for such a long time I knew it was going to be a challenge to find one that I would like.  This phone does not disappoint.  I sent back my Motorola slvr which I originally ordered and exchanged it for this one, no regrets.First off the 'soft-touch' paint feels great in you hands and the leathery touch on the back helps you to grip the phone batter.  It certainly does feel like better quality materials in your hands.  The flip-to-open button works nice. I've never seen that on a phone before and it's damn handy.The keypad is nice and big and it's so easy to dial and text.  The nice big display screen helps with that too.The menus and interface itself is great.  It's simple and pleasant to use, which is the main reason I switched from the Motorola.  Some of the options are unusually further down the list then most other phone menus but I got around that quick.  Voice reception and signal are great and the ring volume and speaker are plenty loud enough.The camera is a little grainy in low light, but otherwise fine, you can assign your images to you contacts or wallpaper.  This phone is very customizable.The camera button is on the outside and can be accidentally pushed, though to be honest you need to have a lot of stuff tightly packet in your pocket for that to happen. It hasn't happened to me yet.  I haven't owned the phone long enough to say about the battery life yet, though I can see why it might drain some battery life with its mini-outer screen as well.Overall this is a great phone.  If you want a phone for its 'ease of use' then I would highly recommend it.
This phone is quite nice, easy to use, the keyboard is great. However, there are two things that really annoy me - the screen gets dirty and disgusting. And - get this - the phone dials on its own! The thing just goes through the phone book and randomly calls people, as it is sitting in my purse. I have tried discussing with t-mobile this issue, and looks like will have to replace the phone itself. Very-very annoying, not to mention embarrassing.
I'm a long-time fan of Nokias but have never purchased a clamshell-style phone from them; like their other form factors the phone is well-built, easy-to-use, and performs all functions with speed & ease. A few high points on this particular model:- fantastic screens, inside & out- great feel to the keypad & nice case texture- the 'flip-open' button is excellent- the signal and battery quality are, per normal Nokia standards, superb
Very happy with this phone. I was using an unlocked 6102i prior to this one and it was an excellent phone as well. The 6131 makes great calls and I am with Cingular.Beautiful internal screen, big buttons and neat rubbery finish on the outside. Unique design, press a button and the phone opens up. I really think this feature is cool.The 1.3 mp camera with 8x zoom takes excellent pictures, especially when your are used to using a VGA with no zoom. The micro sd card, another excellent addition. I was used to taking 5 or 6 pics only to run out of memory and have to start deleting pics. I bought a 1 gig card and have no more memory problems.Great FM radio along with mp3 player. I already had the Nokia stereo headset needed for the FM radio for my 6102i and it works perfectly on the 6131. I transferred about 150 mbs of music via bluetooth to the phone from my PC. Works great. I can listen over the speaker or listen by bluetooth or headset. Speaking of bluetooth, this phone has  no problem pairing up with bluetooth devices. Speakerphone is great for phone calls as well when not using bluetooth.Edge technology is plenty fast for internet browsing. As with any unlocked phone you will spend a few hours the first day getting downloads from Nokia, googling, tweaking settings, etc. to get the internet, MMS, text messaging, email, etc. to working. But is it easy and once done, it's done.Now the only bad thing is, yep, battery life, it is bad. Consider yourself lucky to go a whole day without charging. It really depends on how much you surf the internet keeping that beautiful power robbing internal screen lit up. Luckily the 6131 uses the same battery as the 6102i so I have a total of 3 batteries that I keep charged and just switch when needed.All in all, the best Nokia I have owned to date. Every Nokia I buy is better than the last. You won't regret buying this phone. Just grab an extra battery on ebay. You will be all set.
I bought a 6131 for my Wife, which she came to like after 2 months of use. Nokia's web site said that I should upgrade the operating software to improve certain features. This worked great on my N73, so went to do the same on the 6131. Part way through the upgrade process the computer lost touch with the phone, and from that point on the phone was dead. I returned the phone to Nokia who have now had the phone two months of the four that I have owned it, and I cannot get any responses out of customer service/repair about its expected return to me. Just hope you never have to use Nokia customer support.
I have this cell phone since May 8th. this year and I think it has some tricky good fashions, for example the world wathc, the fast acces to someoptions, but the best of all is the tremendous 8X zoom on the camera lens and the aditional digital zoom for after take the picture. I am a photography aficionado for some 20 years, and I think this feature is wonderfull, my Canon 28-105 lens has only 3.75X. On the other hand the very poor batery life is mortal to this phone: you take some pictures, make a few calls, look the pictures again an the battery is death! For worst the charger take a full two and half hours to charge the battery again; my previous Nokia 3220 do the same in one and half hour. Vicente Cardone, Barranquilla, Colombia.
I think it is great.  The only problem I am having is learning how to use all the options the phone has to offer.  Great phone!
I ordered this phone through Amazon though the supplier was Ace Photo & Digital. I'm very happy with the phone - Nokia is the best cellular device manufacturer in my mind. Sound is great and the flip works awesome. However my experience with Ace was terrible. The phone came with a mal-functioning charger and missing the Micro SD card. My whole interaction with them was a fiasco. If possible find another vendor! Here are my pros and cons for the phone:Pros:1. Great sound and user interface2. High quality materials - looks and feels robust3. Large buttons4. High quality screen5. Blue tooth works greatCons:1. Side camera button keeps being pushed mistakengly - turning the camera on when I don't really want it on. This is somewhat annoying.
I just had to write a review on this phone, after seeing some fairly unfounded reviews I figured I didn't want to write it until I had fully "tested" out my own! Admittedly, I did not get my phone from Amazon--but hopefully you will find my review beneficial all the same.Okay, I noticed--first off--one reviewer complained (there is no better way to put it) about the phone being "crap"--saying reception or whatever was poor. Well I want to say that this couldn't be far from the truth; at least as far as my phone gones--it couldn't be better! Another reviewer mentioned, that she had difficulty setting the phone to her network--or to be more specific, she was displeased that she could not get all of her features working--like email and web access--thus giving the phone another unfortunate strike. I can tell you from personal experience with mines I'm not gonna lie and say that I wasn't simiarly frustrated when I--initially-couldn't get mine setup to my Cingular network. However, if one takes the time and a little "googling" you can find various Motorola modding forums [...] and sites like that w/ other Motorola unlocked phone users that will happily guide you in the right direction to getting your phone working to just about any network! Literally, with a little persistance it took me less than a week--a matter a fact, within the same week that I got my phone--to completely have mines configured to my Cingular network (email, web, and all)!Top it off w/ the iTunes and the hot color and this phone is a absolute winner in my book--by far the best cell I've had! Hope my lil' review helps! :)
It's been couple of months since i have purchased this cell phone and so far i am pretty happy with it. The only problem is it is not compatible with the T-Mobile voice mail system. Therefore each time i have a missed call, a voice mail message or if i access my messages it sends annoying blank text messages. Although there is no charge for them i have the additional headache of deleting them. It also tends to attract fingerprints and dust more than my other phone's but it is sleek and attractive compared to any other phone's i have had. So if you can live with the above problems then it is a decent phone. Otherwise only time will tell about it's reliability and durability!
This phone I have had no problems with at all.  I like the voice dial without having to record the names.  This phone is much louder than the standard RAZR I had.  I went through 5 standard V3s then I got this and it is great.
I've had this phone since January. It worked OK and itunes feature was sort of cool. I really like the size and shape of the RAZRs, so I purchased this phone agains my better judgement (I had a Cingular RAZR that lasted just over a year (1 yr warranty), then completely froze). After a few months with the V3i, every time I checked voicemail, I'd get an empty text message. I've read in forums stating that without Cingular software on the phone (or some PC hack), the V3i interprets Cingular's voicemail symbol deactivating message (whatever you call it) as a text message. This doesn't hurt the functions of the phone, but the text messages are very annoying and you will get charged by Cingular for a text message every time you check your voicemail. If you call Cingular and complain they might take the charges off your bill, but this gets to be a real neusance after a while. Because of this and past experiences, I would never recommend a RAZR without a stern word of caution--don't expect it to last.
This phone was great...for about 2 months.  Then my screen would occasionally turn black or white.  My mp3 player started taking a long time to load or just failed to load.  The background would take awhile to load.  This problem with the screen became progressively worse until last week (six months into owning phone)  Screen went completely black and will not turn on except occasionally when you're charging it to say charging.  Phone can only be used to call out and receive calls...no viewing at all.  In addition, it is having problems powering up and staying on.  I am under warranty, but I am afraid cingular will decide it is damaged not defective (even though the phone has little damage and problems started before it was EVER dropped!) as so many people say they do and charge me 200$.  Buy at your own risk!
I Own a GSM Razr V3 Black Edition, and I Think this is a Nice Phone, There's is other phones with more usefull stuff, but i believe this kind is an excelent one and great style phone...
Going from an old Nokia 6200 (which had great call quality and was ahead of its times)  to a Moto Razr I suffered the torments of usability hell. No memory, no headphone jacks, terrible address book, substandard camera, terrible alarm clock, etc etc.The day I got my digits on the W810i (i for international, unlocked quad band) was a happy day for me. Now, one year into using it I can expertly outline the pros and cons, and authoritatively issue bouquets and brickbats.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hot -* Great battery life. I don't measure this in terms of hours and minutes but the reality of how often I had to charge. I use the phone quite a lot for listening to music especially and have never run out of charge when on the road. On days of low usage I have gone 3 days without a recharge, but topping up for 1 hour everyday is all you need. With the Razr I was constantly being stranded with a dead phone.* Superior voice quality - as distinct from CALL quality, which thanks to Cingular sucks like a vaccuum cleaner!* Walkman quality music - I use iPod earbuds for a good reason, sometimes a Sony MDR 7506- More later.* An expandable Sony ProDuo memory slot of upto 2GB.I bought the phone with 512 MB and have not needed to upgrade yet.* A feature rich 2 MP camera with flash, white balance controls, macro mode, night mode, zoom, resolution settings, and effects settings.  This is quite adequate for point and click oppotunities - but also great for video, I bring out my Rebel XT 8MP only for more "artistic" photography.* A great FM radio. Works really well, although it does require the customary earphone-jack extension that also works as an antenna. I say "customary" because I don't think there is any phone that can play the radio without having to attach the headset cord.* The proprietary audio jack (Sony Ericsson only) actually ends in a generic RCA type stero headphone plug! This saved the phone and allowed me to jettison their earbud in favour of the iBud, or my Hi-Fi studio monitor when I feel like it. You can easily switch from whatever you're listening to -- the radio, the MP3 player or the video player and take a phone call by clicking a button. The song is paused, and will continue where you left off after ending the phone call. The iPhone is trumpeting this feature, but its been a part of the W810i for over a year.* Has an MIDP 2.0 mobile java O/S, which means you can download any and every java app. I use the Opera Mobile browser instead of the packaged Sony browser and google maps which are are also a free j2ME download - *no more paper printouts for me*. I also use a mobile app from cricinfo.tv for streaming cricket scores, and the pre-loaded Music Mate which playes basic guitar chords and also has a pitch pipe for tuning musical instruments.I am a non-starter in video games so i won't comment, except to say i tried the "JC does Texas" preloaded game - it was fun, but did not convert me into a gamer ;-)* The Address book is really excellent. It has a full featured contact list system like a vCard that includes full address and multiple phone numbers for the same contact. In theory the calendar and address books can be synched with Outlook if you download the Sony Ericsson PC Suite and connect use Outlook to synch calendar and contacts. I have no reason to believe this won't work, except my work place will not allow personal devices to be installed or synched up on the work machine. At home I don't use Outlook, so I'm missing out on all the calendar and reminder functionality* A nice alarm clock that lets you select days of the week you find" alarming".So my alarm does not go off on weekends, then comes back on every day of the week.This is a big improvement over the old way where you had to manually set the alarm for each day.You snooze, you lose.* I found this out very recently - but the phone plays videos appreciably. There is a minor geek factor to this, but well worth it. You can take pretty much any video file you have - from P2P, DVDs, flash, etc and convert it to the 3gp format. I use a free universal encoder that's quite a wonder. Its called SUPER and you will find it at e-rightsoft - For example I watched the final episode of Heroes on my phone in a flight. Downloaded from bittorrent, encoded to 3gp to a 176*144 format that took all of 90MB.  You can watch full length movies doing this, but the movie player functions like bookmarking are sorely missing for long files. If you don't watch the full movie at a stretch, you'll spend minutes simply forwarding to the correct spot the next time.THIS IS HUGE -- you can take any YouTube video with you on this phone. Yeah, yeah its a two step process but which one of you is busy saving the world anyway. Get a firefox plugin for downloading YouTube videos as .flv files (flash videos), then use SUPER to encode into 3gp. Voila! -- I have Rihanna's Umbrella and Fergie's Bumps accompany me on all my rides.* The phone is recognized a USB plug-and-play drive. Need I say more?This is very useful, because its easy to move files and also charge it anywhere I have a computer with USB! Forget DRM, everyone is going away from that anyway. Also, Apple's way of requiring iTunes and having to register a device by deviceID before using it, that is way too restrictive.My kingdom for USB P'nP freedom!* W810 has Bluetooth and Infra Red ports. Use them for file transfers, synching or for headsets.* An email client that is configurable for POP3 so I get my gmail, no problems. This is not a business phone so there is none, and never will be support for corporate email. Its easy enough getting to your personal email though, even without POP. Use the browser, doh!* pretty standard but worth mentioning - has voice dialing, that can save you in some situations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Not -* No WiFi !* No GPS receiver. This means that when you use google maps you have to manually figure out where you are, then also check if you are sticking to the route. I have had no problems with this myself, but could be incovenient for some.* The T9 texting system is disappointing. The Razr did it much better. There is no multi-select word completion, and there is not auto-add to dictionary any time you type out a word that was not in the dictionary. The process of adding your own short forms, cute names and whatnot is very manual and laborious.  Also, the auto completion with the Razr showed multiple word possiblities in a multi-select as you typed (like the AJAX javascript lookups in gmail adress) so that meant you could really fly through the message.* An open chat interface called MyFriends (under the Messages menu) using which you can log on to all your chat clients at once - AIM, yahoo, msn and IRC - possibly google chat but i've not cracked that nut yet.The setup is strictly for nerds/geeks/professionals - an average user could never set this up. After spends hours on many forums I was able to set it up. You need the use of a free third party registration system:  Yamigo to create a chat profile to which you can add your chat accounts.  When you create your MyFriends profile in the W810, you need to provide the URL as the server and select the Allow Connection tab to "Any Network" or else this won't work.MyFriends is a very ambitious concept and works in essence but fails in usability.It keeps the internet connection open always because it relies on an HTTP service. When you lose connection it logs you out of all your chat systems, requiring you to re-login. PAINFUL. It also drains the battery a lot. Sony would have done better to do what the Razr did, have an AIM chat client onboard that connects directly to the AIM server, so you did not have to use a third party http service.The best option is to set up the AIM and yahoo accounts to forward to cell phone when not signed in. Works like a charm.* The phone is capable of playing streams really - but bleeds to death on Cingular's cutting "EDGE".Hear me ye all - Cingular is the one thing that can kill Apple's iPhone. The situation can only be rescued if Jobs takes it over and refurbishes their network from the ground up.I have NOT found a realplayer for java mobile yet, so it is really a player problem.I'm sure there's an open source java project out there that can play all the streams.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shot -* The earbuds from Sony are pure product suicide. They are so bad that I could barely hear the music and calls. If I had not tried the iBuds I may have hated this phone, only because of Sony's lazily and badly produced earbuds. That would have been a real shame because this is really quite an instrument.* browsing pictures on the phone is painfully slow.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What you got -  The W810i is already more and does more than the iPhone will ever be, or do. Hi-Fi music, first class camera, great voice quality (when the signal exists!), calendar, addressbook, reminders, notes, alarms, email, SMS, MMS, bluetooth, video recording and playback. The iPhone will conquer the world anyway, because  it has sex appeal and ease of use like never before. Contextual buttons that come and go, basically an expanded interactive menu system. Brilliant breakthrough in usability. For those who don't want to spend the big bucks, you can get all that and more in less than half the price here.
Got the phone 4 months ago. I love it, but wanted more memory for music - so I bought a 2 GB Sony High Speed Memory Stick Pro Duo. After loading music on it the phone would play the music for about 2-3 minutes and then it would give me a "Playback Failed" error message. I tried everything (reformat memory, reformat phone, using the MP3 software, NOT using the MP3 software, etc.) yet nothing would work. I did find a similar case online where the user then bought a SanDisk Pro Duo memory stick which then worked for him. Sure enough, I ordered a 4 GB SanDisk Pro Duo card and the phone works great. Just a heads up to everyone looking to upgrade their memory.
Bought this phone(unlocked) 9 months back. Using it with t-mobile service so far. Switching from simple nokia to this phone.Negatives:1.voice sounds unnatural/automated during initial use. nokia seemed natural. Got used to it after a few weeks and don't feel it anymore.2.Unable to find a good cover for it unlike for other phones. Made do with a nokia cover. Seems to fit fine.3.No single beep ringtone. i really miss this feature from nokia. I tried adding a beep sound to the ringtone from my computer. But it repeats the beep making it annoying.4.Shows the time of only the last received missed call from a person. If a person called twice, i cant see the previous time the person called. Miss this feature from nokia.Positives:1.Good features. voice clarity is good at both ends.2.Camera is better than razor's but not as good as a regular camera. i rarely use it as i use a regular camera. But this is for emergencies.3.Dropped a few times on carpet. Works fine.4.Gets good signal coverage.5.i use it as an mp3 player. good sound quality.6.light is sometimes useful.7.connecting to the computer is useful. i can transfer any file or put any song and use it as ringtone. Also any theme or screen picture.8.Listened to FM radio for a while. But the wired handsfree is a pain to always have connected. So dont listen to fm anymore.9. has EDGE. but i dont know of anybody who ever connects to the internet using cell phone. neither do i.10. Its black. i like the color.Overall, i like this better than a razor anyday. I miss the features of nokia. But sony is a different company and getting used to it. Definitely worth buying.
I've read a lot of reviews and Most say that this is a Fantastic Phone. I have to agree the Phone is incredible.A few people have had issues with "Noise" with the walkman, I have not had this experience and I converted my 192K WMA files to 96K MP3's (using the packaged software Sweet!) and still don't hear any degredation of sound even at low volvumes. The radio works fine and is Clear also. Calls are Clear and I have great Coverage in my Area.The Camera is an awsome Camera for a Phone Camera, I have a Sony 5.1 Mega Pixel, if I reduce the frame size to that equal to 2.0 Mega Pixel the photo are identical, it will never replace my Supershot for Camera features or Flash but for those shots when you don't have the Camera with you this will work great!This is the Best Phone I've ever had!
I have had this phone just over 18 months and must say that it has exceeded my expectations.  I travel frequently and having this phone has eliminated the need to carry an mp3 player and camera in addition to my phone.A feature I truely appreciate is the 'flight mode' setting.  This allows you to power up JUST the music feature without actually turning on the phone thus allowing you to use it on a plane.  Also when in 'flight mode' the battery life is considerably extended.  On a 7.5 hr flight plus lay-overs and having kept the music feature on almost continously I still had 14% battery life remaining by the time I got to my destination!  Another neat little music feature is the built-in FM radio which uses the wire of the ear phones for an antenna!  Upgrading the memory stick to 4Gb allows for well over 8hrs of music and still has room for about 125+/- pictures depending on the image quality.The picture quality is surprisingly good for a camera phone, although I would be more inclinded to call this an mp3 camera that happens to also have a phone built in.  At 2Mg resolution you wont be taking pictures worth enlarging to 8x10 but as a 'point n shoot' camera for general use it more then does the trick and the resulting images are pretty good in the 4x6 size range.The call quality I have experienced has been quite good, even in the speaker phone mode, with an average talk time of around 2.5 - 3 hours continuous call and I have gone up to 4 days without needing to charge the phone under very minimal usage conditions.Truely, the ONLY thing I have an issue with is that the plug-in port for the charger and the ear phones are one and the same meaning that you can't have the phone plugged in to charge and use the radio feature at the same time since it's the ear phone wire that serves as the radios antenna.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone to just about anyone whether you're looking for a new phone, a new mp3 player or even a new point-n-shoot digital camera, especially if you're a traveler and need to lighten you accessory load.
I've owned this phone for 18 months, the first 15 months with T-Mobile and the past 3 months with AT&T.; Reception has been great with AT&T.; With T-Mobile, reception was good. For data, I use the Operamini 4 web browser with AT&T;'s unlimited Medianet and it is extremely fast and reliable. I can access almost all web sites. With T-Mobile Web, service was mediocre, up and down. But that was not the fault of the phone, but the provider. This phone has it all except for 3G and support for Bluetooth Stereo headsets. Music quality is great if you do not mind using the included wired headset.The camera is ok and takes decent pictures. But I would not buy this phone for the camera. The phone is very simple and intuitive to use. You can go on Sony Ericsson's web site and get whatever settings you need to suit the services you want your carrier to perform. I was only interested in the wap settings to surf the internet and SE sent that to my phone via SMS in a few seconds.If you want a reliable phone for data and voice, you should consider this phone. Battery life is excellent. I charge it almost every night for 2 hours because I leave the Operamini 4 browser on almost always since I am a very heavy data user.
I have had this phone for at least 2 years now.  It has been through lots of abuse and still looks and sounds great.  It has survived several rounds with a 2 year-old and a 4 year-old.  The sound quality of the external speaker is the best I've ever heard on a cell phone.  I have stored a bunch of music videos and tv episodes on it in mp4 format.  I've put several mp3's on the phone.  It has an airplane mode so you have all your media available to you on flights.  It works fine with linux, just plug it in and the memory stick and the phone's internal memory are seen and mounted as separate devices.  Anytime I think about getting something new, I compare it with all the features this phone has and I can't justify buying anything different.  Texting is easy and fast.  I can record video with sound, and I have used the *very* bright light on the camera as a flashlight on numerous occasions.  I have used a number of other phones, and this phone manages to be more sturdy and more usable than any phone I've ever seen.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who's on the market.
When i bought this cellphone, i knew i wouldn't regret my deal. there is more than just a phone and 2 mega pixel camera. The profile themes are customizable to what you would really like your phone to be.there is just a lot in the phone that you don't get to see in the users manual...its really worth it...And i almost forgot, it is a Walkman too, what more can a geek ask for...
I love this phone, it is everything as advertised and more, at a fair price.  Great picture and music abilities, only 2.0 megapixels but I still use it as a replacement for my digital camera AND ipod nano!
I have owned a lot of different phones over the years, and this one is the best.  I have a 4 gb card in it.  This allows me enough room to store many thousands of pictures, and enough mp3s for several days - day and night.  Battery life is great, size is small, the camera is adequate both stills and movies, and it is a quadband GSM with removable SIM card.  When out on walks with the little doggie I listen to music or to the FM radio.  By blue tooth it talks to my computer, updating the calendar.I have no complaints about this phone, honest.
This is a nice phone. Work great, just put in my sim and it work great.The wlakman feature works great.My first phone came with defects, however after I got my replacement phone had no problem so far. There is a problem with the sound quality while using the phone in some areas, but apart from that this works great.
The only complaint I have is that this phone is not A2DP compliant as of now. So my wireless stereo bluetooth headphones can't be used to listen to the walkman feature of this phone, only can be used as a headset for voice calls. Other than that this is a great phone.
I was looking to consolidate my old mobile phone and an mp3 player into one gadget and this phone does it perfectly.. Not only is it a phone and a great mp3 player but it's also quite a good 2 megabit camera + video + radio + flashlight + internet access. All in all, a great gadget!
This phone is the best for those who love music.  The Disc to Phone software is really easy to use.  The Walkman player has EXCELLENT sound quality with loud speakers.  The camera is one of the best on a cell phone with Auto Focus which is great for crisp shots with no blurriness.  I love the keypad (durable, cool rounded edges, and great response).  It's not the thinnest, but it is small enough for any pocket that's easy to hold.  I get perfect reception everywhere.  With quadband capabilities making it a WORLD PHONE, makes the W810i the best for anyone who loves feature rich phones.
Overall a great phone. The phone has a good reception and the camera takes good pictures, not really a high quality ones. The Walkman capabilities of the phone are ok, not really happy with the earphones because you have to really stick them into your ears for them to work properly and get the most out of them.I didn't give the five stars because I don't really like the speaker on the phone. I think the sound quality of the speaker is poor and it does not have as much volume as you expect from this kind of phone.
Pros:  Excellent sound and environment noise isolation ( far better than Ipod ), easy and fast switch between walkman / phone / radio  mode, good screen can be used outdoor with no problem, easy bluetooth configuration, insuperable easy to use PC-Like menus uses tabs for item organization ( calls, contacts, options and so on ) good camera / accesory light, good photo camera quality, acceptable video capture ( yet can't replace any digital camera ) easy in-out Memory Stick dos not need to turn off phone, comes with usb pc cable and 512MB. Supports MP4, 3gp video. Good voice recognition.Cons: keypad must be improved. hard keys, hard joystick ( i have one k300 and a t610  and both have better handling ) , a little confusing camera menu, Poor web browser ( Solved installing opera mini ).Reccomended: Yes. It has all the goodies of the Sony phones, plus walkman with  Amazing sound!!
I really like everthing about this phone. My previous phone was a Sony z520 so I was already used to their menu system, but it doesn't get much easier to navigate. The MP3 and radio functions are very easy to use and so are the rest of the goodies this phone is loaded with. For a phone, it also has a good quality camera. I only have two complaints about this phone. One is that since my service provider doesn't sell this phone, I can't get internet settings sent to it. Obviously not the manufacturer's faunt but you may want to research that before ordering a high-end phone if the internet is important to you. My other issue is how small the keypad is. I am a texting machine and the small buttons make this difficult although I have gotten used to it. Once again not much the manufacturer can do when trying to make the phone as small as it is which is why I still gave the product 5 stars. If you want a good quality phone that's easy to use and is loaded with extras, BUY IT!
Screen is absolutely beautiful, charging either by car jack or wall takes only minutes to get a full charge that lasts days.  Quickdial, camera, online button, voicedialing all great.  Antenna is excellent, but not perfect.  Walkman is good, but could use a little more human factors work.  Small as it is, the speaker and microphone is phenomenal and cuts through noise very well.  Adding google maps and Yahoo! mail to the phone and it's a multimedia powerhouse that plays music and keeps you up to date.  Excellent bang for the buck.
The Sony Ericcson W810 is one of the world's leading phones. It definitely has superior camera quality and features than most of the other phones in the world. Also, the Walkman palyer is exceptional, and the memory is superb. This phone is definitely a leading music phone. I would personally rate it higher then the Motorola ROKR 1 and 2. It also has a very sleek look and it's all-around features are fantastic. It has almost every feature than one can think of. It is a phone than can last you the rest of your life and it is the world in the palm of your hands.
I should say that i loved the Nokia brand. But this phone is awesome. The software is nice, a lot of functions, the web site of sony is the best place to found everything you need to take the best performance of the phone. I dont have any disappointments about this product. The Sony W810i is my favorite cell phone is my entertainment center.
i love this thing you can change all the setings like themes wallpapers games everything!!! If you want a Beautiful cellphone with a fantatsic software PLease BUY IT!
For years I had nokia, and I didn't wanted to change to another cell brand but since last year that I bought the sony ericsson w600, the first one, I was impressed on how much I like their tecnology cause there r 2 brands: sony experts en in music and video and ericsson experts on cell phones.I'm so happy with my w810, I just missed some graphics that the w600 had.
i got this phone for my bday and i really enjoy it.  but there are two issues with it.1. When you are talking on speaker phone, there is white noise in the background2. You can't use a downloaded song as a ringtone unless its saved on teh phone, doesnt work if the song is in the smartchipOverall, its a good phone,
I purchased the phone in white and flashed using davinciteam to Hong Kong versionthe screen is pretty bright, but it has a major problem: you can't view it without backlight, that you can't see the clock when the phone is idle (like old T610/T616. the standby gif has pretty fast motion, most of the themes for 176x220 SE models will work, except some themes for Z710i, shows file corrupt errorreception is good, it's like Z710isome complains about the earpiece volume problem, but I don't have such, loud enough even on the 7 bars, speakerphone is louder than Z710ithe keypad is TOO SMALL, it's small like SDA/SP5m, it may bring hard time for big thumb, and it's easy to press Return and Clear buttons by accidentthe audio player is easy and clear to control, though it don't support ogg vorbis, you can encode mp3 in VBR mode to get enhanced audio qualitythe fonts is kinda small, unlike Z710i, which has updated OS, the clock font size cannot be changedbt support is regular SE style (with a lot of profiles), but Z710i also has wireless headphones and bt network serverthe cam is good for 2mpx, it has auto-focus and macro mode, that I can take pic in near distance, but the pic has some noticeable color pixels on white background, it has LED light, which also can be used as flashlight, that is handy in the darkinternet is fine, tethering through either bt or USB works well with pda and laptop, the browser is good toothough it doesn't support bt wireless headphones, the included headset has 3.5mm jack on the mic unit, that you can use your favorite headphones/earphones with the phonebattery time is good for regular use, if you leave the phone idle all the time, the battery can last at least 3 days, or continuous 3.5 hours modem usepros:good audio player, supports PSP cardFM radio has good reception, and supports RDSgood phone receptionfull functional btgood cam with auto-focuslong battery timecons:LCD is dark when idle, unable to show clocksmall keypads, that brings problem with big thumbcam does not have protective cover, like W800 and K790no dedicated T-Zones (internet) button, and unable to assign one (you can assign web button, that opens SonyEricsson offline home page, not online portal)streaming audio is limited to 3gp, no local ogg vorbis supportconclusion: 91/100, if you can live with small buttons, you should be fine
I have this cellphone......and all I can say is love it...love it..loveit.Great features and top of the line......a must have!
While listening to Radio often I hear high pitched beeps. And after some time this digital noise becames anoying. Considering this is designed to be a walkman phone I find this to be a major problem.
...and I just don't give it a 10 because it's not possible!Name what you want or need in a cell phone, and ta-da! - this phone has it...Almost can't believe its priced so fairly (bought mine unblocked).Really, folks, check out its complete features and specs at Sony's site before buying virtually anything else!Say goodbye to Nokia and Motorola now:You won't regret.
Love the phone. Had to go back to Cingular to get them to reconfigure so I could recieve and send pics. Other than that great!
It's a shame Sonyericsson decided to mark this phone with the walkman logo as it has the crapiest music playback capabilities i ever seen.  I bought this phone cuz i liked the idea of having a cellphone, mp3 player and digital camera in one small device however the music playback has a very anoying hissing noise which makes listening to music at low valume levels almost imposible. If you like blowing your eardrums off you may not notice this but if you preffer to listen to your music at lower levels you will be very disapointed. This is a problem which purtains to every W810 model, sonyericsson is aware of the problem and admitied that they are not atempting to fix it. Don't get me wrong the phone as a phone works well and the 2mpx camera is just okay (you can't expect super images from a lens that small). But if you are looking for a good phone with mp3 playback capabilites there are a lot of better products out there.
This has GOT to be the best phone ever made! If you can get cheap, DO BUY! It has everything! Music, photos, and even does video! Others don't come close; the camera alone is 2 megapixels! Get it!!!!!
The phone runs on symbian os, k. There's a putty(remote ssh, encrypted chatting to as many people as you want, via irc) ported to symbian, k. That basically means that you can use a remote irc bouncer(like irssi, through putty which you can find at sourceforge, it's opensource.), to get on irc, over this phone. The web browser may be able to skirt sms charges by using a java-based interface like aim express(havent tried it yet). Other then that I think it's missing bluetooth? Could be wrong, because if it's not then you could add an external gps reciever/software combo to it, and it would take the place of pretty much every "gadget" you need. And it does it in a relatively small form factor, as well.
It is a good telephopne, but the price it's a little high, good performace, the accesories incluided are good.
I'm a music fan & I love electronic gadgets. After tiresome struggle with my palm pda that refuses to play any kind of movies, I saw this item by chance.It looks nice & has all the requirements that I need! with 2megapixel camera I can take better pictures than with my pda, play music of course, and hopefully enjoy movies & a cell phone in just this small lovely thing!.........................................................................BUT NO ! I'm so glad that I found this just before I click to submit my order. I CANNOT USE MY HEADPHONE WITH THIS PHONE......I'll have to use specific "ear-bud" headset to listen to the music.I don't like that kind of "ear-plugging" strobes because it cannot transfer much depth of music that I like.Of course, there are some "adaptors" to allow the use of universal headphone jacks, but then I'll have to struggle with wires and wires entangled.I wish this review be helpful to the people who loves music in serious way.
Sony Ericsson W810 has everythin. 850/900/1800/1900 GMS, bluetooth, IR, 2Mpix camera, autofocus, flash, mp3 (512 MB included) and so on. This baby is loaded.
First off, let me just tell you that I own an older Sony Ericcson phone probably made at least three years ago (low resolution screen, no bluetooth) and it works just fine. Mind you I've had to take a wire brush to the AC adapter receptacle once or twice to clean it out and get it to charge. It has four bars right now. So, I decided to stay loyal to Sony Ericcson and purchase this phone, the W810i, and I recieved it in the mail two weeks ago. All was well the first week regarding music transfer, signal, and radio. I decided to go a step further and get a Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset and it worked okay with occasional beep telling me it "lost" the device. About an hour later I was hit with "EMERG. CALLS ONLY" across the screen with absolutely no signal. Okay. I then uninstalled my headset, waited a few minutes, and tried to make a call. Nothing. To roll this review up real good into a nice fatty boombatty this phone has gone completely haywire playing songs by itself when the keys are locked, incoming calls that I can't pick up, absolutely no calls going out, and just last night when I tried to call someone it made this loud high-pitched noise when it wasn't even on speaker until I had to turn it off. No more. Steer clear of all Sony Ericcson phones if you know what's good for you. Good functionality and signal are vital when it comes to buying a good phone. This one has neither. It is not a good phone. I want to break it.
This product was purchased with my credit card from my amazon account where I thought my info was safe.. I, however, did not make this purchase. Because of this laspse in security, my identity was stolen through amazon and this phone was what they purchased. Beware of having your personal info on Amazon.com, take any of your financial info off, trust me!
EXCELENTE. ME LLEGO APENAS AYER, PERO FUE POR RESPONSABILIDAD DE MI COURRIER QUE ES PESIMO Y LA LENTITUD DE LA ADUANA. ME OBSEQUIARON UN ESTUCHE Y UN CARGADOR PARA VEHICULO. GRACIAS DESDE VENEZUELA....EXCELLENT. I ARRIVE MYSELF JUST YESTERDAY, BUT IT WAS BY RESPONSIBILITY OF MY COURRIER THAT IS TERRIBLE AND THE SLOWNESS OF THE CUSTOMS. THEY FLATTERED A CASE AND A SHIPPER TO ME FOR VEHICLE. THANKS FROM VENEZUELA
muy celular esta bien lindo y lo mejor de todo que vino en la fecha estipulada
I think that you have one of the most efficient delivery process in the world, but this could be better. My point of view , is that this delivery process can be better if the customer can indicated "the range hours approximately" in that the shipment can be attended.Thanks so much.Enzo Camargo F.B.
Our company just switched to Verizon which included getting Q's for people who previously had Treo's with another plan (Alltel).  I had the Treo for 6 months and had a lot of problems with that.My main beef with the Q has nothing to do with the phone or it's functionalities.  Rather, it's regarding the abysmal battery life of the basic phone.  What company would put out such an absolutely useless battery?  Then, God forbid you actually complain to them about it, they have the gall to admit the battery is crap then try to sell you the 'upgrade.'  Upgrade?  How about including the better battery to begin with and give the customer some value for his money?Motorola, Verizon, and other companies that tout the Q should be ashamed for putting this product - with this battery - on the market.We're gonna give this phone about another week and then consider sending the whole lot back and returning to the Treo.Shame on you Motorola.
I got my Q about a month ago. At first I was enamoured with the looks, size, flatness, internet and sound quality. All of those are great. I still love how flat it is and it doesn't seem to scratch easily (unlike my scratch magnet iPod.)I have had Verizon for a long time. I have not really had any bones to pick with them. They have been helpful. I really wish I hadn't mailed in my rebate so quickly. I would have returned it and gone back to plain phone and simple, cheap service. It will be nice while traveling though.I think we should all be mad at Motorola for producing such a crappy piece o plastic. The "soft keys" on the Q feel totally cheap. The buttons look nice, but the top ones don't really feel nice. They feel cheap. I do rather like the rest of the keyboard, though. The battery is JOKE. What is the point of having a MOBILE phone if you have to plug it in 50 times a day????? I expect it to last AT LEAST as long as I am awake during the day. That's really not much to ask for.Things to consider before you buy this:1)Battery life IS abysmal. I had verizon send me a new one because I seriously thought it was defective...Nope. New one is the same- no life after 9 hours of sitting around doing nothing. I am going to have to invest yet another $[...] in the extended battery. It's a good thing I rarely use the nice leather pouch since it isn't going to fit in it anymore. It is a good thing I managed to fanagle this phone for free with rebates and stuff. I have definitely made up for the cost in accessories and programs- don't fall for the accessories trap if you buy this thing!!! I was told the pouch I bought was only $[...], but when I looked at the receipt it was really $[...]....and I hardly use it because it's hard to get the phone out.. and I already stretched it out so it would go in without mashing the buttons.2)Expect to purchase every program you want to use on it. This does not come with anything useful except the internet, and the programs are not cheap! I really wish I had stuck with my Palm! Palm programs were way better and cheaper. The alarm clock allows you ONE alarm. That is IT. My old LG phone let me have multiples. The ringtones totally bite. It's a good thing you can use MP3s. There's not even a built in calculator. You can buy one. My old LG had way better functionality. I am starting to miss it even though I hated the flip phone. I am glad I still have it. I am going to keep it...just in case I get totally fed up with Q.3)Program selection for purchase truly sucks. I hope it expands as time goes by...and be sure to use the trial versions before you buy because they are not very good in general.4)Space for programs is limited. I have purchased 3 programs. Apparently that's about the max-I tried to load Mozilla's Minimo but I don't have enough space left! Boooooooo. My old cheap Palm could load tons and tons of programs and not have any problems...and they were GOOD and USEFUL and CHEAP.5)Maneuvering between programs is awkward. The home screen is not really customizable as it should be. Maybe your 10 year old computer geek kid might be able to hack a nice usable homescreen for you. I bought a program to rig it up, but it is still dissappointing- you can't add shortcuts like  windows- not that I expect it to really work like windows completely, but that seems simple enough and ya CAN'T DO IT. Boooooooooo. The quickie self building shortcut line of recently used programs is good enough though.6)Email Gripes: Please won't Gmail rig it up so we can easily use Gmail on this! The web version works, but not the mobile web version. Also, Hotmail is supposed to be super simple and already built in, but I have to log into messenger for the hotmail to work! Boooooooooo. I just wanna check my darn email! I get error messages more than half the time when I try to check Hotmail or Gmail. Forget using that handy email button on the keyboard- It would be great if that actually worked for me.7) Help is weak. FAQ's are weak. I can't believe how many message boards and sites there are dedicated to this thing.... because it is not good and people are frustrated trying to fix things. My screen wants to stay on all the time.. further draining my already lame battery. I think it is searching for network, but does it really have to do that all the time? Can't it wait until I actually want it to do something? There's probably a way.. but I am a decade too old to spend a week figuring it out.8) Shortcuts. I hope you like shortcut buttons! If you want to master this thing, be ready to memorize and create shortcut buttons for everything. You can easily set them up, but remembering what does what is rediculous.PROs:Freakin awesome reception. I get reception and internet in places that always dropped calls before.Internet wherever- fun stuff! ..but you can get that on virtually any phone now. (Google maps is totally awesome on it.)It's thin and nice to look at.Long story short: Black hole of accessories/programs/more money. I think it will break eventually becuase it is so cheaply made. PROBLEMATIC. I am very happy that I didn't get one of the first totally screwed up Qs, but even my updated new Q has too many issues. This phone seems like it should still be in the testing stage. It is not right. It is not a well built machine, nor are its brains very extensive. It's a pretty piece of plastic. It needs a way bigger hard drive memory, and drastic improvements in functionality and programs.OH YEAH.. also... I bought an SD card for it, which you will want to do if you decide to waste your time and money on this.. but it took me a day to figure out that I needed to jam a piece of paperboard under the SD card to make it connect. It's still in there- under the card, behind the crazy rubbery plastic door that bulges out where the card is. Don't get it wet!This is the first and last Motorola product I ever buy. COME ON! I seriously expected a far superior product from Moto.This phone, like everything else in our modern world, is...Cheap, Plasticky, Produced to make a lot of money while giving a lousy product.I am not a mega-computer-guru, but I KNOW they could have done better than this!!!Wait a year or two. Buy something better.Overall, it works. I definitely wouldn't pay anything for this though. I am crazy glad I got it for free! Carrying a palm and a phone around really wasn't that bad.
I've had 2 separate phone service plans since Cingular had a great promo for the Treo 650 almost 3 years ago.  I never quite got used to it, and the charger for the phone finally collapsed with a not so graceful "ping", flinging its metal charging prongs to who knows where.So, I sold the sucker and went into Verizon for a new PDA (not to be confused with Public Displays of Affection).  I don't think there was anyone working there who was more than a few days over 20!  A nice young lady showed me the new Motorola Q.  Grrr...  there's no touch screen!  Waaaah.I tried to return it within 24 hours, breaking into a cold sweat trying to learn a new gadget.  Another nice young lady looked at me patronizingly, and told me to give it a few more days.  So, today is day 3 and I'm starting to really like it - realizing that you can't have everything in one package.The Q is beautiful to look at.  It fits nicely into your purse or pocket without the weight and bulk of the Treo, or many of the other PDAs for that matter.  I figured out how to use it for internet connection, so no more silly hotel $10/day charges to use their air time.  I can easily send and retrieve email, see my calendar at a glance, open an Acrobat file with the entire agenda and zoom in on what I need to see.I can also have my own data card with music, videos and various programs on it, so I don't have to use up the device's built in memory.  It's blue tooth compatible, and if I'm so inclined, I can even listen to my music/audio files via the blue tooth instead of lugging around another set of ear pieces.This was certainly not love at first sight, but I am growing to love it.
I've had my Q for a little over three weeks now, and it has generally lived up to my expectations which, admittedly, were not all that high.  I wanted a decent phone that could also grab my emails off of my server at work, keep my calendar, and allow me to occasionally surf the web.  It does those things in a satisfactory manner.The call quality is rather good, certainly better than my old Samsung flip phone.  The dialing buttons are small, but manageable.  They are not marked with letters for dialing purposes(i.e - "a b c" for 2, "d e f" for 3, etc). The buttons have a nice feel to them, and are close together but not so close as to make using them difficult.  The back-lighting is adequate.  The screen is bright and the colors vibrant.The only truly annoying aspect of this device regarding its use as a mobile phone is the voice dialing function.  I've never had a phone which has so much trouble picking up voice commands.  In fact, it seems completely incapable of picking up a dialing command.  The most recent example:Me:  "Call Jackie."Phone: "Did you say, 'Call Rob?'"Me:  "No.  Call Jackie."Phone: "Did you say, 'Call Tina?'"Me:  "No.  Call Jackie."Phone: "Did you say, 'Call Home?'"Me: *sigh*This happens every time.  Every time.  Bluetooth or straight phone, it doesn't matter.  The only thing that varies are the odd choices it makes.  The fact that they do not sound remotely like anything you said is a constant.  For those of you wondering if I mumble or have an accent . . . I do not (at least I don't think so!).  My old phones never had a problem picking me up.  I'm wondering if it's a software glitch.Many have commented on the battery life.  The battery life is only fair, but I haven't had the kind of issues that some other posters have.  I charge it every night and it has never quit on me during the day.  I'm careful to "kill" open applications when I'm done using them, and I retrieve my email manually rather than having it "pushed" to the phone.  I may buy an extended life battery at some point, but thus far I'm doing fine without it.  Those who are on their phones constantly may have a different experience.  A car charger is very cheap to buy through Amazon, and I keep one of those in the glove box just in case.The mobile Internet Explorer browser is a bit clunky and inelegant, but that's not the phone's fault. I'm hoping that when Mozilla get's done tweaking their mobile browser it will be a better solution.This device does not come with software to create or edit documents.  I understand that third party apps are available for this purpose, but it's not something I've looked into as I don't intend to use the device for this purpose.Verizon's EVDO network - though expensive - seems to be living up to it's billing so far. The lack of WiFi has not bothered me in the slightest.  I gave my old WiFi equipped Palm Tungsten C to my wife when I got the Q, and I must say that I like the on-demand nature of EVDO much better than having to search for often hard to find WiFi networks.  Subjectively, I have found the speeds while surfing the net to be comparable, with the Q perhaps being the faster of the two.The unit has a solid, well built feel to it. I've dropped it only once (so far) from approximately chest high onto a hard tile floor.  The battery cover and battery popped out and went skidding across the floor, but when put back together all worked fine.  In the three weeks I've had it, I've had it refuse to turn on twice.  Removing and then replacing the battery cured the problem.  There was no data loss.  I haven't noted any other functional glitches.At the end of the day I chose the Q from among several other likely prospects because of its relatively small size.  It's a bit slimmer than my wife's Razr.  I won't wear a belt clip (I seem to have misplaced my pocket protector, and it wouldn't seem right to use one without the other), and the Q does fit neatly into the pocket of either my jeans or my suit coat.  You do need to remember to lock the key pad when doing this.  Incoming calls can be answered without unlocking it.  Locking and unlocking is painless, requiring you to push two buttons in sequence on the pad.In sum, aside from the maddening voice dialing issue it's a good phone which provides email, calendar and web surfing capability.Hope this helps.UPDATE:  I just (1/08) gave the Q to my college-aged daughter after my workplace supplied us all with HTC 6800's.  As time went by I found that the regular battery was holding less and less of a charge and I ended up springing for the extended capacity battery.  I now agree with those that say that this is a must.  Other than that, I miss my Q!  The 6800 has a few more features for the "power user", but it's not nearly the phone the Q is from an ease of use and sound quality stand point.  But for the stiff Verizon data charge, I'd chuck the free 6800 and take back my Q.
I live in a metropolitan area with adequate cell coverage.  My family owns 1 Motorola Q and 2 Motorola Razrs. We have no problems with the cell signal on the Razrs.  The Q is frequently dropping calls and searching for a network in the same locations that the Razrs are showing 2 or 3 bars. I have to keep the Q plugged into the AC in order to keep the battery from draining due to the constant searching for a cell tower. I would not recommend the Q unless you live under a cell tower.
I'm at a loss.  I hope the problems I describe are described elsewhere in these reviews because this phone should never have even been put on the market and the notion deserves reiteration for those considering purchasing this phone.  This smartphone has a long list of negative issues that prohibit it from functioning as a phone.  I can't possibly get to them all but for starters:  every day it shuts off by itself, locks up, won't receive calls, can't call out, won't turn on, and the only way to fix these little daily annoyances is to take the battery out and reboot the phone.  And I am truly not kidding, I have to do this at an absolute minimum 3 times a day, some days I have to reboot it every time I pick it up.  Seriously.  The keypad fails, Media player skips all the way through the songs, miserable battery life, very slow internet speeds for what it is, etc etc.  I do like some of the Verizon salespeople I have talked with about this though: they already know all about it. I say that indicates the mass of customers that had to have come in when the salespeople won't even put up a fight and are simply resigned admitting the phone is garbage.  Several I've talked to won't sell anyone a phone with a Windows Mobile OS unless they are just hell-bent and won't listen. It also lacks the much of the smart function if you don't sync it with Outlook and only on your pc.  Verizon won't touch it until you do the Motorola update (which is a medium-sized nightmare) and apparently will not replace the phone with anything other than a refurbished Q.  Oh goody.  So, I'm stuck with the phone for upwards of a year.Generally, this is a terrific waste of energy, time, and money.  Don't know about the Samsung Blackjack, but most of what I've read I agree with: skip the smartphone all together and pony up for a PDA, preferably without Windows Mobile.
I just switched from the VZW Treo 650 (Palm-powered) to the Q.  My only complaint is the battery life, but it is not as abysmal as some reviewers would have you believe.  Keep a spare charger at your desk, for cryin' out loud!  As for the complaints about having to go through menus for different functions?  Hell-o-o!  It's Windows Mobile...Windows uses menus.The sound clarity is way better than the Treo, as is the screen.  The form factor is not to be outdone.  I thought I loved my Treo...well let me tell you, that was just puppy love.If you want the Q, bite the bullet.  I don't think you will be dissapointed...unless your expectations are unreasonable.  There is no such thing as perfection...but the Q comes pretty darned close!
I bought my Q because I am on the go a lot and needed easy access to my files and e-mail.  While the functionality is great on this phone, it is laden with glitches and therefore, I cannot recommend this to someone who cannot afford to accidentally miss calls because you were ending another function on the phone. The lag time between doing various tasks on the phone is too long.  It takes several seconds after I hang up with someone for me to be able to get to another function.  Also, my Q has a tendency to power itself off, then restart occasionally.  I have checked into the settings on the phone and checked with my carrier, but no one seems to have an explanation. Finally, pulling information off the SD card is not as straightforward as one might expect from a Windows-based phone.  In short, if I had to do it all over again, I would have stuck with the Palm.
So, I am currently on my 2nd Q, happily working my way to the 3rd.Since I brought the phone in August, I have had problem after problem:(1) The battery power sucks. If I talk on the phone for more than 1 hour, the battery power dies to 1 bar.(2) Because I have my emailed account synced to the phone, my battery dies even faster. There are days when I have charged the phone all night, and by mid-day, the battery is either dead, or has one bar left(3) This one is weird, there are times when the phone shuts on and off by itself. I know it's not me because I keep the phone locked so I won't accidentally call anyone. Again, once it cuts off and back on, I am, again, down to one battery bar.The reception on the phone is okay, and I don't experience as many dropped calls as I did with T-Mobile; however, the stress of the battery life is what makes me what to just get a new phone!
Per Nick Riensch, a Verizon representative at their Largo, Florida, corporate store, "every salesperson tells every Q purchaser that the unit will not work well with the standard battery" and that "everyone knows to always sell the extended battery when they sell a Q."We had replaced a RAZR with a Q; the RAZR would last about a week on a charge and the Q lasted less than 20 hours on standby with no calls, no running processes and no internet surfing or e-mail running. This is in the same house and work locations as the old RAZR and a Samsung i730, neither of which have any problems. After the first week, we went in and they replaced the battery, but we got the exact same results.The following weekend when we complained again, Nick Riensch told us that "the only way [we were] going to get the phone to last more than a day was to buy the extended battery." We were still within the return period, so we dumped the Q and got a real PDA phone (the XV6700). No troubles at all with this one. The bottom line: Pass on the Q. Even Verizon's own employees tell customers (at least AFTER they make the sale) that the battery life estimates are not in (again per Nick) "real world" conditions.
I sent for my second replacement. Nearly everyone on the other end says they hear an echo or just terrible sound quality from my end. What a waste of time. Had internet but a waste of time at $40 per month from Verizon. All other features are mostly ok. Won't work on my mac and the one time I tried to download games or do updates on the pc, it didn't work.
Let me take you back to the time before I had Verizon and a Motorola Q, a time of bliss. Oh the days when I could plug my phone into a wall and it would charge! When the phone rang, I could answer it, and when I wanted to end the call, I could, just by pressing a button!Now, in the cruel fall of 2006, I am chained to the Q, which is chained to the incredibly poor customer service at Verizon. Imagine a man chained to a three thousand pound boulder, which is in turn chained to the planet Jupiter nearing a black hole. Yes, it's that bad.I made the mistake of purchasing a Q to send and receive calls, with an option to also send and receive data. I spent a paltry $130 a month, but this didn't seem to matter the second time my Q bricked up and refused to boot. I called tech support. "Hey tech support," I said, "this phone will randomly crash but the screen freezes. So, I'm missing calls even though it looks like the phone is fine. Plus, I'll look at the battery meter which says full, and then thirty minutes later my phone is off. And now it won't even turn on."Tech Support replies, "Have you tried unplugging the phone, removing the battery, and letting it sit?"Hmmm. No, I said. But I bought the $40 extended battery. And a car charger. And I keep both with me at all times, just in case the phone dies, or rather, for when the phone is sure to die, and I can remove the battery, plug the phone directly to the wall, and at least check the messages I missed while the phone was dead.Tech support sends me a refurbished phone - two day FedEx! They couldn't send it overnight. Perhaps there's some $300 plan where they care if you can send and receive phone calls, but it's unfortunately out of my budget.So I got my third phone. Yes, it would still crash and randomly turn off. Sometimes I would try to end a call, but it would just sit there, the minutes ticking away. The only way to recover it would be to remove the battery. You'd see me at Starbucks, sporting my Q and buying a chai latte. "Yes Bill, 200% ROI. No, totally doable. Totally." Then, I'd hit the red button, wait, furrow my brow, set all of my things on the floor, take the back cover off, remove and re-install the battery, and then turn the phone back on. That lovely Windows Mobile sound would echo like a death rattle in the cafe, and then I'd stare at it until it booted completely, to see if I missed yet another call during the resurrection.And today, I arrived at the Verizon store, for the 7th time. This time, in Atlanta. I figured, maybe it was just my small town store that couldn't handle my problem. I explained - politely as I could - and said the phone had died again, and would no longer charge. Again. I received a blank stare, and then a sticky note with a number on it. I said, "You want me to call someone at Verizon to complain about my phone that doesn't turn on?" He stared back, blankly, and without a trace of irony said, "Yes."I said, "So, there's no one at this Verizon store - this is Verizon, isn't it? - who can give me a phone, right now, that works?"He said, "No. We could give you a new phone - we're one of the few stores that stock PDA phones - but we're out of the Motorola Qs right now."I said, "Because you're replacing so many?" No answer, but a finger extending to point to my yellow sticky note. I wept quietly in the car.I returned to the client site where I was consulting, and asked if I could borrow his phone, while apologizing for not answering my broken cell phone. Lo and behold, they had a three strikes policy, and I was eligible for a different phone! He asked me to hold while he got approval, and then returned and said somberly, "Unfortunately, since you have had your account only six months, we are unable to offer you a different phone."I sat back in my chair, and tried not to spontaneously combust. "I have given you over $1300 in the past six months in service fees and equipment purchases. And I am not allowed to have a different phone, when the one you sold me doesn't work?"There was nothing he could do except try - TRY - to acquire for me a "brand new, in the box" Motorola Q. Instead, I had a different plan. I had them turn down the calling plan as much as was possible, and requested all data features be removed. Then I bought and older Verizon phone from a friend, which I will use to send and receive phone calls - hopefully - until I have found a different provider who cares to provide.So beware of Verizon and the Motorola Q if you are demanding enough require that your equipment works most of the time to send and receive phone calls. And doubly beware them if you wish to retain your sanity.
I've had to replace this phone three times now. Once because the audio jack wasn't letting me listen to the mp3s and movie files I bought the phone to play. Once because it started freezing on startup every time. And once because the phone simply went dead and wouldn't start up or respond in any way, even when plugged in. Each time, Verizon just replaced the entire phone, without even trying to fix it. That's four unique instances of this phone in one year of use. That's the only impression I can take away from this.
I've owned my Q for over 6 months now and I'm pleased with it.  Does it Never crash?  No.  Gimmee a break!  But mine hardly ever crashes.  The phone calls are good; I can hear people very well and they tell me they can hear me clearly.  It's very good as an MP3 and WMA player, which are the most supported audio formatts.  Use MP3s WMAs WAVs Midi's and others as personalized Ringtones.  Use personal pictures to display for people you know.  For $[...] you can buy an adapter from Amazon or Radio Shack to adapt it from it's small 4-pin headphone jack to a common 1/8" stereo jack; which allows you hook it to a car stereo with a front jack or your stereo at home or you can make recordings of your voice mails.  It's oraganizer is good and reliable.  It's Bluetooth works good.  I installed a Bible on mine; so using it for book reading is good too.  It's camera and video is what one would expect; however it has a flash which many camera's on cell phones don't have.  Buy the larger battery or be a complainer.  So what if it's a couple centimeters bigger, sheesh!  It has a full keyboard and they only drawback is that many have a problem with the smallness of the buttons (I can work with them fine-but my fingers aren't fat).  With web service you can check on team scores, road maps, or restaurants or movie listings or search other things.  Check email and text message.  In most areas you cannot use this phone for emailing large files; but with the installation of a 2 Gig (or bigger) Mini SD storage card - you can transfer large files between your PC and another.  Buy this phone; because for a world where nothing's perfect, you'll learn to rely on this PDA phone so you can ditch your Palm Pilot - and there's NO Stylus to loose!  It doesn't have a touch screen; but between it's jog wheel, back-button and navigation pad - there won't be a long learning curve.  I'd personally suggest buying a 4 Gig Mini SD card; I know that sounds like alot but you can store some video on it that way.  It play's back 30 frame, 320x240 MPEG-1's when the video is encoded at 600K/sec after installing freeware: TCPMP player for Windows Mobile Smartphones [...]  It won't playback MP4 WMV RM or MOV's well because those formatts require too much decompression.  So you can actually watch full motion shows on this phone so long as they are MPEG-1 videos, using the TCPMP player, and you have a good sized Mini SD storage card, and the bigger battery.  All that for a base price of $200!  (The extras will cost less than $80)  And iPhones are for people who don't mind constantly spending money for the sake of not being more involved in making easily created content for the phone. I am very pleased with mine and don't forsee replacing it for years!  Four Stars because I believe this phone could have supported smooth full motion video from the common formatts.
Motorola Q Sucks.  If you are a serious user of cell phone, then don't buy this.  The phone is not good.  That is the reason, Verizon has brought down the price from $199 to $79.Reasons why you should not buy this:I get the standby time of only 10 hours and talk time for just 2 hours.  Where as Verizon claims that this phone has the stand by time of 212 hours and talk time for 7 hours.  But, that is not true.Remember a situation like Sep 11 or Blackout day.  If anything like this happens, then this phone will not help you for any reason.
This phone isn't all its cracked up to be. MP3 player is a joke. The menu setup is beyond frustrating. It doesn't do anything well. Go with a basic camera phone that does the simple things well.  I'm really pissed off that I'm married to this phone for at least another year. Can't wait. Motoral isn't even willing to answer any of my emails about my tech problems.Now let me get started on Verizon. This PDA is my primary phone. After three months I decided to add a phone onto my account for my wife.  Simple. Yet Verizon decided to tack on the Data package (the expensive one at that) with out my authorization. Called and cancelled it. Two months later its on my account again. Come to find out that "their system" automatically tacks the data package on anytime you do just about anything to your account.  They want me to sign up for automatic bill pay. YEAH RIGHT!!! When they are hoping I won't notice an additional data package here or there. Keep in mind thats an addtional $45.GO WITH A BASIC PHONE.
The Q has great functionality and a very well designed keyboard, but every single positive attribute of this device is far - far! - overshadowed by the  unbelievably bad battery performance. I've had two Q's - including a brand-new replacement - and neither can handle even a full business day of even moderate usage. If you buy the extended-life battery, the Q is no longer slim and thus loses one of its chief benefits. Overall, I'd say this is one of the worst consumer electronics products that I have ever purchased. I've yet to find anyone who is happy with their Q. I've also used Blackberry World Phone, which after two days of usage made me aware of just how bad the Q is.
The Q is a good phone for just talking. It gets the job done as far as being able to get online and for that reason, I have stuck with it. However, sometimes when I am composing an email to someone, Mr. Q gets his own ideas for what the text should say. I'll be typing and either the predictive text will get a little too predictive (e.g. I want to say, "I'm going to the show" and without me even choosing to say it, he will type "I'm going to the shootout." Now that is not what I wanted to say!). OR he will decide that there should be a ppp in the email right after what I'm typing and then every time I click "done" and return to the email he has inserted another ppp till the email says, "ppppI'm going to the shootoutppp" - obviously I have a problem with that!And sometimes I cannot highlight on a webpage the button I want to select.Sometimes the phone just freezes up and I have to restart.The big doozie was the phone completely locking up, saying "not enough disk space!" and it had lost all of my pics, contacts and calendar dates! In the store there was another man returning his Q for another and he said it was his fifth Q!!! Scary...But generally, when it comes down to it, this phone gets the job done. I as a woman with small hands am able to click the little keys, I have learned how to navigate, the calendar is well-laid out in my opinion, the phone quality is good, the speakerphone is great, etc.So I will be keeping this phone until the two years ends. Yikes. Two years?! Let's hope by then the iPhone is incredibly affordable and awesome!
[...] qusers.c om and ww w.everythingq.c om (make sure you piece together the spaces though before you go to these sites).They explain exactly how the Q works and should be setup to get the most out of it.I've had this phone since October 2006 and its May (about to be June 07) and I'm loving my phone.After reading about all the issues let me be the first to  sympathize with all the people who got a defective unit.My 1st phone had the bad battery life issue I've read about. After getting the windows service pack updates put on (MOL 2 and MOL 3 see motorola website) the life did improve somewhat but my phone started to experience some of the random power down issues I hear some of you complain about.So after about 2-3 weeks of wanting to toss my phone under a semi truck because of the frustration, I finally decided to bite the bullet and get the unit swapped out.Now, on my 2nd Q, I can tell you with, Microsoft Office Mobile (from Windows Smartphone 6), PDAnet for using my phone as a free highspeed modem (Which is reason #1 to buy this phone alone),Facade, Deepfish webbrowser, Agile AIM/Yahoo/MSN/ICQ messanger, Papyrus Calander Task manager (qhich also rocks along with Facade, Sprite, Orange, and lets not forget the NES, Sega Genesis, SNES and MAME emulators running over 1000 games, the DVD Mp4 movies, Mp3 collection and just about everything else my 2GB MiniSD card's heart's desire can contain, all I can say is thisphone ROCKS!!!!!The only crutch is that there's a bad batch out there like with any product on the market. It seems as if the newer ones are more stable and less likely to experience the headaches the older ones had people gripping about.But the final verdict lies with battery life and the customability of the device.1. I'll address the battery life:Its awesome!!! Let me explain...I used to have the old Q fully charged by 6am (time I leave for work) and make a few calls to my girlfriend 15-30 mins in the morning tops and check my bank account and a few work items = no more than 15 mins surfing the net. I'd immediately close all apps with task manager AND go into flight mode and out of it to log off the net completely (eliminate the arrows on the top of the battery meter)Anyhow by 4pm central my battery would be dead and I'd have to plug the Q in. I got the Extended battery and my Q would last till 9-10pm at night before it needed a full charge.2. With the replacement Q and old slim battery, I'm now averaging 14 hours of heavy use (emulators, 20 mins web browsing, music, 1.5 hours of phone calls total today etc) and still have 75% life left! Its night and day and looks as if my new Q is the winner phone we all should have. If yours isn't like this, SWAP IT OUT immediately.II. Stability...This new Q hasn't crashed at all even after doing all the necessary system registry tweaks (find out more on qusers)1. the glyphcache one to spead up the interface2. rearranging the keys (ex the old back key by the scroll wheel is now my speaker phone and vice versa)3. the 3x web speed enhance hack4. the memory cache hack5. and the bluetooth volume enhancer hack to enhance my Jabra JX-10 volume (again see Qusers.com)ALL of these and more and my phone just keeps going and going and going. I have had this new phone for about a week now and with HEAVY usage, enough to crash and burn my old Q for sure this new tank just keeps asking for more!I haven't even tried the extended battery because I don't need to...Bottom line, SWAP your phone out at Verizon if its not acting like this. I'm convinced this is how the Q was intended to be....now if only everyone here can experience this!I work at Enterprise in management and all the customers who walk in the door with Qs eyes drop when they see how customized mine is and how the battery life really is!For that guy who complaied about the layout, check out the wallpaper setup on qusers and get the setup you like! With Facade and Fizz Weather you can have a killer setup on your phone!
I've had my phone for almost a year now. So far, it's been awesome.The pros:- I live in NYC, so the reception and sound quality are really good. Verizon seems to have the best service out here.- Good Windows functionality. It's not slow, and boot time is quick.- Not too expensive- Synching is so easy.- It's pretty tiny. Packs a lot of punch.
getting this phone was the biggest mistake ever. I have only had it 6 months and have had to get it replaced FOUR TIMES! none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly. its always one thing after another. and I'm stuck with the thing for another year!! X(
I have owned the Q since August, 2006. I wish I'd bought a Blackberry. The Q has very good reception. The email reception is great - until it freezes up with an "Error" message, which happens weekly. I then lose email access. It's not a good sign when you have the phone HELP number tatooed to your wrist! The IT guy at work has asked me to get rid of it. I need a phone and I need to receive work email at any time. The Q is unreliable for email, and that just doesn't make the grade, no matter how many other features it has.
Wow, I normally would not write a review on a cell phone, but the Motorola Q is so poorly designed and flawed that I can not hold back.  I truly do not understand how Motorola could put out such a product with clean consciences!  It is obvious that there were known flaws when distributed because there are so many different versions of error messages that they (and Microsoft) inserted throughout the software.The following are major problems with this phone.  I won't mention the less major issues.  Battery life is incredibly bad.  With the extended life battery, the phone will not last through a workday (with minimal use).  It locks up constantly, requiring you to remove the battery to reboot.  It often can not make a phone call from the contact list or call history list, usually giving a bogus error about not having a signal or, the simple "Operation Error".  It doesnt change time when passing through time zones and, (this is important for my work) the Windows media player will not open wav files.As soon as I can, I am going to a Palm Treo 760 (Palm OS, NOT Windows).
I will be reluctantly getting my 3rd Q (replacement). I've only had this 2nd one for maybe 2 months. It would freeze constantly during the past 2 months forcing me to remove the battery for a restart. Now I have the dreaded Black Screen of Death with "motorola flash mode bootloader version: boot_c_03.08.00R_MPAP". Anytime bloggers start naming how your phone dies its a very bad sign!
I bought the Q because of the poor phone reception of the Treo 650 I had. The reception was a little better on the Q but still not as good as a stand alone phone. After a month the Q slipped out of my hands and the glass cracked when it landed. I sent it in for repairs and was told it couldn't be fixed. I have now opted for a data card and a Mot Razr. Now I finally have a phone that will work at my house and the data card is a much better way for me to handle emails. It gives me portability and I only have to handle the emails once.
If you get this phone, plan on using all of your minutes on the phone with Microsoft trying to install Active Sync.  It has very stringent requirements, none of which are mentioned on the site when you purchase the unit.  I still cannot get it to work.  Why Motorola would have hitched their cart to Microsoft's spur is beyond me.  If you just want a really expensive unusually large phone that pretends to maintain your task, calendar and contact data, without actually doing so, then this is phone is perfect.[...]
This phone couldn't read any MPEG videos at the time I got it, before to return it to the store, and videos was the MAIN reason why I bought it, too bad. But even with a freeware, you need to check the resolution at 600K/sec, that's weird, it should work without any freeware, just with Windows media player, out of the box, just like on any Windows OS PC, but it doesn't, Windows mobile is really bad.Extended battery, still offers a limited life span, way less than other phones/PDA anyway. Video camera, isn't really good, have you ever tried to shoot videos at the highest resolution, did it freeze your phone after 15/16 seconds, forcing you to HARD reset the phone ? Well whatever your answer is, that happened to me all the time, forcing me to settle for the medium resolution, again, Windows Mobile ain't good at all, Oh you can't even edit the Word or Excel doc, just read them, that's all, let me guess another freeware to install, so this is like in a Windows XP computer that couldn't do anything by itself, back to the future, in the days with Windows 3.1 for Workgroups or what ? Oh yeah again, they say affordable phone with internet, I don't think so, 40$ a month for the Web, unlimited usage ain't cheap to me, 480$ a year just to surf the web or being billed as you go with Data usage like it happened to me, hell no it isn't affordable at all, it is a complete rip off from Verizon. Too many persons like me, who brought this piece of junk back to the store, and next thing you know the price is now 79$, instead of +300$ when I bought it, Huuuum, let see why in the world Verizon would slash the price after just one year, that bad, think...This supposedly smart phone, is a nightmare, you shouldn't buy it period, unless you are some kind of manager, business man, who believe it is necessary to stay connected to some kind of Network 24/7, at all cost, and being billed by Verizon Wireless for it. This is the worst thing ever when you buy that type of phone just for the big screen, and the Mini SD card, in order for you to enjoy your Pictures and VIDEOS on the go, yet having a screen big enough to see the details of these multimedia content, but do not care about surfing the web on a, then too small screen that doesn't allow you to see anything. THIS PHONE STAYS CONNECTED TO BROADBAND ACCESS (High speed internet download from VzW) 24/7, even when in standby, when you sleep at night and the ONLY way to discover this is when you receive your first bill from VzW. Verizon does NOT communicate AT ALL on this particularity of the Q, and other PDA, according to their sale persons, and No one at VzW Tech support is able to block this feature, in fact one girl from their Tech support did it once, and messed up the OS, the phone was trying to connect every ten second and sending to me error msgs, one after another with a horrible BEEP noise, I had to turn off the phone, and go back to the Vz store the day after, in order for the Tech people to download an upgrade and, billing me with DATA USAGE for it ! That was the LAST STRAW, after two months and a half of an absolute nightmare I return the whole thing and the VzW people in the store have been kind enough to take it back, and oh by the way the Customer service receives so many calls of persons like me that they never complain to wipe out our DATA USAGE bill, nothing to pay. AGAIN DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE if you are just looking for a multimedia device that is also a phone with keyboard, it is NOT worth it at all, especially considering the other issues that this phone have, mostly coming from the OS, Windows Mobile is so LAME.You want to see a lot of your personal videos that you will copy on the MiniSD card. let see, Windows Media Player is ONLY capable of reading the WMV, who cares ! NO AVI, NO MPEG/MPG, the most common files found around the world, nope NO luck it is NOT working. You want to use the keyboard to write a note real quick, nope you can't, no Notepad available, ONLY a voice Notes is provided, yes this is a Windows OS without the Notepad.exe. The battery life expectations is ridiculously low even with the extended battery, especially if you are talking with someone, let see is it a phone or what ? The operating system is lame, the multimedia capabilities forces you to translate your videos files in Windows Media Video file format, good luck if you have the kind of collection like I do, the battery life forces you to stay in charge for ever, and if you do not want to have the bad experience I had with the phone itself being connected to the Super Enhanced VzW Network, you can buy the monthly DATA PACKAGE, for 40$/month, just because the phone itself connects automatically, 24/7, 480$ a year just because of the phone, working this way and there is nothing you can do about it, and being an IT computer myself, I went deep in the core of Windows, looking for an hidden, NOT documented settings, well there is none, the phone connects and that's it ! NO choice No confirmation YES or CANCEL screen, nothing, to let you know that you are connected, I'm telling you, STAY AWAY.
I found, after  much searching and discussion with various Verizon people, that you do NOT need the Music Essentials kit to play your own music on this phone. You simply need to format the Micro SD memory card (just a few quick clicks with your phone), then remove the card and insert it w/ adapter into your PC, then drag the music files onto the "My Music" folder that shows up when you bring up the window for the drive that reads the card. However, you either need to do with with .wma files and windows Media Player version 10 or 11, or else set up the phone to allow .mp3 files--see earlier review on how to do this. Good luck!
OK here's the deal with this phone.  I just got it yesterday, and all in all, it's a 7 on a scale of 1-10.  It has the best speakers and sound quality of all non-MP3 dedicated phones (meaning the Chocolate and others like it).  You do not have to convert MP3's into WMA's anymore.  That makes it really nice.  Sound quality on the speakerphone is very good too, from both ends.  Nice to have MP3 functions on the outside of the phone also.  Forget the "music essentials" kit that Verizon says you need.  It's not essential.  All you need is the memory card (Transflash, also called T-Flash) and a reader/writer.  Format the card on the phone, pop it out of the phone, into the reader/writer, put the USB part of the reader/writer into your computer's USB hub, the computer does the rest.  Click, Copy, and Paste your MP3 files over to the My Music folder of the memory card and away you go.  You cannot makes these songs into ringtones though, the phone will not allow you to copy them to the ringtone menu.  There is a website called Freeringers.net that lets you make your own, edit them down, and send them to your phone via a MM from the website.  Costs whatever it would as a normal message on your service plan, plus a one time fee for the website (8 bucks for one year is CHEAP!!!!)  It even allows you to test your phone for compatibility before you pay for it.Now for the not so good features.  The video and camera features come out WAYYYY too dark when you are taking a shot from a few feet away or in a bar/club, even with the flash on.  My Motorola actually took better pictures, it's scary to say.  The voice command feature on this phone is HORRIBLE when trying to recognize names.  I get everyone BUT the person I need.  Again, I never had a problem with this on my last Motorola phone.  It's nice to be able to reprogram the shortcut keys, but you can only program the keys on the main wheel...not the left and right soft keys under the inside screen.  That's rough cuz I am used to buttons on my last phone performing certain functions.  You have to leave the flip open to use the speakerphone, which makes it hard to handle while driving and I hate bluetooth adapters.  Also, you cannot program the phone to turn off the speaker automatically after, say, 20 secs of non use, like my last one.Phone sound quality is no better or worse than any other one I have had.  Reception seems fine so far, except I see when I am in my house, I go into the 1X quite a lot instead of the EV-DO.  Never did that with my last phones either.So all in all, I am going to wait the full 15 days for my trial period, but so far, it looks like a keeper.  I have never really had a problem with Verizon from a customer service end after being with them for a year.  I was with Cingular for 15 years before switching.  I guess I am one of the lucky ones.  I still have to play with the phone more and get to know its "guts".  I just wanted to let everyone know about the main things cuz I have been looking at get this phone for the last 4 months.  I am not disappointed, but I am not overly thrilled either.
VX6100, take a hike! Time for a new phone! After some browsing of online reviews and whatnot, I finally decided on the VX8300 for my new phone from Verizon.BOY that was a smart choice!First of all, all the old LG accessories - like chargers and data cables - are 100% compatible with the new VX8300. You don't need a "music essentials kit" if you want to play music. You can either use an old modified USB data cable from an old LG phone, or you can transfer songs onto a MicroSD card using a reader. You don't need to buy tones or wallpapers, just use Bluetooth (or again, USB) and BitPim just like you did with the old LG phones. You don't need to spend money emailing camera photos either, just use the MicroSD card and the phone's "storage" menu to transfer between your internal memory and the MicroSD card.The "LG Handfree Stereo Headset for the LG Chocolate and other compatible LG handsets" (search for: B000HZZIGO) is the perfect companion to this phone. It, plus headphones (NOT earbuds, blech!) are 100 times superior to the Music Essentials Kit. It, plus a tape adapter, is all the handsfree car kit you would ever need - the phone has a built-in echo canceler for full duplex car-stereo speakerphone operation, even in the oldest of cars. Phone rings while it's playing your music through the stereo, you push the button, and when you hang up, it goes right back to music automatically.I didn't even know it had an MP3 limitation. I did have a problem putting my MP3s on the phone at first, but it turns out that was because it didn't like MP3s with long ID3V2 tags (esp. tags with cover art embedded). It plays MP3s fine as long as you remove the ID3V2 tags (I use Mp3tag to remove ID3V2 tags and leave ID3V1). Otherwise you get the dreaded "Unable to play" message. It does support WMAs of course, and I found that WMA offers better compression as well as cover-art tagging (shows the cover image while the song plays, hello iPod!), so I converted most of my on-phone music to WMA and added JPEG cover art - I saved a lot of space with that.The speakers are great. The phone is incredible. If you get VZ Navigator, a very worthwhile investment, you have the world's best navigation system in your hands. It can get you from point A to point B with pinpoint accuracy, and never miss a turn either. Forget buying a navigation system, just use VZ Navigator! It costs a little extra... like 10 bucks for a "subscription" (not sure what that implies) plus some airtime. Still haven't looked at the bill to see what all it ended up costing.Without a doubt the best phone LG has made to date. Better than Chocolate. Verizon tried to skimp on features and chop this phone down to size but they failed miserably at ruining it, so their loss is your gain! Grab one. Seriously.Oh... and that modification I mentioned earlier? Just cut out the center bump in older LG cables, the bump that prevents you from plugging it in. The wiring is identical. I think it was just a marketing trick to get you to buy new accessories. Your old car charger will work, your old data cable will work, your old car kit should work too if you're so inclined to have one. Talk about a dirty trick!
The LG VX8300 is the best phone I have ever owned.  Its features are outstanding and looks great.  I was a Sprint customer and dissatisfied with their lack of good phones--the signal/service, however, is pretty comparable at least where I live.The camera does have some trouble in low light, and the flash doesn't seem to help all that much.  The camcorder is a nice feature, and it will record as long as you wish if you have a MicroSD card.The MP3 player works well.  You can text yourself <30 second MP3 ringtones (search on the web), but you can't use the MP3's on your MicroSD card as ringtones.  I have not gotten a stereo headset yet, but I plan to very soon.The speakerphone is clear, and I don't get any complaints from the other side.  However I do wish you could close the hinge and still talk on speaker.Battery life is great.  It can go a few days before needing a recharge, and that's if I use the MP3 player, speakerphone, etc.The menu is intuitive and easy-to-use, and you can select from six different display themes.  The buttons are raised and far enough apart that you can dial without looking.I have not tried Bluetooth yet.Overall, this is the phone I have been looking for.  The reception is great, and I have dropped perhaps one call in a very "dead" area.  I would and have recommended this phone to my friends and family.
Great Reception and Sound Quality.  Blue Tooth works great.  MP3 Player works well once you get used to Verizon's software.  I also use Verizon's GPS Navigation on this LG instead of a $350 Garmin.  Added a 2GB microSD card that holds 1400 wma files.  This phone does everything, and it does it all very well.  Best Phone I've ever had.
...I have had several LG phones thru Verizon.  I got the VX8300 for free as an upgrade.  I went with it over a Motorola because of LG's quality.  It has great reception and terrific battery life.  The camera is better than most and the phone feels solid.  It's loaded with features, but most of them I find useless.  I suppose I am not in Verizon's V-Cast demographics at 52 yrs. old, but I will never understand why anyone would need their phone to play music or stream video.  Like 99% of the people on this planet, I have an iPod.  Why would I need the same ability on my phone?  Besides Verizon requires you to buy special headphones and if you are a Mac user, like me, then you can not import songs from iTunes.  Buying music from V-Cast is TWICE what iTunes charges.  The Mobile Web feature is wonderfully practical, however.  For only $5 a month I can check news, sports scores and email.  And it is extremely fast!  If you want all the bells and whistles this is a excellent phone.
I have owned this phone for a little less than a week now.  I have spend the last two weeks agonizing over the decision of which phone to get, I finally decided to buy this one. First of all, the phone is great.  Calls are clear on my end and from what I hear, people say they can hear me fine.  I live in the middle of Pennsylvania, more deer than people, and my reception is near perfect where ever I go.  Contacts are easy to create and organize.  The voice dial is a little tricky but I really doubt I will invest the time needed to use it.  I am coming from an older motorloa v60s phone, which was about 5 years old and damn near industructible it was a great phone, but now I feel like I have joined the modern world.Now for the fun part of the review, the media features are great.  I have seen many reviews that complain about the fact that the phone can only play .wma files and that you had to manually change that through the special menu however, the newer versions of the phone are set up to play mp3s right of the bat without any tinkering.  The manual you get from Verizon says it can't play them but just ignore it.The camera is pretty good.  I wouldn't say stellar but for a phone, it's fine.  You really can't expect the world with a phone camera.  It's easy to take pictures and you can use the front screen as a viewer for taking self-portraits.  The video camera is pretty much the same.  With a micro SD card you can record as much as your card will hold instead of the standard 15 seconds.The battery life is good so far.  I have been playing with the phone non stop for 4 days and have yet to recharge it yet.The phone really takes on some awesome features if you are somewhat computer savvy and want to invest a little bit of time.  When I bought the phone, I got a 1gig microSD card, a bluetooth dongle for my cpu, and a microphone headset so I can listen to music and talk to people at the same time.  With BitPim you can easily make your own ringtones for free.  All you have to do is a little dragging and dropping and then bitpim does the rest, transfer them over to your phone and voila you have free better quality ringtones.  You can do almost anything with bitpim.  With a file converter you can convert any mpeg file to quicktime format and then you have movies on your phone.All in all it's a good phone, ok camera, great media platform, and ergonomically sound.  I am slightly concerned with its durability.  Coming from the old phone I had no cares in the world about durability, I dropped it on concrete and everywhere a normal phone would break.  I suspect that this phone can take some bumps and maybe one or two big ones, but after that I wouldn't hold out much hope for it.  I guess that would be how I would rate any phone now.  With as much technology packed into modern phones, they have to be sensitive and there isn't much room for error.  One thing I know is Samsungs flip both ways phone breaks at the drop of a dime, as my girlfriend will tell you.  Also, I know that no one should ever get the chocolate by LG.  My best friend inadvertently calls everyone in his contact list about twice a day, has already had to receive a new phone because it just stopped working, and they have no durability.Once again, this phone is a good buy at a good price.  I got mine for $50 from the verizon website.  It was worth spending a little more to go through Verizon to avoid hefty cancellation fees imposed by the place you buy it and then Verizon, also you get customer service perks that you can't get if you get your phone from Wal-Mart.  Good luck
After getting myself a new VX8700, I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend. The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers, but it seems to be one of their best performers. Sound quality, speakerphone, RF, and battery life all seem very good. The camera takes decent pictures. It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too. With a new contract, you can get it for $50 or less. At this price, I give it 5 stars.
Feb. 6, 2012: I can't believe I've had this phone 5 years, but I have, and it still works and, more amazingly, it6's still working on the original battery - not that I can guarantee that you'll have the same results.I said originally that I use it to make calls, and that's what I do today. Only today, it's hooked up to my Bluetooth in the car, and it stays in its little cubbyhole and doesn't see the light of day except for its weekly charge. It's really too much trouble to take it off Bluetooth, so we do all our calling from the car, and even that's not much. Our kids all all back in this state and within an hour of us, and chatting doesn't seem to be anyone's style nowadays. It's not a smart phone, but we're smart people: we now prepay for a year and, although we ended up with 120 hours per phone (my wife has the same one), we're also running $500 less than when we paid monthly. And Verizon has even gotten better. I haven't found a dead spot in this mountainous area except for Sequoia National Park where I didn't want to talk to anyone anyway.Still think it's a great phone, And if you absolutely MUST, you can get on the internet and you can take a snapshot. Unfortunately, that will cost you extra.****I have owned cell phones since the time of "the Brick," and 10 models in between. Now that coverage is excellent in most of the country (mountains are still a problem in this neck of the woods), if you want a phone to make phone calls, this is probably a little better than most. It is certainly more durable than the Razr.The pluses: Good reception for the most part; great speaker phone (better than my wired office phones); good display.The minuses: The handbook that comes with it is 37 pages long. Anything after page 4 costs money. Send out five high res pictures, and you run into real money. And it may be an MP3 player of sorts, but at $2 a song, I'll stick with my iRiver or iPod.The long and short of it. After looking for a year for a phone that just made phone calls, this is what we chose. I don't need the camera, but now you have no choice. With special incentives from Verizon - probably because we've been with them for 3 years - the total cost was the retail tax for two phones. Everything else was a mail in or instant rebate.Four stars because it's a fairly good phone, and I've given up on persuading anyone under 50 that they still need a wired phone especially when you want to talk to more than one person at a time. Yeah, the speaker phone is great, but so sensitive that it'll pick up ambient noise so that I can hear people who are 15 feet away from it.
It also plays your own movies. It's great as a phone, not a whole you can improve on there. Calls work fine, speakerphone, bluetooth, etc etc. But did you know this thing can play your own DVD, TV and home shows and movies? Do a search for LG VX8300 tips and you will find the instructions. It's fairly simple, convert your media to avi with pan and scan on, then convert to PG2 high quality on in QCIF format. You must use the QCIF format converter or the movie will be choppy and not play right. Then copy the new video file over to the phones 2GB micro card (which you bought right?) and there you go!Sure, the movie is small, but believe it or not its not bad at all for viewing and comes in handy when on the road, at a restraunt with food running late and your kid just needs a break to get off your nerves. I have half a dozen full length movies and tv shows on mine which take up about half of the 2GB card. Not bad!Other things that people don't touch on much on their reviews on this phone.The phones camera does have a movie mode, it will record movies as long as you have space on your external card. The video isn't that great, but works and records sound as well.Photos are decent enough, and on highest quality if you have the right lighting and a steady hand they can be good enough to be printed decently on a good inkjet at 4x6.Cons:- When you take a picture you have to select 'Save' after to save it. I hate this, just save it automatically and I'll delete it later. Same with movies. Its an extra unneeded step.- Needs more base ring tones, but since you can make your own and save it to the sd card to use its not a huge deal.- No Vibrate then Ring option
I've had this phone for about 9 months now and overall it is a very good phone. Service and call quality is good (sometimes I don't get calls). One thing I hat however is the now generic Verizon interface. It is boring and the menu color schemes look bad. However, the camera in this phone is great considering it is on a phone. Most of my pics are clear and once cleared up on Photoshop, come out great. The build quality of the phone is slightly above average. I have dropped it numerous times and today it fell in a pool. After all of this it still works. The two build problems I have are that dust is getting inside the screens, and rarely used buttons are wearing out.  However, a few of my friends have had this phone longer than me and have never had these problems. Even though this is a great phone, I will probably turn to Cingular when my contract ends just because of the better phones I can use with Cingular(most verizon phones are flimsy pieces of garbage). Anyway, if you're in the market for a midrange phone with some unique styling and want to use Verizon, this is a great example.
I just replaced my old Samsung a670 flip phone with this one.  I loved the size and style of the Samsung, and the LG seemed to be a knock-off in the style, which I liked.  The LG has pretty much the same keys and layout, but with many more features.  The music player is the biggest advantage.  It's a solid phone, that can take a beating.  It is a bit ugly, but acceptable.  The speakerphone works great, as well as the voice command system, which does not require you to record people's names in your voice.  You can operate just about any feature of the phone by voice command.
I have owned this phone for over a year now, and have grown quite used to it, but there are still some things that bug me:RECEPTION: Only average, my old Motorola was better.  An all-digital phone.  Sometimes shows the "service" icon when it is impossible to make a call.  Service is not altogether reliable based on its service display.CALL QUALITY: quite good, with good volume and adjustability.INCLUDED RINGTONES: Annoying and outdated, probably so that you'll buy one from verizon (which they make easy with 'get it now'.SPEAKERPHONE: Great speakers (stereo) are almost loud enough to listen to music in a quiet room, though the voice quality over the speaker-phone is only adequate.  Useful and loud, but not great quality.MP3 PLAYER: almost requires you to buy the verizon music kit to make it work.  I use a transflash (same as micro SD) that they formatted in the verizon store for me, and it works OK, but the phone has trouble recognizing a lot of the music that I try to load from my computer.  The MP3 player often turns on by itself in my pocket because of the player buttons on the outside.CAMERA: Better than average.  Works even in low light at close proximity with the flash.  Good colors, quality is what you'd expect from a 1 Megapixel lens.  Easy to use and access.  Camcorder is average.USABILITY:  Buttons are generally well placed and easy to use, with the exception of the front media player buttons which can be pressed in your pocket.  Voice memo and voice dial work fine.TEXT MESSAGING: The word recognition is not as good or as easy to use as my old phone, and it gets annoying for long sessions of texting.Bluetooth:  seems to work just as well as others that I've tried, not great.Battery Life: really good.  Lasts a couple days with several calls throughout each day before i have to charge it.The user interface is standard on all verizon phones now, with lots of slots (at least 500) for contacts, and space for 3 different numbers for each contact.  The mobile web is slow and plodding, but reliable.The form factor is thicker than razor-type slim phones, but not huge, and easy to fit in a pocket.
I've used this phone for a year. Everything works as when I first received it including the battery, while my wife's Nokia6236i had completely failed.
This is the best phone I have had in a long time. I would give it five stars except for one reason. The sound is not the greatest in the world. I went to listen to my messages with the speakerphone and I got a really tinny sound and the same for when it plays music. I thought something was wrong with the speakers but I went to the store and found the display model was the same. You know when you leave a glass on top of a large speaker and you turn up the speaker and the glass rattles with the music? That is what the sound is like when turned up. Otherwise I found nothing wrong with this phone and it has everything you might ever need or use.  Watch videos on it and great camera!! Take long videos too and transfer then with a micro SD card. Make sure you get a Micro SD card that has an adapter to a regular sized SD card. I love this phone!!! One minor thing. If you get the Car Charger check it before you leave the store to make sure it is a good fit and does not move around. I got one and had to return to Verizon Wireless the next day to get one that was okay. It was the cord not the phone that was the problem. You will love this phone if you get it !!!!!!!!
I love this phone!!! The pics are awesome. This phone does everything, I am telling all my family and friends GO OUT AND GET ONE!! You will not be sorry,  I traded a Treo for this and I don't regret a thing. Super User Friendly!!!
I have no issues with the phone's performance, except for the quality of the camera's pictures.  They are horrible. You have to be in the perfect light, the subject has to be completely still, and you might get a half-way decent picture. But most of the pics I have taken have been horrible and I didn't save 80% of them, they were just too blurry.
I purchased this phone in August 2007 to replace a Motorola i730. So far, I like it pretty well. I wouldn't say it awesome or anything like that, but it's a good phone.My favorite feature is the camera. The pic quality seems to be good. I know it won't compare to a real camera so I won't even go there. I can't compare it to another camera phone 'cuz this is my first one. I like that you can take someones pic then have that pic come up on the screen when that person calls. I know it's old hat to most people, but it's new to me!The sound quality is great. It sounds clearer than the Motorola to me and to the people on the other end of the line. The ring tones sound very good as well.It has alot of ringtones to choose from, but of course I wanted to use downloads. They are now $3 ea thru Verizon so I chose to do it the "round-about" way. I purchased a USB cord to go with the phone and my husband used it to download songs from his MP3 that he cut down to 30sec. This was great because we got to decide what part of the song we wanted to hear.As far as making calls it is a bit more involved than my other phone. My old phone had a "shortcut" to call people that I've recently talked to. No matter what number they called from, I could still easily access a different number in their entry. I can't do that with this new phone. I have to actually go into the "Contacts" to call that person if I want a different number than what they last called from. It's easy enough to do, but it takes a while to get used to a new phone after so many years with the other one. If I want the same number they called from, it's really easy...just hit "Send" and it brings up the last numbers called.It's enabled with the VCast stuff, but I didn't get any of that...I just need a phone, not a TV. It has the Navigation, too...I haven't had to use it yet, but look forward to getting a bit lost one day so that I can (ha,ha!)It has LOTS of menus. Some may say that's a good thing, but not me. I still haven't figured out where everything is! Most of the stuff in the menus are the things I don't use. It gets frustrating sometimes when I'm trying to do something, but I can't remember where it's at so I have to go thru everything in there.Anyway...a good phone to have as a phone. Good camera when needed for that "oh how cute" moment with the kids. As for the "fluff" that comes with it, you'll just have to check out other reviews.
This phone periodically would not ring when people called me, and then I'd get a message notification hours, sometimes days later.  Perhaps you could blame the carrier, but.... during conversations the phone would just die, and then mysteriously come back to life several minutes later.  About the 4th time it happened, it never came back on, and could not be repaired so it was replaced with the same phone.  It was then that I learned that all my keepsake photos and videos on the phone were lost forever in addition to all my ringtones and contacts.  The phone was only 10 months old and had never been mistreated.  LG was of no help and offered no compensation.  I would not buy another LG product.
I swapped for the the LG VX8300 Verizon phone after getting the Samsung SCH u540 from Costco.  Luckily Costco's policy allows you to try a phone for 30 days and if you're not satisfied, you can switch to another.  I tried the Samsung for a week and was very unhappy with how overly sensitive the touch-sensitive buttons were on the outside of the phone.  Essentially, we kept taking pictures of the inside of our pants pockets or purse b/c the buttons would register anytime you brushed anything against them.  Plus, I found the Samsung's reception to be spotty at best.After switching to the LG, I was immediately happier.  Not only was the outside more user friendly for those of us who tuck the phones in our back pockets or purses, but the reception seemed better and the battery life was much better than my old Motorola.  The photos are also very easy to take and send to other phones.  I found the bluetooth connection easy to setup (very intuitive) and the voice activated calling was fairly easy to use, although I will say my old Motorola was better at recognizing what names I was saying.  I like the loud and clear speakerphone function on the LG, too.  Easy to turn on and off with the prominent button that even my five year old can find and use.  My only complaint is the lack of good ringtones that come standard with the phone.  My old Motorola had a fabulous ring that was first a vibrate, then a ringer.  The only setting close to that on the LG is a combo vibrate/ringer.  I'm sure if I went online I could download something, but I am not that tech savvy nor time-available of a user.  I want something that I can open from the box and charge and go.  I was happy that the LG was good for someone who didn't want to spend time to read a lengthy manual.  The menus are all pretty easy to navigate and therefore perfect for me.  Supposedly you can do video too, but haven't tried that yet.All in all, a good "ready to go, out of the box" phone that's easy to use and has good reception & sound quality.  It lost one star due to the lack of good pre-installed ringtones.  I would actually give it 4-1/2 stars if I could.
If you are a media geek, this phone is a great value for a verizon customer. It has all the features verizon has, v cast, mp3 player etc, but at a good price. Also, its a solid phone, able to take a bump or two (razor and Krazors are not the greatest at that).  But, one thing that annoys the heck out of me are the worthless side buttons.  the left toggle button on my last 3 phones change ringtone from loud, soft, vibrate or silent, without having to go to the menu. This phone I have to go to the menu if I want to turn the ringer back on, and there is no option to change the sidebuttons, only the ones on the keypad. Also, the menus are not my favorite. It took me a couple of days to get use to pushing the CLR button to back out of menus. And they have so many menus, finding the feature i want to change is a bit of a pain.  Finally, this camera does not have a zoom feature for the still camera, although the video part does.  But, all in all, its decent.  Why waste money on anything else, unless you want to get the TV phone and pay for that service, which is I believe $25 a month, V cast/net on this phone and other vcast phone is $15.  Check this out, not bad.
first off Ronald is 100% wrong on the MP3 function.YOU do need to purchase from VCAST or buy the kit. you can purchase a Micro SD card and a card reader. then transfer the songs to the card. OR you can purchase a data cable (look on ebay for them cheap) and transfer them.i suggest getting a card reader. it is far faster.as for the ringtones yes there are only a few. but do a search on the phone and there are sites that show you how to make a MP3 ringtone and put it on the SD card.I LOVE this phone. just need to get myself a good bluetooth headset and some headphones.
We have had 4 of these LG 8300 phones since June. The call reception quality has been POOR as compared to my older Motorola E815. I never had a problem using my E815 anywhere in my house, going to town etc. But thesxe LG8300 phones constantly cut out, drop calls in the same locations. We've taken them back to Verizon for the V04 software upgrades which are supposed to help with reception but doesn't as far as I'm concerned. I WANT A PHONE FOR A PHONE, THE BEST PHONE, I have a digital camera, if I want a MP3 player I'll buy one. AGAIN I want a PHONE for a PHONE and want it to be the best, if that is what you want DON'T BUY LG especilally the LG8300. Now we're stuck for 2 years with inferior reception with these LG8300 phones. I would have gotten more Motorola E815 phones but Verizon no longer sells them, pitty, it was the best phone for a phone I ever had.
Hmpfh ergg tyhhu jjas. At least, that what this review would sound like if you were listening to it on the VX8300. Me and my wife each bought the phone with Verizon's "New after 2" plan, and chose this one. It does have a good (not great) camera, the MP3 player plays MP3s, and the micro SD card is nice. My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it. We went back to the store, thinking it was defective. After trying 5 others, we realized it was not just hers. Mine was actually the exception - and even then, the sound was not great, more like "barely intelligible". We were upgrading from a Motorola V276, which sounded WAYYY better, no contest, just didn't have the bells and whistles. I regret getting this phone, and advise people who actually have to listen to phone calls, not play MP3s or text messages, to avoid it. There are way too many others that sound much better.
I replaced an old LG candy-bar phone with the VX8300, it's a good replacement (considering) but the MP3 performance is just not acceptable. I've heard better quality from key chain players that cost $9. The volume level is too low and it has no bass at all when driving earbuds (Sony MDREX90LP). It does sound good when driving a cassette adapter (XM) in the car so that's how I'll be using it.It's just not so hot for the office.
My thoughts on the Motorola V195 are mixed. For its main purpose, as a handheld phone, it works satisfactorily. This gets the phone three stars since this is how I mostly use it. Because it is better than entry-level, I expected more, but did not really get more. That is where it lost two stars.Basic Functions* As regular phone:Works fine. Reception is usually clear, cut-offs rare. Phone numbers are saved well, although I wish I could group numbers (work, cell, home) into one name rather than having separate entries. Speaker phone works well. Ear bug has no problems.* Physical phone:Light, but not lightweight -- plenty of lighter units can be found. The protective rubber piece which covers the outlets for the ear bug and recharger, fell off and was lost. It was difficult to use before that. The time displays well, and has, for most purposes, replaced my watch. I can adjust the volume easily from an outside button.*ExtrasBluetooth:The upgrade I bought this phone for, Bluetooth headset usage, disappointed me. The headset is extra, and does not come with the standard phone. I consider voice dialing on this unit useless. My voice is in no way unusual, with a common Midwest accent. However, when I say 'Steve' it dials my dad or others. 'Dad' could likewise bring me in contact with others.Even when I am in a quiet room or my car, the reception using the headset is terrible. I use the ear bug instead.If you need a good phone, you will be happy with this one. Need to use Bluetooth? Keep shopping.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com
I just got a new unlocked Motorola V195. But found the following issues1) The phone does not ring when it is charging. I made sure that the ring option is loud at all times. Even then it does not ring. I tried to keep ring and vibrate. ANd when charging and when calls come, the phone vibrates but does not ring. Can someone help?2) The speaker phone also does not work when the phone is charging. Is this some stupid software glitch or is it problem with the phone.
i switched to this phone from a samsung and was disapointed.prosa) blue toothb) speakerphonec) battery lifeconsa) very poor UIand the worst of all,the software. this phone does not record an entry per person, but it is an entry per no. if you are storing 3 no's for Joe ( home,office and cell) you will have 3 seperate entries in ur addr book. this is a real hassle, even worse the v 195 also lets you store 3 entries with the exact same name.suggestion:the v 195 is less expensive than most of the other phones in market. it might seem a decent buy considering its features. But, the ui and poor software make it less usable. get  a samsung or a nokia if you can.
Hello! I got this Pink Razr cause i had a pink pebl and it had to go in for repair and Edge Wireless lost it. But, they found it at the last minute. But i did not want to take the chance of having it being broke again, so i got the razr. The phone is sooooooo cool!! Here are some of the Pros and Cons of this phone:Pros:1. The color is really cool.2. The Grapics are great when you are playing games.3. The picture quality is awesome.4. No dropped calls.5. You can hear perfectly on the phone.6. It is nice and thin.7. It fits in your pocket really nicely. You never know it is your pocket because it is so thin.8. It is light weight.9. I like that you can put pictures on the front of the phone.10. I have unlimited texting, so i text alot. If you are a person who likes to texts, this is the phone for you because the keypad is nice, and you know how some phones are slow at texting? Well, not this phone. Thia phone keeps up with you no matter how fast you are going.Cons:1. The battery life. The battery life is good but sometimes  the battery life does not even last a day. I do not talk on the phone alot. But i still love this phone.I hope i was helping you pick out this phone. I am just a 12 year-old kid but i hope this helps. This phone is the best!!
The phone is very nice, I love the number pad although it takes some getting used to, nice size area for the number.  Clear voices, easy to use and slim to slip in a pocket or bag.  I love the color......ps to those complaining about the color.  Online colors aren't always correct, you need to research in person sometimes it's your PC's personal color scheme as well.  Try it you'll like it.
This is it of cell phones.  Easy to use and a Great Phone.
I purchased a Motorola Razr V3 cell phone through Amazon.com from Ace Photo and Digital. This was to replace the phone my wife received from Cingular Wireles that passed away after she took it swimming. Since a new phone costs $250 from Cingular, we opted to purchase an "unlocked" phone for $168 through Ace.The phone arrived promptly, but upon turning it on we found discovered there were phone numbers on it that were not ours. The phone, we suspected, was not new. Three hours after we started to use it, the screen went dead. So much for that!After two emails to Ace that went unanswered, I called their customer service line. Their service was great. No hassles from them. They emailed me a form to fill out and I sent the phone back ($7.50 in postage). We received a replacement phone about two weeks later. This one worked, but the battery compartment cover would not stay on. We were able to use the one from our old Cingular phone. Thank God we had it!I don't have a problem with Ace's service, but I do question the quality of their product. If these are refurbished phones, they don't reveal it. It's now been a week since the new phone arrived, and all is well so far. I'll just have my wife keep it away from the swimming pool and wait until my Cingular contract is up so I can get another NEW phone!
Once again it is a RAZR but what woman can't pass up a Satin Pink phone? Well certainly not my better half. She uses this phone for work and it handles just like all RAZRs. It is prone to the occasional loss of power and is sensitive to drops and falls, but otherwise a dependable phone for her everyday needs.
Don't buy from Ace Photo Digital. The sent me a non working phone and they didn't made the refund. The customer service is awfull and they lied to me.
I was so excited to get my new Satin Pink RAZR V3...only to be let down.  This phone wasn't even close to the color shown here.  Doing some looking around and my phone looked more like the Mauve colored RAZR.  Plus it's put together very shotty!  Looks like a cheap knock off!  Also, I couldn't hear anyone I talked to...they could hear me, but I couldn't hear them.  This phone also came to me, not from AMAZON, but from a company called ACE DIGITAL.  I phoned them tell them about my problem...they said they are going to reimburse me everything I paid for the phone, including the shipping and handling charge, once they receive it back...I'll keep you posted on how that goes.  I'm hesitant to buy another phone here...I'm afraid I'll be out money again, that I'd be waiting to get reimbursed.
The phone should come in with satin pink color for the cover.  However, this phone has 4 different pink tones for different cover panels and the tone differences are so obvious.  This made me feel that this is a phone which did not pass quality control from the original factory.  The battery and charger are terrible. The original charger had 2 round legs for probably an Asian outlet and it came with a crooked adapter to convert it for the US outlet.  In addition, the battery is constantly drained, if the receiving signal was not strong enough (compared to my Sony phone using the same SIM card).  I have to recharge the unit every night even when the battery indicator is full  --- since you never know when this thing will drained suddently.  The cord for the ear phone is too short --- when I use it in my car, I have to put the phone on my lap.  The ear phone quality is really bad and its operation is not as straight forward (handled by a single hand) as the Sony phone.  Plus, the line is so easy to fall out of the phone to cut off the conversation.  I no longer feel comfortable to use the ear  phone while I am driving.  This phone does not come with a manufacture warrantee, strange!  Unfortunately, I did not have time to deal with all the problems in a timing manor after I received this phone.  Otherwise, I would have returned it.The only good feature is the camera.
I am extremely annoying and nuisance with the I articulate that they sent me. This cellular telephone is used and this damaged one. I need a prompt answer for solutions this problem and all the inconveniences that have caused me.Thank you!
Overall: Great phone with good organizer features and messaging. Excellent form factor and innovative keyboard is very easy to use. Build quality seems very good, although the first one I received had a "Back" button that did not work, a manufacturing flaw. The replacement arrived overnight and is fine.Pros- Excellent call quality. First and foremost, the M600 works very well as a phone. I am on T-Mobile.- NO CAMERA. This was a primary factor for me, as I cannot have a camera phone at work.- Great form factor. Unlike a lot of Pocket PC phones, this one is small enough to carry easily.- Multiple input methods. You can use the "rocker" keyboard, which works great, the pop up virtual keyboard, or character recognition. I think that only Sony-Ericsson is still doing character recognition - you simply write on the screen with the stylus and the program types the letters. Way cool. What is a "rocker" keyboard? Well, it's not anything to do with rock-and-roll! Each key has two letters on it, and you push one side or the other to get that particular letter. An "ALT" key supports alternate letters above the normal ones. It is very fast once one becomes accustomed to the letter positions.- Cool interface. Obviously, the UIQ 3 operating system takes some getting used to, especially after a Pocket PC device. But it looks good and works well. Be prepared for a learning curve. For example, dialing a number is as easy and pushing the numbers - there is not phone "application" such as one finds in the Pocket PC Phone world. However, this is only possible one the main "Standby" screen. In general, this device seems more "thought out" and "integrated" than a PPC. Consider it more of a MAC than a PC.- Excellent support. Sony Ericsson has a way to send a text message to configure the internet options on the phone. Very painless. It was equally simple to update to the latest firmware. If you get this phone, be sure and get the latest firmware - it allows one to eliminate menu animation, which makes the OS much faster at rendering the menu screens.- Great battery life. I get 2  to 3 days of normal use. My old PPC got two days at best.- Support for Java programs.- Touch screen, which is unusual in a smart phone. Only some games support this feature, but I found a great bowling and pool application that work with the stylus.- The included games are pretty good, especially the Golf game.- Includes programs to view and (sometimes) edit Word, Excel, and Powerpoint documents, as well as a PDF reader. The feature set is somewhat limited in Excel, and I actually had to change some formulas in one of my spreadsheets in order to get it to edit on the device. It definitely won't do any database statistical functions. If the Excel reader doesn't support any of the formulae in the spreadsheet, it only opens in a "viewer" mode, with no editing possible. For those with a need for complex Excel or Word documents, there is no better device than a PPC - naturally, since MS makes Windows Mobile 5 and MS Office. But the included programs work well enough. There is also a $50 program called "Documents to Go" that has better support, including database Excel functions. I ended up forking over the bucks for this program, and it has been worth the money.- Includes support for "push" email (like a Blackberry). I do not use the phone for corporate purposes, so I haven't used this feature. It is a separate program that has to be installed.- Supports POP, IMAP, and SMTP authentication. The inbox will store message headers forever until they are deleted from the server. Once they are deleted on the server (typically by your PC email program), the next time the M600 synchronizes email it will remove the headers. If you download a message there is an option to "delete locally", which deletes the body - but still leaves the header. If you delete the header, it deletes the email on the server. This takes some getting used to. You can schedule periodic automatic email checks separately for each inbox.- Supports both text messages and Multimedia Messaging (MMS).- Supports a 2 Mb Memory Stick Micro card, to store plenty of data or music. The card is hot-swappable, on the outside of the phone.- Integrated video and music player, plus software to transfer songs to the phone. Supports DRM (which can be considered either good or bad).- Includes backup software to allow one to back up the phones memory to the PC.- The phone will optionally charge from a USB cable if desired. I prefer to let the battery get to around 20% and then power the phone off and fully charge the battery. It charges very rapidly - around 1 hour or so. A wall charger (European with American adaptor) is included.- UMTS (high speed internet). This is a 2700 Mhz band used for high speed data in Europe only. BE SURE TO TURN OFF SEARCH FOR UMTS IF YOU ARE IN AMERICA - the UMTS search eats up a lot of battery. The phone can be set to only search for GPRS, which is the slower protocol.- Includes Bluetooth support, including handsfree. The handsfree works VERY well.- Contacts can be added to one of nine quick dial buttons, and each contact can have multiple phone numbers and a photograph assigned, plus Email addresses and (in general) just about anything else that MS Outlook supports. Ringtones can be added from MP3 files stored on the phone.- Voice dialing and answering is fully supported, only in handsfree mode.Cons- Tri band. This phone does not support the 850 Mhz frequency used by Cingular (AT&T;). It works fine on the T-Mobile bands. However coverage will be best around interstates and large cities. Some people prefer the "Quad Band" phones, which will roam on more networks here in the US.- No WiFi capabilities.- NO CAMERA. I know, I already listed this as a "Pro" item, but many people want a camera on their phone. Not on this model! However, the upcoming Sony Ericsson P1 is the same form factor as this phone and includes both a camera and WiFi.- No EDGE support - only GPRS, which is slower. Think of it as a 28 baud modem, and that is the correct speed. However, WAP sites load fast enough using the built in browser, which loads smaller pictures of websites by default.- The voice dialing does not include "character recognition". This means that one has to go into each phone number and record the contact information exactly as one will say it to do hands-free dialing. Be aware that voice dialing only works with either the corded or BT handsfree attached.- No profiles. Most devices have (at least) built in profiles, or customizable profiles. Thus one could set the phone to "handsfree profile", and automatically turn on the BT, etc. This phone doesn't have this feature.- Unable to customize the main screen. In the M600 this is the "standby" screen, and the  only thing that can be customized is how much of the calendar and messaging one wants to display. One can change the five icons across the bottom, but that is it. Coming from the  PPC world of Windows Mobile 5, where the entire "today" screen can be optimized, this is a bit of a disappointment. No "plug-ins" allowed!- Relatively low memory. I have not run out of memory yet, but I am careful to close all applications after I use them. Like the PPC, this device will leave programs in memory, not actually close them. However, it is much simpler to close the programs than on the PPC. The device really should have come with 128 mb, like most of the competition.  Note again that the new P1 will have 128 mb of memory.- The included web browser (opera mini) basically uses up the entire memory of the device.- The device can occasionally lock up. I have had this happen while adding voice dialing to the contacts, and once when I tried to make a call while the phone was just finished with another call. In each case I recovered by turning the power off and on. It has only happened three times, which is way better than my old WM 5 PPC phone, which locked up and misbehaved all the time.- VERY tight battery cover. OK, this is a bit picky, and I know they are trying to get good tolerances in their construction, but the battery cover took a LOT of pressure to get off. I finally found that if you hold the phone upside down and use the right thumb at the base and the left thumb at the top of the battery cover, the cover can be removed - but it is still difficult. If you plan to switch batteries a lot, you might keep this in mind.- The SIM card fits under the battery cover, and is nearly impossible to get out without tweezers. This isn't too big an issue, since 1) you can't remove the battery cover anyway [little humor there], and 2) you seldom switch SIM cards anyway.- I synchronize my calendar with Outlook XP, and I found that my repeating annual appointments will duplicate in the phone and in Outlook if I connect the phone to the computer while Outlook is already running. So I have to be sure to close Outlook before connecting the phone. I had about 10 copies of everyone's birthday when I realized what was happening. Deleting them was, to say the least, very interesting. I ended up deleting a couple of birthdays entirely and re-entering them.Summary:If you are tired of large devices and MS nonsense, this phone is for you. You have to get to know the OS, and the whole point is that it ISN'T that customizable - but it is stable and dependable.
Well, I selected this phone after buying my wife a 910i last Christmas and seeing how good it was, decided to drag myself in to the 21st century :)I wanted something a little smaller (previously had a T39m) and this unit is great, and suits my work profile as I cannot visit Customer sites with a Camera phone - this phone does NOT have one, and that's just what I need.Bought from Amazon and it DOES come with a QWERTY keyboard - so ignore the reviewer above who, unfortunately got a QWERTZ layout - (begs the question why not return it?).Anyway, I'm more than happy with it - it's a phone, organizer,web browser and email tool, all in one. Bluetooth and IR are extras I've not used yet - may get a headset sometime though.I use T-Mobile service, and for the $5.99 extra for T-Zones Web, you get access to email, and the FULL internet. Ok it's not blazing fast access like DSL or something... but good for quick web access when out and about. It has the Opera browser built in, and works very well.As it's tri-band (with one band being 900Mhz) I think it's limited to GSM services from T-Mobile, Cingular - now AT&T; -, Maybe Verizon?, and some of the Canadian carriers. Check your service carrier for compatibility, some use 850Mhz in the US.The touchscreen is easy to use. and the keys (whilst small) work really well. In fact I use these more than the stylus, though for web browsing you really use a combination of them both.The display is bright an crisp and really bright indoors (which you can control), though outside in bright sunlight the display tends to "washout" a little.One little "issue" to date, is that the updated synchronisation software from Sony Ericsson (v1.2.15) seems to blow away my laptop on occasion when removing the phone from an external CDS-60 cradle... That's the only reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars from me.
I have been using this phone for over a year now.  I love it. I usually keep it in my front pocket with change and whatever else happens to be in there and after a year it doesn't have as single mark or scratch on it. I'm amazed.  It looks as new as the day I bought it.  Beyond its duribility its funtionality seems to be just as durable. I haven;t had a single issue with it.  Its easy to use, has eveything I need, and has been very reliable.  Some of the issues pointed out in previous views, like not being able to define multiple profiles or customise the main screen, lock up issues, etc have been addressed with new firmware releases.  And I have been able to run Blackberry Connect on it with great success to use it for my company email enterprise server and also push personal POP3 email out to it.  Even my companies security policy changes recently pushed to all BB users were not a problem.  I have nothing but good things to say, and I am very anal and super picky.  Being a technophile i certainly puch all its features to their full extremes too.  Best of all I have yet to come across anybody else with one in daily travels.  So, wait...ignore this review and please don't buy one ;)
I bought this phone thinking about another sonny ericsson I had couple years ago. There is nothing related to that one. Seems like this phone comes from another brand. Instead of improving they made it worst.The features that come with this phone, don't work properly, but how did I was going to know it until trying to use each of them with time?The instruction manual is incomplete.It took me years to load music to it. The memory is small and it is not explained that it comes with one of this tiny memories that is great enough for two or three songs. After buying the 2G memory ($20 extra)I only could record music directy from an original disc... another of sony's great ideas. The music that was already in my computer marks error, can't be copied.The phone sounds good and can be listened as a small radio.The support page never offers real solutions either.What I like is the big screen. I will hardly go back with a phone with a smaller screen.A shame it doesn't have camera, but stiil it won't work properly for sure... I just give it two and a half stars as it works pretty mediocre.
If your looking for a very stylish and a great smart phone this is the one to get.  I got it as a gift and once I got it in my hands and used it for a while I wanted to get one for my self.  I recommend getting your hands on one of these amazing smart phones before they are gone.
I am not as technical as the previous reviwer, but this phone has most of the features need in a smart phone. Purchased this in India. I am on Cingular (AT&T;). Works well in my area. Did not work in parts of IL as this a triband device. Yet to figure out how to configure e-mail through cingular service. Did not freeze up on me like it did for earlier reviwers. Great phone overall. BTW, the keyboard in QWERTY & not QWERTZ as somebody mentioned earlier.
Synchronizing with MS Outlook is a breeze....was able to transfer all my data.You can use the jog dial, the stylus or your fingers to navigate thru themenu, what has amazed me is that you can set up your email, internet connection, mms, 3G thru the internet....without going to the reseller to set it up for you.So far I am very happy with this phone.
The M600i is truly an intriguing device with its unique qwerty keyboard layout and clean design. After purchasing my Sony Cybershot DSC-T50 I figured why would I need a camera phone, so I ordered the M600i and tested it out upon arrival. A Sony phone with a Sony camera...you'd think that would be a perfect combination to rival peanut butter and jelly or chicken and waffles! :)I returned it via UPS after one day.Doing away with the camera was no issue, for I had only planned to use it as my PDA and word processor for my poetry and blog entries. Interface-wise it reflects the p990 in every way from the touchscreen navigation to the colorful display with a slightly smaller screen. Unfortunately this reflection of the p990 is what starts to get this thing in trouble.If you read my review on the p990 you will see two HUGE cons that I screamed bloody murder over: no Apple iSync support and slow Quickoffice Word firmware. The M600i has these same issues and also brings another one to the table of its very own: its qwerty keyboard.  As interesting as this keyboard is with two letters per button, it just did not work for me. Even though both the M600 and p990 have small buttons, I guess it was psychologically easier for me to use the p990 with each letter having its own key.Another issue is build quality. Compared to the p990 and my current Nokia E61i the M600 comes across as a toy, not a smartphone. This phone may be a good alternative to Bond girls, but I don't think I'll be running around in an evening gown in Casino Royale part 2 anytime soon (even then I would have my Nokia instead). :)
I love this phone. I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one. My original one was a free upgrade but after two weeks I was willing to spend £100 on a replacement. I liked it that much.I've now had my PEBL for over six months. I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with. Despite the poor quality of photos I still give it 5 stars because I think it's that good. It won't suit everyone but that's why there are hundreds of different models of phone out there!
I really am happy with this phone overall. The pros: great color, it's not a RAZR so not everyone has one, I like how it opens up, looks great, works great. The cons: slightly bulkier than I'd like it to be, because it's an unlocked forgeign phone, some of the spelling of words are different than what we Americans are used to. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone who wants something that works like a RAZR, functions like one, but just doesn't look like one. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. I am on a Cingular network plan, and it works just fine.
I give it four stars because it's a good phone but, you can get this same phone from the motorola website (yes, it too is unlocked) for $165.99! It's a real good phone, but why spend money that you don't have to?
I love this phone! It is really cute and it works better than any other phone i have ever had. It is very clear and even the people I call tell me they can hear me clearer than they can hear most people!
just get an unlocked phone at motorola site FOR 139.00. RIP OFF
As another reviewer noted, the listed description of this phone is wrong, read down to the detailed specs and you will see. It is not 850mhz compatible, actually it is 900mhz, so it will not work with AT&T; in North America. For that, you'll need to go with the Nokia 6120 or 6300, which are similar in features and do actually offer 850/1900mhz.
It's not a 850/1800/1900 as amazon says .. It is 900/1800/1900 .I alredy sent an e-mail to costumer service . But they didn't change yet . And probably never will .
That`s the key word "unlocked". I bought one for my friend who lives in China.And he just put his Chinese SIM card in and use this phone directly instead of recode or renew the core for Chinese display and input.About this phone , it`s cool.
Ok, this is not the best phone in history, but I consider it to be one of my personal favorites. It is so for two main reasons: for one, no one and I mean no one that has used this phone (even just once) forgets how perfect the keys are to use and touch. Very well designed and as mentioned in another review, navigation and text messaging with these keys is wonderful. The second reason is that the system in itself is pretty quick (access from one folder to another, opening apps, loading sms, etc), unlike most nokia models which are constantly criticized for carrying symbian software that is too slow. The camera is just a plus, it's nothing special, there is no flash and the only way to appreciate the 2 megapixels of the camera is to take a picture in conditions with plenty, and I mean plenty, of sunlight, otherwise the quality of the photos are pretty average.
Whether it's for business or pleasure, the Nokia 6233 phone gives you the best of both worlds. Get quick access to important information via mobile broadband while listening to your favorite music files through stereo and 3D surround sound speakers. Write letters on the go to colleagues or friends with the enhanced Java email client. Connect easily over-the-air to your office or home PC to share or move information to and from your phone.Whether you're taking 2-megapixel quality pictures while on vacation, or sending your boss video excerpts of your last client meeting, the Nokia 6233 phone bridges the gap between business and pleasure in modern mobile phones.Nokia 6230 is actually new generation phone built in Series 40 platform; it has a lot of new features:-  Nokia 6230 is a very compact and stylish cell phone.  -  Color display (65,536 colors, 128 x 128 pixels)- Nokia 6230 has 6 Mb of memory.- Integrated digital camera (640 x 480 resolution)- Video recorder and player (record up to 2 MB - FM-Radio, you can just listen to it, or use it as alarm.-  Speed dialing & voice dialing,-  Voice recorder.-  Built-in stereo FM radio.-  Music player for MP3.- Calendar.
If you are looking for a PHONE, not a camera or an ipod then this is it! I had an older flip phone from Sprint for years and loved it, then it finally broke! We ended up getting the fancy Samsung M620 Upstage Black Phone. Really neat fancy phone. It has all the bells and whistles and very pretty, but NOT user friendly!! I have an ipod already and just wanted a simple to use phone. This is VERY user friendly. The camera doesn't take high quality pix but it shouldn't because it is a phone.... I have a good camera and an ipod so this is perfect for me. It has voice recognition & I can answer the phone or make phone calls without opening up the phone. You can control the type of rings or how loud you want them for different callers. VERY USER FRIENDLY and sounds great!
PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone!
I have had this phone for over a year and a half, I've had to have it replaced twice already.  The first time the outer display stopped working.  All three of the phones do this thing where the phone crashes out of nowhere, which gets really annoying when I'm in the middle of writing a text  message.  Also, the camera button is on the outside, where it takes pictures  by itself, usually in my pocket.  Sometimes I can't hear the person on the other side, or they can't hear me.  This phone has way too many issues.  On the bright side, the operating system is easy to use.  Also the timer is cool and so is the fact that you can set multiple alarms.  The settings are preset so you cannot set them up on your own.  The phone overall just has way too many problems though.
i think that it is a good phone for young kids. It is not complicated, and the camera is pretty good. Its simple and attractive, and good for new buyers. overall a good phone
I bought one for myself and liked it so much that I bought one for a friend. He is very pleased.
The screen is tiny, like an ipod nano screen on its side. The camera viewfinder is barely visible because it is 4:3 ratio and it is like an inch from corner to corner. The ringtones are cheesy and my motorola E815 is so much better. the camera is only VGA (.3 megapixels) versus 1.3 on the E815.Its a good looking average phone though. I do warn you that it's not Black and grey its light blue and a little bit darker than navy blue.______________\\  //Peace out____,,,\\//____________\\\--_-\____________\___\\/
The phone has gotten a lot of hits for battery life. I had the phone run down quickly once and quickly realized that if you close the phone on a select few functions it doesnt turn off the screen. It maybe a slight knock on the phone but if you simply look at it you can tell if the screen is on or not. If it is just reopen it and close it and the screen will turn off. As far as the phone itself it has a few games a few ringtones and a few images. You can buy more, but frankly I dont care. You can set it to vibrate or to vibrate and have a ringtone. It has plenty of functions for a inexpensive phone, such as web access, texting, speakerphone. The best part of the phone however is the quality of the calls, my relatives have these ridiculously expensive phones with cameras and doo-dads and they sound like you're talking inside a toilet. This little cheap phone has 5x better sound quality than theirs. This is the little phone that can and I love it.
I brought 2 Oyster recently. I have no problem with the batteries. You need to set the backlight to 7 secs. This way the battery will keep its charge longer. A charged battery can remain  on standby for almost a week.As an previous poster noted, it was the older models of the Oyster that had a battery problem. If you can get good Sprint service, then Virgin Mobile will work for you.I was lucky that I got 2 phones for free after the rebates. There is no charge to activate the phone. You get 15 min or so of free time. If youfind that service is  bad in your area, then you don't have to pay anymore.
I'm here to say that I swore I would never get a flip phone, why you ask, because I like to be different, but I had a tf that wasn't a flip and loved it until I started having trouble with it. The ringtones on my tf were nice, tf just recently has ringtones that you can downloaded.  Well a friend of mine convinced me to try VM he has had his phone over two years and loves it. So I checked out the site and picked the Kyocera Oystr Prepaid phone. I love it and really its not bad for a flip. The only things I wasn't to keen on were the screensavers and the wallpaper that they had, I downloaded more wallpaper that I liked and I just don't bother with the screensavers. I downloaded two ringtones that I liked, that I found on the site. I would recommend this phone for anyone wanting to purchase a flip phone for the first time. Its easy to learn and not to complicated. The only downfall of this phone is the battery life. Will be glad withn VM can fix that, I only have mine as a necessity and emergencies.
Ok so for those of you who are upset about the gadgets not being advanced enough...... come on, it's $20!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You get a great bargain for the price, if you want to upgrade, the next phone is $50 and up! This phone is being discontinued according to Best Buy, so if you're debating GET IT NOW AS THERE'S ONLY A FEW LEFT IN STOCK AND WILL NOT BE COMING BACK. Just keep your charger handy and or take the suggestion from a customer on here and adjust your settings. I bought this phone for my sister who will be entering college in a couple of weeks, the service is a Sprint line, and the free nights and weekends are the best! Paired with a $20 prepaid phone card, this is a great gift below $50!!
Ok. The actual phone is awesome. I love all the features, its small, its pretty. The phone is good. The service sucks. When I bought the phone, it said service is available in my area. Not so. I have walked all over this town and cannot send or recieve calls and texts ANYWHERE. I have been wrestling for customer service for days now. Unless you live in a huge city with a lot of cell phone towers, do not get this phone. It won't work for you.
I have had this phone for several months now. It has decent battery life (not bad as other reviews claim), good signal strength, and it is very cheap! What else do you want?If you are looking for a low-end cell-phone, this is it.
It is my first cell phone EVER (I thought I'd NEVER catch on to them!) and I LOVE(D) it. Then.It (did) everything I needed, which was only the basics.It's a pearly white, and the cover feels awesome. It's not slick, however. Like many phones.You can text message, and call people, and all that.But the things I HATE about this phone are showing up now. And just so you know, this review was 4 star-rated and relatively positive. But now it's time to edit and show you the problems I've had thus far:I think a good place to start would be the ring tones:The default ones are somewhat annoying, and the ones I've tried to put on my cell NEVER worked!!! Take this as an example. I love Keyshia Cole, Mariah Carey, Vanessa Carlton, John Mayer, Incubus, Nelly Furtado and Kelly Clarkson. About half of these artists I've tried to put onto my phone through free services.Those DON'T work! Almost any offering where you can get ring tones, it's always Sprint, Verizon, AT&T;, Cell One, Boost and T-Mobile but NEVER Virgin. No. Instead, we must suffer, or buy the LATEST ring tones (which some of them I abhor). >_<The other option I had was to get some DIRECTLY from the artist, if I bought one of their CDs. I've tried a few times to get 2 of Vanessa Carlton's ring tones from her 2007 album. I definitely sent the text and got no response. I've gotten ONE response when I tried to get a Keyshia Cole ring tone and followed the directions to find out this silly phone isn't compatible.Ugh. I'm an avid music fan and I just couldn't understand why it doesn't allow other ring tones to be applied. So that let me down SO much. But in college I wasn't really concerned with that stuff. I just needed it to keep in touch with my ride home and to call a few people every now and then. No texting whatsoever. That didn't hit me till later!But I was glad that you had the option of buying the Virgin time cards almost anywhere instead of one of those expensive service plans!! And I hear it's a HUGE mistake ordering them from amazon! A lot of people have been complaining that the phone cards here expire about a month after you get it or have ALREADY expired by the time you get it! So, so wrong.Although it's been there for me there are many problems such as while it's charging (and on) you can't turn it off without unplugging it first. Tell me why that is? I'm sure other cell phones aren't like that!2.75 stars (is my final rating, weighing the good and bad).Edit: recently i just tried turning it off while charging, and it went blank. also, like i said the only time that i successfully downloaded a ring tone was through the phone itself (from Virgin). it does its job mostly, but surely other phones do it better (and with less trouble)!
Bought two phones for me and companion as a Christmas gift.....excellent price..good features......etc etc!!! Now the LCD screen is totally blank!!! I can make and receive calls......but......what the heck???Oh yes......i can bring back to the dealer and wait God knows how long to get it back!!! Why bother??? I'll just let my TOP-UP time expire.....and so long VM/KIOCERA!!!
I bought an unlocked SLVR L7 Pink phone and it is really great. My son liked it so much he bought a black SLVR L7. I really don't have any complaints other than my Phone service doesn't support the phone at this time and I can't get any downloads, but that doesn't have anything to do with the phone itself.
I just wanted to let people know that they don't have to worry about porting their number when purchasing new service with Cingular through Amazon.  I was a little concerned about how smoothly this would go, given the mixed reviews, but it only took a couple hours.  However, I am only giving 4 stars because the pink phone is a bit brighter than is depicted in the picture.  Also, does anyone know how I can set my phone so that it does not roll over to voicemail so quickly when someone calls?  I have not been able to find any settings for this, either on the phone, or through the voicemail feature.  All in all though, I am enjoying my new phone!
I bought this phone in Nov/Dec. 2006 and have enjoyed it quite a bit.Granted, I don't use the iTunes and special features all that much, but for what I use, it's good.It fits easily into a jacket pocket or the pocket of a purse, which is nice.  However, I do have to set it to vibrate *and* ring when it's tucked away or else I won't hear it in the store or another location with background noise.  If it's out on a countertop or in my hand, it's plenty loud.The buttons/keys are rather tiny and I have to use my fingernail to press them usually.  A little aggrivating sometimes, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  Most people who complain about reception are probably dealing with a faulty phone or are not giving proper (dis-)credit to their service provider.  I've never had reception problems with this phone.I also found a good scratch-resistant screen protector on amazon (by Eforcity) for under $2 that fits this screen perfectly.  You can't even see it.
I was strongly cautioned not the buy either a RAZR or SLVR, so I did research to find a phone that would best suit my needs AND be something cute and attractive (if I am keeping it for two years, this is a must!).  I fell in love with the look of the SLVR but I still felt like I needed to look into it and compare with other phones.  I read all of the reviews, good, bad and ugly and decided, for my needs, this was the phone for me.So far, this has been a great choice!  The phone itself is very attractive and I was able to find a case specifically made for the L7's that enhanced this even more, instead of hiding it behind some bulky material.  I have no problems with the reception and can always hear clearly and be heard clearly.The biggest disappointment I had was that I couldn't figure out how to assign individual ringtones and assumed this this was not an option of the phone rather than being the outcome of the ill-informed user that I was.  Reading other reviews showed that this was a disappointment for other users as well.  WE WERE WRONG!  My best advice: READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL!  But to sum it up, to get an individual ringtone, a number has to be saved to the phone rather than the SIM card.  So this is no longer a disappointment for me.For those of you who get this phone through Cingular/AT&T;, the phone comes with a memory card (nice bonus!) and I was able to find another micro memory card with more storage and 2 micro card adaptors (to fit the micro in other memory card slots) for just over $13 on Amazon.  I do not use the iTUNES feature (as of yet) but have put music on my card and played it through the "my sounds" function, which has worked great for me.I have seen complaints about the keypad and have found them, for myself, to be unfounded.  I have no problems with them.  However, I do not text a lot, but when I have, the functions have been easy to use and unconfusing.The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the quality of the camera.  Pictures are a little blurry and dark.  Since this is not my primary sourse of photos, this is not a huge disappointment for me.For my use, this phone is fantastic, but bear in mind that I am pretty easy on my cell phones, with a little less than an average amount of use.  It's got all the fun features and bells and whistles I wanted to have a little fun with my phone, but works great in it's most basic form as well!
I love the SLVR phone. I have not had any major problems with it at all.The only complaint is that I cannot assign specific speed dial numbers to certain numbers.The itunes function will only allow 100 songs on your phone, no matter how big your card is. However, I love the itunes function on the phone because I can just play it whenever I like (it is great to use when waiting for the bus).You need to use a San Disk micro sd card with the phone though, I tried to use a kingston micro sd card and the phone would not recognize it.The buttons, menus, and programs are easy to use with the phone. I would recommend that if the phone is in your purse or pocket, you lock the keyboard often because the number pad is very sensitive to touch.The phone is durable, I have dropped it several times and it still kept on working.If you are looking for a slim phone to play music text, and surf the internet once in a while, it is a great choice among phones.
I recently ordered this phone through amazon and I must say I love it!! It is everything I wanted in a phone and more. To me its the best of both worlds, the pretty pink exterior is just my style, the itunes is so easy to use, and it is very practical to use as an everyday phone. I just love it!!
The phone only has the basic functions - but that's what I need the phone for. To talk.Camera sucks, no extras...On the other hand it is really tiny and has a fine reception.
i absolutly love this phone i just got this phone today i got the pay as you go one.PROS:$nice and small$camera has cool features: sepia,b&w;, line drawing, solarization, negative, embossing and it has flash too and you can take multiple pictures at a time and you can put a timer on$can take pictures with camera open or closed$its very cute$has IM and caller id and stuff like thatCONS:%sometimes the buttons are a bit too small but its easy to get used to and you find ways to get arounf that.%NOTHING ELSE YETT and hopefully nothing else.i would recomend this phone.but not if you are a giant..or close too one.
The phone is really small, good for small purses or pockets. I love the flashlight I use it all the time.  The camera is awful, takes ugly photos. It is very loud, good for my loud home and in other loud places.  overall it works as a phone and a flashlight...but don't get it if you want good pics.
I have to use my phone as an alarm for school. Works normally, except when it just decides that I don't need to go to class. The alarm never goes off sometimes. Other than that I love the phone. Just beware.
If your main reason for using a cell phone is to make phone calls and crystal clear reception is a priority for you, then this is definitely the right phone for you. My wife and I both made separate trips to the local Verizon store, and we tested this phone against the LG VX8300 and the 8600 and the Motorola RAZRs and KRZRs. Yes, the other phones all look cooler and have better cameras and more features in general; however, the Nokia 6215i phone was much, much clearer and had less static than any of the other phones. The calls sounded better on both ends:  for the Nokia cell phone caller and for the person who received the call. We called both landline numbers and other cell phones, and tested each phone one after the other and multiple times during our visits to the Verizon store.We spent an inordinate amount of time on this process because we did not want to get stuck with bad service and phones ever again. We have been miserable customers of Cingular for 3+ years now, and we are in fact expending $600 to break our family plan contract with them 6 months early. It is completely pointless to have a cell phone if the reception for your calls is so poor most of the time that you can't even carry on a conversation. I could not make calls from my Cingular phone from my office in downtown Arlington, VA despite the fact that everyone in the offices around me had no problems making calls with other carriers. I could not make phone calls from the Convention Center in Boston despite the fact that everyone around me was merrily chatting on their cell phones, etc., etc., etc.I am sharing this experience in hopes of saving others a lot of time, aggravation and expense. If we had ordered our Nokias one day earlier from Verizon, we would have gotten the phones for free and paid no activation fee. Unfortunately, they changed their online offers overnight and we were out an additional $220 as a result.
I upgraded to this phone primarily on the opinion of a the c-net review which said this phone had such good voice quality that it was indistinguishable from a land-line (San Francisco), and reviewer (VA) who said this phone had the "best voice quality" -- since i was having trouble hearing on my previous phone, especially in mobile-to-mobile calls.  Perhaps it is the area I am in (north Jersey), but I sure can tell I'm on a cell phone!  While better than my previous model, I'm still saying "what? could you repeat that?"  In calling Verizon Wireless to ask another question, the technical supervisor just told me "the voice quality and even reception ability varies a lot from individual phone to phone within every model: we can get 5 phones of the same model and line them up and each one sounds different and right next to each other they'll display different signal strengths..."  Wish I'd known THAT before I bought!I like this phone's features, and since Verizon has it on promotion, it's a great deal right now.  It has more "conveniences" than I'll really use.  It doesn't have bluetooth for hands-free, but that's OK with me.My biggest complaint is that the LED display (it's not an LCD but new LED display) is completely unreadable in daylight.  Also you must use some kind of cover: the battery comes unclipped with the slightest of touches on the clasp such as pulling the phone out of a pocket or purse.  I find the more "rounded" shape phones a little easier to hold than this "squared" shape, and it's easy to press on the exterior screen or the buttons on the side when holding the phone closer to the ear when trying to hear better in a noisy or outdoor environment.
This is my first cell phone that I got with the Verizon Wireless plan and I am quite impressed. I really like the sleek glossy look that goes around the phone. Suprisingly enough after 7 months of use it doesn't have any major scratches on its surface.I have NEVER lost a call or had no service wherever I have gone while using this phone. It is amazing since I always used to have a terrible time trying to find a spot where my older phones would get one bar of service.I do have a complaint though, the screen on the inside of the phone is tiny. If your eyes are bad then I would recommend a phone with a larger screen. Other than that I praise this phone, especially since I didn't have to pay anything for it with my plan.
I just bought this phone from verizon as a replacement for my 6256i which rocked to high heaven.  I bought this partially because of the glowing reviews in this area and especially for the signal reception reports.I find this phone to be poor in reception compared to my 6256i. It takes a couple of bars of signal to even boot where my 6256 was booting with not even a bar. The camera is crap but I knew that in advance.  The buttons are way too close together and cause lots of screwed up sequences of button pushing. The clarity of reception I don't see. My mother who is a little hard of hearing can't understand me with this phone but had no problem with the 6256. The front display is tiny but the clock is large and readable. The inside display is small and made smaller with the banners up top and bottom with another banner added whenever voice or data mail is received. The colors are very vivid however. The available memory is VERY small...I can't believe they made a phone without more on-board memory.I'm getting another replacement sent since it will not perform some of the advanced functions due to it's inability to get a programming update via the *228 function.  If the reception is the same on the next phone and the clarity is not understandable by my mother, I'm swaping for another phone.
The Nokia 6215i may be an entry level phone -- one of those that are given away with contracts -- but does the job more than adequately.  The reception is excellent, which to me is the most important feature.  The phone does have an extendable antenna, which might seem out-of-style, but reception remained quite good without extension.The camera is very average, but as far as I am concerned, the phone camera is just for taking quick pictures to show your friends where you are, something funny, etc.  If I want something I can print and frame, I'll still use my regular camera.  There is a flash, which has come in handy.The most unique part of the phone, however, is the screen.  Though small, the screens are made with new OLED technology, which is extremely bright with terrific contrast in average lighting.  On a traditional LCD screen, there is a large backlight that sends light through every pixel, and each pixel is like a little nightshade.  To make a dark point, the screen pulls the nightshade to block as much of the backlight as possible.  But the pixels can't block 100% of the light; a little bit always leaks through, especially if you look from other angles.  A good analogy is a window blind -- never perfect at blocking all of the sun, and if you look at it from different angles, you get more or less light through.On an OLED screen, each pixel is like a tiny little light bulb, which can turn on and off independently of one another.  When they are off, they are completely off, which gives the screen its amazing contrast.  It also looks identically sharp regardless of your viewing angle.Unfortunately, it is COMPLETELY invisible in bright sunlight, even more so than most cellphone screens.  This is also because of the fact that each pixel generates light directly rather than blocking it.  Even though the light generated by an OLED is impressive, it is no match for the sun, and gets washed out completely.  On the other hand, since an LCD works by blocking light, it is still able to block some of the sunlight to form a visible image, even if it was designed to be illuminated from the back.  The nightshade/light bulb analogy is again appropriate.  In a sunlit room, turning on a light bulb makes a lot less difference compared to pulling the blinds.  So, the OLED is a bit of a double-edged sword.My only other significant quibble is the low memory capacity, with no ability for expansion.  4 MB is just not very much; you won't be able to keep too many pictures or ringtones.Overall, the phone is quite good.  It is small and light, and looks rather sleek.  Most importantly, it makes crystal clear calls with no drops that I can remember.  That would have earned it 5 stars, but the screen problem and limited memory knock it down a notch.
I bought this phone a couple months ago. It looked great online and in person, but I HATE the keys... they are not raised at all and it's difficult to text message. Also, the "OK" button is really small. It's very sleek and pretty- I'll give it that. I like the speaker, it sounds fine, I like that I can take decent pics... I hate the screen saver! Does anyone know how to turn it off? I also dislike the fact that I have to push extra buttons to send a text. My old LG only had about 2 or 3 steps- the Nokia steps have doubled, a bit of a pain. All in all, though, I really like this phone. I'm sure I just need to get used to all the little things. Buttons and all.
My old Motorola 265 is having cut-out problem occasionally so I decide to upgrade to a new phone.  I signed two-year contract and get this phone for free from the Verizon website.  Then my headache started.The new phone looks nice and works nice except the speakphone is not as loud as my Motorola 265.  But since the second day I got this phone, I found I'm having much worse cut-out problem than my old phone.  I had to call Verizon for replacement.  The first replacement only works worse than the original one.  So, replace again.  The second replacement still has the cut-out problem but I have no energy to care about this problem any more --- its speakerphone totally doesn't work!  I need the speakerphone everyday when I chat over the phone with my husband.Verizon is not happy either.  Their CS told me they can not ship me again and again and I don't trust their service any more.  Therefore I brought this phone to the local store.  But the local store can not do exchange for me because my account shows my cell phone has only 3 months warranty(??!!).I'm so tired but I still have to call Verizon.  Today they told me they are going to ship me another model, Motorola V325i.  I checked customer review on Amazon and only to find very bad reviews.  I don't know how the new one will work but I'm just too tired to argue with them any more.From the three Nokia 6215i phones I've got, I can tell that its speakerphone is generally soft (but my current one totally doesn't work).  If a speakerphone feature is important for you, keep away from this model.
I've had this cell phone for 2 days and it is great. Text messaging, phone calls, and the camera work fine. The image on the screen is high quality. Overall, it works great.
A nice phone for basic uses, no frills.  It has a very long battery talk and stand by.  I am very pleased with the audio and the speakerphone function compared to my old Motorola camera flip phone.  Small and compact, fits in to shirt pocket, very light weight.  A very nice phone for the cost.
Nokia N91 is a great phone for people who love music and are always on the go. The dialing features are great and superb quality music. You can put in a lot of songs and enjoy videos on real or flash player. The dialing features are great specially with the voice activated dialing. Texting is also nice but could have been better with a little bigger keypad. The only it lacks is a LED flash which would have served the purpose of taking good pictures in the night along with the 2 megapixel camera, even though it does take great daytime pics. Overall the weight of the phone is reasonable and looks very manly. However i do not know if ladies would like this phone becoz of its weight but lookswise it is very fascinating. Connection is great too even in areas with low signal reception. Overall i would rate this phone to be a nice looking phone with very advanced features that would certainly attract people once you slide the steel keypad cover. I have had many compliments on this phone and am happy to have it.
love it....love it....love it!!! i have nothing bad to say about this phone...it's got everything i need and looks really cool!
Even though I purchased and grew fond of the Nokia E62 and E70, I decided to give this smartphone a try due to my good experience with the SE W810i model.My first impressions on the first couple days were absolutely DISMAL from the numerous crashes that required taking out the battery to cut off the phone. After the 15th crash, I called SE customer service and calmly gave my opinion on the performance of this phone. By suggestion from the operator I downloaded the firmware upgrade from the SE website and must say that all is well.  The technology packed into this phone is amazing, and not mention the eye-catching looks of the silver covering.The ability to input info via the qwerty keypad and the touchscreen/stylus is a HUGE draw for me, a former Palm pda/Treo 680 owner.Accessing WiFi and setting up bluetooth with my MacBook Pro was pretty simple, but synching the address book and calendar is a different story. In lieu of no Mac iSync support I am using a third party software called p990iCal to sync my calendar data and using bluetooth transfers for my address book vcards, and both methods work just fine.Navigating the phone does take some patience and time, but using the manual with good common sense is usually enough to suffice.The bright, crisp screen is relatively large compared to the Nokia E70 and the qwerty keyboard, though small, is a joy to type on with my thumbnails. There is one gripe about typing on this keyboard: I love the support for Quickoffice on the smartphone, for I am addicted to writing on the go with Word. Where the Nokia E70 and E62 shines concerning text processing on the qwerty is where the SE p990i rests on its laurels. The SE cannot keep up with my typing speed whereas the Nokias could without a doubt.  After pressing each button there is a taskbar that pops up at the top of the screen showing the selected character being highlighted and then placed into the document body. This truly slows up the typing process...and if you keep typing as the p990 tries to catch up, it gets lost and inputs jumbled letters. I have disabled the predictive text feature, but that apparently only handles the words and not the individual characters.I have deducted one star for this reason alone.The screen that shows spectacular imagery in clear color cannot be seen at all in outside sunlight, so be aware of using this outdoors.  The photo quality is amazing and the flash is very strong while the video quality is great but not stellar. The media player application plays mpeg4 video files that my Nokias were unable to play, and the music player and FM radio is great as long as you have good headphones(the speaker is in mono). I surely took advantage of the space I had in a 2GB memory stick I had used with my previous W810i model.The task manager is an absolute godsend! Instead if having to go through the menus to access recent apps you can go here and reopen them again! Voice dialing is good but must be programmed for each contact entry which the Nokias did not require at all. Handwriting recognition on the touchscreen appears to be the same as any other Palm device.This is definitely a neat little tech package for those who love gadgets. Downloading the firmware upgrade should alleviate any problems concerning its performance.Update for May 2007:I have long since this review sold my p990 device and returned to Nokia. I am currently using the E61i until my preorder for the E90 Communicator is fulfilled. The p990 was and is still a great device, but just not for my purposes.  This is a real shame, for I will always have a soft spot in my techie heart for touchscreens and styli in navigating that p990. I just couldn't tolerate the inconvenience of no Apple iSync support and a slow Quickoffice Word interface in writing my poetry and blog entries. Nokia has provided reliable stability in both these areas and I plan to remain with them as a loyal customer. The p990 is still a capable device for what it can do, only as long as it is updated to the current firmware and can adequately meet one's needs.
I have owned several different types of phones (Cingular 8125, Cingular 3125, Cingular 2125, Sony 600i) and this has moved to the top of phones that I have used.Pros**Styling: Love the styling of it.  It is a good looking phone that is a little funky but has a nice clean look.**KeyPad and touchscreen: I love having the keypad on the front so that I do not have to type a phone number on the screen.  It is convenient.  Then to be able to flip it open and be able to type in on the screen or with the small keyboard.  Nice.**Syncs with Outlook: I have had few problems having it successfully sync up with Outlook and to have all the contacts for easy access...very nice.**Phone quality: So far so good.  My calls sound good and people tell me that it sounds good when I am tlaking to them.**WiFi: I love it.  It still surprises me that the high end smart phones don't carry t (such as the Palm phones) but this phone does and it works well and is easy to use.**Lock feature: It is a quick slide action on the side to lock the keyboard so you don't accdiently dial.  There is no need to press 2 buttons to unlock as it is just another flick on the side of the phone and it is unlocked.  Easy to use and quick to use and thats appreciated.Cons:**Kinks: Yes, there are some kinks with the software but this is to be kind of expected in that it really is a computer that acts like a phone at times.  But, I haven't had the problems that others appear to have had in regards to slowness, etc.**Camera: Good quality, but it takes a bit to get comfortable in using.**Learning Curve: I have used windows mobile and I have been comfortable using that software as an interface for my phone.  Now switching over to Symbian has taken me a while to get use to icons and functionality.  It is a good operating system from what I have seen, but it has taken me some time.Overall, it has been a terrific phone and I plan on using for it the next year.  Well done Sony.
When i purchased this phone over 6 months ago, I was leary of all the issues that the reviews and comments mentioned. But nonetheless, I purchased it to see how it was for myself. I had a P910i and it paired with my car's Bluetooth flawlessly, but I was extremely bugged that the P990i could not pair up with my Bluetooth on the BMW. But with a couple updates from Sony Ericsson it was fixed.In the beginning there were a few bugs, like the certain softwares on the phone took longer to load (i.e. camera), and if you had a couple programs running together (i.e. music player, camera, web browser) it would have a tendency to freeze up. But the wonderful parts about this phone are that Sony Ericsson's firmware updating team has been doing a great job in keeping this phone up to date and running at it's best, it's features are second to none. (2mp camera - great pictures, Wifi, QWERTY, Sony's music player[MegaBass], PDA, web brower).So don't worry about the other reviews that claim it has bugs, all the majors issues have been ironed out and the phone is running well (with the latest update from SC) It's a great phone, but I only wished that SC made it slight smaller so it wouldn't be so bulky in the pocket.Firmware:Phone: CXC162037 R9G007Bluetooth: CXC162058 R5A01Organizer: CXC162036 R6D23CDA: CDA162007/1 R6D23
When I first heard about the P990i and the specifications, I was really impressed. After I received it, this became less and less. So many bugs and crashes with a cell phone! Incredible! So I waited for the long promised firmware update, everything should be ok then, at least they promised. But this phone is still of minor use. Here are some major reasons why:1. No transflective display, barley to use outdoors in a sunny state like CA!2. Far away from the promised 14 day standby (6 days in best case)!3. Restarts quite often when using it with 3rd party applications!4. Also built in applications do crash sometimes!5. No icon "appointments today"!6. A backup saves only a part of the settings and no third part applications/settings (and even worse: all recorded voice commands are lost)!7. Crashes sometimes during a phone call!8. User buttons can only be defined with a few and different functions, dependent on the button!9. Number keys can only be defined for phone numbers, no additional functionallity like "Bluetooth on/off"!10. Office sync does not work for international phone numbers!11. Have you ever had a phone that takes almost 2 minutes for booting after turning it on???These are only some of many problems this phone still has. After all that trouble I wish I could give it back and buy a working phone from a different vendor. It really seems like this phone and its software was built up in a rush and nobody ever was testing it in real business conditions (leaving the SQA for the stupid customers). This is really poor after all that long development time. I will definitively never buy a SE phone again, the market is full of much better working devices. And it will become even better in June... Good to know that there are at least some companies who really know what counts to keep their well paying customers!
My wife bought this smartphone for me as a present. I love it! And the glitch? Non-existent!However, I didn't feel that way in the beginning. I thought this phone was a waste. For one, it was slow. Additionally, it kept hanging up and crashing. Finally, this darn thing was so complicated.After I downloaded the phone's software on my computer and did an update, it fixed everything. It got rid of the glitch, and this awesome gadget is now operating the way a laptop-slash-phone machine is supposed to be running.Generally, here's what I think about this phone:The GoodWi-Fi - imagine sitting at the airport, reading your RSS feeds, checking your e-mail or your favorite Web site, and talking to your loved one -- all at the same time. And since you have wi-fi capability, your Internet is free. You can't beat that.Picture - this phone allows you to take a picture, crop it, enhance it, save it, and send it to your friends. It's all done in the phone. And since you have a wi-fi, you can upload your newly-taken picture onto your blog and share it with the rest of the world.Multi-media - good video capability, but I haven't tried streaming videos; you can also talk on the phone while viewing pictures or surfing, to name a few.File Manager - it's easy to move files from your your laptop. Basically, go  to the File Manager, click and drag, and you're done. That goes for all the other documents that you want to move or copy to the phone. I tried copying and pasting MP3's, videos, spreadsheets, Word documents, and PDF files, and they turned out just fine.Synchronization - unfortunately, I haven't tried synchronizing with the Outlook.Contacts - you have speed dials, and it's really easy to do a search for one of your contacts.Antenna - I have Cingular, which is now AT&T;, and I don't get a lot of dropped calls. I owned a smaller, regular Sony Ericsson K700i, and that thing kept getting disconnected. Not this one.Screen - it's crisp. Also, you can change from portrait to landscape when surfing, which is nice, too.The BadIt's complicated - you need some time to learn how to operate this phone because the manual and the Website don't tell you everything.Screen Visibility - you can't see what's on your screen under bright conditions. So, when you're taking a walk under the sun and you want to call somebody and you need to search that number, good luck.Speaker - it lacks the "oomph" factor. The company certainly could have done better.Camera - at 2 mp, this is anemic. Heck, smaller, regular phones now pack in 3 mp.Memory - you can only install up to 4-gig memory stick. Why not 8 gigs, like the I-phone?The UglySize - Size doesn't matter, right? Wrong. In this case, bulky is bad. I usually put my phone in my pocket. After a while, it feels like I'm dragging a dead cow.Qwerty Keyboard - it's small, and it's challenging hitting the right letters.Crash and Hang-Ups - you'll experience them with this cell phone, so update it right away to prevent them from happening.
Is the best phone ever! I have more than I need and exceded my expectations by far. The interface is very friendly and the only thing is that with the keyboard close, it limits the phone utilites ánd to acces to other needed stuff, you have to open the lid and the menu appears completed.
I was a big fan of the p900 and really looked forward to getting the 990, sadly the phone is constantly locking and crashing...I have to take out the batteries to rebot.When charging from mains power supply the phone does not allow me to answer incoming calls! very frustrating for such a promising smart phone.. I going to change the sim card to element this as an issue but dont hold out much hope..
This phone is packed with features so we bought it. It turns out the phone freezes very often including on some simple operations.If you don't mind removing the battery and restarting the phone every now and then, this phone is for you. If you want a reliable phone, avoid at all cost.
Pros:- quality camera- it is a comfortable device to hold against your face and talk with, screen is slightly recessed so it does not contact your face and you do not need to continually clean it. Fundamentally it is a good phone.- Flip can be removed if you want a candy bar-style device with QWERTY kb- good accessories bundled including charge/sync dockCons:- no standard 3.5mm headphone jack- uses proprietary expensive, low capacity Memory Sticks :-(- OS and UI slow but not much more so than a 400MHz Windows Mobile device- Complicated and inconsistent menu structure (alleviated by learning hotkeys)- slightly bulkyGive it at least a week before you decide whether to love it or hate it. I hated it at first, now appreciate it as a good phone first with extras whereas some PDA competitors are mainly extras with a mediocre phone tacked on.
Excellent features, It's a real smart phone..Get the mobile, Charge battery FULLY for 4 Hrs., upgrade the firmware, & start using it.... hassle free. I read all the reviews posted on different sites, and had second thought.... .but desided to take a chance, and it was worth. I haven't fased any of the problem since I purchased mobile. This was LOVE at first sight. Excellent, value for Money.
Excellent functionality. This is an upgrade from my previous Sony Ericsson 900 phone. Access to contacts and all information is much faster, the operating system provides much easier use of all features. Camera has much more resolution. Wi-Fi is the main reason I bought this product and it works great.
I am a fan of sony ericsson, I love the cellphones they make I bought the P990 and I regret it, it constantly freezes, turns off on its own, I can't call because when I try is like if I have no service and I do have all signal... So I don't recomend this Item. I believe sony should make something better, the phone looks nice and it is not so big I guess that if sony could fix all the problems it has, wich I believe might be related to software problems It could be a great phone, (I tried everything, I even upgraded the software and It's still the same) In my personal opinion this phone still has a lot of work to be done on it. Sony should have waited longer and tested it a little bit more. To finish this I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PHONE, buy something else instead the W series work, I am using the W300 instead and I have no problems.
This is a great phone, uses international SIM as well as local SIM cards.  The phone works well in East Africa (with local cell phone service as well as the international SIM) and in Europe (international SIM).  Though cheap, it does what it is supposed to do: make calls.  Bonus: alarm, date/time, easy read screen, easy to use, and a contact list to make calls easy.  Great travel phone.
This is a great phone for staying in touch when traveling to just about anywhere. It has a monochrome LED screen that is actually visible in bright sunlight, no camera, no video, no fancy tricks. But it is really great for making old-fashioned phone calls. All you need is a universal SIM card that works in multiple countries, and you can buy that from any of a number service companies that sell pre-paid or post-paid mobile telephone time. I bought one that lets me keep the same international phone number without a periodic charge.
This phone is perfect for the frequent traveler because it doesn't cost very much (if you lose it or have it stolen you're not out of a lot of money), and buying it is way cheaper than renting the same model from a phone rental company.  All you have to do is buy a SIM card when you arrive in the country of destination.  The phone comes with a european connector with a U.S. adapter.  The one I received was blue instead of grey, but lucky for me blue is my favorite color.  I highly recommend this phone for the student or budget traveler.  I never travel out of country without mine.
This cell phone comes with a European connection for 220 current.  It is poorly made and feels very cheap.
I have this phone for 3 months. It is a great phone integrated with all the features that you would like to have. - GPS+WiFi+GSM+Blue tooth. I don't regret buying this phone. I does its job without any problem.  Even with all these features, I feel like this phone is not for me. This would be a great one for business. But I feel it is a bit of a over kill for personal use. I feel the response time is little slow because the processor is bogged down with all the application. You have to wait half a second by the time you press the button before the phone responds  Next is GPS - Even though the software behaves like a full fledged GPS, you cannot have maps worth more than 512 MB. This means that you can have only a few states worth of maps in the memory. If you travel to a different place then the next time you update the maps, the software wipes out all the previous data while generating the new map. Later I figured that we can use some other softwares(like TOM TOM ) to overcome this problem. I have yet to buy it but It seems like It would work.  About the WiFi, I couldn't think of any reason I would use a WiFi when I'm home.(may be at hot spots)I would rather use the computer.  Keyboards - As always (previous models is not big enough to type with comfort)  If you are a Road warrior, this is the one of the best you can get. But I will not recommend it for personal use.UPDATE: Good PDA but bad cell phone - minor but annoying quirkJanuary 26th, 2008Now, it is almost 6 months I have this cell phone. I'm finding that the longer I have it, the less I like it. In my opinion, this seems like a experimental model-an attempt to make a big jump for a truly integrated mobile phone. For the first time I'm disappointed with a HP product. I should say that user interface is very important. It need not be as flashy as Iphone but there should be some level of ease. the small keyboard is becoming increasingly annoying. Heavy windows is truly hurting it. I'm not a person who has a very good knowledge on software but from a user point of view, this is my opinion - You should not wait for the cell to respond. I have missed phone calls many times just because, the phone gets hung up when Im trying to receive the call. Some times I have to reboot it.  One more thing I noticed is when ever you closed the program, it still runs in the background and takes the memory. This makes the phone sluggish. I have to go and delete all of them every now and then. I'm still maintaining the 4 stars for the integration. Not the performance.As a PDA it might get a 4 star but as a cell phone it deserves only 1 star.  I believe that road warriors Deserve better performance and I do think they have it now.
As a phone, this is much better than previous ipaq phones I have had. As a PDA it also performs much better than previous models, particularly as it seldom crashes, needing infrequent resets. The only serious problem is the ridiculously short battery life.
GPS+phone gprs+whifi+bluetooth+windows mobile 5+..... everythink included in term of needed functionality. Stable and smooth operation.The best choice for a pocket pc device
it's really good pda , but it desn't have camera , So hp 6945 is better because it has everything you need .
I love this. Phone works great with Tmobile Prepaid. I use it to sync Outlook and Word between home and office. It's a great note taker. For extensive notes, it works well with Bluetooth keyboard. One thing they don't tell you. In the charging cradle, it does slide show of photos with time and date. So it's a photo picture frame on your desk. GPS rocks. And it's got a voice recorder. Bluetooth works with car kit. Adequate camera. It's smaller than past Ipaqs but the screen is still visible. Love it.
I will keep it simple..Pros.*very good exterior design.*qwerty keyboard feels nice when typing*very good software package included*keep all your info, contacts, emails, task, up to date with active sync*GPS at your hand! (get GPS TUNER 5, excellent tool)*wifi, easy set up, excelent connection speed*bluetooh*edge-gprs, easy set up, get your mms, wap, emails, via your cell phone gprs service.Cons.*Battery life sucks*when you are running more than 3 programs at the same time, sometimes the the screen freezes.*Camera takes up to 5 seconds to activate when the program is not on.*Camera with no autofocus*You need to buy micro sd card, (not included)The gps in this ipaq is great, I downloaded The GPS TUNER , use my own maps for calibration and i was ready to go. I used my Ipaq gps on a commercial flight sitting by the window, and I got gps fix all the flight. It was great having all my flight info, speed, alt, avrg speed, ete, eta.The phone feature was off, so my smartphone becomes a pda, and no one cant complain about it during the flight.It it very nice to see your path later where your flight was.
I just got my HP 6945; took chip from my T-Mobile MDA; and I was operational. Took no more time to get mail then any other Pocket PC. I installed Tom-Tom, 5-minute veterinary consult, Plumb's veterinary drugs, synchronized it with my calendar and numbers and I am in business. Using a Jabra bluetooth, I can stream my MP3's while doing everything else. The only feature missing was voice activated dialing, but I am adding MS Voice Commander to fix that. I get better reception and signal (and stability) with the HP 6945 than with my T-Mobile MDA. So, it was a great purchase. Picture quality is not what you want if you are a photographer, but it is a phone. In a pinch, a picture is still worth a thousand words. Beats carrying a phone, a camera and a PDA; since this is all in one. I find that my thumbs don't mind the keyboard, but it does take a little adapting. The numbers lock feature is nice.rog
OK folks, here is the info you have been waiting for, coming from the perspective of a hp 6315 owner:First, ALL the bluetooth issues are resolved completely.  You will no longer have to be concerned with reconnecting to headset constantly.  Plus, NO MORE ECHO - thank god!  the echo problem is fixed.  When using the bluetooth to answer phone, it answers imediately and you can talk the second you hit the button, no delay.  Headset sounds crystal clear to caller. (I don't know why all these folks are claiming they can't get their headset to pair up.  I had no problem)Second, in comparison to the 6315, this phone is greased lightening. Its all a matter of perspective, but if you owned the 6315, you will love the speed on this 6945.  ie. hit the power button and it shuts right off with no delay. I would say it operates at double to triple the relative speed of the 6315.Third, no more hangs like the old days.  I have been using it non stop for 48 hours utilizing remote surveylance software, installing lots of programs, using mini sd card, streaming with wmp, using internet explorer, using mail & phone, and even running wifi bluetooth and gps - NO REBOOT REQUIRED YET. and memory bounces right back when closing programs rather than clogging up and requiring resets.Basically, Everything that bothered you about the 6315 seems to be fixed.Beware, to my surprise ther was NO included backup software but I installed sprite backup/restore and it works perfectly.Yes, battery life sucks, get a car charger and get over it.  Note that the bigger battery solves that problem.  Alot of people are saying to get the bigger bat if you use your gps, but if you use gps you will plug into charger to keep phone from going into standby constantly so tell them to stick it:)Note: With small Battery, I took phone off charger at 10:30am and using all features except gps under average loads (including internet surfing and streaming for an hour using wifi and gprs), it was at 62% by 4:30pm. it charged to 100% in about 30-40 min.other Things to note:MS voice 1.6 is AMAZING.  It hasn't screwed up once.  No comparison to older products.You can now associate rings and photos to your contacts which is nice cause it pops the persons pic up when calls come in (I dont know if spb added this feature or it came with).and this phone works perfectly on tmobile service. The only issue was internet access (I had to change the prefix on the internet server options from internet3 to wap).SPB add on is a must!You will have issues with screen resolution, but since win mobile 5 doesnt support the larger screen res anymore, you might as well get used to it.  Plus, you know that new mobile 5 software will be modified for the newer screen sizes.Anyway, that's about it.In conclusion, if you have the 6315 and your thinking about an upgrade, DO IT!!!!
1. Built in GPS receiver, supported by best selling PDA GPS software iGuidance. BB 8800 sucks2. Built-in wi-fi coupling free Skype software makes International Phone call cheaper at same quality as fiber line or PC call anywhere for free.3. Well-backlit full keyboard, easily to compose email, contact, calender, office productive applications ( not like BBs view only).4. excellent Active link:  not only sync email, contact, calendar, photos, movies but also provide internet acess through PC;  not only sync with home PC but also Office PC plus Exchange Server.  Sync options can be set seperately5. Excellent Medai Player with Equlizer Customizable which makes headphone output excellent sound quality6. Very solid built, I dropped it twice onto concrete surface from 4 feet high, after reboot, every function kept working, only a tiny scratch left on it right bottom corner (hardly to see or feel)7. Ready to throw those pricey Data Plans into garbage binP.S. I've used it for 5 months, and during this 5 months:a) I never missed single phone call even when I'm in a shelter room where the signal is very weak (my sony ericsson 810i missed signal sometimes), when I'm listening to MP3 through the included headset and when I'm watching IPTVb) I never need to reboot due to freeze. Sometimes, it does show a waiting icon for a couple of seconds, that's because it's paging out system memory in order to accommodate more application to run at the same time. There is no harm, you won't miss a call, you won't lost any data.c) When start to sync with PC, there are a couple of seconds during which keypad or screen won't response.
I was one of the early adopters of the iPAQ h6315 and suffered the consequences.  The hw6945 is head and shoulders above it.  HP has addressed most of the hardware and software issues (although a little more RAM and processor speed would be nice).  Strangely enough, one of the most important new features is the screen cover.  Now you no longer have to wonder what terrible things might happen when the unit powers up in your pocket.  The keyboard is small, but usable however not all applications have an indicator that it's in NumLock mode.  The GPS receiver is excellent.  The MS Pocket Streets that comes installed has so few maps available that it's essentially worthless, but the Delorme Street Atlas Pocket PC software (that comes free with the latest version of Street Atlas) is great.  You can buy a 1gig mini-SD card (for about $35) and download any or all maps of the US and Canada; just beware that the larger the map, the slower the processing. The routing feature will talk you to your destination while showing your current location on the screen.  Another S/W package that should be considered mandatory is MS Voice Command.  I have over 800 contacts that are synchronized (over Bluetooth) with my laptop, and the voice recognition accuracy is astounding.  There is no training required; it works off of the spelling of the names.  Making calls from the car is simply a matter of pushing a button and saying "Call Jim Smith at work".  I have a Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset and it works seamlessly with the iPAQ.  Although I'm still in the honeymoon period, I'm a very happy camper at the moment.
I owned the previous version to this one and liked it fine. Now, I own this device and I love it. It is an-all-included PDA. Battery does not last long, though.
The good stuff:This smartphone is amazing.GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, Mobile Windows, PDA, Camera, MP# player, and on and on and...The phone actually works great too!The bad stuff:Expensive!Complex.Somewhat clumsy interface.If you are a techy type not easily intimidated by things smarter than you, you gotta havit!
HP just done it again, this is an incredible device, I live in South America and my PDA GSM work just fine with any telephone operator, It just took me to put it out of the box and place the GSM SIM CARD and that was it, all services of my network work perfectlly.If you live outside US, gotta find a GPS software to upload to your PDA the maps of your country, I use GPS Tuner and I convert the maps to JPG and works great, the WiFI feature is awesome.Some remarks to future buyers..- Use the clip holder belt that the product comes within..- Must have Car Charger, 'cause battery life is far to last like any other cell phone, for ex. I receive and made about 35 calls per day, and use in a very low maner the conectivity features like wi fi and gps, and battery last for about 10 hours..- Think about the weigth and size, even when the pda is very compact, and easy to handle, it is going to take a while to get used to it, my previus phone was a Motorola V3, and I still use it on weekends, due I use my PDA just for work, having a GSM service rocks 'cause let you change yor SIM Card to any phone any time you want..- Must buy the adicional memory card, Amazon sells it for 14$ th mini s of 1GB, happens that when you use a lot your windows mobile applications, your phone turns a little bit slow..- The Camera function is great, it has some GPS function I don't quite understand what the hell it does yet, but must be great.Basicly, these are some remarks I missed here when I bought my phone. It is totally unlocked, works great in ANY TELEPHONE OPPERATOR. you may buy it whit your eyes closed.Enjoy!
Finally I have an integrated device that performs very well for each of its functions. It really replaced my old pocket PC, Cell phone and GPS units so now I carry only one device. The radios are excellent (Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS and Phone) and they can work together without interferring among them. The software interfaces are intuitive and well integrated to the operating system.The GPS sensibility and performance is outstanding, even better than a SIRF III.The audio control is practical and you can use the included earphones (2.5 mm conector) or a bluetooth stereo headset.My only complain is for the camera because it's way below the quality level of the device; it takes a long time to open (about 17 secs) and adquire an image (about 12 secs).This device is worth the investment !
I am a mac user. This product works fine with the Missed Sync software. I found all the features in the right place. I would rather not to see a keyboard since I always use the stylus. The keyboard makes the screen smaller than it should be. It is fast but upgrade the memory with a 2GB mini SD card. The camera is slow but the pictures are nice. Bluetooth, wifi (WPA enabled) and GPS work flawlessly. The phone is complete.
I have used several devices earlier and also explored every little functionality of this IPAQ 6945 before writing this review.PROS:- there are tons of freeware and paid applications to make the best use of this device- GPS, WiFi and bluetooth all work- typing email is very convenientCONS:- material looks cheap including the flip case. The body built is not comparable to that of Treo which looks very professional. 6945 looks like a cheap toy- The OS is very slow in responses - sometimes takes about 4-5 seconds to respond for a key click- GPS does work, but you need to shell of $150+ for TomTom or equivalent money for any good GPS software. You might probably get a Nuvi for the same price, instead of adding TomTom on this slow device- HP doesn't give any additional mini-SD card with this device. You need to buy your own. MiniSD is more expensive than normal SD and even micro-SD. I am not sure why did HP chose this format- flip-case feels as if it would break at any moment- you cannot sync (activesync) with your computer over wifi. It seems Microsoft decided that activesync does not have encryption built-in and disabled syncing over wifi for security reasons. Sounds awful when you first hear, but that is the truth. The Wifi in this device is useful only to fetch emails from google etc., but you cannot sync with your computer- there is no HP support for this device. They just transfer you to T-Mobile or Cingular without even telling you when you call them. If you are not with either of those carriers, you are left in the desert. Don't trust HP's support. They just suck.
I bought this device almost one month ago since I had a simple cell phone and needed to replace it. I got attracted by the idea of having everything I needed in only one device which could fit my pocket (talking about size). The result is this relatively slim pocket pc with a huge lovely and clean screen with all the abilities that HP had to offer with this product.Ok, pocket pcs can bear several software as Microsoft Word, Excel, Power Point and Picture Viewer, as well as Internet Explorer, File Manager, Pocket AutoCAD, etc. I also loved the idea of having my personal organizator as a databook, worldwide alarm clock, appointments manager, large address book and also... the WiFi posibility. I've got a wireless connection and I must tell, this device works pretty well. Websites are seen so clear and just the same you would watche them on a conventional personal computer. Connection time is fair and gets signal almost inmediately.Connectivity between devices is also a great stuff, as this HP wonder has integrated bluetooth and IR ways, as well as a craddle with a USB cable, in case you don't have a wireless enabled computer. It includes a built-in digital camera which I understand is just 1.3 megapixels, but however, I already have a digital camera, so I don't need a fancy one on this unit.Speed and storage is enough for daily use but if you are a hard user of data and need speed, you may require to buy a 2 or 4 GB Mini SD (as I did, of course). I have installed some of the complement programs on my SD card and the main ones on the unit. This is a great way of saving some memory for other large files or running software.Something I would improve is the battery life. In my case, using the phone for about 1 hour and keeping the screen on (working) for 45 minutes a day, it only stays alive for 3 days, then I need to charge it. If we could replace the whole craddle for only a cable to connect it to a computer, we would also have a better choice (specially for travellers).In conclusion, I love this device... I know there are other options in the market (as O2 Atom Life or Flame) which are faster and have larger capacity, but I rely on HP as a brand and of course, they always offer good products which are supported by the best customer service.
Al parecer, uno no le puede pedir a un tostador de pan que lave tu ropa.Esto se cumple en la HP6945.Como agenda es excelente!Pero commo telefono todavía le falta. Es más difícil usarlo que un el modelo basico de Nokia.Además la cámara de 1.3 deja mucho que desear.De igual manera estoy satisfecho con la compra; envío y recibo mail con facilidad y además ando con 1 aparato envez de 3.
I do recommend the HP Ipaq HW6945 Phone ... all the stuffs I expected I've got: good wi-fi, bluetoth, GPS, Windows Mobile, GSM etcI can use a SIP Software or Skype and GSM for calls..Very good!!!
It is everything you need on a phone-PDA. It is light and the functionality is easy and better designed than the earlier versions.The only thing that I could say negative to the 6945 is that sometime is slow on heavy usage.
Overall, the product is comparable in functionality to other PDAs/Smartphones (Nokia N95, O2 XDA, etc) in the market. It comes with all the expected cool features, such as Wi-fi, Bluetooth, GRPS, touchscreen and a camera.I do think the phone is a bit slow in responding to keyboard and stylus inputs. The response that you get from the phone while placing a call is a bit slow compared to other phones. You have to learn to be a bit patient while making calls. The camera function is particularly slow in starting.Another issue I have with the phone is the battery life. The battery life is really inadequate for using the installed applications on a regular basis. The back-light and application usage really cause the battery to run down pretty fast.A common feature in most phones that is missing in this phone is the ability to map telephone numbers that appear in text messages to names if the numbers are present in the address book. The lack of this feature can sometimes be a source of confusion for me, especially with SMS delivery notifications. I sometimes get confused about which SMS I sent the SMS delivery notification is referring to.In conclusion, this device is excellent--no doubt. It would have gotten five stars from me if the processor were a bit faster.
Owned this ipaq for months and it is one of the best cellphones/pda's around... GPS is awesome ... and its a communication powerhouse--wifi, EDGE, bluetooth... (if only it can do 3G!) :)
I am in love with my IPAQ, it is very convenient for all uses.
EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM AMAZON.THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED WITH A DELAY OF 24 HRS BUT AMAZON LET ME KNOW THEY WOULDN'T CHARGE THE SHIPPING AND THEY DIDNT.OF COURSE I WILL BUY AGAIN FROM YOU.GREAT PHONE. I JUST INSERT MY SIM CARD IN EL SALVADOR AND IT WORKS.
This product is really neat - has everything I would want in a single, yet small device.My only complaint so far is that the phone sometimes simply freezes, and the only solution I have found is to remove the battery and consequently restart the device.The only SW I have installed so far is the beta version of Skype, which is really awsome!! I can call my relatives FOR FREE in the UK drinking a Capuccino at Starbucks using their free wi-fi access.
You won't believe it when you use Google Maps. The PPC will track your position and give you live traffic, directions, and Satellite view! It's really amazing when traveling on I80 around the Great Lakes! Oh, the phone is the best! Forget the iphone, this will replace your blackbery, phone, navigation system, and in most cases your laptop. There's something special about needing only one battery charger.
Well! Look seems that Windows mobile 6 coming out soon, but the thing I got still Window mobile 5. Such the attractive functions, blue tooth, wi fi, gps, they all work find. But there the GPS software need activation $129 is suck and seem not much website talk about it!!! There also had built in gps software "Microsoft Pocket Street" but you need to get the ".mps" files to use it!! Hopfully I had bought Microsoft Street and Travel 2007 already. This software can export ".MPS" file. But there had something weird. From the start I wasn't unable to use the GPD, after I had install trial GPS software come with package, then the GPS starting to work out!!!  Video recording only 320X320 with poor framing motion. Don't see any voice recording software. Still looking for Traditional Chinese software, but seems just the different model of hw6965 can use traditional chinese.  Lot of people say to me that is too expensive, but I was thinking that if you going out and hanging too much stuff in your body, that is too much. For now on I can just carry this and have all function even wi fi for connection internet. But there the internet browser is not looking so good. Seems Microsoft doesn't want to make it better. Now I am looking forward for the Microsoft Mobile 6 upgrading.
I don't like this Pocket PC.  Everything works, but its so slow... I allways close unnecesary opened applications, but it still slow.  It seems to me that HP have to work on using a new processor, something about double the actual speed of 416 Mhz.  Here are some observations:1. The phone works, just put your SIM card and use it, thats ok.  The problem is that the software and response time never compares with my previous Sony Ericsson phones, my last one was a W600i.  You need both hands to operate it, if you are driving... looking for a phone number in contacts, Call History or the Speed Dial, be careful, use your Pocket PC phone can easily kill you... of course you can use a voice activation software that in my case, Latin America, almost none of the automatic softwares works (accent I guess). If I'm dialing a number and the voice mail alert starts playing right before the recorder starts... it doesn't matter if you press the End button, buttons are so slow in response that you have no time to place a miss call...2. The GPS works just fine, but not with the HP applications... there are no maps for my country (Panama)I used the GPS Tuner software and had to georeference some images from google earth.3. The HP 6945 freezes a lot, it is very anoying having to restard so often.  Some times it freezes when I'm receiving a call.4. The square screen is not good because some of my applications don't work on it.5. The camera is really slow to start, very limited functionality and bad quality photos... if you want to waste good moments... just go and take pictures with this mediocre camera.6. The battery is very bad, you better keep on syncronizing very often or you'll end up with out batteries very soon.  There a lot of excuses like don't use your Blue tooth to often, dont use your GPS because it'll suck your battery, pay 55$ for a new bulky battery, stuf like that.7. I'm not planning to buy other HP Pocket PC in the future, I'm so frustrated with this one.
Use CAUTION before ordering from Electronica  Direct: Although the website would suggest this item is in stock, I was highly disappointed when I ordered a case, extra battery, additional memory, etc. only to find that the most crucial portion of the shipment had been cancelled, days after I had placed the order. THE PHONE WAS NOT IN STOCK!
After a long research I finally bought an HP iPAQ hw6945. I will try to answer here the main doubts I had before the purchase.1) Size and weight: it is very small and light, practically the size of my old iPAQ 1940 but slightly thicker and heavier. It can be easily carried in a shirt pocket and does not require the use of a case due to its screen cover.2) Screen: square, 3 inch, 240x240, surprisingly good both in size and legibility. It has the same width and character size as the 3.5 inch screen of the iPAQ 1940 and the fact of being shorter is not very disturbing. Actually, when entering text, both screens have practically the same size due to the space occupied by the virtual keyboard on the iPAQ 1940. My feeling is that this screen has much better legibility than the 2.8 inch 240x320 screen found on most phones due to its greater width and character size. Furthermore, the virtual keyboard is very small and difficult to use on a 2.8 screen. I installed the free Haali Reader program and can read eBooks as easily as on the 3.5 inch screen of the iPAQ 1940. As for the legibility outdoors, it is much better than that of the iPAQ 1940: it is very good in bright sunlight and acceptable under non direct lighting.3) Keyboard: very good once you get used to it. It is noticeably faster than a virtual keyboard on a 3.5 inch screen and much faster than a virtual keyboard on a 2.8 screen.4) Operating system: Windows mobile 5.0 has a couple of big advantages with respect to the 2003 Operating System.4.a) Office programs are much improved. Word Mobile uses now the same file format as the PC version and maintains all the document formatting. Excel Mobile includes now the possibility to make charts. A PowerPoint viewer is now included.4.b) The lower part of the screen now includes two softkeys (options that change depending on the program and circumstance), which are accessed by the two inner keys (just as on mobile phones). This feature, together with the central joystick and the keyboard, make it possible to use the device almost without using the stylus, which is very convenient.5) Battery life: quite good, lasts easily for a full day of normal use. However, with constant GPS use, it lasts for a little over 4 hours.6) Telephone: 4 band, very sensitive, good sound, does not feel at all too big in the hand. Just great to write SMS messages!7) WiFi: excellent. The possibility to have Internet access at every hotspot is incredible. Internet Explorer is fairly good and using Skype is a joy.8) Bluetooth: I did not try it yet.9) Digital Camera: fairly good. I read a lot of negative comments about this camera but found that pictures are perfectly acceptable, even when viewed on a PC screen, if the highest resolution and lowest compression are used. However, the delay between the instant the button is pressed and the photo is taken is quite long, so that the camera is only suitable for static subjects.10) GPS: very good. While it does not use the SIRF chipset, the GPS is very sensitive, much more so than my Garmin eTrex Legend. It works perfectly under tree cover and even inside some buildings. Furthermore, the first satellite detection is much faster. If you plan to buy a hard case for outdoor use be aware that an all aluminum case severely limits satellite detection.Bottom line: I am quite happy with this device that surpassed my expectations in almost all aspects. I think that the purchase of one of the many devices with a 2.8 inch screen could only be advisable for younger people with good eyesight, provided that is has a sliding keyboard.
After looking at comparing prices among other Smartphones I can tell you that the HP8945 is the best you can get out there, I've seen P990's and Qtek's smartphone series at similar pricing than this and I can assure you there's just no comparison among them. The HP8945 is a PC turned into a smartphone, as the others are phones trying to become a PC.
After having different Palms over the years (from Palm III to Vx), I decided I needed a fancier upgrade. The list of attractions is big for the hw6945:- GSM phone- Bluetooth- WiFi- GPSBut I must say Windows Mobile and its applications are a lousy shadow of what I had with PalmOS. Every single application is more limited and less intelligent than its Palm counterpart. For instance:- ToDo list doesn`t have categories- Contacts don`t allow a series of customization that Palm allows (it looks like we went back to the early bad sofwatre designs - replacing customization for lots of columns on the database)- Calendar appointments (especially recurrent ones)are much harder to configure. Palm has a very clever design, BTW, for recurrent events.- Outlook is much heavier and less customizable than PalmDesktop- Synchronization is a painfull process, I still don`t know how to get a few things synchronized the way I want, and getting help with Microsfot products is much more difficultThe actual features (GSM Phone, WiFi, etc.) are OK, no complaints except for the anit-intuitive wasy to configure and use them. Things are spread all over, so if you land in a different country (I`ve used it in India, Holland and now Brazil) and want to customize a few things (like choosing the carrier, or configuring GPRS) you have to visit dozens of different places. Those things seem to work OK, though.Maybe this is just bad luck, but in any case after 1 month of use the backlight is malfunctioning (goes on and off randomly), and needs to be replaced, which is something very hard to do overseas (I bought it in the US, but I live in Brazil).As soon as I can compensate for the financial damage, I`ll certainly replace the iPaq for something else, preferably a PalmOS-based device (or any other OS really) with WiFi... I should have trusted my instincts on this one.Rubens
I liked the key pad, the t9 messaging functionality, and generally the layout of the keys and buttons (the navigation arrows are a little small so I have to use my thumbnail instead of thumb).  The pictures are good, but a little softer than better (more expensive) cam phones.  The customization is kind of weird--I'm stuck with a ping background in phonebook that I can't get rid of (not bad if I were a 13 year old girl, of course), and the "rainbow" option for text only works for direct dialing, which I virtually NEVER do.  But the worst thing was that after having it for less than 10 days, it got a "burned out" section in the bottom left hand portion of the screen.  It affects all the screens, covering roughly the bottom 1/9th of the screen, and is only about half as bright as the rest of the screen.  I liked it, but have to return it.  Bottom line is that if they're discounting it so deeply they're giving it away, there's always a reason (usually cheapness in the mix somewhere)--there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm returning it for a better phone.  Probably the 6133, but we had problems with that also (supposedly because of an older, 32Kb SIM card, but I'm dubious) and had replaced.
This phone was free with the "My Favs" plan. The phone is OK. Not great, not super duper, just OK. It is a tiny phone that weighs next to nothing and has a rather cheap feel to it. The camera button is pushed everytime I pick-up the phone because it is very flimsy and practically pushes itself.You have to jump through way too many hoops to get this phone setup the way you want it. The ringtones provided with the phone really suck, as do the Fav icons. But not to worry, T-Mobile sells ringtones and Fav icons, which is why they give you the crappy ones. Thanks, T-Mobile!!!I really like the My Favs plan, but if I had it to do over again, I would spend some money to get a decent phone along with the plan.Can you figure out why the phone was free???  Gosh, Batman, you're so-oooo smart!
i've had this phone for a couple days and i am liking it, i don't much about cell phones though, i just like something i can us for texting and a few phone calls.over all its a great little phone with all the basics, although it does have a cheaper feel to it, but i could just be used to the heavier razor. i like this phone, its easy to figure out.but here are a few cons to this phone if you're considering:-you can't rearrange the display menu. which is kind of bummer because you have to hit a few buttons to get anywhere, but its not horrible, just a couple clicks and you're there.-the camera button is right on the side, so if your holding the phone and accidently hit it while texting or dialing its a bummer.-the ringtones are crap. sorry. this the one thing that i have nothing good to say about. they suck. i hate buying ringtones because i think its silly, but i am going to because these ones suck/-its really quiet. i can barely hear it ring. but thats okay for me because most of the time i am texting and not everyone wants to know when i get a message.-the backlight stays on while charging, i don't know if that is changeable or not, but once its stops charging, but its still hooked into the charger, it stays bright, which in turn runs the battery down.other than those little complaints, i have to say its a pretty simple, easy phone. i would suggest it for someone who needs something easy, a first time cell phone user, or just someone who doesn't want to deal with all those extra buttons and features.
I bought this phone November 2006, and it has been a terrible experience. The phone seemed fantastic for the first 3 months, and then it started malfunctioning. This phone has the worst reception of all phones i've ever had. It has dropped almost every call I have ever had outgoing or incoming. Everytime I tried to send a text message it would always say Retry over and over and over and usually I would just give up. I got so frustrated that one of my friends gave me his old Tmobile phone, a 1997 Motorola with an antenna and no battery cover on the back, and I prefered that phone to this POS Samsung. I will never trust samsung phones again, particularly this brand.
First of all, the main photo from above is not a T-Mobile phone, it is obviously the V3m (made for Verizon or CDMA version) easily distinguished by the protruding 'bulging' camera -- all other gsm versions are flushed. T-Mobile Razrs have been crippled by the carrier and they also erased the most essential features that came along with this fine phone; for example, there are no options whatsoever to display either an 'analog clock' or 'mm/dd/yyyy calendar' on the screen similar to the one pictured above and another one I have. They've also replaced the rear aluminum battery door cover with flimsy plastics, somehow T-Mobile does it to all their Motorolas now!Second: I am a die-hard Razr phone fanatic, not because the phone looks sleek and slim and what have you but most and above all, the designed ergonomics featured on this phone is excellent. The phone is very compact, the only place I seem to house it at most times is in my rear jean pocket and it hardly gets in the way. It is extremely user friendly, the keypads not only look great, but functions very well and with ease. Since then, there has been a handful of updates and newer models to the Razr line, but until I have the few extra hundreds to spare, I don't mind and continued using similar ones that I can get for free.Although it is under the 'weak' T-Mobile GSM network, nevertheless, reception pull from this phone is still excellent. Not to pound on the carrier, but the original 'aluminum silver cladded' version that was given to me previously from Cingular Wireless (now at&t;) was on a completely different level and the best Razr yet - it came readily 'unlocked' and the phone had an array of network options available should I plan on traveling internationally. The software version from my Silver Razr was and still up to par with today's standards.In comparison to the two, it is basically the same phone, but there are some additional differences from T-mobile's programs (other than the obsolete VGA camera) compared to my silver version - for example, on this phone:- There is video capture- Updated shortcut, a quicker and faster way to "scroll to find names" on phonebook contacts.- Multiple entries can display under ONE name in contact list.- Press and 'hold' the # key to put phone in vibrate mode vice versa (uniquely, there is a small "phone vbrate" symbol on that key also)This phone could have easily gained 5 stars, but the carrier disabled most of the essentials and with the absent of a 'metal' battery door making this just a tad above other mediocre phones.
All I've ever expected from a cell phone is decent reception, a watch, an alarm clock, and a halfway interesting game to occasionally stave off boredom.Until I bought a RAZR, I had always used the standard Nokia brick offered by T-Mobile, And I was always content with it. Then I discovered the RAZR.The RAZR has everything I want from a phone.Exceeding that, it's so compact that I don't even notice it's in my pocket. It has a speakerphone that I can use while closed and sitting on the seat of my car instead of holding while driving. I didn't even know it had a camera until I bought it.
I bought the RAZR v3 a year ago because of its stylishness.  I have to admit I was swept up in the trend.A couple things were disappointing right away:-Lack of features.  The V3 really is a basic phone.  You can't even search the phone book by more than the first letter.  It lacks any of the fun little goodies other, similar phones have.-Poor reception.  I'd drop calls or get no reception in places where my friends with T-mobile (but different phones) came in loud and clear.-Poor speaker quality.  Using the phone in anything but a silent room was almost impossible.  Even at the loudest volume, the speaker was too quiet when out and about.  I had trouble hearing in restaurants, at concerts, even just sitting in the car with the window down.  The microphone volume was low too, as many of my friends complained about how quiet I was.-Speakerphone.  It was so quiet, it was basically unusable.-Voice record, but no customizable ring tones.  Honestly, why include a voice recorder if you can't set them as ring tones?  Granted, that is a rare feature.-Lack of smaller stuff, like stopwatch.I did like the look, and it was easy to navigate.  The navigation was very customizable, and I really liked the ability to reset the functions of the soft keys.However, this all wasn't even the worst of it.  About three months later, my first wall charger broke.  I figured I had shorted it out or something, so I just bought a new one (at $30).  Fine and dandy.  Another 4 months down the road, THAT charger broke.  At this point, I'd started hearing from my friends with RAZRs (they'd become ubiquitous by now) that their chargers were going out too.  So I spoke with Motorola, who "hadn't heard any formal complaints on the problem" and only warrantied their accessories for 14 days.  I spoke to T-mobile, who said they couldn't do anything about it, because they could only warranty products for the duration of the return policy.  So I was forced to buy ANOTHER charger, at $30.One month later, that charger went out.  I kept my receipt from the purchase, and brough it back in, but T-mobile gave me the same story, maintaining that no one else had ever had the same problem.  They wouldn't  do anything for me except offer a 10% discount on a new charger (needless to say, I was very unhappy with this, and about fed up with the RAZR).I finally got the drivers for the RAZR online and started charging it on my computer with a mini USB cable.  This, however, was much slower.  I noticed that the RAZR's battery started buzzing (for lack of a better word) when I was charging it, and hardly holding a charge.I'd been very careful not to drop the phone up to this point, but the first time I did drop it (admittedly, a fair distance, onto linoleum) the screen cracked in half.  I dropped my little Nokia brick 50 times and nothing ever happened to it.  Its durability was obviously awful.  The coating had started to chip off and there was dust under the screen that I couldn't do anything about.  This made it so I could barely see the screen- the dust issue has affected every single RAZR I've ever seen.I finally lost my RAZR a few days ago, and was really glad to be rid of it.  I'd never buy a Motorola again- not only did I have such issues with the RAZR, but my previous phone, a little Motorola flip phone (can't remember the model number now) crapped out after 8 months.  I'm just an average cell phone user- I expect my phone to last at least the year before I can upgrade to a new one.  I've had Nokias and Samsungs that last forever and have far better features for the price- I'll stick to those brands from now on.All around, the RAZR was a huge hunk of junk, and convinced me to never buy a Motorola again.
I received this phone as a Christmas gift and almost wish Christmas had never come.  This phone is truly a disappointment.  The battery lasts only one day after maybe an hour of sporatic conversations.  There is an annoying delay when you press any menu button.  You forget what you wanted to do by the time your request comes up on the screen.  Both screens seem to keep smudges eternally.  It is nearly impossible to wipe it clean without a chemical of some sort.  When saving a number, you can't see what state it originates from as with my previous non bluetooth phone.  When placing a three way call, you can still hear the other person on the line and they can hear you dialing the number.  There is an abundance of media players and on demand functions that I will never use.  The camera does not come with a light, so forget about taking pictures anywhere but outside on a bright and sunny day.  This is my first and last Motorola.  I haven't dropped it yet, but I can't wait until the day that I do.
This is the BEST cell phone i have ever had yet!1. I get great signal2. Amazing camera3. Okay video4. Easy to use and doesnt take forever to load5. Beautiful lookinggI highly advise to get this cell phone.
I bought this phone after lots of rave reviews. However I was in for a great disappointment. The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast. I can hardly go by a day without recharging the phone.I addition the phone automatically reboots itself and there seems to be a delay in my opening the phone and it being ready for a phone call.Overall I am very disappointed.
You will get a lot of trouble if you use T-Mobile service. This is very the case if you want to switch to other carrier.
I've owned this phone for a few months now and I am overall very pleased.  The reception is decent, as good or better than any other Cingular phone I've been next to. Voice quality is also above average, while the speakerphone is a bit garbled and I always wish it could get a bit louder.  My logitech bluetooth headset syncs and works everytime, and the camera is also passable for a phone.  The inner display is crisp and the outer display is very attractive.  The outer buttons can be keylocked to avoid accidental music, and serve as soft keys for other functions besides music (incoming calls, alarm, etc).With those basics out of the way, really the best thing I like about this phone is windows media player.  I've outfitted mine with a 2gb microSD card and Logitech bluetooth headphones and it works flawlessly.  I've put 800+ songs on the card through the windows media player sync on my Windows XP computer.  The headphones sync every time and I can use the headphone controls without taking the phone out of my pocket.  The music will pause for calls and resume at call end.  I also like that the phone will handle audiobooks from my library with its Windows Media Player DRM capabilities.  I haven't used the phone for video, but if I did, I would be sure to sync it though my computer's WMP to give the best chance of a playable video.On the downside, the phone is a bit slow switching between applications.  Also, Windows Mobile does not overwhelm the consumer with useful applications.  It's missing a countdown timer, digital wallet, and the alarm clock is very basic and buried in submenus.  Luckily there are plenty of third party applications if you want to pay.  As far as free applications go, I highly recommend GMail, Google Maps, and Opera Mini.Overall, I am very impressed with the phone mostly for it's style, screens, and solid music capabilities.  There's a few things missing, but it makes up for it by giving me more than I thought to expect from a phone.
Some history: I have owned a cell phone from the days of the Motorola "brick" to the Motorola flip phone to the first Nokia candy bar phone with a Palm Pilot to the Audiovox 5600 which integrated my Palm functionality and a phone into one device.By far, the Nokia was the best phone. I had reception everywhere - even where noone else's phone worked, but I had my Outlook contact on my Palm. I wanted one device so I got the 5600. It synced great, but reception was poor. I couldn't use it from my home or work. I also missed the protection of a flip phone.Now I have the 3125 for about 2 months. Reception is great. I use it at home, work and everywhere there is coverage (I hike a lot.) Syncing is great and it is a flip phone so I can toss it in my pocket without calling some random number.I wanted a device that works as a phone first and then as a PDA. The 3125 does both well. It is a basic mobile computer for simple tasks. With a bluetooth keyboard you could do a lot.Pros:Reception almost as good as my analog Nokia of 10 years ago.Clear bright display - easy to readEasy to hear and to be heard. Speaker phone works well.Nice big tactile keys that automatically light up when needed.Much improved navigation keys (left, right, up, down, enter)Bluetooth with a Plantronics earpiece has good range and audio works well for the listener and talker.Battery life is better than the 5600. Not as good as the Nokia or Palm which would easily last a week. Color displays suck lots of power.Easy menu navigation - hint: you can hit the 1-9 keys to navigate the 9 icons.Voice recognition works once trained (bluetooth and phone).My old applications from 5600 work.Bought a 3rd party case that works well ($7)4 band phone works in all countries using GSM. I used mine in China with a China Mobile SIM. hint: call Cingular and they will unlock your phone for free!Cons:Proprietary connector - can't use std headphones.Themes supplied have too much junk. My biggest beef with the themes were the large icons and space taken by "advertizements" like MSN or Cingular. To solve the themes issue, I edited the xml files. You can also buy programs to modify the themes.Had to buy SmartNotes program to sync with Outlook Notes.MicroSD card is under the SIM card.Cingular staff and instruction manual don't tell you much. I had to figure out a lot on my own.No on-phone help - my old Nokia had menu help 10 years ago.Notes: I am a PC user (not a Microsoft fan, but surprisingly like windows mobile). I use Outlook for contacts, calendar, email, and notes. I sync my phone with all of these.
Summary: If you do not need a full-on Blackberry and want to have wireless access to Outlook this is a great phone.First my goals from this product: I'm definitely not a 'road warrior' and do not plan on having a Blackberry grafted permanently to my hand, but I do work away from the office one day a week or so and I wanted to keep an eye on emails, have access to my Outlook contacts whenever I need it, be reminded of upcoming Outlook appointments without having to log onto email from a PC. I wanted to be able to do this automatically, not syncing from a PC with a cable. I also wanted a fairly normal-looking flip phone and one that was not too bulky. I did not need a keyboard - I planned to be more of a reader than a writer of emails etc.This phone meets those needs perfectly, though with one flaw outlined below. I have the unlimited data plan ($20/month) and it syncs very nicely with Outlook. It will download as many messages as the memory allows, starting with the most recent. Without any add on card this means about 20+ depending on what else you have loaded (e.g. music, photos etc). If you need more you can buy cards starting at around $30 to up this capacity. When you open the phone you get a well designed summary screen which shows how many messages are waiting (all types) and shows the next appointment today and tomorrow. Contacts come over well from Outlook, and you can dial directly from contacts. There is a good and simple search system for finding contacts. Sound quality is fine, as are connections - typical for Cingular, as good as previous Nokia phones, much better than with the Motorola phone I used to have. The screen is high quality though small, and web browsing is as easy as is probably feasible given the lack of keyboard and small size of the screen.The only real problem is that this phone accidentally reboots ALL THE TIME. It reboots about 5-10 times a day, typically when put in a pocket or dashboard, when picked up for answering etc. The reboot procedure lasts the best part of a minute and is jarringly noisy so this is a major flaw. The apparent cause is an over sensitive safety switch on the battery/SIMM card cover designed to cause the phone to turn off to protect the card when you open the back. There is a simple fix (involving putting a piece of folded paper over the switch) which apparently works (tried it today, so far no reboots). The web site discussing this is here (solution towards the end)(.......)Apparently newer phones don't have this problem so Cingular's maker may have fixed this by now.Assuming this is the case this is a highly recommended phone for people who don't want a full on Blackberry but want some of the functionality.
This phone works amazingly well in most aspects. The call clarity is great and the menu system works very well. I especially find the hot bar menu system on the start screen very convienent. The mp3 player function workds remarkably well and with a 2 gb smartchip, this think becomes a monster media device. My one grievance is the camara on it. It lags horribly when you try and take a piture that is not staying perfectly still. In all, I highly recommend this phone.
I got this phone to replace my Motorola V551. Even when I was getting used to it, I could tell that in some ways I prefer my old phone. On the Motorola, all I had to do was hit 2 buttons on the side and the phone was muted. On this one I have to open it up, go to profiles, and change the profile. Takes longer. Motorola gave me a full printed manual, Cingular gives me a link to an online manual. If I want to hold it in my hands, I have to print almost 200 pages. The ring is too quiet, and the overall operation is complicated. Basic functions are hidden in Windows menus. Also, when you have the phone in your pocket or holster case, any pressure will hit the buttons on the cover and the phone will start trying to play your music. That's pretty irritating.That being said, the performance is great. Good quality feel, better pictures than the Motorola, better reception, text messages are easier to read, the internet is way faster than the Motorola, and it is clearly a newer, more advanced phone. For those that don't know, the Motorola V551 is basically a Razr in a less flashy package. All the functions are the same as the Razr. That V551 was a great phone, but it's getting behind the times. I took off one star in my rating because of the complicated layout and lack of a printed manual.After I originally wrote this review, my phone broke, so I sent it back. Then the replacement AT&T; sent broke. I took that phone back, and the people at the store could see I was about ready to jump ship over to Verizon, so they gave me a Palm Treo 680 for free. So far, that phone has been pretty decent. I am still waiting for someone to come out with a new version of the Motorola V551; simple, attractive, reliable, with some cool features but not overloaded. And this 3125 isn't it.
The external LCD screen on the phone cracked mysteriously. This seems to be a design flaw. Do a web search ( "Cingular 3125 cracked LCD" ) and you will find a number of owners who have had this problem. The descriptions are all the same - no one dropped the phone, they just generally pulled it out of their pocket and it was cracked. The crack appears on the *inside* (internal side) of the screen so it is not the result of physical damage by the user (no external facing dents/marks etc) .Users posting in web forums report that the damage is not covered by Cingular. They also report that the phone is not insurable.Phone screen broke for me 2 days ago - rendering the external screen useless. I will go to cingular this weekend and see if I can get a replacement.
The reasons I chose this phone are: it is small and lightweight, I can synch with MS-Outlook, it has a great MP3 player, expandable memory, it has Bluetooth, a decent camera, I can read pdf, Word and XL files that are e-mailed to me and much more.What I don't like: The speaker-phone is poor quality because the speaker is so small and this also affects the ring quality. Many times I accidently turn on the media player which runs down the battery. I wish the media player would not work unless you have earbuds plugged in.Overall it is a great device if you don't want to carry a big phone on your belt.
As soon as I got this phone, people told me my voice was breaking up, sounded like static, noisey, etc.  So I took it into a Cingular store they said 'Oh yeah this phone is bad', and exchanged it for another unit.  So I am on my 2nd 3125 now.  I called a couple people and asked if my voice sounded clear now, and they all said it was still messed up.  Now what?  The MS ActiveSync is a well known nightmare to get to work.  I love the looks of this phone, but frankly I am very unhappy with several aspects.  I guess I'll go back to the store again and get a 3rd unit.  Maybe one of these will work right.
Hi,I bought this phone 6 months back and I feel this phone is ok. The pros are excellent battery backup, good signal reception, nice mp3 capabilities. The cons are some times it works crazy(few hang offs), it restarts again(well I feel it is rare), the internal memory is too little and when the memory is filled, it gave me a warning to "Clear Storage", when I did that it even cleared all my contacts and I lost so many contacts. I feel this is ridiculous. I think the speaker quality needs to be improved much better(need more sound), the micro memory card slot need to be given outside, now it is behind the sim card and also removing this card is too scary...instructions are very bad..Overall I would say is average....
This little phone does everything I've ever wanted in a phone.  It's running Windows Mobile, so it interoperates nicely with Office products, and it is easy (like a pocketpc) to add new software and sync with outlook - unlike many other phones, it actually includes a sync cable.  No need to purchase music or ringtones, you can simply copy an mp3 or other sound file directly from your computer, and it just works.  Makes a great little mp3 player too, and includes headphones.  If you're familiar with Visual Studio, you can easily write your own software.  Oh yes, I highly recommend finding the Star Trek communicator ringtone mp3 and installing it... this phone is just not complete without it; not only is this phone otherwise referred to as the Star Trek phone, it also has much the same form factor as the old trek communicator, but is much more high-tech, and it is just really nifty (and unobtrusive) to have that classic tone go off.  A couple of minor caveats:  unless you can find some bluetooth headphones you're stuck with the ones that come with the phone, which have pretty good sound but I find the wires get tangled a lot, plus they could use an audio suppression filter to cancel-out the external world.  Then there's Window Mobile (and PocketPC's in general) issue of not having a means of cleanly exiting the programs; periodically you'll need to pull-up the Task Manager and shut-down the various apps that are running.  I recently was in the midst of loading a cart of fertilizer at Lowes and inadvertently bumped a button (phone was in my pocket), and suddenly had music playing, and it took a minute to figure-out how to shut it off.  Awkward.  Still, I love this phone.  And once you get it be sure to grab some free apps like those provided by Google Mobile (search plus google maps with traffic, and even gmail) and then of course you can get weather from the Weather Underground.  It even comes with a pretty-decent Solitaire game.
I hate this phone. I stupidly upgraded to this annoying phone from my razr, which I loved.  My main source of irritation about the 3125 is that the keypad light goes out too fast and there's no option to change it.  Same for the cool blue clock on the outside of the phone. It drops calls ALL the time (my razr almost never did).  Reception is spotty.  It's a 5 keystroke process to turn on bluetooth on the phone, then you have pair up with the headset - a 2-step process - it's a royal pain.  Syncing it with my pc was impossible. I gave up on that. The battery life is short and takes forever to charge.  The font on the main screen is difficult to read because it's too small. The interface is dull and unimpressive. You can only set one alarm time. Internet is excrutiatingly slow. I haven't bothered with the mp3 player because I have an ipod.The few good things:  Solitaire game is kinda fun (but tiny).  The camera's decent. The phone is well-made, solid and sturdy.  The keypad keys are larger than most, so you almost never hit the wrong #'s.  But none of this is enough to justify the price of this pda flip phone.I've had cell phones since 1994. Lots of them and all different kinds and brands. I have to say that this is one of the most inconvenient phones I've ever had and I can't wait to get rid of it. Maybe I'll run it over with my car... or smash it with a rock.
I have only had this phone for a few days, but already I LOVE this phone. The reception is great, its small, loaded with features including my 1900 plus contacts from Outlook. (so easy to do)  I have a lot more to learn about it and will update this more later, but so far, so GREAT on this phone!
I really really love this phone. I fell in love with it from the first moment I saw it and had to have it immediately. I bought a unlocked black Rizr from Ebay as soon as I could. People advised me not to get one because they believed that the Razr was such a terrible phone, but never having had a Razr, I felt it was worth a try.*** The good ***- The phone is beautiful. The screen display is bright and vibrant. Wallpapers and photos that you upload to the phone look just as good on the phone as they do on your computer. Everywhere I go I get compliments about it, and my friends wish they had it. It's very slim and easily fits into my pocket.- It's pretty study. It doesn't seem like it would break easily. I actually accidentally dropped the phone onto a concrete floor the other day. No damage what-so-ever. Not even a scratch or a dent.- To me the phone is very functional. My service is Cingular (AT&T;) and it worked immediately when I put in my sim card. Setting up internet was a little bit of a challenge, but doing a little research online solved that problem. The phone slides up easily and all of the menus are easy to access. You can personalize the phone and assign buttons to whatever features you wish.- Texting is very quick and simple because of the iTap. The phone remembers words and phrases you type so it makes long messages less of a hassle to write.- There is a voice command feature that I just started tinkering with that is very cool. You press the voice command button on the side of the phone and you can have the phone call, lookup, or send a txt message or email to anyone in your address book. Or you can even just say a telephone number and it'll dial it for you. With the voice command function you can also tell the phone to pull up applications like the audio player, check batter power and signal strength.- The camera and video are easy to use. The camera has a high intensity flash and zooms in. The video camera is great as well. Extremely easy to use and fairly good quality with sound. With my 1GB micro SD card I can take exactly 1 hour of video or 1000 photos.I use a card reader and micro SD to upload things to my phone and it is so fast. As soon as the card is entered into the phone everything is immediately recognized. It's also a breeze to set your mp3s as ringtones. There is a voice recorder on the phone so you can record your own ringtones as well.- The phone has a couple of games loaded on it already, not really much into games, so I haven't played them. There are two music players: a Java player, and the phone's default player. Theres a calculator, date planner, alarm clock... standard features that you'd find on mostphones.- Battery life is wonderful. I have now gone 3 days without charging the phone and I still have 2 bars (out of three) left in battery life. I suppose it all depends on how much you use the phone for.** Things I don't like **- One word: FINGERPRINTS!! The screen is a fingerprint magnet and it drives me crazy. I actually keep an anti-static cloth with me so I can wipe the phone off when it gets bad.- The vibrate is a bit weak. Sometimes when it's in my pocket I don't even feel it, and there's no way to change the vibration strength.- The speaker phone isn't very loud, but I don't use it that often anyway.- The sound quality of the music and video isn't that great, but I really didn't expect it to be stellar.- The keys are a little hard to press and it's difficult to accurately dial numbers using the pads of your fingers sometimes. I have to use my fingernails to dial or text to keep from pressing the wrong key.But none of these flaws are serious enough for me to take away a star from this phone. The pros outweigh the cons by far. I absolutely love this phone, and if you're a fan of the slider type phones, I urge you to give the Rizr a try. I don't think you'll regret it!
Four days ago, I had a motorola razr, and it was time for me to get a new phone. Well, my razr was terrible, so I doubted rizr a little, but since the design was hot (and it was 2 MP camera!), I got it. Well, heres the pros and cons:Pros:1.Nice design with skin that gives you firm grip2.Has 2MP camera and memory card slot to let you take more pics3.Springy slide so you dont need much forceCons:1.The camera doesn't seem like 2MP and feels same as the average 1.32.MP3 sounds like radio and some music cannot be played even though it can be played in other phones or MP3s3. Theres no change from the razr to the rizr; just slide and MP3.It's just an average phone; just overrated by many critics and overpriced too. You'll probably find a better phone than this one.
Not real happy with the sound quality of the mp3 or the speakerphone.  My Nokia 3220 speakerphone is far superior, although the 3220 does not have the mp3.  Setting up mMode and MMS for AT&T; legacy plan has been truly challenging as Cingular/AT&T; don't/won't provide tech support for an "unsupported" phone(they didn't sell it to me, so they don't want to provide tech support), and believe me I have connections at the tech desk being a former employee, and it's like pulling teeth - still don't have proper settings.  Have searched the AT&T; legacy/Cingular self support site and the web, tried all settings found for AT&T; MMS/mMode to no avail.  I can finally connect to mMode homepage and a couple of other mMode links on occasion, but still getting multiple "internal server" errors when attempting to go to specific URLs and some linked to the mMode site.  This phone was obviously manufactured for Asian markets, the Motomanual that came with it gives directions for menu options that do not even appear on this software version.  So, I will view this as a challenge and continue searching for resolution.I really do like the phone, bar the problems I have had with the settings.  It's just plain cool looking, and for the most part user friendly.  If you have the patience to program an unlocked phone straight outta Asia, and internet/MMS is not important to you, this is an awesome phone.  The SMS (text msg) works with no problem, although the iTap takes some getting used to.
I've owned Virgin Mobile for my last 3 phones. I even have their oldest model in use (my son). The Cyclops is a great addition to the line and is an affordable camera phone as well. One of the biggest complaints of Virgin users in the past was the low ring tone. I used to have to set my phone on "high and vibrate" just to hear it. That's definitely been fixed. The phone has a great range for volume settings. I could also transfer my phone number and BALANCE when I purchased this phone. That was  welcome surprise, especially since these don't come with any contract. Because I use my phone so little, it actually costs me about $7 a month when I 'top up'. In addition, the Cyclops phone has free evenings and weekends. Wow..what a bargain! I really recommend this phone to just about everyone, especially those with kids. It's a great first phone at a great price. The Virgin line also comes with a pre-paid bag to send in your old phone for recycling. I've had great customer service, btw...even on Labor Day.
Having owned the Snapper a few years, I was looking forward to upgrade to the Cyclops. This Kyocera phone seemed like an improvement over the older UT Starcom model because of it's slimmer casing, internal antenna, and a 1.3 MP camera. However, I ended up keeping my old phone because I can't get over the many flaws of the Cyclops. I'll briefly summarize:PROS:-small form factor-internal antenna-1.3 MP camera-colorful design-external displayCONS:-audio interference (white noise) possibly caused by antenna-when opened, phone bends too far back and is uncomfortable to hold-large external red LED flashes continuously during calls-text messaging is a pain because of small buttons and software glitches-average quality internal LCD display with childish graphics-camera quality about the same as higher end 0.3 VGA MP cameras
I have had this phone since december of '06 and love the phone, however i am having a problem finding a replacement home charger for this phone and if you go thru vmobile they want you to pay 30.00 bucks for it!!! not gonna happen!  so needless to say that is my only complaint.  the charger seems to have shorted out and it as been quite difficult to find one to replace it!
I have had this model for about 6 months now. It's small, easy to use and the battery doesn't die out fast. The camera takes great pictures too. This is the first phone that I can say I would recomend.
I've upgraded from the Audiovox 8610 which I had for three years. I just wanted a new phone, finally.This phone is really cool. The camera takes decent pictures (if you want nice pictures, buy a real camera!) and you can set the pictures as backgrounds or as caller ID's. You can record voice memos with it, which is also a cool feature. And as for what the other person said, I don't think the phone bends back too far when you're talking on it. And I'm an avid texter, and the buttons are not any smaller than the other phones I've had.Pros:Downloadable games, ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers.Internal AntennaExternal Caller ID / DisplayVery lightweight and slimCons:Cannot put into silent (vibrate) mode when the phone is charging.Pre-loaded games are only demos and can only be played for a minute before it asks you to purchase it.Boring backgrounds/ringtones that come with itOverall, this phone is pretty cool.
I bought this phone about one month ago. I rarely upgreade phones but I really wanted a camera phone so I bought this model because of its price. I now wish I could return it or throw it away. I usually love flip phones because I find their quality to be better but this is not the case with the Cyclops. The red light on the outside flashes constantly which is annoying. When texting the letters often get scrambled because of a software glitch so the message is completely incoherent. I often have to erase and then rewrite it several times. The camera is horrible too. Every picture is either too bright or dark and they are very grainy. In addition, sometimes when I check my pictures the phone just turns off by itself for no reason. I believe this is another software glitch.I would go ahead and spend the extra money on a better model if looking for a phone that you would like to use.
I was looking to upgrade my previous Virgin Mobile phone which was a cheapie when bought and only passable.  I checked these reviews and bought the Cyclops since it had some features I liked.  After activation and waiting more than the time suggested,  I tried to get a signal and make a call, but the signal kept fading out and I was lucky to get one bar every now and then.  Since it wasn't usable from my home, I returned the phone.  My previous Virgin Mobile phone was no great shakes, but at least I could get a decent signal and make a call.  I also have a Sprint phone which is so old it's laughable which gets a decent signal from my home.  I really don't know if it was the Cyclops per se or if I just got a dud.  If you are in a somewhat rural area as I am you might want to consider something other than the Cyclops.
I have Tmobile and I bought the unlocked phone and just traded sim cards from my old phone.  I did lose some of my newer contacts and some archived text messages, but other that that everything has been fine.  Synching to my PC was flawless.  Could be a bit tough for a novice but transfering MP3's is easy.  The keys are VERY touchy, that took getting used to.  There are a lot of things I'm annoyed about but I chalk it up to not being used to the phone yet.  So far it has worked well and I'm happy.  It takes some patience to figure out, but it's a great phone IMO.  My main concern is it's size, I bought a case for it because I'm afraid at the price I'll damage it.  I paid $170 on ebay.So I've been using this phone for a while now.  I still like it. I keep it in my pocket while at work, use it as an alarm clock etc.  The quality of the pictures it takes isn't as good as it could be, especially indoors.  Outdoor shots are much sharper quality with the natural light.  The MP3 player works well but for the price of the phone I'm feeling like it should have more memory.  In any case, I still rate it high after all this time.  I haven't had problems.
I have had this phone in NYC area for about 3 months now. My wife hasCingular (RAZR) and I was going to get that phone as well, but thensaw this one available at the Cingular store and figured I would get it for the looks, andCingular said they support the phone so I thought all would be good.After using it for 3 months, I lose service in A LOT of areas aroundhere, and my wife's phone works fine. I guess it is b/c of all this1900, 850, 900 band issues. If I knew aboutthis problem before purchasing the phone with a 2 year contract, Iwould definitely have gotten a different model instead. Also, I justwent on a trip up to northern Vermont, and my wife's phone neverdropped a call or lost service (Cingular), and I had no service for the wholetrip (Cingular), which was very frustrating trying to do business from the road.I was thinking of getting the battery signal increaser metal strip,but after reading more about the phone, I do not think they will help any?? Ifanyone has any suggestions for me to get a better signal, I wouldappreciate it, as I have paid a lot for this phone that loses a lotof calls daily.
If you're looking for a phone that is the best value for your money, stop reading right here. This phone isn't for you.If, however, you're looking for a functional phone that is attractive and garners a lot of attention from passersby and fashionistas alike, you're in the right place.The Motorola V3i DG is a great phone - it is a RAZR after all. Some people don't like the RAZR because they think it's been played out or overdone, but this phone is unique and has a definite "cool factor". The phone's features are a standard late 2005 or early 2006 featureset - there's an MP3 player, a transflash slot, a camera (that could be a lot better, but that's Motorola for you - it's a phone), a video camera, support for real-song ringtones, and a nice set of screens.If you're looking for a device for e-mail, this probably is not your phone. If you like to text constantly and IM casually and you talk often, this is a great phone for you. My one gripe is that the speaker phone is of a low quality compared to the RAZR I had for Verizon. Other than that, it's an excellently-crafted piece of work.I highly recommend this phone (with the awesome-looking DG case).
This phone I found is over priced, and doesn't work any differently than my mom's razor phone that she got for free from her cell phone provider.  If you want a phone that looks like it belongs to a pimp, by all means buy it.  In the end, it's still a cell phone.  Wasn't worth my time.  Hope I spared you from losing some hard earned cash.  The phone will lose the ringer or not ring at all depending on how you handle the phone.  The buttons on the side are not very ergonomical.  I wish I had read the reviews and saved my money.
This phone is not outrageously expensive and, if you wear a suit and good shoes sometimes, what's wrong with carrying a phone that doesn't make you look as a teenager? I bought D&G; RAZR to replace my ~$600 Treo, because it was too heavy in a pocket and antenna fell out and had to be reattached with crazy glue. Voice quality  and battery life is far better than Treo for half price.
I had this phone for about two months. It has the worst user interface of any phone I have owned. It was obviously designed by some engineer without any notion of what phone users really want to do. After 2 months, when I couldn't get it to redial a phone number I had just called, I took a hammer to it. As  one reviewer said, the two happiest days you have with this phone are when you buy it and when you get rid of it !!! I'll never buy a motorola phone again. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero !
Lets be frank, this is a RAZR after all. It is all blinged out in gold as per the D&G; style but it is a RAZR. The reason I give 4 stars is my wife absolutely adores this phone and she feels it is completely reliable. The phone's features and operation have been more reliable than her previous Silver RAZR so she loves it. The only reason I won't give 5 stars is the fact it is a RAZR and is prone to the normal problems associated with RAZRs. If you want the look, then buy the phone.
I have had this phone since August and I love it. I am constantly complimented on it and people are always curious about it. I have no problems using text messages (someone had said they did) There is a slot for a micro SD card inside the phone (I have a 2GB card) so it doesn't really run slow for me. The phone has additional features a regular razr does not, like airplane mode, iTunes, and what I like best, software that you can transfer pictures to your phone from your computer (make your own wallpaper!) and can make your own ringtones with. Since D&G; designed the phone there are some misspellings in the English lol (like dialled calls, personalise for example). There are times when I don't have signal when I should, but there are also times when I get signal when noone else does (like on the subway) so its a coin toss. All in all I love having th phone. It is definitely for people who love to be noticed and show off, and like having a pimped out phone.
I got this phone because I wanted to change from pay as you go to a subscription plan.  I just took whatever phone the sales person offered me.  I was quite taken aback by the flash of a D&G; gold phone and the implications of having such a high end label.  That is my only complaint.  The quality of the speaker system is excellent.  I love the real song capabilities and the ease of texting.  I have gone from hating texting to texting diva.  I love this phone and have had it since September and have had no problems with the battery or the finish.  The phone will get you noticed, but that's not why I got it.  I recommend this phone as being useful, capable, and efficient.  I'm not a techie, and only use it for texting, alarm clock, listening to tunes, and phone calls.
I have only had this phone for 3 weeks and I love it.I only use it as a phone and a camera.  I send text messages, too.I have not used the web, MP3 player, or speaker yet.It is beautiful.My only complaint is that it seems to get dirty quickly with regular handling.
Well, where do I begin?This phone was given by myself as a present to a dear friend of mine. Text messages are often never received nor sent by this phone to other phones. Also, the phone will be closed in attempted to be dissconnected from a recent phone call - however, more than a few times the phone will not disconnect the call, as if it is still connected to the last caller. At this point the battery must be completely removed and the phone restarted.Also, the phone will randomly say "please insert SIM card" when the SIM card is already inserted into the phone...All in all i was very dissapointed by the money i paid - a very high amount for a cell phone. THe phone has already been in the shop once - and my friend has only had it since christmas.
I do love this phone, and regardless of what another review says its gold not bronze. However if you use tmobile you may have some issues. Firt when you get a voicemail message you will not get a standard alert telling you that you  have a message., You get this blank weird text from '_@' no names, no text just those two characters in the 'from' line., The only way to fix this is to actually download software to hack the phones software itself because tmobile don't go out of their way to fix it or send the updates via text for the phone. Another thing, games from tmobile will not work on this phone, another issue because of tmobile lack of service, but just something to be aware of when buying this unlocked phone. Also when you get this pack ,you do not get the US power charger but rather some asian/euro charger with an adapter. There is also a weird sticker on the box sayng that as soon as you open it motorola no longer are responsible for repairs. Totally weird but anyway...how do you know if you even need repairs unless you open it? I foun this totally insane. I have had no actual damage or problems other than the issues with tmobile voicemail and game functions.I have had mine a few months and haven't had problems with fading, however I do keep it in the eel skin case most of the time. Another thing, the battery doesn't last long on this phone, not compared to other phones I have had.This phone looks great and does work well ...once you sort out a couple of issues.
i love my gold phone. when i first got the black razr, i hated how flimsy it was, i was afraid of sitting on it. then i switched to the slvr, which i totally loved. i loved how sturdy it was and the thinness. however when i got my slvr stolen, i bought the unlocked gold razr. it is similar to the black razr that i had, but this time i actually am not afraid of breaking it, bc i now care for this phone more than the previous two. it may be just the label, or that it is in gold, but i really make sure not the scratch or sit on this phone AT ALL. if you are looking for a replacement phone bc you got yours stolen and have to buy an unlocked GSM phone, i really recommend this one, bc it is only 150 dollars more than a regular unlocked razr. i also recommend this phone if you have a tendency to not care for your phone, bc with this phone you will definitely start caring.
I just received my new Motorola RAZR V3i Dolce & Gabbana Phone (Unlocked)by Motorola.  I use Verizon for my Services.  When I took it there to switch from 1 razor to another - they said they don't support this type of phone.  Would this be true or did the salesperson even know.  My current razor does not have a Sims card.Thank you
I love my dolce and gabbana motorola phone; I have the bluetooth headset and eelskin case too. Come on, if you are into D&G; you might as well do it right. :)  The mp3 sound is great; phone is easy to use and has great features. I recommend it for those who must have.....like me!
A beautiful cellular telephone with more features than the average person will ever use.  We purchased the unlocked cellular for use by my wife (I already had a more masculine cellular) when traveling in South America, rather than paying almost $3.00 per minute for calls through our local carrier.Check on the kids a few times and the telephone is paid for. The telephone charges saved, should justify the steep price of the phone. You can purchase a more economical unlocked phone but there is no way it will look as good as this one.
I bought this phone from Neiman Marcus when it first came out, and it's been about a year now and I have no complaints. It's an awesome phone, both in function and design. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, especially for those fashionistas out there! It's definitely worth buying, in particular now that it is at half the price it was at when it first came out.
day 1 - the day you buy it.day 2 - the day you get rid of it.
The Motorola Razr's hype is based on alot of advertising.  I had one of these for 2 days.  It was horrible.  I couldn't hear people talking to me, so I turned up the volume to maximum and then I was echoing in the background.  I've heard this phone has had nothing problems.It felt soooo good to say "GOODBYE MOTO!"
This phone is great to me, I love all the features that comes with this phone, a luxurious gold and silver finish, megapixel camera and mp3 player with bluetooth connections,video capture/playback,quad-band world phone (850/900/1800/1900 MHz),voice-activated dialing,and you're talk time is up to 4 hours. It doesn't hold memory long but it is very pretty, everyone is always like where did you get your phone i have never seen a phone like that!![...]
This company practices good old chivalry with its clients as well as with potential clients.  This is the phone to have if you want wide eyes open when people see it in your hand.  I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.  Batteries seem to be funny even with the best laptops:  it is a matter of knowing how and when to charge your phone batteries; once you get the trick you'll always see the magic work!
This gold razr is cool looking, but looks too much like some kiddy prize or something and the paint is sure to wear off! so much for a beautiful lookin phone. get the Motorola Razor V3tit is the black one for T-mobileit has a memory card and the motorola symbol on the from flip lights up blue its amazing!!!
I completely agree. This is a trendy phone for those who love to show off. It has some great new features as compared with the older versions of the razr. It's not a PDA or a smart phone and is not intended to be. This is stickly for the fashionistic age, those who want to show of something that not everyone has. As a matter of fact, you won't see anyone carrying this phone where I'm from (MI) and only 2 people have purchased it in the Metro Detroit area so far (me being on of them). So it's rare, and it's nice to have something that no one else has. I love it for what it is. It's way better than the other razrs and the phone mp3 is pretty ok. Especially for the $200 I paid for it. I enjoy this phone and the looks people give me when they see it. So don't buy it if you are into high quality features that a smart phone has to offer, buy it if you want to be flashy and rare! LIKE ME :-)
Same great phone in a great package.  My wife wanted one when we saw them in Ireland in the fall, so I picked it for her Christmas present.  People stop her to ask about the phone and her office if envious.Great gift for the woman who has it all!!!!
Okay I'm actully older reviewing this phone and used the kids forum so I don't have to log on.I'll review who is suppose to use this phone and its quality. But let's just say that this phone does carry the Dolce & Gabbana name. Now their clothing may last long but other things, expect to use it for about a year, this phone will be outdated. Now let's move onto the targeted market for this phone.The targeted market this cellphone was designed for is for those that wear Dolce & Gabbana clothing. Walking around with this phone is suppose to complement your outfit and especially with the D G logos dangling around.Now for the quality. Since this is a Dolce & Gabbana phone we treat it as an accessory. It shouldn't be used everyday nor should it be used to bring to work. This is more like the evening phone when you go somewhere special so complaning about it's quality is kind of.... not smart since this is what this phone was designed for. Now onto the actual v3i phone review.This phones camera is leaps better than the original v3. Even though it is only at 1 megapixel it still produces pictures good enough for the smaller prints. Video record is a shame as usual due to the limited resolution. Video playback on this phone isn't choppy but the phone can't really handle the high framerates. Using this phone as a music player, the quality is there but no where near an mp3 players quality. THe phone offers a micro sd slot and I think you can near around 2gb with these things, but I never cared to purchase one. THe accessories for this phone aren't really that expensive and are very affordable if you compare them to the actual Dolce & Gabbana accessories, not the ones with Dolce & Gabbana and Motorola. The cases run for about 70 dollars I think for the ones with Motorola, and the ones with just Dolce & Gabbana should start at around 255 dollars, and go way higher.  overall this phone does deserve a 5 stars and if you plan on purchasing this phone, you have to know it is just a phone for a night out don't look at those people complaning about this phone saying how slow the os is, i found it just right because you can't really compare it to a smart phone.
This phone has been featured on the Wives of Orange County, people it's old news and played out! Time to come up with a new design. By the time you see it on TV all the other posers already have them. It no longer is original and it's yesterday's fashion. So if you are thinking about buying it don't because it is too late! Fashion moves quickly, you have to move with it!
I saw this phone at saks....not to fond of the Razr , however it caught my eye simply because i own a lot of Dolce and Gabbana clothing. With that said....this is a designer phone, one can choose to buy a hanes cotton t-shirt for 10 bucks or a D&G; with the same feel for 100+ ( same concept applies to this phone  ). If one feels that this phone is out of their price range ( or too expensive ) it's probably because they either can't afford  it, or are quite practical with their money .None the less this  phone can only be appreciated by fans of the designer.  5 stars for design ( i'm bias to this label over all others ). As far as function I enjoy my cingular 8525 pda
I love this phone.  Went from a Motorola RAZR to LG CU500 to this in a very short time and can easily say this phone beats those in a hearbeat in terms of ease of use and looks!If you find its short cuts - which after a week of use you will - you'll see it's extrememly customizable and easy to use.  CNET rated it excellent after their extensive review system and said the only fault they found in it was the 'slippery' keypad - which I have not had any problems with coming from the flat keys of the RAZR.To the person that called this phone upgly, couldn't be more wrong.  Unless you're looking at $600 phones out in the Asia and Europe market right now, there isn't a better looking phone out there!p.s. the white is much more attractive but more feminine.
I have had this phone for a little over a week and I am in love with it. It's so fashionable and functional at the same time. And with bluetooth and iTunes, you can make your own ringtones from any song in your library and then bluetooth it to your phone in the blink of an eye! So cool!! I can't find anything bad to say about the phone --- the MP3 player is awesome with a sweet display --- i bought the extra SD memory card and I have so much room now --- the camera is incredible quality for a phone. 1.3 megapixels turns out to be a 11 x 17  inch photo at 72 dpi. I printed one out and was amazed! My friends are so jealous of this phone and all the stuff it can do. I love the colors on the displays, especially the rainbow color of the numbers! I'm very happy I bought it and you will be too!
I just got my Samsung phone today and I must say that it is the best phone I've had so far. I upgraded from my Razr and the difference is night and day.PROS:1. Lightweigh but still durable enough not to break easily2. Color scheme is perfect3. Camera is better than many other of today's phones4. Can make a call with the slide down5. Easy to navigate menu6. Long battery life7. Great reception8. Volume is sufficient9. Doesn't get dirty easily10. Easy to see iconsCONS:1. Only comes with phone and charger (thought maybe small memory card)2. When first starting out, performing simple tasks may seem difficult. IE. transfering music, photos, videos etc.There are so many good things with this phone that they outweigh the bad. I highly recommend this phone to children who want the music aspect of the phone, and to adults who want a quality phone for a reasonible price.
I got this new phone for christmas and I love it so much. It is so pretty and I get so many compliments on it. The screen is big and bright, and the sound is great. The buttons are easy to use and not too small and it is easy to text. Cool MP3 player and it records audio great, nice, clear speakerphone. The only annoying things is that everytime you press and button it beeps but you can turn it off. The one bad thing that you can't fix is you can't use audio that you've recorded for a ringtone. But other than that this is a GREAT phone. I recommend it for anyone. 5 stars!
I have had this phone for about a month and love it. This phone has everything i need like:- Big Screen < Games are easy to see, and better game play compared to other phopnes with small screens. This phone displays big text wich is way easier to see and can be customizable. >- 1.3 Mega Pixel camera < Pictures are very good for a phone, but not that good to print out. In the other hand 1.3MP is better than VGA >- MP3 Player < Very Good MP3 player ! Speaker is CLEAR and LOUD, but it would have been beter if it was a bit louder. I haven't tried hearing music through the samsund headphones yet.>- Expandable Memory < This phone comes with 18mb of internal memory, wich is more than enough, for games, graphics, ringtones, pictures, and any other data you save on the phone. But, if you plan to have more than 4 full songs on this phone, you will need a Micro SD card. Be aware ! this phone supports up to a 1 GB. I went out to get a 2GB, when i slide the 2GB card on my phone, it showed 998,687K of free memory ( 1,000,000K = 1GB ), and not 2GB, wich is about 1,998,000K. I went to return the 2GB for a 1GB and my phone showed the same amount of free space. >This phone has very good reception, and good call quality. The speaker is a tad low, sometimes it is hard to hear the person you are talking to. Sometimes i have to enable the speaker to hear in loud enviroments, and even that the speaker isn't very loud. The download time for a song from my computer to the phone is about 25 seconds. I have problems trying to transfer songs to my phone because somtimes it doesn't let me. When a song is tranfering, it will stop at 20% and then displays a window wich says: FAILED TO TRANSFER FILE. I have to keep trying this for about 5 times, until it is able to transfer the file, after that i will be able to transfer about 15+ songs until it fails to transfer another song.
I replaced my Razor which had a broken hinge with this phone.  At first I gave it only three stars because I had a lot of trouble getting the phone set up.  It doesn't seem to be near as intuitive as the Razr.  I've got most everything figured out now and I LOVE this phone.  I still think the instruction book is poorly written and there a few things I don't like.  Don't use the mp3 player.  It's just a phone for me.  Don't like that I can't program it not to go the web all the time.  That button is just to easy to push.  Text messaging is great and the phone feels great in your hand.  Love the voice dialing.  I think this phone is a great value as a phone.  And the battery goes on forever.  I used it all day and didn't charge it that night.  I used it for most of the next day until I had a 3 hr phone conversation with a friend.  After the conversation it finally needed a charge.  My razr never had that kind of battery life.
Hello,  This is a very well designed phone, inside and out. First of all, the call quality is very good, although i wish the volume could be a bit louder. Hopefully, this will be addressed with a future firmware update. The voice dialing feature on this phone is amazing. The MP3 player and 1.3 MP camera quality are good, although i prefer to still use my standalone player and camera. The 262k color screen is beautiful, and playing games and surfing the web on it is very enjoyable. I do recommend downloading the free Opera Mini browser so that you will be able to get to more web pages. It works great with this phone.  I have had the black and white version of this phone. The white version has a very nice polished look and feel to it. I have gotten so many compliments on it from co-workers and friends. The black version has a flat finish to it and is pretty sexy too. I found the backlighting on the white version to be a bit brighter than the black version, and for whatever reason, i am getting better reception from the white version. I know the hardware and software are the same on both, so i do not really understand why this is happening.  I gave this phone 4 stars for a few reasons. First, it would have been nice to have gotten a data cable, or memory card, or headphones, or anything extra with this phone. Alot of its competitors include some/all of these accessories with their phone, and i really cannot see myself spending extra money for these things when i already have standalone units. Next, although the issue of the volume "may" be addressed in the future, there is no doubt that right now the volume of calls is a bit too low. The quality is great, but the volume is not. Finally, the amount of accessories available for this phone is pretty low. Where is the love for the D-807?
I just love my phone...  this is the best phone I've had from Cingular/AT&T...;  I haven't had any problems with it...  It's small enough to fit in my pocket...  It holds a lot of pics that I can on the go...  The music sounds great...  A great phone...
I purchased this phone to replace a stolen LG CU500, and after 6 months of use I chose to buy a used one to replace this Samsung. It's a good quality phone and I got tons of compliments on how nice looking it is, but I found it to be WAY too irritating in more ways than one. The keypad is very slippery and required my hand to be at an awkward angle, which made text messaging a chore. I also had issues with the reciever volume not being loud enough. In order to hear while I was driving I had to have my window up, the radio off, and no vents on. In 90 degree heat, this sucks. The camera is nice but I prefered the rotating lense of the LG CU500. I used my LG CU500 to listen to music and for photos frequently but never did on the Samsung because I found the features difficult to use. The browser was also better on the LG. I was unable to access several pages on the Samsung that I was able to on the LG CU 500's 3G network. Overall, it's a good phone, but maybe not for everyone.
As with many others who reviewed this phone, I came from a Motorola RAZR.  The RAZR was great but this phone seemed to be better.  I own the white version and it looks super!  The voiceCommand feature really understands what you're saying.  It allows you to access nearly any of the features of the phone using only voice commands!  The feature understands any user, which means anyone can use the feature.  The one hangup I have is that according to Samsung (I called their help line), the phone CANNOT USE SAVED MP3S AS RINGTONES!!  The only way to use them is if you PURCHASE the ringtone from online.  Despite the useful expandable memory card slot, you can't use your already saved audio files as ringtones.  Aside from that, I'm very happy with it.  (If I had known about the one limitation, I would not have purchased it)
This phone looks great has good features and is easy to use. The design of the phone is great. The numbers when dialing are large and easy to read on the screen. Entering new contact numbers is very easy. I got this phone after using a Motorola Razr which was up till this phone my favorite. The battery was really good on my Razr and the durability was excellent. That is why I didn't give this phone 5 stars at this time it still remains to be seen how durable the phone is and that is very important. If this phone can hold up over time it will be the best phone I've ever had.
This is the one of best phone I ever had. Looks pretty with the decent color and the unique design.
I just recieved this phone today for a birthday present. I was upgrading from the Sony Ericsson Z525a. I have no bad comments for this phone. It can hold a lot of pictures and music when you have a memory card (which i have). I would recommend this phone to anybody who wants something different from the razr (which everybody at my school has) and something that is easy to operate. It sounds like an Mp3 Player and has excellent call volume. This is a phone that everybody should have!
We had this phone since Nov. 2006. The phone broke in 2 this week, the top portion broke from the bottom portion. So no problem, since there is a 1 year warranty on the phone right? Wrong!!! Samsung says the phone can't be repaired, and the warranty is only for repairing the phone, not replacing it. They said we will have to BUY a new phone. So beware when buying Samsung products.
I jus got dis phone today from cingular. I replaced it with mii RAZR, which i gave to mii mom. The screen is awesome and is sooo bright compared to the RAZR. The features r great and r fun to use. I recomend dis phone to teenagers. It is a beautiful phone and is affordable. I LOVE DIS PHONE !!!!!!
Just got this phone and I like it. It is a little quirky though when you first set it up.It is more difficult to set up the speed dials than the Nokia 3220 or the Nokia 6010. You have to go under profiles to do it. On the Nokia 3200 or 6010 you just hold down the button you want to set up the speed dial on and it prompts you automatically to set it up. Not on the 7610.To adjust the ringing tones and the volume, you also have to set it up under profiles. If you just search under Settings and Sounds, there's nothing there and you will assume this phone comes with only one ringing tone. It doesn't.I got my phone with a Chinese (I should say Asian, I don't really know what language it is) manual, but I found the English manual online easy enough.In order to receive MMS you have to set it up on the phone. I haven't yet figured out how to get there, but I'm working on it.The manual does not give step-by-step instructions. It tends to skip one or two steps and you have to figure it out by yourself.There is no way to set up the Menu button on the selection button. That's frustrating.I don't listen to music on this phone and I'm not into ringtones so I can't say anything about that. I just use it as a regular good ole' phone.It is bigger than I thought, definitely bigger than my old Nokia 3220. The camera is better.When you take a photo though, it doesn't save it under Gallery like you'd think. It saves the photo under the Camera option. If you want to set up a photo as the wallpaper, you have to move the photo from the Camera to the Gallery and set it up from there. There is no option to set up a screen saver.The buttons are hard plastic. I don't really like that.The volume on the handset is good but the speaker volume is awful.All in all I do like it, even with the quirks.I do love Nokia phones and will keep buying them.
Good points:-Works well with Cingular sim card/network-People comment on its attractiveness, looks cool when people call and when you first call someoneBad points:-Reception is no better than the free phone I got a year ago when I got my cell phone plan (although admittedly, it just may be I have a problem with Cingular in my area of Seattle)-Defaults on the phone need to be tinkered with, and not all menus are all that intuitive, takes some monkeying to change some features - and the ringtones that come with it are pretty limited-As pointed out, camera doesn't take great pictures, but few cell phones doOverall, I do sometimes get irritated with it, but would probably still get it again, because it really is that attractive of a phone.
This is a great phone but for some reason it keeps shutting off and then turning back on and says Searching.  I think it might have something to do with T-Mobile.  Just wanted to warn people that are checking this phone out and also have T-Mobile.
Well, I have o say this is the best mobile I ever had, and I've had lot of them. I've been hesitating about buying a Sony-Ericsson, because I had a bad experience when the T10 (Ericsson) and T25 (Sony-Ericsson) came out, but this phone is awesome. It comes with a lot of features and besides that, everybody that see my phone gets amazed by its design, it's just BEAUTIFUL and it's so attonishing that everybody likes. Besides that it's not so expensive, I bought it for $300 and I feel it has been a good buying. I recommend it!
This phone is NOT Quad band - it does *not* support GSM 850.
I just upgraded from a RAZR phone, and this new KRAZR is exceptionally nice. The phone has great reception, the sound quality & volumn are very good, the menus are very easy to get around,it fits your face well (not too short as many phones now are) and operating the phone is simple. This phone is clearly evident of Motorola's evolution in the cell-phone industry.  By the way, you can customize the "soft-keys" to be whatever you want them to be. Likewise, you can customize the menus to appear as you would like.  They have really thought of the user and have made this phone very User Friendly as well.  It seems that the majority of the people I talk to aren't as interested in "whistles & bells" as much as they just want a plain old GOOD phone.  This is it!  However, if you want more, you can load your MP3 music on to it, you can use the calendar, you can take a picture, and if you are really adventurous, you can access the internet, and also retreive your email! By the way, this phone is capable of taking advantage of the Cingular/AT&T; EDGE network which gives you 'faster than usual' internet.  I highly recommend this Good Looking, Well Working phone.
I hung on to my old v60i in the hope that Motorola would fix their user interface, this one is substantially different, but the bad features of the v60i remain. The side buttons.As of 5/22/08 I'm about ready to hurl this from the roof. The UI is just too inconvenient. I've also had to replace the battery once.6/13/08 Enough already! I replaced it with a Nokia E51. On the E51 the side buttons are not too sensitive, they require deliberate use, and all buttons are automatically locked after a timeout period anyway. The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone (GSM quad band, WCDMA dual band, 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I haven't found yet). I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other, but I'll be replacing that and the daughter's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51's data capabilities; why would I inflict on her what I wasn't happy with myself?Let's do the good first: The voice quality in both directions is good, the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging. I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week. The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone. Signal handling is much better, it holds on to calls that AT&T; could previously be relied on to drop, but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell, though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone (symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out). For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable, I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT&T; to roam to Europe. The music player is fine, but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones, which you can't use on a plane, or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone. It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.The not so good: The iTap text entry is slow and not as good as the old version, whatever that was called. I guess I'll eventually get used to iTap, but the old predictive text had some advantages.The Ugly: the joker who came up with these side buttons that can't be disabled should be fired. It's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry (below) or, with a bit more of a rubbing motion, switch the ringer from one more to another. So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie. Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent. Somehow. Then there's the voice entry, the best you could say is that it's not good. If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say "say a command". Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book. Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard. It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.But would I buy it again? Yes. There aren't many neat phones like this and if there's another one with quad band GSM too I didn't find it.But if someone comes out with a quad band GSM phone with good signal handling and no side buttons you'll see my KRZR on Ebay the next day.
This particular unlocked version seems thinner than the ones being sold by cell phone carriers. My initial impression was this phone was very tiny. It is smaller than the RAZR V3 in overall dimensions. I use this unlocked phone with Cingular in the Los Angeles area.The good:1)Small and cool looking. Most people who have seen it seems to be enamored with its design and form factor. It is definitely an eye catcher.2)Call quality is great. The volume can be turned on VERY loud. So if you are hard of hearing or just like to hear loud voices over the phone, then this phone will probably fit the bill.3)Speaker phone. Motorola managed to incorporate a great pair of speaker phones. It is loud and clear enough to have a conference call in a small room full of people.4)Comes with more than basic ring tones. It comes with several (around 12) musical ring tones. Better yet, the ring tones comes out in a full stereo mode (or at least sounds like it).5)Camera is good (2MP). Although it will not replace your digicam, it will be more than adequate for emergency uses.6)Battery life. My informal test on this is that it can handle upto 4-5 hours of talk time.The Bad (mostly due to it is unlocked):1)You need to configure EVERYTHING on the phone. Nothing comes preconfigured. This includes the default language, time, date, voicemail, email, IM etc. This can get rather tedious since Cingular does not support unlocked phones.2)You may lose some functionalities. For example, I have noticed my web browser functionalities do not work with my cingular SIM card. This is no biggie for me since I never browse the web using my phone
I have owned a number of phones over the course of the last couple of years.  Recently (within the last 3 months) I have tried the Samsung, Chocolate and LG VX8600.PhoneCall quality is much better than what I experienced with the LG.  The LG sounded muffled to people on the other end when I was talking with them.  Those same people now say that this phone is great.  Much crisper.  Reception is also better than the LG, which does surprise me.CameraHey it is a camera phone!  It does what it is designed to do.MusicThe phone uses a mini-SD card.  Works great.  No bogging down of the processor as I experienced with the Samsung.TextingI like the iTap better than LG's version.  There seem to be more words loaded into the dictionary.BluetoothI am currently using a plantronics 655 Bluetooth headset. Call quality is excellent and much better than the 8600.So far it is a keeper!
Just as a phone, the KRZR K1 works great. It has clear sound even in low signal situations and the speakerphone is excellent.The camera is adequate but not stellar.  The games are in Chinese and so unplayable unless you know that language.It won't work with Phone Tools 4.35 and isn't supported by the US Motorola support.  I could get the software to recognize the phone but itrefused to sync until I updated the phone firmware.Motorola support (the KRZR specific support number) told me that there was new firmware but that the only way I could get to it was to navigate through Motorola's Chinese language web site.  The support people could not email me or send me a direct link to the firmware because it is "an international phone".Update:  I thought I would add an update to mention that the latest Macintosh OS (OSX 1.4.9) has added support for this phone to their iSync software and it works flawlessly.  So that makes this, in my opinion, a pretty good phone for Mac users or those who don't want to synchronize it with anything.
Received the phone from the Cingular folks.  Had a RAZR V3 before this, and like the slimmer body and upgraded styling.  As a non-tech type, operating the thing wasn't as intuitive as I would have liked, I had to refer to the manual many times to set it up and surf the web to figure out how to get it to work with Mobile Phone Tools.  The best thing about it is the style and provision of basic phone functions (calling, camera, e-mail and music) without being a big behemoth treo-like organizer.  I still cannot figure out how to save pictures and videos to the micro SD, the phone says there isn't enough space, but there is.  A few other bugs too, hopefully there will be more support and info on the web in the months to come.
Purchased the phone for my wife.  Charged it up, popped the SIM card in, and away she went, no problems with voice!  However, because it is an unlocked phone not tied to any provider, you will need to setup the phone for internet access (for downloads of ringtones, games, basic internet stuff).  Depending upon your wireless service provider, you may also need to update the firmware from Motorola's website.  I am with AT&T;/Cingular and had to manually input the WWW settings to get it to work (available online at various sites other that AT&T;/Cingular), and call customer support to update the IMEI on the account.  Customer support and my local AT&T; store were really no help setting up internet - do a google search for unlocked phone Cingular media.net settings and you will get several pages to help you set it up.  The interesting bit that we found with this unlocked phone is that it is an exportable phone, meaning the voice commands are in British English, not American English, so many of the phonetics are different.  However, for my wife, this works to her advantage as she is British, so we found the perfect phone for her.  She is very happy with this phone.
I have wanted a blue KRZR K1 for over a year and I finally have one. Mine was an unlocked European one purchsed from tigerdirect.ca since I am canadian.What can I say about this phone? I didn't really take much time to mess around with the native firmware. I researched everything I could find out about this phone ahead of time before I made my final decision on purchasing it. I have owned a lot of motorola phones, and all have been great,...the K1 never disappoints, if you are keen on doing some tweaking. Back to where I said I never messed around with the native firmware: while researching I found that there are a few motorola mod websites out there...and people who are just as gadget savvy as I am, have released updated monsterpacks (newer and more customized, unbranded firmware) for this phone. I flashed the phone with the brand new monsterpack I downloaded and the phone is now EXCELLENT. Any issues with the os being slow or buggy are completely erased. I have skins installed that make my phone similar to the iphone interface which is pretty neat....plus with any other installed skins, I can change the look of the phone's os on the fly. My audio player has been updated, nicer font, more installed programs...just everything is all around better...making MY KRZR K1 the most envied phone in my area. The picture taking quality is really great compared to other phones.....I also have a 1 gig mini sd card with a ton of songs on it (that can also be used as ringtones). With a set of headphones, the sound is phenomenal. I have music videos and even a whole movie on my storage card and they all play great! The great thing about having an unlocked phone is that you can use the data cable and install free programs off of websites like getjar.com. Better web browsers, instant messengers, and even applications to make this phone as close to a pda that you can get. Add the syncing with outlook and setting your reminders, the K1 can be a wonderful phone. You just have to be willing to put in the time to learn about the phone, and willing to have no fear and mess around with p2k editors, java apps and the like. The phone is a great phone even with the native properties, but it is a bit simplistic with the native firmware. If you are willing to pimp it up with mods and the like, you definitely won't be disappointed. If you have an unlocked K1, make sure you get the gprs settings from your cell service provider in order to get internet/gprs functionalities to work. A great place to go to is howardforums.com. A lot of the settings are already on this site, just use the search function.
this phone has all the features you could possibly want in a phone.  it's sleek, very good looking and easy to use.  the one caution i would make is that this model does not include the 3 touch-sensitive keys on the face of the phone that the K1M has.  i don't believe the K1M is available unlocked yet, though, so unless you want a plan as well, this is just something you have to live with for now.
First, I'm a guy with large hands - when I position my thumb over the keypad, I cover up all of the keys - from both the 2 & # on down to the 0 and #. I've never had a mis-pressed key. But I've seen the "small keys" comments and that was my biggest fear in purchasing the phone. If you can use a cell phone - you'll be OK.The speaker is surprisingly clear. However, when I slide the phone into my back jeans pocket with the speaker slot facing me - I cannot hear it at all.  BUT - in any other position the speaker is quite loud and clear.The form factor is, in my opinion, GREAT. It's small, till you flip it open, then it feels more like a 'real' phone with a mouthpiece near your mouth.I bought an unlocked version it wound up coming from Italy. I had to change the language before first use and that was slightly confusing.I read comments about fingerprints on the faceplate, and thought it was a little odd, "who cares about fingerprints", I thought to myself.  But, they are annoying. The surface is so shiny and perfect that the smudges and prints make it look dirty.The camera takes nice pictures.  It's 2 mega-pixel so it's not a digital camera - but it's not really bad either.I am in the process of trying to get different software for the system from a motox forum.  They seem to have modified and unsupported versions that might be better than the default version which seems limited.Finding drivers to attach this thing to your PC can be challenging.  I run win2k and haven't been able to access the phone from my home PC.  Fortunately, I run XP on my laptop and was able to use their proprietary software & drivers to access the phone.I got my phone with the $10 extra bluetooth headset (kit).  It was well worth it. The bluetooth works very well and the ear piece is nice.Someone mentioned that the menu response is slow.  It is, but it isn't so slow that it's a bother.  I dislike the current programming (which may be different with different carriers) because I can't make the MP3 player software available from the main menu.I am disappointed so far in the fact that it DOES NOT serve as a USB mass storage device.  You seem to need the driver for _phone_ in order to access files on the phone.  I've also purchased the 2gig microSD flash card for additional storage.  If you plan to use any extra feature (mp3s, photos, video) - I would recommend getting it. They can be found for less than $30.It also appears that you can get developers software to write your own java applets from developer motorola com.  So if you're techie - that might be fun.I can't give it a sincere durability rating yet, but its sat in my back pocket of my jeans without damage so far (200lb guy sitting on it).  I haven't dropped it to the ground, or dropped it in water yet, but that will happen.  I hope it survives.I've no complaints about battery life yet - though I haven't pushed it to see how long I could go without re-charging it. So far, it's been getting semi-nightly charges - I don't tend to talk on it 'all day' though.Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase, but not 100% - so I give it 4 stars.
I just received my KRZR K1 yesterday and I love it. It's very sleek and elegant feeling. My only "issue" with it would be that it's so new that T-Mobile's "T-Zones" doesn't entirely support it. Some games are not downloadable, (including my Favorite- Bejeweled) and at this point, NO Mega Tunes OR Hi-Fi ringers can be downloaded from T-Zones. Disappointing, but the phone does come with a wide variety of ring-tones to choose from.The games loaded on the phone are partially chinese and partially in English, which takes most of the fun out of it for me.However, these are small issues that I believe will eventually be resolved.It comes with a USB connector, but does not come with the required software, so the USB connector is useless. So far I can't find the software anywhere on the internet. Still looking.It can download Mp3's, but the site it downloads from is in Chinese, so that's a bit of a problem....The phone itself works perfectly, it's just that all the extras that make this phone expensive don't work here yet, or aren't supported in the US.If you want to LOOK like you're on the cutting edge, buy this phone. If you want to actualy BE on the cutting edge, you might look at other options until this one has more US Support.
In 9 months I went through 4! of these phones. Key pad #5 on first one didn't work properly I exchange the phone after 3 weeks. Second phone after few months went totally dead few times for no reason, or there was absolutely no sound which meant missed calls or I couldn't make a phone call. It was replaced under warranty for refurbished one. After only 2 weeks same thing as with second one  happened with this one. Received refurbished replacement under warranty #4. Right from the box 4 key pads didn't work. Is this coincidence? Otherwise phone is stylish, beautiful, with very good reception. Camera is not that good. I really like it when it works and because reliability is very important for me and I had so many defective ones I can't give it more stars. My previous phone was Nokia and I had it for 5 years without single problem. I even dropped it, and it worked with cracked display for 2 years without problem. I'll never buy Motorola again.
This phone gets exellent reception and call volume quality. However, there are other phones that gets you the same thing for much cheaper. The extra bells and whistles on this phone did not work for me.1. This phone could not be recognized by my computer via a USB device. So it rendered my Motorolla Phone Tool program useless. I did some research and found this to be a common problem with the KRZR. So inorder to have custom ringtone, I had to spend an extra $50 on a MicroSD card and connect that directly into my PC and then put it back inside the phone.2. No internet for AT&T;/Cingular. I bought this phone unlocked and called in Cingular to get internet access on it. They gave me a link to change my settings. I did that and the internet was still stuck on "Lauching Browser" everytime I tried to get it online. I called them again and they told me there was nothing I could do because the phone was bought unlocked. But I had no problem getting my unlocked V3 online a few months ago.So basically, this phone is superb when it comes to getting clear calls and good reception, much better than the V3. But when it comes to other essentials, it leaves much to be desired.
I got this phone just recently because I wanted a new phone and I couldn't wait until I'm due for upgrade. I love it! Everything works fine the only thing I'm disappointed of is I cannot access Internet or media net because it's unlocked. I've checked with my Provider and they said they couldn't do it because it's unlocked. All in all this phone works great!
I've had this phone for 3 days now, and I am extremely happy.  My previous phone was a Motorola RAZR, which recently met its maker.  The KRZR has stronger signal and better reception, and automatically worked when I put in my Cingular SIM card and powered it on.  Its dimensions are similar to the RAZR, and is more visually appealing.  My wife already wants one for herself.The only caveat is that this phone is from Hong Kong.  Everything is in English, except the java games (which include Sandoku and some kind of English to Cantonese translator).
Well packaged and arrived in very good condition.  Very sleek and stylish looking phone.  Now that my fiancee has got the hang of the various features he loves this phone and has no complaints whatsoever.  Would definitely purchase another one.
I was very hesitant buying an unlocked phone over the internet and from a distributor that I was unfamiliar with, but my experience was great.  I wanted to purchase a phone that I could use  with my current phone plan that I could just put my sims card in and it would work, that's exactly what I got. And, I didn't have to extend my contract.I had to do a little research to make sure that it would work with my sims card.  The reviews that were on Amazon were very helpful in helping me pick the right phone that accepted the correct signal (not sure that's what it's called).I received my phone in a very timely fashion and it worked as soon as I put my card in.  It will be a great surprise gift for my husband.
The phone has met my expectations.  It's only been a few weeks since receiving the Motorola KRZR but so far so good.  I'm always pleased with Amazon's response time and shipping time, not to mention the follow up emails.Many Thanks
I had low expectations about this phone, but when I opened it for the first time I knew it was ment to be mine. I could not want any other phone than this one. It has all the features I want and its very cool, modern and at a very good price.
The krzr looks pretty sleek, but i find it a bit bulky.  Though it's slim, it's kind of thick and long.  I used to have a razr, which i find less bulky because it was flatter.I don't know if it's just a defect in my krzr, but I can't navigate through the phone book.  When I punch in a "m" the phone doesn't do anything, and I'd have to scroll all the way down the phone list.The one thing that's pretty sweet about this Motorola is that you can have multiple numbers for one person (unlike all the other Motorola phones).  To deal with the lack of navigation, I assigned each of my numbers to a group, which helps me get to a number faster.Besides that little defect, I think that the krzr is okay, but i think i like my razr more.
I'm not someone who finds himself phone shopping very often, and really liked my last Nokia... but it went thru the wash and wasn't salvageable. So I went shopping. I hate the phones the networks have at the stores, I wanted something different, something with pizazz!I really love this phone - smaller than anticipated, but very much the scale that I prefer.  Key features that I find a 'must have' in any phone is multi number contacts and speakerphone.  This does both and then some.  I was debating between the blue and the silver - and went with the blue, and I'm glad I did.  However, it is very very susceptible to fingerprints, so I highly recommend the BodyGlove Cellsuit to keep it nice and free of smears.  This is an unlocked phone, so the keypad and some of the programming is not US only - the dictionary for example is in Chinese I believe.  It comes with a wide array of ring tones and the sound quality exceeded expectations.  The camera also exceeds expectations and has a picture editor on board - cheesey frames, b&w;, brightness, sharpness and sepia - but these functions do eat up battery life quickly.I am very much a Nokia man, and have been hesitant to buy Motorola, but Nokia currently has nothing that interests me, style wise and the 2 gig micro sd ability intrigued me... by the way, have I told you how much I love this phone?  I have yet to find a flaw.
It is a very good phone. very light and compact. also versitile. like the mp3 songs that can be stored on the phone. the camera and video camera are very nice as well.
i bought this phone from them, i was sooo excited because i use my phone for work and my current phone is a POS and it has stopped working, so i opted for overnight shipping,  the phone arrived as described, i plugged it in and inserted my SIM card, only to find out that my screen doesnt work,  it makes phone calls, but i cant see anything.  i pressed the buttons on the side thinking it might be the contrast only to find out its yelling at me in french! i went to the website to find a customer service phone number, but to no avail, i had to email.  so i hope i can get this straightened out and get a working phone.  this experience has left me without a phone.
Hooked it up with Cingular without any problems.I bought this phone for my mother, she's not very good with "technical" things but so far this phone has been very user friendly and easy to use. Reception has been great and battery lasts long.Complaints are the buttons are so small you end up pushing things by mistake. For my mother being a woman, she doesnt have this problem as much as me. Better for small hands.Being this phone is the international version it does have some weird characters on the keys. Ive read some complaints about this before I bought the phone but to be honest they are nothing to complain about and you dont even notice them after awhile. It still has the normal abc printed on the keys along with those weird characters so no worries when texting.Volume is EXCELLENT! I dont like how it has a seperate volume function for when you are previewing ring tones though, thought that was kind of unnesessary. It was accidently turned down all the way and took forever to figure out why it rings fine but I couldnt hear anything when previewing the ring tones and MP3's.Bluetooth works good so far no complaints.Camera is 2MP and takes great shots. Also the screen is nice and bright.Overall a great phone but I think more suited for a womans hands than a mans.Oh yes does NOT have the fast foward, play, pause, and rewind touch sensative buttons on the outside like the Verizon version.
I switched from the RAZR to the KRZR because of the more narrow design.  It's pretty much the same phone in different packaging.  I've had no problems with the KRZR.  The only complaint is that when I have it on vibrate mode and it's in my pocket, I don't feel it vibrate at all.
I owned the RAZR and then it seemed like everyone had one. Along comes the KRZR. I just had to have it. It is an object of beauty. It has an Apple "polycarbonate feel" to it. Sound quality is really good. Motorola could fix up the TEXT features. They still are not as good as Nokia. Since my RAZR I am now a Motorola junkie.Only downside - the shiny surface gets finger printed too easily - I keep a microfibre cloth at the ready.
Just ordered this phone and am returning it because there are foreign characters (I think Chinese) above each number on the keypad. Its distracting when you are dialing or texting. If you look really closely at the larger picture of the keypad (on this product page) you can just make them out.  At any rate, I thought I'd let people know.  I ordered another one from TigerDirect and hopefully won't have the same problem with that one.Update - the TigerDirect one had the same problem with the keypad.  Am returning that and ordering from the Motorola website.  Hope that one is fine.
This is a fantastic piece of motorola looks great and it's the samllest cellphone in the market, good camera.. a little slow software but it isn't a problem..
Seriously, I dont recommend this phone. . . the only good thing is its looks. its all show and no go. . . I bought it because i broke my old phone (nokia 5300) but this phone was so bad i decided to go back to my broke phone.. which I now fixed. This phone also has horrible functionality as far as mp3 players go. the speed of navigation is horrible because of horrible layout and the fact that the processing capabilities are horrible(waayyyyy too slow)Im giving it two starts one for the sleek look, and one for the 2mp camera, which you can still find on ALOT of other phones.
I ordered this phone thinking it was the real deal but then to find out it's an european phone and can not receive downloads or pictures. What is the sense of having a camera phone you cannot share pictures, download ringtones or games of your choice.I suggest if you want this phone with all the features you get it directly from the manufacturer or a cell phone store. This was a gift for my husband and was emabarresed when I found out all of this by taking it to a Cingular store, yes I paid cheaper but was not given the full description of what I was getting.
Sure the phone looks cool but the V3xx razor blows this thing away specification wise.  Why the Goforce 4800GPU was not included in this phone is beyond me.  Also why is there a measly 66mhz processor in this when the V3xx/Maxx have a 247mhz(Arm9)?  The screen is a smaller resolution QCIF compared to the QVGA of the V3xx too.  I mean the only upside I could see it the 2MP camera on this phone.  It also only supports EDGE which the V3xx supports the much faster 3G HDSPA/UMTS.  If you are big on fashion and not specs then this is the phone for you.  A much better phone would be the V3xx 3G phone or wait for the Krazr K3.  One last not why is this thing still called a razr?  It is not thin and that is the point of the razr phones.Look at the jbencmark comparison's[...]
After I bought and receive this phone I realize than the only languages for the menus and Text input available are English and others (Japanese, Mandarin o Korean)The video has a good quality and I could have a good shoot, but with the pictures even when the image has a resolution of 2mp all the pictures looks with blur.
Este teléfono tiene un gran estilo, es sencillo de usar, tiene buena calidad de sonido, buena cámara, y otro montón de atributos que lo hacen una muy buena compra, sin embargo, es un poco lento al iniciarse, procesar imágenes, etc., quizá un procesador mas rápido lo haría una mejor inversión. Además si le pudieran agregar algunos campos a los contactos, para adicionar información, seria excelente y por último que al colocar el cumpleaños de un contacto este se sincronizara automáticamente con el calendario.Por otra parte el Software Motorota Phone Tools que vino con el teléfono, no reconoce este modelo, ese si creo que fue un cabezazo de parte de esta gente, tremendo pelón.
I have not used this phone yet.  However, I just ordered the KRZR K1m (CDMA) from Alltel (through our corporate sales outlet)and a few hours later, the sales person called to advice this model has been recalled and will be re-released about a week later.  Apparently, Motorola has heard the complaints noted in some of the reviews here.  I hope this helps anyone considering buying one of these phones.
The phone was delivered on time with no delay. It came on the original box with all others stuffs such as manuals, guarantee etc. I recommend this seller.
The product arrived in a sealed box which I was unable to get to for a couple of weeks, three to be exact post acceptance of delivery.  Upon attempting to charge and power up, discovered it was dead on arrival.Now I must return and somehow get this resolved.
I bought this for for my daughter for graduation, no one else had it for sale, not even sony ericsson!  She was going to settle for a differerent one and very disappointed. She was so excited.  The phone works great and does support the 850 band width. If it didn't it would not work on our site. My network transmitts at 850. I had a phone that did not have the 850 and did not work on our network. This is a great looking phone!!
Works as advertised - after struggling for a few hour to change the installed regional language from Polish cyrilic (!!!) @#$%^&* to English. Since one has to use menus and sub-menus to reach the correct function it was a real challenge. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
I abosolutely love my ORANGE PEBL U6 phone.  I can't seem to stop looking at it, and customising it...This phone is all I want in a cell phone..the sexy look, feel, and color and not to mention my "cat meow" ringtone, keeps heads turned and wondering where did you get that phone.  I initially bought a RAZAR...boo hoo definatly not all it is cracked up to be.  It comes in a few other colors lime green, burgandy, black, blue...If you are looking to purchase something that stands out, this is it!!!!!!!.  CONS: number pad attracts lots of smudges, constantly cleaning it and not a mega pix camera..still well worth it.Roxanne
This item was not at all like it was described. I do not buy anything refurbished unless it is guaranteed "like new". This telephone looked like it really had been through the ringer. Furthermore it came with a little xeroxed pamphlet that left out a whole bunch of applications that the cell has, so I have to trial and error a lot of stuff. I would say rather than buy a used cell, pay the extra $50.00 and get a brand new one. Lastly, there is no way to insert a security lock on phone and previous owners "films" are still on the phone and I can't erase them.
I love this phone. I love it so much when, having had it for just two weeks and accidentally immersing it in seawater so that it died, I bought another one. My original one was a free upgrade but after two weeks I was willing to spend £100 on a replacement. I liked it that much.I've now had my PEBL for over six months. I still love it, but some of its limitations have become apparent. I'll list the pros and cons and you can judge for yourself.**Pro the PEBL**It's a clamshell - why would anyone ever buy a phone that isn't a clamshell and risk phoning someone up when kicking their bag in a pub (yes, I did this with a normal phone, but fortunately phoned the friend I was in the pub with so we realised; saved a huge bill!)?Beautiful design and, as yet, I haven't found it at all flimsyThat fantastic opening manoeuvre which is just so coolSome good standard ringtonesBattery life seems fineMenus are reasonably customisable and there are lots of useful optionsThe phone is lightweight, fits in a lady's pocket and that smooth shape works wellReception seems fine wherever I use it and it's always easy to hear people and for them to hear me**Cons for the PEBL**The camera is really pants. The one on my previous Samsung was 10 times better and that was an older phone. The video feature is equally pants.Texting can be slow... you type quite far ahead of the actual phone sometimes, and I'm no speedy teenager at textingThe software that came with the phone doesn't work with my PC running WinXP (I think this is a conflict with my computer as it is meant to work); however, I have some other Bluetooth software which will work for transferring files and stuff, I just can't use all the address book features that are in the proper softwareThe main thing about this phone for me is the good design and it's very easy to live with. Despite the poor quality of photos I still give it 5 stars because I think it's that good. It won't suit everyone but that's why there are hundreds of different models of phone out there!
I love the actual product but I couldnt access my voicemail by pressing 1 like ALL other phones can and I cant log onto the internet with TMOBILE from this phone. I just wish I would have known that.
This has to be the absolute worst phone in the world.  Menus suck, reception is lousy, it has problems with bluetooth signal quality and is constantly telling me to switch to the handset, the battery life is good for about an hour or two at most of talking, the keypad is hard to use because the directional pad has an awkward shape.  I go this phone for free and hate it!  I will glady pay money to get a phone that I feel is functional.  The only good thing about it is the fact that it has a nice one handed opening mechanism.  Thats it.  There is nothing else worthy of even mentioning of this unfortunate waste of plastic.
What's bad to say about the Pebl. Nothing!!!! I love this phone. Great speedy service, thanks!!!
I have had this phone for over a year now. I love how it feels in the hand; MUCH better than my husbands RAZR! I was happy to find a phone in my favorite color, and the green is wearing well.I have not had any problems with this phone, although I have had some issues getting the software on my computer.It's a fully functional cellphone, the equal of my husband's RAZR and better than the Nokia I had before it.I don't understand why the PEBL isn't more popular, honestly!
Honestly, I own this phone in black and I've had it for a year and it is a great phone. I hated my razr and bought this unlocked from Motorola's website. Other than the issues of having to program all the gateways and codes for your carrier so that the texting and multimedia messages will work, everything is great. I highly recommend this phone.
FAST, RELIABLE, COMPLETE, IN THE RIGHT COLOR, NO PROBLEMS. THIS SELLER DELIVERS!!!!!!!!!  VERY VERY SATISFIED.
okay ihave soooo many problemes with this phone and there not the dumb problemes stupid ceos complain about[i swear some of the most stupidest complaints i have ever seen!] i have had this phone for only a month and a half! i dropped a few times and one hard time at a subway resturant now it turns self ever 5 second[litterally!] and drops almost all of my calls. has horrible pictures from the camera. cant set your own speed dial it goes according to first letters, so if u have a friend named tyler, sean, or walter u  ALWAYS have to go to the phone book and look them up. wont even charge now b/c of this stupid turnig itself off deal. If your a gamer i dont recommed this phone b/c u cant downlad games i was highly  dissappointed about that. sometimes when somebody is trying to call me i will flip open the phone and it will automatically will either just keep vibrating, will make this horribble siren noise, or just drop it all together.and to make the phone turn back on or stop doing this i would have to take the battery out and put it back in, so now my battery cover comes off all the time now from me having to do that so much. now if your a person who is somewhat clumsy or drops there phone every once in a while i strongly suggest u not to get this phone. and if your person who is not that i still dont reccomed this phone b/c its just a bad phone overall.
For $10 more, upgrade to an N80 w/ uPNP, video calling, WiFi, bar code reader, MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Safari browser, higher resolution screen
This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.The phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars.
beautiful phone with a great camera and easy to use web browser.  i was really impressed by the sound quality.  just note that you can get it for cheaper at [...] (or elsewhere).
Positives:Great screen display (its best feature for which I have bought it)Intuitive and easily customizable software applications (when functional - see below)Clear audio sound and great/loud speaker systemVery compact and good looking overallDecent battery lifeNegatives:Keypad could be biggerCamera (for which you pay a high price premium) adds years to faces (but is ok on still objects); there's a delay in image capturing (i.e. what you see captured may not end up being what ultimately gets saved as your photo)Software glitches (i.e. attempting to set up the alarm clock would trigger a system error - problem fixed after performing a factory settings reset)Weaker signal capturing abilities than my old Nokia
First, let me apologize to the seller (TigerDirect), I removed my feedback by mistake. The item was promptly shipped and arrived in perfect condition.Second, I love this phone. I am still trying to familiarize myself with its features. It has been awhile since I used a Nokia phone (I've been using a Sony Ericsson for the past 2 years) so I sometimes press the wrong button.
I needed this phone in a hurry and Amazon came thru.  Great phone,great pictures and fast service.  What else do you need  to get around in the world today. Thanks
I will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned.Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear.
after 2 years of using my n-gage qd it finally broke down so i needed a better phone as a replacement, my friend had the n-70 n i was blown away by it, i researched the nokia n-series, i really wanted to buy the n-95 but i change my mind since it was way too much so i bought the n-73. i had it for a day, its a very nice phone, good call quality, nice camera n yeh it takes good pics for a 3 megapixel, the speaker is pretty good too, to me it sound the same as my sony walkman, well like most symbian operating system it has problems too, earlier i couldn't send any text message so i just reinstal the firmware n viola it works well actually it wasnt that easy i had to experiment with it until i did just that but anyways its a good phone for the price.pros:-camera (nice picture quality)-call quality (crystal clear)-speaker (good, sound the same as my sony walkman)-light sensor-build quality is good-most likely customizable-battery lifecons-numeric keys is too small n no spaces in between-sometimes it can be a bit slow especially in sendin text messages, my n-gage qd can send text messages more faster-no wifi
This is a nice cellphone... I loaded it with a 1GIG card. Do the math... about 20-30% more song capacity if converted to ATRAC coding. GPRS 850 were im from. Has a special program that clears your calls, your basically speaking through a regular phone line. Picture and video editing on this phone, 30fps video, 3.2 mega pix cam... yep very clear..And oh yes... 100 BASS 100 TREBLE on this thing.Drawbacks:Slow operative system. s60 i guess. Dont take video or picture in dark places.. you will see nothing. Dont reduce bouncing on videos, youll see slow frames per sec.Dont drop it!!! very fragile.
This is an excellent phone*Great big ultra definition screen*Great camera*great signal*No drop calls*Full internetbrowser with opera miniA++++
purchased this phone in Hong Kong, a white oneno matter how good the review I read, the price was a drawback, and some random crash issuebut this one has the latest 4.x firmware, which is pretty good and stable I thinkreception: typical nokia, but I see it's a little better than 6120, same as K790a on 1800 part (using in Hong Kong)voice: amazing, very stable even it has 1 barbattery: it's on par with K790a, the battery claimed is kinda conservativescreen: bigger than K790a, bigger screen is eye candy, and the fonts are easy to read like on 176x220cam: it's good, but slow to startup, tested the phone before, found some blue-purple tint, but this one I purchased is alot better, alot less blue tint, which can be fixed by adjusting white balance; the video capture is alot better than K790abt: it's not have many function as K790a, but it's FAST, get 1.2Mbps on file transferhowever, 4.x firmware has a2dp added, but it works only with included players, and it has crashing problem with realplayerremedy: disconnect the stereo headset before open up realplayer, connect it back once the player starts playing, do it every time the phone restartsfunctionality: being as a smartphone, it has a good platform to add 3rd party appsconclusion: the current price of this phone is simply a steal now, it used to be $500-600 range, get it if you have chanceI give 96/100improvement needs to be done: bt a2dp application coverage, cam startup, SD-HC support
I Really like this phone, the camera quality, the software, everything is excellent!
I could hear the person I was calling fine, but everything I said was very static-y.  You could hear every little movement if I adjusted the phone at all.
This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Micro(tm) (M2(tm)) NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone. It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too, especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music.
Srudy phone during all scenarios. MP3 player is great, no compatibility problems. The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone. The camera is more than decent, (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) No problems what so ever, the design is rather smart and simple, without the lack of elegance. The flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably, and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. Tiny design details that make it a Sony product. AMAZING battery life, surprising for an MP3 phone.
I wanted an unlocked GSM/GPRS phone to replace my Cingular-branded palm Treo 750 Smartphone (at&t;/Cingular), which from the start I'd been wholly unimpressed with.  I began longing for a mobile phone that was just a GOOD MOBILE PHONE, that didn't crash all the time (yes I mean you, Treo), and that didn't have aspirations to be something else, a hybrid phone/can opener/whatever. I was drawn to the entire new Nokia line, but their prices kept me away. I was slightly skeptical about the Sony Ericsson line's focus on music (I already have an iPod, thank you very much), but I liked the price point and the positive reviews made the choice much easier. Although I've only had the phone a couple of days, and it's technically not supported by Cingular, my service provider, I seem to be continually wowed by this phone: it's design, call quality, features, abundance of free "themes", games and add-ons (especially in comparison to the paltry offering for the Treo) all make me think I definitely made the right decision with the Sony Ericsson Z710i. I'm even getting use out of the FM radio.
Hey this is a great phone. I have had it for a week now and it works flawlessly. I have never owned a Sony Ericsson phone before but I am really happy. The Camera is awesome and the call quality is clear and it gets great reception. Definetly a phone to pick up if you are looking for a new one.
This is a great phone with cool multimedia features.  It has a built in FM Radio but you have to use the supplied head set that has a unique adpater, meaning you cant use anything else.  I was hoping that I could use this phone to replace my HP PDA but whe the reminders come up they dont repeat themselves so if you dont hear the reminder you will not be notified again.  The vibration is not very hard meaning sometimes you cant feel it if it was in your pocket.  The coolest thing I found about it was you can record phone call conversation with ease.
hello readers, in this product review, i'm gonna talk about the sony ericsson z710i. so i'll try my best to break it down and such. here i go...first and foremost, this phone operates under the GSM networks, such as tmobile and at & t (cingular). so those who want to bring this to sprint or verizon will have no such luck.secondly, if you look at the official product review, it would likely mention that it comes with a 512mb memory card. unfortunately, it's just not true. as i comes with a 64mb card. if you read other reviews, you would likely know of this. if not, well now you know.for some odd reason, the outer screen of the phone isn't colored, but maybe sony has a method for it's madness, perhaps?now, i can't always bash this phone for it's shortcomings, as it does have some redeeming qualities:appearance- i admit, one major reason i got this puppy was cause it's a pretty looking phone. the black/grey like color with the silver trim is quite a sight to behold. when you open it up, the buttons light up in a nice blue color, andaesthetics- (did i spell it right?) as for how the phone feels on your hands? well it is a bit thick, even by today's slim as a slice of paper standards. but for users who have dealt with sony ericsson phones, it feels quite alright. but one major flaw is to access your memory card, you have to remove the battery case. and since it's not exactly a very popular phone, it's not very easy to find accessories for it.battery life- pretty good actually, i've gone for hours vibing to the music i jammed into it. (i forgot to mention, but i bought a 1gb memory card for about 20 bucks, giving me a lot more room for video clips and music.) and the call time? i don't really notice, but i can assume it's somewhat reasonable.call quality- i can't really give it that much of a good score. maybe it's just my luck, (or my network) but some calls come out garbled. but if you hang up and call again, you'd get better resultscamera- not very good actually. sure it takes 2 megapixel photos, but the quality is not the best sony can offer. (my sister's sony w810i has a much better camera) but at least it comes prepped with some decent photo editing software in it. it can also shoot video. again, not good, but something is always better than nothing. oh yeah, before i forget, it has no flash.software- i actually like the software for this one. the navigation buttons are customizable to a point that you can for example: press up to activate your bluetooth signal, press left to open your calendar, or press down to start playing video games. the music application is okay, but like i said before, sony has done better in this field before.internet- unfortunately, i can't rate this because i don't use it.overall- not a bad phone at all, but i'm sure you can find something better from sony. (like the w810i for example)hope i helped...
For all good about this phone read the other reviews. The BT is really flaky for me - I have 3 other BT devices that exchange contacts between each other flawlessly, not so for this phone. Very often it just says "Can't add contact". I almost decided to return it and try another copy but the price really went up since I bought it, so I'll probably just keep it.UPDATE: I just got back from UK where I used this phone with prepaid T-Mo UK SIM card. Everything worked great, I had coverage literally everywhere (I was mostly in London and around it)
For 235 bucks you wont find a better phone...by the way, the mp3 files sound great...now i dont need to carry my mp3 player, this phone do the job...just buy a bigger card, the 1 GB Memory stick micro works for me..
This unlocked phone is very nice. I think it is better in silver color than black color...It is my best phone.
I purchased this to replace a RAZR that was having "issues" just after the warranty expired.  The Sony is not nearly as pocketable. It also does not get as good of reception as the RAZR but is generally acceptable.  What I really don't like is that it doesn't have a dedicated hang up or call buttons.  The controls on this phone are very difficult to use and you will need to read the manual even if your a teckie.  By the way, the manual is so so; it didn't even mention how to use it with speaker phone!  The music feature is stupid; you need proprietary headphones and the sound quality is awful!  Still, it does seem to have good battery life and the screen is far superior to Motorola's especially in bright sunlight.  Sound volume and call clarity are fine in most cases.
I got this phone as a christmas gift, and, aside from the battery issue my first one had, this is an absolutely terrific and easy to use phone.  the keypad is the best i have seen on any phone, and the size of the screen is perfect.  I had my previous phone, a samsung x4217 or whatever it was, for well over 4 years, and i had just about had it with that phone, so pretty much anything was an upgrade.  All i wanted from my new phone was a screen on the outside to show the time, and a camera that i could quickly pull out and snap a quick pic of something, and this has both.  this phone also has a video camera, which is a great extra feature.  the outside screen doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles, it just shows the time and whatever symbols you have at the top of the interior screen.  this phone has great sound quality, and the speaker phone works like a champ.  the ringer is nice and loud, and being able to use the bluetooth to send sound files to my phone, instead of downloading tones from cingular for an arm and a leg, is another great bonus.  We also signed up for the multimedia package, which nets you unlimited internet and Cingular Video access.  Cingular Video is great for espn mobile and cnn quickies, along with funny shorts from shows like letterman, family guy, and the brak show.at the end of the day this is just a phone, and it does everything that a phone should do, ie. not drop calls and it has great sound quality.  it doesn't do any particular added bonus that great, but it does all of them well, and that's how it should be.  if you are looking for an inexpensive phone with a lot of well-rounded features, this is by far the one to get.
We bought 5 of these for our family two months ago.  We were previously Nokia and Motorola users.  We made the transition fairly easily.  Pluses:  big keypad, big, bright display, decent sound quality EXCEPT for the speakerphone, nice camera with video.  Minuses:  iffy batteries (one phone had to have the battery replaced within two weeks), poor quality speakerphone, annoying placement of PTT button, too much emphasis on web access functions for those of us who don't like using a phone for our internet connections.  Bottom line: if you're looking for a good, cheap phone that does all of the basic things well and has a nice set of extra features to play with, this is the one for you!
I have owned the LG CU400 for about one month.  Both the call quality and the reception are  very good.  Battery life is acceptable, although I should note that I use the phone only for calls - - no internet, no Push to Talk and no Bluetooth.  The speaker phone is on the tinny side but acceptable - - about what one would expect for a phone of this size.I have, however, encountered two problems:1.  While the battery life is acceptable, I encountered a problem with the battery strength indicator.  The battery strength indicator on every cell phone I previously owned showed that the battery strength gradually declined as I used the phone, thereby giving reasonable advance notice when the battery needed recharging.  This is not the case with the indicator in the CU400.  The first CU400 I owned showed that the battery was fully charged (3 bars) until a relatively short time before it turned itself off because the battery was too low.  Specifically, on one occasion when I timed it, the indicator went from 3 bars to 2 bars five or six days after a charge.  After only 10 additional hours on standby with no calls at all, the phone turned off because of a low battery.Thinking the indicator was defective, I returned the phone to the AT&T; store and received a new replacement.  The indicator on the replacement phone operates slightly, but not significantly, better.  The first phone had Cingular markings and the second had AT&T; markings, so I doubt that the two phones came from the same manufacturing batch.  It seems that this is an inherent problem with the phone.  If you buy one of these, I definitely recommend immediately charging the battery when the indicator goes from 3 to 2 bars and buying a car charger, if you spend any appreciable amount of time in a car.  The car charger does not come with the phone.2.  When the phone is powered on or off, it makes an annoyingly loud and harsh noise.  My wife nearly jumped out her skin the first time I turned the phone off while standing next to her.  The noise cannot be changed to another tone, but it can be turned off by putting the phone on vibrate or by turning the ringer volume all the way down.  Of course, if I were to do either of these and forget to turn the volume back up after the phone is turned on again, I will not hear the phone ring.  I complained to AT&T;, which advised that the phone makes this noise because it is a "3G" phone and that the noise is supposed to replicate the sound of a "jet."  All I can say is that I have been around airports for quite a while and the noise sounds nothing like a "jet" to me.  The closest thing I can compare the sound to is the noise a vacuum toilet on a cruise ship makes when the toilet is flushed.  It is really hard to imagine that a major US corporation would put such an intrusive sound in its cell phone and not give the user any option to replace the sound with another.In summary, the CU400 is a very good basic phone, provided you don't mind listening to the sound of a toilet flushing when you turn it on and off and you also don't mind either frequently charging or running the risk that the battery will unexpectedly run out of juice
How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways........1. The noise it makes when turning it on and off.2. In order to use the phone, I have to be standing outside in a area completely devoid of trees, buildings, power lines, even cars.  If it is a cloudy day or raining, forget using it.3. The stupid PTT button on the side is in the way.4. Ringtones installed on the phone - where did they find that awful stuff?I had a Nextel and switched to Cingular when my children moved out of state so it wouldn't cost them to call me from their Cingular phones.  Needless to say, we don't talk much because my phone doesn't work unless I'm standing in the middle of an empty field or parking lot. I am planning on going back to Nextel.  Oh, I've only had the phone for two months.
I'd like to echo some of the comments of others.What I like:The large number keys make dialing easier than other phones I've used. I like the look of the phone and its size. It fits nicely in my hand and in the pouch of my purse. The sound quality is good and the range is pretty good, too. I rarely find myself in a place where there's no service.What I don't like:The PTT button is placed where my thumb goes when I flip the phone open, and so I almost always hit it, which means I have to cancel the request almost every time I use the phone. The battery status indicator is difficult to read, and is pretty much worthless to me.This particular phone has two major issues that bug me a lot. It loses connection to the tower, and messages often arrive a week or so late. I went back to the store after a week of this, and was told I needed to bring in the box that the phone came in. By the time I found the box, the trial period was over, so I'm just living with these problems, but I would not buy another one because of it.My recommendation:If you buy this phone, keep the box. You might need it if a replacement becomes necessary.
As another reviewer said, the LG CU400 makes earsplitting noises every time you turn it on or off.  The first time my mother heard it, we were in the car and thank God nobody else was on the road or we would have crashed.  She was so startled by it.  The sound is a CLEAR deal-breaker and I wish I could crack this phone in half most of the time.  Oh, and its battery! Runs out of Power in no time at all.
This has got to be the Yugo of all cell phones.  The loud start up noise is one item, the inability to download ringtones, or much else for that matter, and the lousy service.  Our Nokia phones worked just fine on Cingular (this week AT&T;, next week ???) but this one can't seem to hold a signal to save it's sad little soul.  You'd be better off with a pair of tin cans and some kite string.  Cheaper by far and considerably more reliable.
I just got this phone, plus I intend to use it only as a phone, not for web browsing or anything, so I can't review a lot of the features.  But one thing has jumped out at me as a major problem: the phone makes a very loud, annoying sound every time you turn it on and off.  I searched the menus and the manual for some way to turn the sound off, or at least down, and found nothing.  Finally I emailed the manufacturer, and they told me the sound cannot be disabled or turned down.  That's just idiotic and shows a real lack of respect for customers who want to be able to control their phone's volume.  The alternative is to leave it in silent mode all the time, but then (obviously) I can't hear it ring.Otherwise, the speaker seems to work well, and so far I haven't managed to accidentally push the Push To Talk button (which on my last phone was placed in a way that you couldn't help but push it every time you picked up the phone). However, the screen is kind of small and makes it pretty hard to see the number of bars you're getting.  This phone seems to get fewer bars than my last phone, although I don't really hear a difference in the sound quality.  It also seems to take a longer time to charge -- plus, the charger is not Energy Star rated, so it's using more electricity than it needs to.Overall, I'm not happy with this phone, and I wish I made a different choice.
This is a great phone that actually works in my office building and in my server room ( I am in the IT department). I have been through two phones and the phone and my computer will see each other, I can not transfer a file. They will not connect. It will not connect with my headset or my GPS. Cingular and Lg have been no help. other phones have connected via bluetooth to these devices, so it has to be the phone.
This is a great, simple phone for those who just want a phone for making and receiving calls and text messages. Reception is quite good and battery life is great -- I go days and days and days between recharges.  However, the plastic cover over the display is tinted and mirrored so that it is virtually impossible to see the display outdoors in the daytime.  Most phones, especially basic ones like this, are difficult to see in daylight conditions, but this one is impossible.  It is so bad that am going to be getting a new phone, even though I will have to pay big bucks to do so.  This is my fourth (or fifth?) Nokia phone and the first one that has disappointed me.
The 2610 had all the promise of a great upgrade that improved some of the issues I had with my GREAT 3120 and 3220 previous, and almost perfectly enjoyable, Nokia phones. But, alas they blew it with a couple of stupid and totally unnecessary killers.First the GREAT things did with the 2610. They allow you to customize(assign)the navigation(arrow)keys to functions of YOUR choice. not theirs. They added a needed center button to the navigation keys. They replaced the infuriating proprietary NOKIA POP-PORT combination USB and HEADPHONE access port with separate STANDARD USB and HEADPHONE jacks. And they expanded the number and length of info that can be added to each addr book contact.The killers for me? The USB port is not a PC Sync port. It CANNOT be used with Nokia's PC Suite sync software, or any other mfgs, to back up personal contact, etc info you so laboriously put into your phone. Nokia, if your reading this, without an IR or Bluetooth wireless connection on this phone, how is one to BACKUP their data on this otherwise excellent phone you put a USB port on??? Second, why to heck would you reduce the readeability of this phone in daylight by removing the ability to remove wallpaper(increases contrast) behind contact lists, remove the ability to choose a list in place of stupid miniuature unreadeable wallpapered icons in Menus, then add insult to injury by then decreasing the readeability in daylight with a non-removeable shade over the display.FIX these things PLEASE so I can come back to you and this otherwise excellent phone.
I'd never recommend this 2610 because of the single issue that the display is unusable in daylight & barely marginal for inside viewing. It's a shame because the sound is good. Maybe that's why AT&T; gives them away free - hoping to get rid of them!
EVERYONE that is selling a phone in this category, must be stupid... The category says "Nokia 2610 (Unlocked)" which implies the phone is unlocked and can be used on ANY network....However everyone in this category selling this phone states that the phone is locked to "AT&T;" or "T-Mobile" therefor implying it's not an unlocked phone... don't buy a phone from this category if you plan on using it with another service provider.
It won't work in the western USA. Costs extra time to find out it won't work and then you have to send it back and you end up getting one from your phone company anyway. Not a good idea.I washed yet another phone and got an iphone which has been the best thing I ever did.
OverviewI purchased this Smartphone after 3 months of research. My criterion was that it had to play music via Bluetooth, had to have a windows mobile platform, and had to be comfortable. This phone satisfied all of them for the most part.There are a few cons to the phone, however; with the windows platform it will not be long until applications will come around to extend the functionality and fix problems. I'm a computer programmer and I'm currently working with the mobile platform to develop new programs with Visual Studio, hence the need for the windows platform. I can safely say that in the next couple of years we will be seeing some exciting new technology that will be developed with the new Smartphone and PDA's that run a platform like window mobile.The blackjack is an excellent device to introduce you into the Smartphone/PDA universe. With Blackjacks features for Email (3 different options to receive email w/ this phone), Instant Messaging, SMS/MMS, ActiveSync & MP3 player capability it's my opinion that the Blackjack is on par or surpasses any blackberry.Con Brief & Fixes1) Music plays on the speakerphone if you have no ear buds.First the music capabilities of the phone is excellent, however; if you do not want the entire world think that "you like big butts" when everyone hears your song "Baby got back" by Sir Mix-A-Lot coming from your Blackjack's speakerphone. I would suggest getting the wired ear buds or a stereo Bluetooth headset. After a little research I found out that if I wanted wireless music from my Blackjack I would have to have a Bluetooth headset that had a feature called Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and if I wanted to control the music from a Bluetooth device I would need Audio/Video Remote Control (AVRCP). The Blackjack has both capabilities so all I needed to do is to find a Bluetooth device with the same. I found two that are not big headsets: LG HBS-110 and Sony Ericsson Bluetooth HBH-DS970. I bought the LG HBS-110, I just bought it when I did this review so I can't tell you 411 on it yet but I can say that both devices WILL work with the Blackjack.2) The battery life of the phone is very poorCome to find out the new G3 network from Cingular takes a lot of power to maintain. For a music enthusiast, like myself, I am looking for longevity when it comes to my players batteries. So I did some searching and come across a small little hack with the Blackjack that will turn off that G3 feature so the batteries can last for up to TWO DAYS in normal use. Let me advise you now, if you do not know what you are doing when you are in the settings of the phone. You can seriously damage your saved data on your phone or even lose it completely. So, I advise that you get in, change what you need, and get out. Do not experiment unless you are willing to lose your phones data. On the main screen of the phone type the following:  *#1546792*#  the admin screen will appear, scroll down to selection "3 Network & Call Settings" and hit OK. Next, scroll down to selection"5 Network Mode" and hit OK. Next, scroll down until you see "GSM" with a black dot next to it. Then, push the soft touch button with the word "Done" on the screen associated to the button. Now exit the Admin Settings by hitting the Home button (the button with a picture of a house on it) and you're finished. In a few seconds you should see the icons on the top of the home screen change. Next to the signal bars you should see a picture of an antenna instead of G3. This little hack should extend the life of your batteries tremendously. Also, by changing the Network Mode you should NOT lose any functionality from the phone, the only change should be the speed at which you send and receive data on the network. If you do experience problems, reset the network mode back to "Auto" by repeating the above steps; then start your troubleshooting of the problem.
I would have to say this is easily the best phone I have ever owned.  My last phone was a RAZR that I bought when they first came out.  That phone was alright, but I really felt it was lacking features for the price I paid.The time came to upgrade and I decided I wanted a phone that had more features than my falling apart RAZR had.  The decision came down to the 8525 or the Blackjack.I chose the Blackjack.  The 8525 was out of my league for price.  After dumping $500 on my RAZR, I promised myself that I would never do it again.A warning to all!  If you have large fingers or have a tendency to fat finger things, you may want a different phone!  Definitely try before you buy if you fit this category.You will get the most ouf of this phone if you are technically savy.  If you aren't this won't exactly be a bad phone, but the potential of it will be limited compared to those that know how to "hook it up."  I would suggest that if you aren't highly skilled with technology that you find someone with a Blackjack or Motorola Q that knows how to "hook up" their phone.  They can probably help you out a lot.Let me start off with my complaints.The directional pad in the middle takes some skill to use.  I have gotten better with it, but let me describe the initial frustration.  The way the buttons are laid out around the directional pad cause problems.  When clicking to the right I had a heck of a time keeping my thumb from pushing one of the button towards the upper right (labelled "...").  That button closes what ever you are doing in most cases.  I might be scrolling around a web page, touch the right side and BAM!! I am sitting at my homescreen again.  Then I have to go back into my start menu and open Internet Explorer again... and be much more careful the next time!  .To help those of you out there that may have a similar experience...  I have found the best way to use the central directional pad is to place your thumb over the OK button.  Tilt your thumb in the direction you want until the pad is depressed.  Avoid the natural instinct of pressing the center of your thumb on the side of the pad you want to.  Once you master this, only seldomly will you have trouble with closing apps.The only other complaint I have is the battery life as many have described before me.  The 3G network is taxing on your battery.  You can switch networks to significantly increase battery life.  I know you want 3G!  We all do!  What if switching between networks was simple?  It can be!  Do not fret, all will be disclosed!What you want to do is open up Activesync with you Blackjack plugged in.  Click the "Explore" button.  Double click the little PDA picture titled "My Windows-Mobile Based Device".  Open the Windows directory.  Find the bandsel.exe file.  Right click the file and create a shortcut.  This will likely place the shortcut at the very bottom of the file list.  Scroll down and find it.  Rename the shortcut to "Band Selector" or something to your liking.  Cut the shortcut and then paste it into "\Windows\Start Menu\Applications".You have now created an item in your applications section (under the start menu) that will allow you to change from 3G network to the Edge network or vice versa.  Note: If the shortcut does not appear right away, shut your phone off and turn it back on.What!?!?  What did you say?!?!  You want to be able to switch networks easier?!?!?  OK!!  Now that we have a shortcut we can add it to speed dial.  Simply go into your Start Menu and choose Applications.  You should see the "Band Selector" icon you made in there.  Highlight it, and then click the right "..." button on your phone.  Select "Add Speed Dial".  Personally I chose 88 for my speed dial.  To access 88 for instance, just press 8 once then press and hold 8.  The network selection menu will appear!  Choose any speed dial you desire!Might I make another wonderful suggestion when you get this phone... Treat yourself to the program called Facade!  It is a marvelous program that will add a top notch Homescreen to your phone.If you get Facade, follow the directions to install it.  Then go to Start --> Settings --> Display --> Homescreen --> Click OK, and select Facade Wide!Find some screenshots or whatever, but it is the best Homescreen I have tried and I have tried many.The keyboard is a great feature.  There is no faster way to pump out text messages than with a full keyboard.  The keys are small and close together so it does take a little practice to perfect its use.  Hang in there!  You WILL get better at using it.Cingular Xpress mail is slick!  What can I say?!!?  You basically install a piece of software on your desktop computer that will slingshot incoming mail to your cellphone.  Corporate email from virtually anywhere with internet access is feasible.Get yourself Google Maps!  The newest Google Maps application runs great on this phone!If you don't have a Gmail account, now is the time to get one.  This phone will interface extremely well with Gmail using POP3 settings.  I would suggest doing a google search for "blackjack gmail recent:username".  This will reveal some webpages that will assist in setting this up.Once you hookup your phone, it is great!  I love it!  Whoo hoo!!
I have had the phone for a week and I am returning it. Samsung really swung for the trees on this and the expectation was high. However no matter how good this phone looks on paper or industry reviews it simply fails to deliver. If you are a consumer that plans on using more then 75% of the features you will be disappointed. Here is why:Lets outline what 75% feature usage means: Phone, addressbook, email (either POP or Xpress etc) some, Calendar, To do's and organization, a bluetooth accessory plus maybe 10% of the day on streaming content and/or the occasional web surf (which you need to setup and maintain email). First. you will get about 4 hours, maybe less of battery power until the phone is completely dead. Add the second battery that is bundled with the purchase and maybe you can make a phone call on the way home from work. If you are used to other PDAs or blackberrys, you will HATE the navigation through the phone. Excessive menus make it hard to find a command quickly. Plus the scroll wheel doesn't scroll like a blackberry, therefore you can't use it to select everything on the page.Price for services is high.To get email,text messaging and have 'limited' streaming capability (meaning NOT HBO or XM) plus the basic phone package, will spend close to $150 a month depending on your personal preferences. While that might not be high for some, think about that plus cable plus home internet and then consider what your paying just to stay 'connected'.Even if you cut out the streaming content, cingular will try and convince you otherwise because while using the phone, its easy to stumble across a feature you are NOT paying for and get 'hit' with the bill at the end of the month. Cingular will not refund you for this under any circumstance. Look at the warning explained above in the product details: Warning: If you want to enjoy the full audio and video capabilities of your UMTS phone, please select a MEdia Max service plan option during checkout. If you do not sign up for a MEdia Max service plan option, you will be paying per KB when you use the over-the-air UMTS audio and video features on your phone (upwards of $10 per minute).Functionality wise, the Keypad layout is difficult to see. The numbers and the letters are all the same size on very small keys so I found myself just staring blankly for several minutes trying to figure out where my character was. Not saying you don't get used to it but be ready to hit the wrong character several times because of the close proximity of the buttons. I never had that kind of a problem on my blackberry.Additionally Samsung claims that the Balckjack can perform as a blackberry however, after I purchased it, I found it is not. You can communicate (limited) with a blackberry server, however you need to load a 3rd party client software on your computer and for it to sync your messages throughout the day the computer needs to be on and running. Plus any meetings and Tasks are lost completely. I really think Samsung should explain this better and I feel Samsung really wanted to release something big and crammed a whole bunch of features into a slim sleek package but never tested it with 'real' consumers with 'real world' type usage.I'll finish up with what they did do right. The phone is beautiful. Perfectly designed, a nice weight and contrary to another review it feels like a quality phone. (Minus maybe the small keys and the disfunctional scroll wheel) The screen is maybe not as big as others but that was the point wasn't it? To make a smaller PDA phone. However, fyi, the streaming video comes in at half the size of the screen resolution. Earpiece is good and clear. Over all dimensions blow away all others except maybe the Blackberry Pearl. Cool, black RAzorV3 kind of finish. I would love to keep it if the phone actually delivered the functionality it needed to.
I convinced my husband who is a blackberry owner that I wanted the cooler phone and it was worth $200. The size (thinness) is great- fits into my backpocket or side pocket without anyone knowing.The issues with the phone have been it's very difficult to get it set up the right way and the battery does not hold very long. Sure you get a new battery, but when you are on a conference call or on your way somewhere in the car, it's not that easy to change.  I have been charging with the ligher charger in the car and switching battery 1/2 day through. I use it a lot for email- but truly only make 3-5 calls a day on it. The email sucks up the energy everytime it syncs.Keyboard is tight, but not an issue for me. Cool features- camera, etc. If you use them it's worth it- if not- get a blackberry.
After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering.If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. I feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right.
My first Email phone and I'm relatively happy with it.  Mine came with an Extended battery/cover ($50 value) which easily gets me through the day, and though it does increase the width and weight a bit, it's still very pocketable.Small keyboard is pretty easy to type on with good feel and button reaction.Big advantage is the low cost of the Data Plan.  This is a "Multimedia Smartphone" running Windows Smartphone so don't believe anyone who tells you it needs the $40/month PDA data plan. Cingular does not advertise this, but the Blackjack can use the MediaMax 200 Unlimited data plan (aka Smartphone Connect) for just $20.I also have my Outlook and Yahoo email accounts set to sync remotely (although Cingular help desk twice told me this was impossible with my MediaMax data plan and said I'd have to sync through the Hardwire to my PC...false).Low monthly data plan charges are definitely a BIG plus to the Blackjack!
When my company's IT department decided to lock us out of our webmail accounts, I went looking for a phone that would allow me to send and receive email for my side business.  I read all of the reviews and went to the Cingular store planning to buy either a Treo 680 or an 8525.  After holding the two aforementioned beasts, I realized that there's no way I would carry a phone that large - I'm not a utility belt type guy, I like a phone that fits in my front pants pocket, but doesn't raise eyebrows while there.  After holding all three phones in my hand, I knew that the Blackjack was the one.I was a little trepidatious after reading some of the reviews here, but the Cingular store guy assured me that I had 30 days to return it, and matched Amazon's price.  So out the door I went with my new phone.After using it for two weeks, I love it!  It does just about everything my old Ipaq did and is an excellent phone to boot.  My favorite features:1) Email - that's what I bought it for in the first place, and the email feature works great with my POP mail accounts.  Someone posted below about how it deletes your emails as soon as you have read them...that's only the case if you configure it that way.  I initially hooked it up through outlook and outlook downloaded all of the emails from my pop mail accounts, emptying my webmail boxes.  I have since turned off outlook, and set up the pop accounts on the phone itself.  This way the email goes to the phone AND to the webmail boxes.  I only keep the last three days emails on the phone, but an additional copy is stored in the webmail box, so I can log on to the internet to read them.  I also have the POP email accounts configured to automatically check for new email every 15 minutes.  Easy and very functional.2) Internet - Cingular has a 3G network where I am and it is fast!  The BJ has a great browser, which lets me surf my favorite sites from anywhere.  The excellent screen makes the sites surprisingly readable, even though the text is small.  The added banus, however, was how easy it is to use this phone as a modem.  I can connect the BJ to my laptop with the USB cable, go to File Explorer>Windows>Internet sharing.exe and my laptop recognizes the BJ as a network device.  Combine that with the 3G network speeds and I have a decent broadband connection on the commuter train!3) Entertainment - I get bored easily, so I always need to be doing something.  I used to carry my Ipaq with me all the time, just to have games to play in the checkout line.  I stopped doing that years ago, but now I have the equivalent functionality in my phone (which I do carry everywhere).  It took a couple of days to get used to the stylus free operation of the Windows Smartphone OS, but after a little playing, I found out that it can do almost everything my Ipaq could.  I can read books using the free Mobipocket reader, and I have three novels currently loaded on.  I can listen to music or watch videos. or (My Favorite), I can play classic Nintendo games.  I was able to get the PocketNester application to work on the BJ, so now I can whip out Mario Bros, or Legend of Zelda or Tecmo Bowl wherever I am.  Cool stuff!  All this content requires more memory, but thanks to my friends at NewEgg, I was able to get a 1GB Micro SD for $13.ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE: A lot of people have complained about the battery life.  Cingular included an extended battery and a new battery door with mine.  The extended battery makes the device a little thicker, but not in an uncomfortable way.  With the standard battery, the camera sticks out a little bit from the back of the device.  With the extended battery, the battery door brings the back of the device flush with the camera.  Still planty pocket sized.  I've never used the standard battery - so I can't comment on that - but the extended battery gives me about 2 days of juice under normal usage (about 1.5 hours of calls, 2 hours of email/internet, 1.5 hours of games, phone on standby the rest of the time).  I try to remember to plug it in every night, but when I forget, I have plenty of juice to get me through the second day.All in all, I couldn't be happier with the device, I will list a few cons, though.CONS:- Nonstandard headphone jack.  I'm used to it because my Ipaq did the same thing, but I really wish it had one!- Three button unlock.  I wish there was a better way to unlock the phone than having to click three buttons.  Two would have been fine.- Navigation (again Windows problem).  Some of the features take a lot of work to get to, like the internet sharing.- Lack of a clipboard - I really wish i could copy/paste (Windows again).
In some ways, it's a great phone - the screen is BEAUTIFUL and the storage of films and audio are great. But those are extras - in what you basically need, it often is terrible.To search a name, I push the CONTACTS button. If I want "TODD" I used to hit "T" and my old phones would all jump to the T section. On this phone, it jumps to the first name with a T anywhere in it! Like sTeve or lesTer! Argh.When I get a call from a new number, I push SAVE and store a name next to it. When you go look in your contacts, the name is often NOT there. It may appear in the contacts 3 or 4 minutes later (huh?!?) or not at all. Psycho!There are various ways to configure the front homescreen, but you OUGHT to be able to put what you want on there - this is software, dumb software - and there should be more control.
So this is my first PDA phone. I actually did not need one, but since I was going into a new contract, and I would not be able to buy another phone (free of cost) for another 2 yrs, I thought that I should go with the "in thing".I surfed the net and found a site where I got this phone for free without needing to subscrib for a data plan. I dont intend to use it for data much. If I do, I will pay per use. I just wanted a PDA Phone that would give me the flexibility of email et al and I could subscribe to a data plan when I think that I need to. The cingular people were charging me quite a bit for this phone with a required minimum mandatory data plan (without a data plan, it was exorbitant) and were sure that I could not get this phone for free anywhere without a data plan, that too added as a new line to my already existing other Cingular phone. Too bad for them........Ok, now for the phone.....I must say that as a first time PDA Phone user, I was smitten by the Blackberry Pearle for its looks and all. However, I have been falling deeper in love with this phone ever since I got it (about a week).PROS:- Excellent display- Very user friendly and customizable OS (I did not need a manual for most of the stuff).- Loud and clear ear piece.- Good signal strength. (This was the primary reason why I moved to Cingular. Earlier, I had a T-mobil and my wife had a Cingular, she would singals everywhere, but T-mobil sucks on that accunt).- Good keypad. The key pad comes up like a cluttered one with very small keys at first look. I was scared as I have fat fingers. But the keys are protruded so that I have never pressed a wrong key. Better that the big key plat key pad in my razor.- Even without using the data plan, I am able to use the calendar, alarm, internet and it helps a lot to keep me on track for my day to day activities.Ok another thing that I have read a lot about here is the bad battery life on this phone. I must say that I got 3 days from my first charge on the regular battery (not the extended one), with a talk time of about 2 hrs, fair amount of net surf (pay per use), and lots and lots of palying around. The first thing I did was swtiched off bluetooth and 3G. I will switch them on when I need them (I am sure this will drain the battery faster), but for now, I am good. (I will update this space about battery life, if I see it going down).So all in all, this phone is real good, looks real sleek (yes, even when compared to the Pearle). I like it.
I've been using PDAs/smartphones for years. Prior to the BlackJack, most recently a Palm Treo 650, and before that, a Blackberry. Compared to the Treo, the voice quality and overall reliability are much better (doesn't reboot every half hour). If you're someone who talks on the phone all day, the BJ might be a good choice, if you don't mind recharging every day. Our sales people really like it. It's lightweight and has a slim design. The guys love it because it looks like a sports car. Internet access is much faster than on the Treo, but still a bit sluggish and limited. I'm a heavy email/text user, and I must say I miss my Treo (nevermind how much I miss my Blackberry!). The BJ keyboard is teeny, unintuitive, and there is weird spacing between the sequential number keys. Even after months, I'm still not used to it. The email text on the screen is much smaller than on the Treo, the contrast is much worse, and it displays fewer lines of text (boo!). The charger slot on the side of the device has The Flimiest Plastic Cover Ever. It was hanging on by a thread after just 2 weeks of use. In addition, the battery life is quite poor, and I don't even have Bluetooth turned on. I have to recharge it daily, whereas my Treo or Blackberry could go a few days between charges. If you know someone who has a BJ, make a few calls on it and send a few email messages to see whether it'll work for you. If the Treo were more reliable, I'd go back to it in a heartbeat.
Here's an update now that I've had the phone 3 months.  I should have given it 3 stars not 2, but I can't change it.To upgrade your phone to 3 stars too you must do the following -1. Follow all of the battery-extending advice you can find.  Turn the brightness down, disable email synch in the evenings, turn off beaming, turn off bluetooth, limit the backlighting, use the extended battery, switch to Edge instead of 3G.  If you do this your battery life will be 3 days instead of one.2. Gripe - you cannot edit tasks with this phone, you can only change the title.  This sort of bugs me because I use tasks a lot in Outlook.3. The alarm is buggy - the snooze sometimes keeps going.  If you have a sleeping S.O next to you they will be annoyed when you head to the shower and your phone keeps beeping.4. I got a headphone adpater off Ebay for $5, now I can plug the MP3 player into anything.  It still annoys me that they didn't put a standard headphone jack on this thing, the adapter is one more thing to carry around with you.The rest of my review still stands, and Windows Mobile is still terrible.My original review:I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.* Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.* Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B* Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.* Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.* No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.* Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.* Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??* Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you.
So far this phone has been stellar. I can echo the previous comments on the sexy form-factor and the utility of the phone. After custimizing the home screen, my fiance' played around with it and insisted on getting one too. Easy navigation is a big deal for her, and the sidebar feature (push and hold the scroll wheel) - which is customizable, as is most of the interface on this phone - was a big selling point.My phone came with the extended battery and cover included; that was actually a pleasant surprise. However be aware that it doesn't ship with a belt clip or case. You'll want to pick one of those up as well as a car charger and a microsd card.The phone is light and sleek w/ the standard battery, but the extended battery gives it a much nicer feel in the hand. My fiance' actually prefers it w/ the extended battery in, and she's got a strong bias for small phones.Of course it's not quite perfect. I have 2 major beefs w/ this phone:1. No Wifi. This is extremely annoying because the SGH-i600 in Europe has Wifi, and it is essentially the same phone.2. Battery life: not utterly miserable, I can go two days of regular use (texting, regular calls to the missus, minimal browsing) before the battery goes out. This is on par with my previous phone, the Audiovox SMT-5600. But it should be better, considering they did so much to keep the power low, all of which annoy the heck out of me:-Proprietary USB cable-Three button presses to unlock keypad (since the keypad is locked no user activity is anticipated and the device drops into a deep sleep mode. Power button wakes the phone from this state - that's my guess)-No LED-Default 10s till screen turns offThese things do work (and the last is customizable), but my previous phone had none of these 'features' and it still had generally the same battery life.All in all this is a great phone for the smartphone newbie or geek alike.
I bought this phone because of its advanced features and Windows based applications.  I ran into two problems that after 25 calls to Cingular could not be esolved and I had to returrn the phone.  1) Cingular does not have the expertise to support this phone, 2) The e-mail feature is ridiculus...one must buy a special service for the e-mail and then once an e-mai is read, it is deleted.  Every 15 minutes, the user must send/receive to get new e-mails.  Once, the user receievs the new e-mail, all old e-mails are DELETED, even from the user server (i.e., gmail, sbc, etc.).  The amazing part of this is that Cingular agents don't know about this and it took me a month and more than tens of hours on the phone to find out about this deficiency.  There also seems to be a total confusion at cingular on what service one needs for the phone and at what price! Other features are excelent once the user gets them working!
I have had this phone for a little over a month now and it has worked great. Here are the highlights:Pros:-Slim design for a PDA style phone. I carry it in my front pocket along with my wallet and it doesn't seem any more bulky than my old flip phone.-Windows Mobile OS... so far so good. I synced up wirelessly to my Outlook acct. within minutes of starting the phone up. It actually receives email faster than my computer does (I also set it to sync in non work hours so it doesn't buzz all day long while I am at the computer). Excel files and PDF's open up with ease. I also set up Yahoo Messenger which I use for work within minutes.-Buttons are fairly easy to hit and the scroll wheel works great (also works as a select button when depressed).-Clear Display.-Comes with extended battery (which I have yet to use but appreciate having)-Google Maps works really well but only if you DOWNLOAD it (a must).-Fast downloads.Cons:-Unlocking the phone is a chore... Power button on top...then soft key...then star. Not very one-hand friendly.-Camera... 1.3MP of poor photography-Searching for contacts. If you search for a name beginning with "M" it pulls up every contact with an "M" in the name. Why can't it just take me to the people's names that begin with "M"?-Some webpages are hard to navigate.I have not really used the media player nor tried it with a bluetooth headset so I can not speak to those features.The bottom line is I am happy with the phone and would recommend it. I wanted a phone that would sync up to my work email, open microsoft office attachments and run Yahoo Messenger. The Blackjack is a great business workhorse and performs all of the functions I need very well.
I had problems using this phone - so I called tech support multiple times and finally got through to level 3 support after 30 mins of waiting and wadding through crummy level 1 and 2 support.  Here are some tips on using the blackjack for your info:- To do hard reformat - turn off phone, turn it on holding to wheel's up arrow key. You will be prompted - click 1 and y to answer questions.It's better than the soft "Restore Factory Settings"- Where is task list? select organizer - task listwhere is Unheard voice messages indicator ?  look for 0_0 symbol on top of your phonePress Right wheel 2 secs to get click listHow to update click list?In Click list - select Edit folder, menu - add, click application, select applications and click OK to put tick marks on them - then click Add.- In contacts, to use search, type in two or three characters (do not type one character).  Eg. "Sam"How do I stop desktop icons from changing? no way to do thatHow do I update SIM contacts - don't bother.  Manager your contacts in outlook and export to blackjack using active sync.- your CD also has  MITS Sync software- Wizard 3.0 that will allow you to manage contacts on your Samsung- Holding Home Key done gives you Task Manager. Click menu, select stop all - calendar will still be running. If you have problems with anything running in blackjack, you can do the above steps to stop all tasks.  For example, I was having problems with calendar alerting me about events that were two days out.- you can use speed dial to short cut to any applications
I don't know what happened to P.Feng, but Google Maps and Google work fine on mine. I also put on a Java-based Sudoku game that works fine.With the (included) extended battery, I get good battery life, calls are clear, signal is good. I tried out typing on a Blackberry Pearl and the Blackjack for comparison, and the Blackjack was much easier. I don't make many typos, but more than I would on a regular keyboard, of course.The camera works well in good lighting if you stand still, if it's dark it's not so good. The video player works fine, I compressed a personal video to about a megabyte for a minute, it looks bad on the computer but on the Blackjack screen it looks pretty good. I won't give up my MP3 player for the music player on the phone, but it works sufficiently if I didn't have my regular player with me.I didn't get the wired headphones in my box... don't buy them at Cingular because they'll charge you $20. Buy them online, much cheaper for the same thing. Either way, those headphones are not comfortable, and being used to the Shure's that I use for my MP3 player, the sound quality leaves much to be desired. I am going to try an adapter to see if the Shure's sound a lot better or not, or if the phone playback just isn't very good.
I was looking for a fast (3G) phone that had windows mobile on it so I could use it for streaming television from my slingbox. As much as I love my Nokia E62, it just doesn't take pictures, have 3G, and won't play my slingbox. So here's the lo down on the Blackjack:PROS:SmallSleekBlackBright screenfast broadband like speeds3G for 400Kbps to 700Kbps (never really get it though)full query keyboardtwo batteries (you'll need them!)Windows mobile 5.0 smartphone edition (watered down version of PocketPC editionAble to watch slingplayer (until it froze which was often)Nice camera with many optionsCamcorderCONS:Feels kind of on the cheap side in constructionBoth batteries give me less time than one battery on my Nokia E62Screen is small (2.2" compared to 2.8" on the nokia)freezes oftenwebsites stall very often compared to Nokia E62websites hard to read compared to Nokia E62Couldn't get it to be a modem for my laptop even with customer support (Nokia was a breeze)Cramped buttonsnot much usable memoryCan't edit Microsoft Office docs (Nokia you can)speaker phone not nearly as good as NokiaAnyways, I'm keeping my Nokia, it would be perfect if it had the 3G, a camera and the symbian was a bit faster but I returned this as I am happier with the Nokia which is built much better with aluminum case, a much larger screen, longer battery life, better browsing and much cheaper.
Hi.. I normally never write a review for any phone.. I like to enjoy reading reviews... but I couldn't help myself form writing a review for this phone... First of all.. this is a superb phone.. awwsome phone whatever you want call good for it.. this phone rocks .. blah ... blah .. and if you know how make things work, this phone is really gr8 than any other phone in the market till today.1) This phone looks gr8..

I don't understand the complaints.  Maybe the Blackberry people are writing them.  But the Blackberrys I looked at were too big.  The Pearl was bigger, the Q was bigger, etc.  This phone is light but solid.Coming from a Razr, it is easy to love this phone.  I needed a phone that would hold my contacts (over 4000), sync my calendar, do email (I have 4 accounts on it at once), and play music.  Oh, and be a good bluetooth phone too so that when I get in my car I am automatically connected.Blackjack does all of that and much more.  It does it in a very lightweight, thin form factor that has a great screen.  I feel like I have only scratched the surface of what this phone can do.Since I use ACT! (the older 2005 version) which didn't support Windows Mobile 5.0, I bought companionlink to sync with the phone.  It works fine and all my calendar and address book info is on the phone.Pros:  Small and light with a great screen and the ability to do what you need to do. 3G connection is fast for internet browsing.Cons: battery could last longer - but they give you a backup, which I have only had to use once.  I charge the phone in my car and at night when I go to bed.  I use the phone all day, including email access, contacts, etc.  It has not been a problem for me.
This review is for those of you debating the merits of the Blackjack vs. the Blackberry Pearl.  First off this phone has the best web surfing i've seen so far on a small device.  It uses IE as its browser and you get the whole web page as you would expect to see it on your desktop computer.  I did find a few sites which hobble their content such as Schwab but then it gave you special pages with charts that you couldn't get on the blackberry.  Navigating is fairly easy using the scroll wheel.  Occcasionlly I noticed a few glitches.  Images were nice and sharp.  The Pearl on the other hand gives you the web page all broken up.  Photos were nice but graphs and images rather fuzzy. In terms of phone quality the Blackjack has a high quality speakerphone which was superior to the Pearl and overall sound quality on the handset was slightly better on the Blackjack.  The Pearl's great strength is much better email system that is easy to use and delivers the mail to you and it's there. And it's easy to manage.  I also found the operating system of the Pearl to be easier to navigate and to be more elegant. In terms of styling the looks speak for themselves and it's a personal choice.  The Blackjack comes with two batterries and even with it's extended thicker battery it has a nice feel and is not bulky in the slightest.  The blackjack's headset is annoying in that it uses a proprietary plugin where the battery charger plugs in which means you can't choose your own headset. I was somewhat disapointed in the game selections for the Blackjack but I'm sure this is a temporary situation. What else?  One big con for the Blackjack which may not bother some is that the radiation level for data appears off the charts in comparison to other phones.  I think this is because it's a 3G phone and the bandwidth demands mean a lot of wattage coming out.  I think the designers were aware as they seem to have made an attempt to redirect the radiation out the base back of the handset. This means the amount of radiation going into your ear may be lower.  But of course you still have to hold it when you're surfing. It's  just something that people should be aware. of and not necesairly bad.  It's the reality of wireless. I just wish manufacturers would focus on a solution.  The Blackjack keyboard is very nice.  The keys are a little small but not too bad. Overall a nice phone and I'm really on the fence as to which phone to use. It coes down to whether you email more or surf more.
I have had this phone since January 2007. Do not get me wrong, it's a nice phone! But it's got a few annoying ticks, like needing to be rebooted more then any other cell I've ever owned. The syncing process has issues as well, if you're not Microsoft and computer savvy -- you can lose numerous contacts in Outlook.
I had a RAZR before this, so its a huge improvement. The screen is very vibrant and I love having a full keyboard. I read the online manual from samsung and very quickly learned how to use most of the phone features.Pros- Excellent screen.very fast internet in 3G areasfull keyboard for quick textingeasy navigationconsbattery life with regular batterysometimes freezes upcant make the phone ring and vibrate (bad for noisy places)annoying confirmation screen after sending text messagesannoying at&t; startup (flying whooshing fiery balls, very loud)
I have had this phone for some time. The bad: the ring volume is kind of low (I actually had to order a new phone) .. and the reception isn't that great (on the first phone) I am awaiting a new phone at the moment.The pros is that the phone has a lot of capabilities and they are pretty easy to use. Its a fun phone! The keyboard is small, but its a phone, what do you expect? The camera is great!Some advice, don't text a lot especially if you do not have a charger out of the house because texts will run the battery really fast.
I have had my Blackjack for 5 months.  So far it is my favorite phone.  My two previous phones were the Cingular 2125 and the Treo 650.I am glad to be back to a full keyboard -- I missed that a lot on the 2125, since I do more data input than actually talking on the phone.  It gets much better reception and the speaker is louder than on the Treo.  I plan to keep this one until they come out with one that has a better camera, a standard headphone jack, and gps.  Waterproof would be nice. :)Pros:  While the keyboard is cramped, I am able to use it effectively, especially with text prediction.  The signal is better than most PDA-style phones I have used.  With the extended battery it is not so thin, but the battery lasts me all day, even with bluetooth always on, listening to music while walking/driving, some text messaging, checking email every 15 minutes, and lots of calendar and task list input.  I only talk on the phone about 60 minutes each month, but it is the only phone for our household (no land lines), and I have not had a problem.Cons:  While better than the 2125 camera, I don't know why they didn't put one that can capture more megapixels -- the technology exists.  I would also like GPS in this phone -- similar smartphones have it.  It is almost impossible to read the screen in daylight -- have to search for dark shade to use it outdoors.  My biggest issue is that there is no standard 2.5 headphone jack.  I cannot use earbuds, the adaptors seem to be hit or miss on getting one that works well, and BT stereo headphones are really heavy.  For a phone marketed as part music-player, this seems downright silly!But, I love my phone!
Let me first say that I'm not a business professional, I'm a college student. Email and internet usuage is not a big issue for me. I mainly liked the blackjack because of the full qwerty keyboard for texting. I originally had a nokia 6010 (eeck) and then a motorola RAZR. While the razr was good for its day, it recently became unresponsive.I have "tested" many phones. The Nokia E62, was a great phone, but too bulky for me. I will say that I love the blackberry Curve and the Pearl, just a bit pricey for a college student. :) The AT&T; 8525 is also a great device, I love the touch screen and the sliding keyboard. For cost benefit the blackjack was the way to go for me.I will admit that Windows Mobile 5 has a bit of a learning curve, and the inculded manual is not much help, so just like any other new phone, I just started messing around on it and most of it came to me in about a week. The camera is a bit choppy but it still has good quality. The use of third party programs and be done on the blackjack. All I have now is the Bible, but it works flawlessly. If you are a big texter (like me) you will love how fast you whip up those messages.I can't comment on email and internet usage because I don't use those features. I live in an EDGE area so trying to comment on a 3G phone wouldn't be relevent. Overall a good product that some will either hate it or love it. I for one, love it. So give that 30 day chance and if you don't like it, just send it back.***UPDATE*** 07/09/2007As far as battery life goes, I am using the included extended battery. I charged it on Friday night and on Tuesday I needed to charge it. With the vibrant screen and the full keyboard, I think thats great battery life. I have yet to use it with the standard battery.
I am new to the smartphone universe and I'm wondering how I ever got along without one. At the time of this writing I have owned my BJ for only 24 hours and I am having fun learning how to stay organized, play my favorite music, and actually hear people who call my phone.The quality on the external speaker is excellent. There is zero distortion of music as it comes through the speaker which is on the back of the phone. I love the fact that you can play music between calls and there is an option to have the music continue where it left off after you receive a call. Phone reception is the best I've experienced in a cell phone, ever. I noticed right away that I could hear callers much better than I could on my Motorola Razr; that is a big plus. The speakerphone option is also an added bonus and it too is crystal clear.WINDOWS MOBILE 5 was the selling point for me. You don't need special software to get your favorite music, email, or organizational tools. It's already on your computer and all you have to do is load the Samsung Blackjack disc that comes with your phone. I reccomend getting this done right out of the box. Then all you have to do is perform your initial synch to set up your Outlook Calendar and contacts. There are also a few trials on the disc that may be of interest, like NotepadSynch so that you can save the notes you write yourself on your BJ onto your computer hardrive. Windows Media 10 on your PC is already set up to interact flawlessly with BJ media so programming music favorites is a cinch. I had no problems loading songs to my phone and its fast! You can also have a lot of fun using the Song ID. It will "listen" to a song as you play it from your radio or computer and allow you to store the artists' name and song info---how kewl is that! Warning, this feature can be quite addictive.I really like the camera quality on this phone. I was so frustrated with the Razr camera I just stopped using it altogether. Now I am looking forward to taking pictures and using them with CallerID. My only hangup is the fact that you can only access the camera via the START menu. There is a video feature but I do not plan to use it much as there is no flash on this phone.
I've had the blackjack for almost a month now.  Overall I think it's a great phone.  This is my first smartphone.  I didn't want to purchase a blackberry because I simply can't use all its features.  I need to check email and surf the web.  My business doesn't have a BES(blackberry mail) server so I decided to get the blackjack.It is a little complicated at first to get the hang of everything.  The navigation buttons are close together and I often hit the green or red call buttons on accident, which is annoying.  I also use the task manager way to often to close programs that have no "exit" function.  I would have given this phone 5 stars if it had built in GPS and wifi.I really enjoy this phone becuase of its applications.  I've found all sorts of usefull programs like Google maps, IM+, Fizz Weather, Facade.  You can really customize the homescreen a lot since its just xml.  I was able to setup my POP3 accounts easily and retrieve/send email with it all day long.  The battery holds out just fine for me as well.  I have yet to use the extended life battery.  Docking with my pc works everytime and is easy to use.  The phones reception is also great.  I kinda live away from the city and I still get clear calls and constant Edge service, sometimes 3g.  I have movies and mp3z as well and both play great.  The speaker is good for me.  I don't usually play loud mp3s in a room full of people...I bought a 2gb microsd card for $26 at Brandsmart and it works fine.  I also got unlimited data from AT&T; for $19.99 a month, so I'm not sure why I see others complaining about paying $40 a month.  The camera on this thing is great as well.  I had a razr before this and its camera was good, but it doesn't compare to this phones cam.  Overall I'm very happy with it and use it a lot more than I thought I would.
I am an old Palm devotee, way back to the Handspring days. I never thought I would switch, but let's be honest, the Palm based phones are as heavy as a brick (a small brick, but a brick nonetheless!). After carrying around the BlackJack (BJ) I knew there was a better way. I carry it around in my coat pocket and don't even realize it is there. The only thing that took me a while to accept is the fact that I can't just tap on the screen of my BJ and add a calendar item. I used to do this all the time with my Treo 650 and it took a while to be at peace with having to tap a few buttons/keys in order to do the same thing on the BJ. One application, which is totally worth the $15 or so dollars I spent on it, is SBSH Facade. This creates a home screen that is much user friendly than what comes with the BJ.The Blackjack is great, especially with the unlimited data plan. For the first few months I did not have the plan and did not take advantage of it's features. But, let me tell you, the internet on this thing loads up very quickly! I get my outlook e-mail and calendar synchronized in real time in no time! I am amazed at the speed! Previously I had the Treo 650 with Sprint for 2 years, and I hardly ever used the internet explorer and the phone for e-mail since it was so slow, and the screen was only ok, the screen on the BlackJack is amazingly clear. I can read the smallest print! I might not be able to add a calendar item in a two-step process as I could with the Palm version of the Treo, but the extra few steps are worth it given the speed of the Blackjack and the much, much lighter phone. I miss my Treo only in the calendar function, but in everything else I am very happy with the Blackjack!
this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness.The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing.Niggles:1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either.2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own.3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around.4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint).
I've had this phone for about 2-3 months now.  I really like the email/internet/keyboard features.  What I didn't like was having to purchase the memory card and headphones seperately.  This added quite a bit onto my investment in the phone.  The phone I received also has some kind of glich when searching your contacts list.  If I am searching for "kerry" in my contacts I type in "K-E-R-R" and it brings up not only "Kerry" but also "Jimmy" and "Kristen"  This should not happen as I am typing with a keyboard and not the number keys.  This issue is really annoying.  I've read through some bulletin boards online and saw that several other people have had this contacts issue as well.Only other issue I've had is a couple times the battery has been completely drained within a couple hours after charging, even when the phone is not in use.  I have to take the battery out and put it back in and recharge it to fix the problem.THe phone is impressive looking though, and I like the mp3 feature.  The camera is also impressive.
I have had the BlackJack for over 1 month now.  I love it.  I think that it's a great smartphone.  Yes, it does lack some battery power but they give you a second battery for that.  I don't find it to much of a pain to swap out the batter in the afternoon.  I think I would suggest getting some kind of screen protectors to put over the screen to prevent scratching.
It's a love-hate relationship. I've lived with this phone for about 4 months now...Simply, this phone is the best way to get your Outlook to synch with your corporate Exchange box--without carrying a phone that looks like it's from the 80's. There's no disputing that.That said, it does have a LOT of quirks... Allow me to share some of the quirks with you. (Most of it is Windows Mobile 5 related.)- Cannot run Java based Gmail client app.- You CANNOT voice dial! (Unbelievable but true. Even with the $39 MS add-on software.)- Saving new numbers using the phone's UI is incredibly painful.- The directional key is tricky.- Using "Profiles" to set ring level & vibration is also painful. You can't just press the side keys to increase the ringer level and enable/disable vibrate.- The reception "bar" indicator is misleading.- If you have too many applications open, things slow down!- Getting ActiveSync to work thru Bluetooth is near impossible.- Cingular makes it very hard (and expensive) for you to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem.The basic phone functions that you took for granted are implemented in such a clumsy manner. Most of it is attributed to the Windows-like interface. Microsoft has had 5 revs of Windows Mobile and still, the killer-app (calling someone and receiving calls) is still so clumsy. It's simply unbelievable; no inexcusable.Bottom line: Cheaper phones will do a better job of quickly dialing and saving new numbers than this device. But hey, I have to live with it because I need the seemless Outlook & Exchange integration.
I bought the BlackJack a few weeks ago and am having a terrible problem with dropped calls in the Los Angeles area. Happens when I'm driving, when I'm stitting still in my office, any time of day. What makes this even more frustrating is that once a call is dropped, the phone loses it's ability to make ANY outgoing calls, and I have to power it down and turn it back on again. Spent last weekend in two Cingular stores and on the phone with Customer Service and after I got a new SIM card and did a hard re-set, the best advice they could give was to exchange the phone (which is a pain after I spent so much time to set it up). I agree with a previous review that the Cingular people as a whole have NO CLUE how to support this phone - *extremely* frustrating. I have a theroy that the phone is more advanced than the network, and we're just going to have to wait until it's done being "built" before the service is solid (the same thing happened with the BlackBerry a few years ago when I got it). Of course, no one at Cingular would say that...
Ok, I've had the Blackjack for two weeks now, after I got it for $100 for sticking with AT&T; for two more years.  I'm absolutely in love with it.  I enjoy the crisp, bright display (which I've always enjoyed with AT&T; phones), the keypad, the easy to use calendar, and also the windows media capabilities.  It's very, very cool that I can sync this thing to my computer and upload pics, music, etc. (and that I can make any music file into my ringtone).  The external speaker is actually quite loud should I choose to use it, and texting is a breeze with the keypad.  I took this out around a table of professionals with blackberries and they oohed and aaahed over it because it's thin and sexy, not bulky like the blackberries.  Internet usage on this phone is pretty cool, too.  I can surf the net with ease and navigating the pages isn't hard at all.  The battery life is also superb, too.  I changed to this phone from the bulky and ugly 8125, which had to be charged every night.  The Blackjack can go around 2-3 days without a charge, which is pretty convenient.  Overall, the Blackjack is slim, sexy, dependable, and fun to use.  I love it and I'd recommend it to anyone.
I had to return my BlackJack to AT&T; warranty center three times!  It froze a lot even though I frequently stopped programs using the task manager.  I also reset it several times, but it never stopped freezing.  The volume is too low, and I missed calls.  Even at the highest volume setting, it's difficult to hear.  The phone also becomes very hot when you are holding the handset to your ear.  It's best to use the bluetooth device.  I was very disappointed with the phone.  At&T; replaced my phone with a Blackberry Pearl.
Had this phone going on 9 monthsthe good:- 3G (its the big thing this has over the iphone)- dispay- connectivity generally good - I get my share of dropped calls, but I blame that more on AT&T; or Cingular or whatever these yahoos are calling themselves lately- google maps and other java apps work great (not sure why others had trouble with it)- the scrolling wheel- voice quality- bluetoothThe bad- dinky keyboard- the navigation dial around the OK button just sucks! most times my finger hits an adjoining key and causes lots of problems. If it wasnt for the scrolling wheel on the side, I would have put the phone in the box and shipped it back a long time ago. As it is, I barely tolerate it and will go out of my way to avoid using it.- gmail app is not supported. I can get it to receive mail but it cant send or synch with inbox. workaround is to access the gmail website and compose/send mail from there.I have not used the MP3/music. Camera is ok - not great.Battery life is ok - generally a day or 2 the way I use it. Usually not a problem since I charge it in the car.
I'm a long-time BB user, but my new company doesn't support it so I tried out the Blackjack.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either and I returned it after 4 days.ProsAfter reading the manual and messing around with the phone, I was able to become pretty familiar with it in about a dayAll the functions worked wellConsShort battery life - the small one lasted about half a day and the larger one made it to about 8PM.  I usually go a full day or day and a half on the BBScreen washed out in the sun...had to block out the sun w/my other hand to see the screenThe hard buttons didn't feel right and the end button next to the main 4-way control meant i kept pushing it and exiting out of programsAs I said, it wasn't bad, but it didn't wow me either.  I think I'll try the Q next.
The phone is gorgeous, and the buttons are easy to type on. The only downside of this device is the Windows software. It sort of reminds me of Windows 1998 - limited error messages and a very buggy version of Internet Explorer.
I have had a Blackjack for a month now and am very happy with the phone. I previously had a Pocket PC phone with a full slideout keyboard and almost never used it for replying to email or accessing the web, but with the Blackberry style keyboard, I find myself constantly using it to reply to mail and have used the web browsing several times.A couple of minor issues, and this about the only 'less than perfect' aspects of the phone:1) I carry the phone in my pocket and therefore use the key lock. To unlock you need to hit the power button on the top, the unlock key and then asterisk. A little clunky. (PS If you have it locked and the phone rings, it will let you answer buy just hitting the answer key).2) The meeting reminders keep ringing until you dismiss them. It would be really nice if it defaulted to just one ring to remind you. There is prob a setting somewhere to address this.Great phone for the price!
I wish I had purchased the new Treo 750 palm Treo 750 Smartphone (Cingular)or the 8525Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular).  Here are the cons to the Blackjack:Cons:1.  The phone takes 10-15 seconds when I press Contact List for the list to load. I confirmed this with another fellow user at Spring VON 2007 last week.  Can you imagine what it is like to wait 15 seconds while driving or trying to get a name. Engineers have 100 contacts. Users have 1000's. When people ask me why I do not recommend the phone, I tell them to watch, press contacts, and hold the phone up to them.  They are usually tired of watching by the time the contacts load. Samsung tech support acknowledged this is a problem with the phone.2.  Windows problem: When you type Jim or Bill all kinds of names come up. Even though Blackjack has a full key pad the software thinks you are typing numbers not names so it brings up abc letters associated with dialing "1" if you are typing a, b, or c.  Ridiculous!  Must have been designed by an engineer.3.  I can not view Youtube views or blip.tv or dave.tv or brightcove videos on my Blackjack.  Even with Adobe Flash lite 2.14.  The Blackjack is slow going from one program to the next. I think the Blackjack has a software hardware integration problem.  Sometimes you have to wait 10-15 seconds until you can access the phone to get to Call History for example.  The phone is busy waiting for another program to finish up.5. Often the phone will go off line and you can not get on the internet. It requires rebooting.  Others on line have complained about it.6. Battery life is like having a flashlight that dies before you get to the end of the trail.7.  I figured out the ActiveSync problem after days of effort.  Also loading contacts was wierd. I first had to uncheck contacts, load all the other information, then check contacts and load it. I found this hack ona forum.  Samsung tech support have not a clue about the hack issues.8. The screen is really too small for heavy email use.9. The key board is too tiny for lots of use.10. There is no WiFi on it - a must, WiFi dramatically changes your experience of using a Smartphone or PDA11. It does not come with a headset and the headset you need has a special jack that is only fits in the Blackjack.Pros:1. It is small and fits in my shirt pocket - replacing the pens!2. Cingular provides the service and it is 3G.3. A new version of MS Smartphone operating system is around the corner I heard which will allow me to edit Word, PPT Decks, and Excel.
I love this phone. The BlackJack is a lot of fun and certainly rivals all the blackberries out there, It's thinner and much more my style. The buttons are a little compressed but other than that it's a great phone for the price.
Good Stuff: Its an ok phone, has good call quality and really good battery life. Also takes really good pictures, specifially the color and tones of the pictures are very rich and almost look touched up. Looks cool, people that aren't that into phones think its something special. [...] has some good info on the phone.Bad Stuff: the charger/usb plug is propietary <sp?> so you have to buy that stuff off ebay or somewhere to get them. After taking pictures, i think you are supposed to confirm that you want to save or delete it, so if you dont answer it will delete. i usually end up with the last picture i tried to take. Lots of people have this phone, i have sat down for dinner where 5 of the 6 people set their blackjack on the table.I dont like not having the ability to copy and paste text. i sometimes find myself typing in the "to" field of an email and cant just copy the text from there into the actual message body so i have to just delete it all and retype it which is a hassle. Cant create or edit work, excel or .txt documents, all you can do it look at them acrobat reader style with something called piscel viewer. it sucks because i have to put all my notes into my outlook calendar and then find them later when i get to my pc. you can set mp3 files as ringtones but they have to be in the regular memory and not on the storage card. i think there is enough regular memory for about 4 songs. I was hoping the windows mobile upgrade from 5 to 6 would help me get over some of the little things i dont like but they keep pushing it back every time the get to the production date.Overall i really feel like i got suckered into the hype of this phone and it really isn't any different from all the other smartphones out there. I've had this phone for about 10 months. I wouln't reccommend purchasing this phone but if it was free or [...] with contract then it might be a good choice.
This is by far the worst cell phone that I've ever owned. I had a Qualcomm 1920 in the late 90's that's battery lasted longer than this one. You can't navigate hotmail, or link it up to Outlook on it. You would think such an advanced phone would have no problems sending picture mail; guess again. There are Vegas odds on whether or not they will send. Just recently, my phone decided to lose my yahoo account, and forget how to log on to the internet. And when I try to send picture messages now; I get an 'Unable To Connect' message. I can't wait to get a new phone so I can smash this one to pieces. It makes me miss my Razr
I love my BlackJack I have had zero problems with it as I have with the palm 750. However getting Amazon.com and ATT on the same page was a nightmare. ATT shows my contract has expired while Amazon shows my contract not be expired. Neither one would deal with eachother.  Both Companies have poor performance in the customer care department. I gaurantee it will reflect in the up coming market shift.
I had a Blackjack for around 2 1/2 months and the only good I can say about it is that it has a nice display, albeit small.  I have never experienced more dropped calls and poor reception than I did with the Blackjack.I could be in areas where other people with the same cell phone provider, different phones, standing right beside me would have multiple bars indicating antenna strength.  I would be lucky to have one bar.  Another family member also has a Blackjack and he has experienced the same problems that I had.I believe Samsung phones in general are lacking, because my wife has a Samsung A707 and experiences the same issues as I did with the Blackjack.Another thing, battery life is absolutely atrocious.  I realized very soon why the Blackjack comes standard with two batteries from the factory.The keys are also close together and I can't even begin to count the number of times that I was typing an email or using the center directional pad and my thumb would slip to the side and hit another key or exit out of what I was currently doing.I've now switched back to a Blackberry (should have never switched in the first place) and all is right again.  I'm not a big fan of Samsung phones.
I purchase this phone for both my wife and I, and we both love them. Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate, but is very versatile and functional. Reception and call quality are great, and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless. The screen is bright and crisp. There is no 3g in my area, but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing. Media player works well. Battery life is good with 3g turned off. This phone comes with both a standard and extended battery. With pretty heavy usage, I still have 1/2 battery power at night. 3g is said to really suck the power, though. Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want.
Friends of mine love this phone. For me it's just okay. It's not an excellent phone and it's not an excellent PDA. It is very thin, but it doesn't seem to do anything particularly well. Just not my cup of tea. I got a Mogul HTC instead. I have it for a few days now and i like it a lot more, with a full keyboard and touchscreen.
This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion.They overlooked a few features:-There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.-There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up.-In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location.-The track wheel feels pretty cheep.
Yesterday I received the BJ, spent half the night plying with it (including pretty painful process of downloading and installing a new firmware), only to discoverer at morning two "features" which made me return it without second thought:1. once paired with more than one BT device, it requires several steps manual setting to switch b/w them; i.e. it does NOT recognize and connect to a paired devise automatically (like my old RAZR, for example), and once you connect it to, say, an earphone, you'd need to manually re-connect it to, say, GPS or car BT, if needed - just to re-connect to earphone again!..2. speaking of car BT - it doesn't really work; well, it pairs with it, but doesn't support phone book synchronization - making the car BT unusable (try to find a contact in BJ while driving!); bewteen my 40K car and BJ I chose to change the phone ;) again, with my RAZR the car BT worked perfectly fine; funny thing - while googling for solution I found out that this is a well-known problem - and people are waiting for SAMSUNG to fix this since 2004! what a shame...I recognize bluetooth problems might not be that important for others, but to me lack of such a basic functionality is ridiculous - it's like buying a luxury car to discover it doesn't have a radio installed... For me it was a show-stopper... bye, BJ!
Pros:The screen is great. Enough resolution to read very small fonts.Great keyboard for such a narrow phone.Very thin and lightweight.Speaker is loud enough for any situation.3G speed is fast.Windows Mobile 5 and soon upgradeable to Windows Mobile 6.Cons:Does not work with BMW bluetooth.  Searching the web reveals that this is a very common issue due to Samsung not using the Microsoft bluetooth stack. This makes it not compatible with many bluetooth devices.
I've been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it. Sure there are things I would change, but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes.Cons:* The keyboard buttons are really small, but then I'm not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger. And I wouldn't want the phone to get any bigger.* If you ever see an ad that has a number like this - "1-800-Big-Deal" good luck on figuring out the alpha-to-numeric translation. Haha. I had that issue not long ago. However, I think all smartphones have that issue.* Lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset. This one is big for me. I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature.Pros:The list would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone. So here are a few:* Browser support is awesome! I can view everything, even Flash apps!* VPN support. If you are corporate, 'nuff said. This rocks.* Easy bluetooth setup and management.* Perfect size for a Smartphone. Not too wide and very thin.* Glass screen (doesn't scratch) and screen resolution is unbelievable.* Quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver.* Extended life battery comes with the phone.* Easy side access to SD card. No having to slide the battery off to remove or replace.There are a ton of great things about this phone. I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal, but until I see for myself, I'm sticking with this beauty. Buy one. You won't be sorry. I got mine for $75 with a $75 rebate. Free? Can't go wrong which ever way you look at it. :)
The phone is great, its decently light, has a nice bright screen, really good reception, and if you use it without bluetooth it holds a charge for at least 2.5 days on the smaller battery. Can keep it in my pocket, it doesn't need a holster like all those PDAs. It is 3G enabled with blazing fast data download speeds, it was like looking at milliseconds on a stopwatch.The interface though, totally sucks. I tried to transfer my contacts from my earlier Nokia phone, with Nokia its so easy, Copy to SIM, Copy to Phone. Here, you have to copy (to the phone) and delete (from the SIM) the contacts ONE BY ONE. Oof, I have 200 contacts, OK so I don't call every single contact, but hey, I always thought computers and automated went together.Had a very difficult time getting the back cover off before I discovered a neat trick on the att backjack forum, see my discussion on this page.Tried it with Microsoft Live Search and a bluetooth GPS device and worked fine except in midtown New York where I just couldn't get the GPS to latch onto anything.Had to install ActiveSync 4.5 before could sync with my PC, the CD this came with had only ActiveSync 4.2 which I just couldn't get working, it refused to recognise the phone.
I've went through probably 4-5 phones in the past 6 years. I could never find the one to fit my needs. But the Samsung Blackjack has everything i could ask for in a phone. i have absolutely no complaints. Just grateful that I think I will be keeping this phone for a VERY long time.
This is just a horrible phone; it freezes up all the time, whether you are entering someone's number or you are checking email.  Even a reset doesn't work -- I have to pull the battery out to reset.  I can't change the options of one of the email accounts I created and can't delete it.  There are so many other such gotchas -- I will never buy a Windows Mobile phone again and highly recommend against a Blackjack.
As long as you dont need to edit files this is the one you need.. I tried the Palm the Crackberry and Blackjack... I have the backjack.
After researching the Amazon site for cell phones and reviews etc, I picked this phone. But I am reaaaally dissappointed..Here is why...(1) The Battery dies very very quickly. I change batterries once in the morning and once in the afternoon !!  maybe that is the reason this phone comes with an extra battery and a separate charger unit !! But this is a real pain ... the Low battery signal starts up after a couple of hours or so even when I have not used the talk time at all(2) The PC sync is not as good as my previous phone. Has only default contacts list syn with MSOutlook,  could not sync with a second Contacts list like ' Home Contacts' which I setup on my MS Outlook.(3) Cingular and Amazon forced me to a minimum monthly scheme of $80 per month ( 39.99 for voice and 39.99 for data) and for 24 months(4) The Office email server setup never worked for me(5) The wake-up alarm system seems to have bugs and did not work -  maybe related to batterries but wierd(6) I find tha AMAZON return policy to be very difficult  so have to deal with this now !!
It's virtually impossible to key in telephone numbers correctly.  The numbers are spread arbitrarily around the keyboard.
Overall, I agree with most of the comments already posted indicating that the BlackJack is nice.Unfortunately, I came across one unpleasant surprise that you won't hear about until after you buy the phone.You can not stream XM via the browser using your existing XM account.In order to stream music via XM, you have to open a XM mobile account for an additional ~$9 a month.  This is a disappointing as I was attracted to the blackjack with the expectation that I would be able to stream music with my existing account.Called customer service to make sure that I was not just missing something and they indicated that they were getting a lot of complaints regarding this...
This is a great smartphone by Samsung.  I just got it a few days ago and let me tell you it blows my Nokia 6620 (also a Smartphone) out of the water.  The phone is great.  It has great reception, quadband, yadda yadda (why restate the specs when they are right up above this review anyways?!)Battery life seems decent - I have yet to use the phone for a full day as I just activated it yesterday.  Amazon.com fails to tell you that you actually get two batteries and an external charger/case for the second one.The only problem I have with this phone are the buttons - and I'm not talking about the tiny qwerty keyboard; that's just fine for my fingers.  I'm talking about the send and end button - the end is more of a problem.  If you are doing anything with this phone while on a call with someone, be careful as you may accidentally hang up on them.  The buttons should have been raised or something, and made a little smaller so they aren't touching the rocker pad.  The back button does take a little getting used to as well.  Sometimes you will expect it to take you to the last screen you saw and it will end up dumping you back on the Today screen - not a big deal but still a minor annoyance.As far as the "number spacing" it's not a problem.  Actually it's a feature.  What Samsung has done with this phone is set 2 buttons on the keypad for every number (except 0, *, and #).  The letter directly to the right of the number you want will also activate that number when dialing a number on the phone.  You can even press down both keys at the same time and it will only register as one button press.E-mail setup was a breeze.  I am using the built-in POP setup for GMail, and I have Yahoo! Go also set to sync to the phone. The sheer number of applications available for this phone give anyone who buys it lots of flexibility and options.  Just beware that The MIssing Sync still seems to have a few issues (not sure if it's with the phone or not - I can't sync my address book through it, cause of some retarded error).Pros:Easy to useComes with 2 batteriesVery flexible due to all the applications available for downloadLook at the specs 'cause I am too lazy to list the rest.Cons:Back button takes a little getting used toSend/End buttons are too easy to accidentally press.I am giving this phone 4 stars due to the problem with the send and end buttons.  I'm sure I won't always have a problem with this, but Samsung could have designed it a little bit better.  All-in-all I am very happy with my "purchase" (well, I got the phone free, but I would still buy it if I wasn't offered it free [I know people are gonna hate me for that =P].)  If you need e-mail on-the-go or just want an easier time text messaging - this phone is probably for you.
Don't be fooled by it's good looks, this phone is awful.  Spotty service on 3G and EDGE, inability to make notes (making the keyboard on it pretty useless unless its solely for texting), complicated interface, frustrating menus, and low speaker volume.  The volume is a really big gripe with me.  At it's loudest setting, I miss almost every single call I get when in the car, no matter which ring tone I use.Bluetooth headsets are pretty frustrating as well, the phone doesn't supports voice-dialing, and if you have many contacts, better pull off to the side of the road to scan through them all, dial, turn on/connect the headset, and you're ready to go.  Yes, you'd save time by pulling over to find a pay phone.Then there's AT&T;/Cingular's service.  These are "special people" folks.  Even a year after its release, they know nothing about the Blackjack.Want some navigation?  Try using GoogleMaps or the TeleNav system AT&T; wants to sell you.  I bought it, tried it, but nothing happens.  Apparently, there's no built-in GPS in the phone.  What?  A smart phone with no GPS?  You heard right, what they don't tell you after signing up for TeleNav is that you also need to buy a $100 GPS add-on.  Then pay the monthly fee.  Got it?  You're better off buying a separate portable GPS system for under $200; you'll save a ton of money, believe me.Also, the phone takes awhile to boot-up and shut down and the speaker phone isn't very loud on it's loudest setting (unless you're sitting in a quiet room).So what's the good thing about this phone?  Well, it looks nice and shiny.  The screen is nice and big.  It takes good pictures and video.  It will play MP3s (but the volume will cripple you, unless you have the headphones with the special connector--no standard headphone jack here).  Oh, and sometimes you can even make phone calls!  Isn't that neat?Bottom line, if you want a phone with a built-in GPS, a notepad feature, voice-dialing via Bluetooth, decent volume, and a good signal, then avoid this one!PS: I'm not even mentioning the battery life or the WAY too small keyboard.
Does anybody know if I cancel the PDA service (but keep the voice service) after a few months, will there be any penalties? I am interested in trying the PDA service but not sure if I will want to keep it.
I had a samsung blackjack until they day i logged onto the cingular website and saw the blackberry 8800. Windows Mobile just reminded me of yet another reason why I had switched to a Mac five years ago! It was stupidly designed and left me frustrated with almost everything. for example, In order to quit an app, you need to open up the task manager and click "stop?" WHY??? You can't just simply ignore this because having too may applications opened will drain your scarce and precious battery life even more then it normally does. (When I walked into the cingular store to get rid of this daemon, they informed me that the newer blackjacks come with a bigger battery that makes the phone bigger...even with this option, it still wasn't enough for me to keep this phone.)In order for this phone to even remotely function for me on a day to day basis, I called cingular and they instructed me to log into this hidden menu where i had to turn off the 3G and use the EDGE network because the 3G is what drains the battery. (Ok?? so I chose this phone over all the others in that cingular store because of the supposed 'faster' internet browsing experience, but now I'm being instructed to TURN IT OFF???) Just a reminder: if you use the phone with the 3G turned on, It will not last more then 6 hours under normal use of internet, phone capabilities. (Also the 3G emits significantly larger amounts of radiation then edge network phones...just something to keep in mind....large amounts of radiation both next to my ear and brain, and in the palms of my hands scare me..)I usually love samsung products (their LCD tv i have is amazing...it made me opt for the samsung phone actually!), but this phone is lacking in all of the services that would make a phone "smart." HOW ABOUT A LARGE ENOUGH BATTERY SO I COULD USE THE PHONE? OR MAYBE APPS THAT QUIT THEMSELVES LIKE IN THE PALM OR EVERY OTHER PHONE THAT I KNOW OF. It just seems the designers of this "smart phone" were stupid...please take this into consideration before buying!!!
So I just got this stupid phone and am just now charging it after an HOUR of trying to get the stupid battery back off.I have a feeling that the phone is going to be great!  BUT the battery cover is ridiculous.  I had to YOUTUBE  it to find a video to show me how to get the battery cover off and it still took too much effort!A phone that has this much potential should be not THIS aggravating right out of the box!!!!!!!!!Review Part 2:  I sent it back in less than 24 hours AND canceled my service with Cingular....Part of my problem with this machine is that Cingular(At&t;) misrepresented it to me on the phone.  I wasn't happy with how difficult it was to get the back cover off for the battery, how much effort it took to get multiple emails put together, or the fact you can't manipulate ringer volume without going through preferences(mind boggling to me??!!)Cingular also had problems with their tech support(not knowing things etc.)Overall this was a horrible experience...Verizon here I come!!
The Blackjack is very cute and slim. I'm a girl so i like those features. I love that it comes with an extra battery. But because that extra battery is larger it also has an extra cover which makes the phone a bit bigger from the back. It's not compatible with macs which totally sucks. I really really love it cuz i can get my e-mail in there and i never had that before so i'm in awe! It has all these cool features but i honestly dont use them. For example:it has like videos that you can watch thru the internet, also internet music and some other things that i honestly don't use but it's still very cute!overall i recomend this to GIRLS!!!!! Just cuz it's slim and it's fun to text on. & I know that ppl love to text. so go on ahead and buy it.
This thing will microwave you.  I had mine tested and the phone got extremely hot in the upper corner where it's emitting the same radiation used to cook food.  Sure it's just battery powered, but still... this phone is a total piece of junk.
3G is so fast if you don't have 3G in your area move and you will thank me when you do.
Targeted simultaneously at several of the competition phones, this one packs in enough to make you like it over several others in its category. I have been using the phone over the last couple of months, and have been deliberately taken my time to post this review but still I haven't found too many glitches. Previous to this one I was using an i-Mate SP3i; another smart phone, which wasn't really one. Well, SE W950i is a smart phone and it lives up to it.A Very Simple and Neat UI is what is strikes you first. The Screen is crisp and reponds well. The Stylus that accompanies it may take a while getting used to, more-so if you are used to longer styluses but once you get used to it, it's pretty comfortable. There are three parallel ways to use the phone - the three way Scroll Wheel (which I personally LOVE and find the best), a touch screen and the keyboard. The Handwriting recognition may take some time getting used to, but once you are through it works well. Dedicated buttons for all your walkman features are also an add on to simplify life. The instrument itself is not bulky at all; weighs decent and measures much thinner than the positively Obese Nokia N-Series offerings.The OS manages multi tasking much better than Windows Mobile, since it kills the LRU process (sometimes even all the processes, sadly) when overloaded, but prevents itself from crashing. Although I must say that once this one hangs (pretty rare; i've faced it twice in 3 months), even the power button wouldn't turn it off; you'll have to disconnect and reconnect the battery. Task Switching is way smoother than Windows Mobile and even the previous Symbian Releases. This is notable specially when receiving a call while listening to music. The call engages and disengages very smoothly.Music; the prime reason for me loving this phone. The response times of the internal memory are decent and the playback is phenomenal. The earphones that ship with it are way better than those that ship with an iPod. Thoughtfulness of their design team is clear when you see the charger which allows you to connect the headset even while charging - at the same port. The headphones have a standard audio jack which means you can use any headset with it, but unlike the other phones with Audio Jacks, this one has it on the Handsfree set, instead of the phone - use your headset and still answer call with the same one by using your handsfree mic. The Walkman remote could've used a few more functions (like a radio button and press-forward on the Next button) but it is functional and handy. The Music Player itself is not only good in L&F;, it also performs well. Beware though; it won't play any distorted MP3s. (Those songs you ripped off your scratched Disc, which your PC plays with slight 'klik-klik'? Yeah, they are no good on this phone.) The Video Quality is about the same as the iPod. While one can never fit his entire collection onto the 4GB (I can't even on an 80 GB iPod), nevertheless you CAN fit your active library into 4GB and it's fairly easy to sync as need be. (If you can't wait for the 8GB w960i)At this price tag, most people are looking for a do-it-all phone, which unfortunately this one isn't, cause it lacks a camera. Understandably, while Nokia has chosen to go the integrate-all-devices-into-a-phone way; SE is going a way I understand more - user profile specific phones. So this one here is targeted at the user who is looking for a rich music phone with Business capabilities to add to it. Please note that this isn't a business phone with a music capabilities like the offerings of O2, HP, Palm etc. However, the phone by no means compromises on the features provided. It integrates well with all possible applications you use for your work; Outlook (even 2007) can be easily configured too; Word Processing Applications can be added. If one accepts that he ain't possibly going to make his Cellphone a replacement for his Laptop and Broadband connectivity; you wouldn't really miss Wi-Fi. For all your on the fly work, this one suits just fine. Quite a few useful applications pre-configured with your phone Like RSS Reader and Play Now, come into handy use.With all of the above, one expects Battery life to pretty much disappoint; here's where SE show their true power. I've personally used the Phone to play 14 hours of music (with All Phone features turned on); Read a few RSS feeds, made about an hour of calls and still not run out of battery! The battery charges very fast and gives you atleast a day's worth of playback and phone usage (even if you are always doing one of the two). Forget about running out of power. Period.Set your priorities right - If Music tops them, this phone is for you; If it doesn't, look elsewhere.
Bought the phone from Amazon, but had to send it for repairs to Sony Ericsson. They asked me to submit a proof of purchase- an invoice with the phone IMEI number (its like a serial number). Called amazon but was told that they don't open the box so they don't know.Sony said its a great market phone- so sorry NO WARRANTY without the receipt, the IMEI on receipt should match with the one on the back of the phone!So basically if you buy this phone and get into problems with it- NO ONE IS GOING TO HELP YOU AND YOU JUST THREW YOUR MONEY AWAY.Please think twice before buying friends!!
I initially liked this phone with the touch screen, it is pretty stylistic. However, there seems to be a software bug in it, as it kept hanging once in a while. Normally, it happens when I press a wrong menu option and try to go back too quickly but it seems to happen even without a cause at times and sometimes I do not realize it has hanged, while just lying in its cover and later my friends complain that they've been trying to call me without getting any response from me.I would not recommend this phone and would hope that Sony Ericsson, improve their Quality control a bit more and do comprehensive testing before launching such expensive products.
I received the phone in pristine condition. Works perfectly, all package items included. Delivery was very fast.
As a long-time owner of Sony Ericsson and Nokia phones; I was a bit hesitant to buy any phone outside of those two familiar brands, but after my last phone got lost, I needed a replacement and needed a good phone fast.You know know Motorola's popular Razr line dominated 2006 and is still a strong contender for 2007, so with that popularity, it seems the company is not going to venture too far from a line that really sky-rocketed them to the No. 1 spot. From the Razr came the new Krzr and Rizr line and so we will pick on the Rizr at this time.I have had the phone for 3 days know, and I am really impressed with this little thing. The hardest thing for me was just geting use to the Motorola interface (this is my very first Motorola); but besides that, it had all the features I craved...P..R..O..S......1) WORLD PHONE Baby - I love Ericsson phones, but they are usually tri-band phones...I needed a quad band phone with all the travelings and phone calls I make, and I knew Motorola is very consistent with this modality.2)CAMERA & VIDEO based- telephone - I love to take pics and I love recording capabilities on my cell phones, so when I found that this nifty devide has a 2MP camera and an un-timed video recorder (both of which can be accessed with a dedicated button), I was very thrilled..It has full-fledged camera and video options, so you'd never need to carry a separate camera or video camera when you have this phone3)MP3 Player - I already have a dedicated music player, but it is nice to have the option to load as much as 40-50 songs on this phone ( with its included 128MB micro-SD card).4) Great battery management - You'd think with a gadget that boasts to be a phone, MP3 player, video and camera will die in  few hours right...wrong..I have only charged it once (I love having my phone fully charged before I leave the house) and it is really good with its battery management ( definately squashed my last cell phone which boasted all the same features - Sony Ericsson K700i)5) EXPANDIBLE - The phone only has around 24MB of memory, but with the included 128MB card, and the ability to upgrade the phone yourself and get a 2GB card, there is virtually no way to ever really run out of space6) STEREO Bluetooth HEADSET anyone? - Ok...so I havent purchased it yet, but because this is a Music player phone and because it does have Bluetooth, you can buy a Bluetooth stereo headset so that you can jam to your music and be totally wireless...NiCE!!7) Perfect for NON-FLIP Lovers - I have a thing for bar/candy bar phones...I never cared for flip phones, so this is a real treat for both the lovers of flip phones and those of us who still like the European-type non-flip phones...ALSO, voice recordings & voice note-talking capabilites, JAVA-enabled, standard productivity suite (Calendar, Alarm, World clock), Instant Messaging ( if you are on the T-Mobile network), Ability to use your MP3s as your own ringtones...C..O..N..S......1) What? No Infraread - Although I will miss having the IrDA technology, everything seems to be moving to a Bluetooth connectivity world, so I am not too sad about it.2) No FM Tuner - I didnt really need this feature on a phone, but I did have it on my last cell phone and it was great to have. This phone's other features do make the lack of a FM tuner bareable though, so its all good.that's it...I am really enjoying this phone. I am glad I got it. Thanks T-mobile. LOLLet me know if you have any questions or want to know anything else about this wonderful product!
Motorola RIZRFirst blush, day 1: Attractive phone, feels good & sturdy in the hand, buttons are very responsive, slide function is easy to use and graceful, GUI is not exactly pretty but mostly very intuitive. Rather well put together phone.Why'd I get this phone: quad band, Bluetooth, good camera, a music player (or two actually, confusing) which seemed decent in the store. And because it was NOT a flip phone (which I loath), Tmo didn't have a decent candy bar (which I love), and ... it was not a Samsung (take that for what it's worth).Pros:1. Great camera compared to what I've had (SE T610, Samsung T809) with very strong flash, actually, it's like a flash light. Can I smart button this function anyone?2. So far, reception is pretty good, antenna stronger than my old & beat up SE t610, and comparable to my Samsung t809 (which broke), but sometimes the call is scratchy or does that computer reverberation like sound (which I've never experienced on my other phones).3. iTap text message entry is pretty impressive/smart (this is my first Motorola phone). I'm not sure of how it is implemented on other Motorolas but I like it on this one. I miss a few choices of T9 on my SE t610 (w/ Tmo) but iTap is cool.Cons:1. No timer or stopwatch2. No analog clock option (but Moto if you're going to design one, make it look like the Nokia analog clock for the 6133 or the s60 menubar clock)3. No mirror on the back for self pics like many Sony-Ericsson bar phones have4. Placement of memory card: buy yourself surgical tweezers or hemostats to get this sucker out5. Mac/Bluetooth/iSync: iSync does not work for me despite having first dl'd an iSync plug in which purports to doing so. With my Samsung this made me irate, but Moto has a good track record with iSync support so I'm waiting.6. Headset has better mic, so others hear me better even than when I'm using the phone regularly. BUT, there's often (65% of the time) a buzz that either I can hear, or both my caller and I can hear.7. Cannot access full menu when on a call, only some menu functions (but not text or call recording)8. Cannot record calls9. Some functions & settings hard to find (or completely lost)Tmo has crippled this phone in some ways:1. no MotoReader like the Moto site for the product says (which opens MS docs)2. the option to save text messages to the SIM card has been removed. Tmo support says they can't control this. Moto says Tmo has removed it and thus controls that aspect.3. cannot install Java apps like the Moto site says.What? I thought this was MY phone now. Silly consumer, Deutsch Telecom owns it.Comments:1. screen is tiny compared to others, but still is very resolute and pleasant to look at2. camera is great, doesn't have as many fun options as my old Samsung t809 (which I really didn't like but which did have lots of ways to play with your pics when taking them like comic bubbles etc)3. my RIZR was set to display only SIM card contacts when I first got it from Tmo which frustrated me for a while since the phone kept telling me that the newly BT transferred contact was "outside current view"4. I have decided to keep the phone with Tmo despite the drawbacks I've listed.After long term use:1. key pad lost responsiveness, would not enter some numbers, some numbers would enter two or three times, scrool pad lost sensitivity on one side.2. after moving on to other phones, the features i miss are- flash light (simple feature, but once gone is missed)- iTap. going back to t9 is painful now! iTap took a little adjustment but once adjusted is far superior
Ok so I have the a Unlocked Black Rizr I got off of ebay since amazon is still so high. That will probably drop before too long. But keep in mind amazon has warranties and protection compared to the hassles ebay can ensue. So heres my take on it after a couple weeks.The good and bad of this sweet phone!1: Mp3 player. I love having this in my phone! I have a separate one butthis is so much better if you just want to pack light. The interface isn't the best on the media player but its bearable. It allows playlists and sorts by artist, album, and song. Only thing that really bugs me is no link to the now playing. It has one when you just let it play but once you leave that screen your s.o.l. Overall decent though, however you can't do other things and keep the music playing. You can suspend it, but that still pauses the playback. You can also add a 2gb microsd card to really make it worth while. Just make sure you have a card reader to speed transfers to the card.2. Bluetooth/Stereo Bluetooth: Whooh, this may be my favorite new gadget! listening wireless like never before. I have a Motorola S9 headset and a SonyEricson. The S9 really makes me never want to use wired headphones again. However, the sonys are more comfortable but you have something hanging down still. I love both though. Definitely worth the money. Just hope you have gotten used to pairing headsets. Sometimes the phone likes to play games with me and make me repair them. Especially if you switch headsets a lot.  Also, you can use the bluetooth and the motorola software to backup your contacts, make ringtones, and sync calendars with your computer. You just have to get the software.(I suggest checking forums for it but you can always be honest and actually buy it and keep motorola in business.) The software is nice but beware paying much for it. Theres many other ways to do the same thing. Thats all for that.3. Camera: I love having the camera but beware its not going to blow your mind or anything. Good lighting though so it will get decent pics when you want it to. So generally it serves its purpose of getting you a pic in the spur of the moment. The video camera is awesome however. You get a clear picture with as much recording time as you memory can hold. SO you can catch not just that one moment but the whole thing. Just don't think the 2 mega-pixel camera will look as good as the a good digital one.4. Ok here's a few little random things: Expect moto menus. Not a whole lot has changed here however the voice dialing on mine was like the British version. Just a couple more weeks and I'll have my accent perfect to use this feature. Hopefully =). The amazon versions are probably more the american version than mine.  A drawback to ebay but hey it proves this is truly a world phone. I'm using t-mobile and get good reception pretty much everywhere. Battery works good I usually charge it like every other night or so depending how much I listen to the mp3 player. Good battery life considering all thats packed in it. Screen is good. Would recommend a screen protector to keep it looking good.Overall, I'm very happy with it. It works great as a phone or mp3 player or camera. Just watch the price. Thats the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Also, get the black or red. The blue is sadly, real ugly.Oh almost forgot, make sure you go to carriers website and get the download for the internet browser. Internet won't work without it. At least, not with t-mobile. Found it in faqs for phones not purchased through t-mobile. Don't worry, its free to download.
PLUSES:Looks futuristic, up to date, cool. Menu is easy to navigate through, phone is pretty user friendly. Great display and graphics. Cool ring tones and backgrounds. 2megapixel camera, light. Good reception.MINUSES:Here is what I just don't get: Sony Ericsson has this and I think it is one of the most useful features. This phone nor any of the other motorola one I know does not have the ability to light up the main display when a button is pressed. When the screen goes blank, you have to press something for it to light up, but any button you press will perform that button's command. If you press any button on a Sony Ericsson while the screen is black, it first goes to the main screen. This is VERY inconvenient. If you are on a call, the screen goes black, so if you want to check how many minutes you've been on the call, or see what number it is, or what time it is, you can't, unless you press a command key, in which case you'll end up in that command. Sucks. Also, the speaker is shoddy, sometimes it just breaks up and sounds muffled, as well as the ear phone. I don't think the people on the other line sound as clear as they should, I often find myself asking them to repeat thmselves, but not on my Sony Ericsson. The picture quality is OK, not good, not great.Bottom Line: Cool, but far from great. A few tweaks to the interface would make this phone much better, but Motorola just didn't hit the mark yet.
I have had my RIZR from T-Mobile for a few weeks now after switching from Verizon. I was originally considering the Nokia 5300. But when I compared the 2 phones side by side, the RIZR seemed more solid, more durable and less flimsy than the Nokia 5300. So I chose the RIZR and I could not be happier. The phone is easy to program and a breeze to use. The display is bright, clear and very easy to read (even without my bifocals!). So far the sound quality and reception have been outstanding. The best feature for me is the mp3 player. With my new RIZR I can transfer mp3 songs directly from my computer to my phone with a simple drag and drop (the 128 MB card is not very large, but enough for my needs). I can then select the songs to act as ringtones. Being able to assign a song/ringtone to a certain phone number is a really cool feature, at least for me.The mp3 player included with the phone is very easy to use too.My only "minor" gripe is the screen goes black during calls. But I found pressing the volume up button, which displays the volume screen temporarily, brings the main screen back fast enough for me.All in all a great phone and highly recommended.
I was completely happy with my Motorola Razor.  However, it didn't have the option to expand the memory so it let me to this phone.  I'm fairly happy with this phone.Pros:Small size2mp camera w/flashMP3 playerMovie (3GP) player.  You can rip dvds and convert them into the 3GP format and watch movies on your phoneExpandable memoryQuad bandBattery life.  5 days stand by 3.5 hours talkUSB port to manage your phone via computerCons:Signal not as good as my RazrThe phone would seem like it's initializing itself from time to time.  It gets very annoying.  Sometimes I want to make a call and it'll do this for about 30 seconds.  It gets frustrating specially when you have a very urgent call to make.You need to be a surgeon to pull out the memory card and the sim card.I paid one bill for this phone.  It's a decent buy, specially when you go to the gym, it can be your phone and mp3 at the same time.  I wouldn't pay a dime over a bill for this.If the Razor had the same features, that would still be my phone.
I guess I just wasn't meant to have this phone...  I originally purchased it from cells[...]It's a neat phone, especially the video functionality that lets you pick different color filters, even a negative filter.I chose the unlocked version thinking I'll have more versatility for travel.  However, this means that you have to call T-Mobile to download t-zones so you can send and receive picture and video messaging.  It also means, most annoyingly, that you won't get the usual icon to let you know you get voicemail - instead empty text messages _@ lets you know someone left you a message and delta@ lets you know you've checked your voicemail.Unlike the phone from cellswholesale, amazon did send me a new phone, with the tamper sticker on the box and the protective plastic on the phone.  Whereas cellswholesale's phone was for the Chinese market with a Chinese adaptor, amazon's was for Hungaria and Romania, so there was no English handbook.  I went online to motorola's website and made the mistake of downloading the upgrade software for the phone hoping the voicemail notification would work.  (It didn't work - it only erased a lot of the extras for the European market).  Extras also included the PhoneTools 4.0 software with USB connector, which I unknowingly purchased separately.It's still a neat phone - but the reception is HORRIBLE.  Everyone I speak to sounds like they're congested with a really horrible flu and I miss out on over half the conversation.  I'm with T-mobile in Northern Jersey and this reception is way worse than for the Nokia phone I had for over 3 years.  Also small things I preferred about my Nokia phone was how it placed an icon on the screen to let you know you set the alarm and also Nokia let you know how much time was left before the alarm time.  And yes, you need tweezers to remove the SIM card from the Rizr.  You can set an analog watch on the lower right, but it's hard to read.It's too bad I'm returning the phone to amazon.  I love the way it feels - solid and compact and its smart multimedia features.  It also has an easy-to-use voicedial program.  If it wasn't for the terrible reception, I would keep it, but then again, what's a phone for?
I've had this phone for about two months now and have only two complaints: average to good call clarity (I'd prefer excellent) and a crappy OS.Call clarity is acceptable to good and volume is great.  Battery life is average for a phone with this sort of feature set.  It needs daily charging if you use it a lot.Only major complaint: The operating system blows.  I've had a longstanding  allegiance to Nokia phones, which has only grown since switching to Motorola and realizing that the Nokia OS is often sensible where Motorola's is cumbersome.  But I didn't like any of the new Nokia offerings and decided to give Moto a try.  Moto OS is to Nokia OS as Windows 3.1 is to Mac OS X Tiger, which is to say I won't buy another Motorola if I can find a phone by another company that isn't ugly, has good call quality and decent battery life, and has the features I need or want.Bluetooth works great.  Expandable storage is lovely to have (though getting that little card out is a pain). Camera is top notch for a cell phone.FYI:  Purchased it locked from T-mobile but successfully unlocked it when I recently switched to ATT (Bought the code off Ebay).
I've had this phone for a month or so now.  For the most part I like it; not sure what I would have gotten instead.  It works nicely, has the features I need, and the audio quality is significantly better than any other phone I've had.A few notes:- One thing that hadn't occurred to me with the slider design: there's only one display, and it's color.  I'm used to using my phone as a watch, but, with this one, I have to poke it to make it turn on the backlight.  For this reason alone, my next phone might be a clamshell.- The vibrator is wimpy, to the point that I miss calls sometimes.- The battery indicator is screwy - the battery is always completely full until it's empty.- Getting it configured to work with my carrier (I think they're called ATT this week) was more work than I had expected.  Non-technonerd people are likely to need help to get things like web browsing or GPRS working.Overall it's a great phone, though.
I got this phone in April and for about the first month I was quite pleased with it.  It's slim, easy to use and is generally a nice phone.  Then it started to randomly shut down and reboot while I read text messages, while I wrote text messages, while I looked to see what time it was, in the middle of conversations, and even while simply sliding the phone open.  This happens about two times a week and it is very annoying.  Other folks have posted this same defect online but T-Mobile refuses to acknowledge that there is anything wrong.  I hate very few things in this world but right now I HATE THIS PHONE.
The RIZR Z3 its a really nice cell phone, it has good options, games, very friendly over all. The only critic is for my opinion that the software its a little bit slow.
I love it!  Comfortable to use, easy to navigate, feels sturdy yet sleek, has a fantastic camera that takes very clear photos and videos too, a great little MP3 player, lots of cool ringtones, funky wallpaper, connects with a USB to my computer, extra storage card included, wireless capability, clear reception, and best of all - it's gorgeous!What more do you want?  :-)UPDATE...it's now April 2010 and I still have this phone - still going strong!  :)
The phone seems very sturdy.  It has a nice industrial design.  The firmware is OK at best, and it takes more clicks to get anywhere than my kids' nokia.  That got it a star above 1.  The software that I had to buy separately was totally inadequate.  First of all, it goes out to sync and downloads 30 MB's of s/w and says its up to date, but it still won't sync.  After reading their website, I download some more s/w to reinstall the drivers.  NOTHING WORKS.  I call them and they say that there's a new version that works w/ this phone.I get it, and it does well w/ the calendar and contacts from MS Lookout, but is unable to work with the music.  I have music in High resolution MP3s, but it can't read them.  It can't read wmas, which sync really nice-  I can't resize my MP3s to the smaller ones (see nokias great s/w).  All in all, it's been about 12 hours and I'm uploading some music that may or may not work, and takes entirely too much of the memory to hold it.Motorola, you're an embarrassment.
I purchased this phone and I have to say that it is totally cool I have had a ton of Motorola Phones but this one is the greatest.There are so many things it would take a hour to write it all down,the camera works great and is 2 mp camera with a flash,it has two music players on it one regular player and one java player it also supports A2DP bluetooth so you can use the Motorols headphones.it has Obeymoto on it and screen 3 it has 20 MB of memory in the phone and can hold up to 2 MB trans flash memory card in it.I have it in the Black color but it also comes in red but they are hard to find.If you want the latest and the greatest and are as tired of the old and outdated Razr V3 as I am this is the phone for you.Word is that in March T-Mobile is replacing the old Pebl with this phone so keep an eye out for it in March sometime T-mobile has already discontinued the Pebl so that is a good bet this will show up soon.
DB roth is good at response. When they found out the charger come with Moto Z3 has defect they sent me a partial refund on that charger real soon. The product were actually made in China, both phone set and charger, even they are Motorola. The quality is not that good any more. I'm very disappointed.
I bought the phone for my 6-year old who was having separation anxiety.  I purchased $25 of minutes and gave hime the phone for emergencies (which is what the thing is for).  Since we did not have any emergencies in the last 6 months, the phone has gone unused.When I tried to use it this morning it would not work.  I called customer service who pointed me to a terms & conditions page 3 links deep on their website.  In 5-point font they let you know that if you don't use the minutes in 90 days they expire and if you don't use the phone for 120 days they deactivate it.  There is a $25 reactivation fee and you lose all of your purchased minutes.When I pointed out that the policy was not clearly posted I was basically told tough luck by a 22 year old "Customer Service" manager.This is a terrible way to do business, a really obnoxious means of wringing additional revenue out of an existing customer base (especially given the primary purpose of the phone as an infrequently used emergency device).This company ought to be ashamed of themselves.  Bunch of scheisters.
I bought this for my son at the beginning of the school year for emergencies. Far too expensive on the minutes that must be used before they expire. I tried getting more minutes on their site that you must use and is poorly setup. It keeps looping you on a minimilist site. Good luck trying to find a phone number to call them and getting a human being. I sent email and a day later they responded with a phone number to call. No, the number is not listed on the site. Finally I just gave up and got a free real cell phone for just $10 extra a month on my plan (T-mobile). I'll take the chance of him being responsible than having the frustration of trying to work with this substandard product (there are no number buttons on it and it is difficult to hear anyone) and poor customer service. I would give it ZERO stars if I could. Save your money and look elsewhere.
The Motorola KRZR K1 is a very stylish phone.  It will surely impress people.  The only thing you need to worry about buying this phone from Amazon is that it may come from another country.  This means that an American adapter is included for the foreign plug and the language is in British English, which is not a big deal but odd for people used to Personalize instead of personalise.  The phone is extremely shiny because it is made of polished metal and glass.  Glass is an odd material for a mobile phone, but looks nice considering how fragile it is.  The screen color and resolution are also very nice.  Call quality is decent.  All in all a 9 out of ten for looks and 8 out of ten for quality.
Okay, before I get into this.  I have to let everyone know that this is the first flip phone I've ever owned.  All of my previous phones were candybar style Nokias.  The KRZR is an excellent phone, still a little pricy, but beautiful to behold.  The MP3 player function is quite good.  The volume and clarity for such a small object are top notch.  Colors are bright and vibrant.  I think my favorite feature of all of them is the voice command function.  That in itself made it worthy of a five star rating.  I have only one complaint.  The menus can be quite complex and detail intensive at times.  The manual deffinitely came in handy a couple of times.  But otherwise this thing is worth its weight in gold.
I purchased an unlocked, midnight blue version of the K1 KRAZR for $99 by renewing my T-Mobile contract for 2 years at my neighborhood cellphone store.  (Not many stores will sell you an unlocked phone, so this will not be an option for most people.)  Compared to the RAZR, I was surprised at first at how much heavier it feels in the hand and also how much thicker it looks.  It is actually just slightly thicker than the RAZR, but because it is so narrow (and heavy) it feels much thicker than it really is.Even though I miss the elegant styling of the RAZR, the KRAZR beats it hands down on features: a camera with half-decent resolution (finally - why did it take so long?), video camera, memory card slot, voice recognition, and MP3 capability.  The form factor, while not as pleasing to me as the RAZR, does fit nicely into the hand.  The voice recognition could come in handy for hands-free phone use when driving, and each time I have tried it, it has worked flawlessly.By the way, the memory card you need for this phone is a Micro SD card.  If you buy a SanDisk Transflash package, it will come with an adapter that allows you to read it in an regular SD card reader (which is standard on some cameras and desktop computers).  I bought a 256 Mb Transflash package on Amazon from Blue Proton for $9.48 including shipping.As for negatives, the Motorola software is still not up to par, and you will need to refer to the manual to figure out how to do some tasks that should be obvious.  My pet peeve is that the Recent Calls screen will only list a number once, so if you missed three calls from the same person, the phone will only show the last, most recent call.  Apparently the folks at Motorola don't care if someone has been trying to reach us urgently but didn't leave a vmail every time.  I also haven't figured out how to copy the phone book from the SIM card to the phone memory all at once, rather than one number at a time -- what is Motorola thinking?
The KRZR is easier to hold because of its slimmer design. Plus, the features are better in every way but there is something to beware of. I purchased mine from Amazon as an unlocked phone about three month ago, and when I called about repairs for a small part on the back last week, I found out my phone was manufactured for sale in the United Arab Emirates and that phones headed for that country (or possibly others, I don't know) are "not" covered by Motorola's warranty in the U.S. And when I asked who I should call, presumably in the United Arab Emirates, I was told they didn't have a phone number to give me. Needless to say I was a little surprised to find out that one, I don't have a useful warranty, and two, Motorola couldn't provide a phone number for a different part of its operation. Very strange, especially since Motorola's website says "if it says Motorola on it, we can help." Well, apparently, that isn't true. So buyer beware. And by the way, the part that broke was the little loop that holds the lanyard. It isn't made of metal like the one on the RAZR. I had the back replaced by a local repairman for $30. Other than that, I love my phone!
this phone is awesome. all it took was some browser and MMS setup and it was all good. bluetooth is great. it comes with a digital music player program that is cool. all you need to buy is a mini-usb to 3.5 mm adapter(which you can get on amazon, New OEM Motorola Headset Adapter (Emu to 3.5mm) SYN1504) and you can plug any set of headphones and use the phone as a decent mp3 player. it can hold up to 2 gigs of songs/videos/pictures.(with expandable memory card.) overall, i love this phone. packed with so many cool things in a small package.
the product itself is great. just as described. however, i searched under sprint and this product was advertised as compatible, but when brought into a sprint store was told it wasn't any good. now i am stuck with the phone that can't be used.......
The quartz part of the phone gives it a look of modernism and elegance, but is so fragile for a cell phone, I just dropped down once, and it just blowed away in a million pieces.
The phone did not get good signal and it did not ring most of the time.  I might purchase the phone again, but NEVER will I use this company again, MobileCityOnline. I would not suggest them to anyone. They have very very poor customer service!!
It's hard to express how I love this stuff.I've used it for months and keep loving it more and more.Hope more people will love it!
This is a great little, compact phone with lots of nice features (blue tooth capability, voice activated commands, internet browsing, music and video, great camera, etc), good battery life, and excellent quality hardware. I first purchased one for my husband and enjoyed using it. Then I purchased one for myself too.
Beautiful, stylish, sleek phone. It's mis-marketed as a high-end phone, however.The camera is wonderful and the 2 music players superb. It's an American media phone. That is, heavy on the music & games, but not so great on the Internet. Motorola should've placed an operating system on this puppy. Nevertheless, the memory card is priceless.American carriers have found that Americans are willing to pay $20-30 MORE per month for a PDA so they needn't offer smartphones anymore. So, all of the so-called 'high-end,' non PDA phones are only high-end in the media department. The thing is, T-Mobile offers unlimited web browsing for a flat fee which makes smartphones a better buy than PDAs.High-end phones are media-rich and net-rich. This phone is only the former and, at that, has no FM radio.  This is one of T-Mobile high-end offers, but isn't quite high-end.Anyone who wants a phone which is high-end in the media and Internet fields, but doesn't want to pay $20 extra for a QWERTY keyboard should stick w/ T-Mobile and purchase an unlocked smartphone from AMAZON. It won't come w/ an American service plan because Americans are forced to pay the extra monthly fee for PDAs, but you can do everything a PDA-er can, sans the keyboard. In fact, the Nokia N80 does tons more than ANY PDA on the market right now.... but it's 360 bones.This is a great phone for teens... stylish folks who want good reception and media. If you want this plus slammin' web and MS Office offerings, I'd opt for buying a smartphone. PDAs are a rip-off.
it has a very short charge time which is great. the battery last very long with the bluetooth ear piece.its great stuff.
Buy this phone - its a must for all women. This is a fashion accessory which works and works well!!  It looks fabulous,is sleak, small, fits into womens hands easily and I can use the mirror front to put on my lipstick too!!The menu is great, easy to use (I hate reading instructions) and the rubberised back means it doesnt slip off your table or out of your hand.A fabulous success and have 3 friends who are all buying one too....
Voice coammnd does not work for me at all. There is no option to train to my voice either.
I received my unlocked razr v3 here in Baghdad and right out of the box it was great. I am not pleased at all with the hands free. The volume from the ear piece is not the quality I have come to expect from original accessories. The sound of the mic according to my wife is distant. Again not the quality of an original in my opinion. I have browsed the inside of the phone. I am a long time motorolla user so it was very familiar. I have a plantronics bluetooth in the US and when I get home I will try it with the phone.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Baghdad!
I got the phone within a couple of days after ordering.The phone was in excellent condition as advertised.
This unlocked cell phone can be used with a GSM network service provider and it provides tri-band connectivity (900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz).For best results with domestic Cingular / AT&T; service, select a phone that uses the GSM 850 frequency. For best results with domestic T-Mobile service, select a phone that uses the GSM 1900 frequency.Works fine on Cingular for now in many regions, but won't work in say VT where the Cingular network is entirely 850.  Cingular is apparently moving GSM off 1900 to 850 so coverage will become more patchy over time.The K800i is a 3G data-enabled device, compatible with third-generation mobile networks that offer broadband-like transfer speeds--up to 384 kbps--providing quick and easy access to audio and video streaming, Web surfing, multimedia messaging, and email wherever you go. - Note - this functionality will only work on european/ROW networks, not Cingular as the frequency is wrong.
Trying to find great CAMERA PHONE that's unbreakable:) but LIGHT and TINYTHIS PHONE COMES w/ additional unexpected features: MP3, VIDEO recorder:) NICE...YEAH, Nokia is always the BEST.
This phone is probably the worst I have ever owned. I cannot wait to get a new one, because this one is so bad. First of all. There is no screen on the front which is just annoying because you can't see who is calling you or what time it is until you flip the thing open. I get horrible reception everywhere I go, and zero reception in a lot of places. The phone I had before was fine in those same areas. There is no predictive text for text messaging which makes sending a short message a tedious chore. The back cover falls off everyday. Over all it looks nice, but when you get down to it, its just not practical considering all the other phones out there. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
Overall a decent cheap phone, however there are a few things that bother me.1) No external screen to see incoming caller ID and no external time display2) FM reciever is cool but it requires the headset to be plugged in to get reception so even if you want it on speaker the head set nedds to be available.3) The feel of the buttons are very numb, tough to tell if a button was actually pressed or not, not a big deal for dialing but in games it kinda sucks.4)Over all the phone has the awkward feel of the first in the RAZR series and really I don't like that, it's thin sure..but they make up for it in making the just a little too wide for my tastes.5) Reception is ok.... so far it is getting the same reception range my old v220 did with a cracked antenna. Not impressive for a phone that is a much newer release.Again these are just the things I was disappointed with and if these things don't bother you then I am sure it will make a good phone for you. But for me I was a little disappointed. It met my expectations but it certainly did not exceed them in any area.
Everyone complains about locked phones and poor selection from the major US cell providers. Well, after a long search, I found an answer in this phone the Samsung D900.  This is an unlocked GSM/world phone, and will work out of the box on any GSM network woldwide(in USA: T-Mobile and AT&T;/Cingular).Have had it for over a year now, and am quite pleased with its impressive array of features, which include a great 3mp camera (with Camcorder- unlike iPhone) and mp3 player and terrific polyphonic sound.It also allows mp3s to be played as ringtones, (although you will need to crop them down using various software) which means no more purchasing the same song twice- once for your musing device, and then again for the phone).It is a slider design, which I have grown to really like, over clamshells. The sliding mechanism opens and retracts smooth as silk, as only Samsung can seem to do. Reliability has been great, as I dropped it on the street once, and it didn't even get a scratch.The one drawback I found is I can't get it to save my sent text messages. Also, could use an fm radio, which I believe is in the works. Also, this is not a heavy email/internet type device, but is loaded with features in an exceptionallly small package.Even after a year, i think this phone is still at the cutting edge.
Great Phone, and you also can download lots and lots of useful software to your handheld/phone/game console/internet machine
I love this PDA....I just got it on Sunday!  It is very user freindly and I am not big on instructions LOL.  I took my time reading the manual and I was able to figure out the Ming without getting frustrated.  The only thing that I haven't learned to do is get picture text, being that it is a phone not quite like our technology here in the USA, I have to call Motorola and see if they can configure it do this feature.  My cell phone company couldn't get it after spending an hour on the phone.  The phone takes great pix clear and crisp, you can also take a picture of a  business card, you never have to type all that info again, and it is a flip.  No more accidentally pressing buttons while the phone is in a back or your pocket that might drain your battery.  The ringers are also loud enough for you to hear you phone if you are in another room, in your purse or work bag.
I received the product on time, and it is working fine. That is a great cell phone, a lot of functionalities. I recommended it for all.
I got this phone for mothers day is best present ever love the phone easy to use and the best part you could record a conversation and send it in a mesege too i got a lot of compliments whith this phone loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiit
Wow!  This is a BEAUTIFUL phone, kicks butt of flip version of Shine from Verizon.  Slider is sweet, phone feels solid.  AND boy DOES it SHINE!!.... in virtually most lighting.  Roll bar select key is a bit tricky at first but soon becomes very natural, AND you look so cool because of it!  Has basic goodies, SIM card very accessible and compatible, battery life better than average.  Standard MP3 player.  Has microSD expansion slot for up to 2GB.  Slight problems with reception outside of major metropolitan areas and some dead spots in small cities due to tri-band but overall pretty good (I use AT&T;/Cingular).  Tons of cool ringtones and sound effects.  Mirrored effect slightly difficult to read in strong sunlight.  USB connection to desktop worked effortlessly like direct plug flash drive.  Camera quite decent although some delay in trigger.  Has flash but only on/off - no auto.  2 megapixel photos are better than most.  Hottest slider around, no doubt.  I use this as my cool factor phone.  Highly recommend it!  Please check out tri-band reception in your area first to avoid disappointment.
This is probably the first device that excited me before I even unboxed it since I got my iBook a couple years ago.  I give credit to LG for taking the time and investing the money in exciting packaging.  I mean, you're dropping $300.  That's not chump change for most of us.  Give us some bang for our buck, and LG does that.  Props for that.The phone itself is stunning to look at and its surprising heft is a nice change from all the pennyweight ultra slim phones out there.  You'd do some damage if you chucked this phone at someone.You may want to throw it when you realize that it's packaged with an AC adaptor which is most definitely not of US origin.  I don't know if that thing came from Korea or Germany or what but it looked like a stun gun to me.  Fortunately a nearby store had a cheap compatible adaptor.Setting up the phone has been a little tedious but I can get online after a day and I can make calls and send/receive SMS/MMS messages.  I think it's lack of the 850 band makes it a bit of a risk in some areas but I think I can manage missing the occasional call. I'm not owned by my phone.The LG Shine is a good call if you want a cool phone that isn't like every other phone out there and you don't mind monkeying around with WAP and MMS settings.
The shine is a very good phone, definitely looks great, sound is clear as well as reception. Music player is decent and camera takes pretty good pics (for a phone). It would be a 5-star without discussion IF it had voice dialing... Amazon review is wrong when states it has a speaker independent voice dialing, it doesn't have one at all. It's a shame a high end product lacks such a basic feature you can find in almost any mid priced nokia or motorola
I have had all the top phone from Japan, and was getting sick of my little razr, so bought this little gem after reading all the reviews, it made very well, strong build, the screen is bright and clear love the menu scroll buttons, I think I have found the perfect phone, no fingerprints on the mirror screen, amazing... about the same size as my razr, but a bit heavier...Loving it check out my photos
I cannot recall a phone that looks better in person than in photos.  The LG Shine is alone in this category.  I was at awe with it's elegant lines when I saw it online but it looks even better in person.It's full metal body gives it a sturdy few, I have used many "hot" phones in the US but they just don't compare.  Razr, iphone, blackberry...  This phone outshines them all.I bought this to replace my bulky sidekick... while waiting for the KS20... I am very pleased with my choice.
I love this phone..... It is completely everything i need in a phone andother than the price the phone is the perfect pick for an upgrade. This phone causes everyone i know to turn and look because everyone is so shocked to see such a cool phne for some reason it isnt even out with any phone line yet so thats really cool cause its rare and u can be different an the only one with such a sick phone.
Provided that you're not into PDAs and if you can do without an FM Radio, Sony Ericsson W880i is more than enough meet your savvy. Its stylish design and seemingly incomparable range of features all in a compact phone, would please any gadget fan, music afficionado or even fashionista. This phone is all that and a whole lot more.Packed with the Walkman 2.0 software and a 1 Gig Memory Stick Micro M2, you can just imagine the amount of music you can store with this phone. The firmware supports up to an 8 Gig expansion should the M2 be available in that capacity already in the future. This phone also supports A2DP Bluetooth Stereo headset profile which means this is completely compatible with any device like the Sony Ericsson A2DP Bluetooth Stereo receiver (MBR-100) or the Sony DR-BT30Q Bluetooth Stereo headset which I prefer to use with it.Other than that just like it's predecessors, it comes with 2.0 Megapixel camera. This should be sufficient for day to day use although should you opt for a camera phone with a higher resolution, this phone is not for you.The screen resolution is a compact version of the W900 series so the display is really crisp and clear. The screen resolution is higher than the W800i or even the W810i.Only setback might be for people with big hands. The keypad would not be appropriate for them. This phone would be very difficult for them to use.Lastly, this phone comes with 3G and a VGA camera for video calls. The last feature not only seals the sweet deal, but you would never find another phone out there in such a compact state with all these features which can literally fit in your left shirt pocket.
Having spent some time in-store playing with this device, and doing a fair amount of web research, I cannot say that I am an expert on this phone, however I can tell you that it is a handy little device.That being said, for a great deal less, you can get the w810i, which is thicker, and not made of the sexy metal frame, but includes a built in flash/flashlight, and EVERY other function that this phone contains. Unless you have the cash to drop, and want a phone thats just a wee bit sexier, I would suggest the w810i instead.
I have only had Nokia phones prior to this phone but decided to branch my wings out after my Nokia fell in a puddle. Purchased the phone off of ebay and it was easy enough to set up and use with TMobile....Pros:Sleak styleclear and colorful screenloud speaker phoneGood cameraIn car optionBluetooth capableSizeCons:Battery Life is horrible, lasts only a day.Screen is smallmenus are slighly confussingno screen saver with clock only functionscreen blacks out really quickly to save already bad battery lifetexting with one hand difficult because phone is so skinnyweird predictive texting that is not as user friendly as NokiaDropped callsPoor antennacant hold with shoulder and talk... muffeled voicehorrible manualOverall, I think I am a nokia person. I like the look of the phone and the size is sweet and I like the ringtones and clearity of phone, but I was so disappointed with the batttery life and reception. My old nokia's battery would last for three days and could find a signal anywhere. Maybe its just because I'm not used to Motorola's but overall I'm underwhelmed.
only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easily
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR XMAS. AND IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED.I ALSO WAS VERY PLEASE WITH IT.
After loosing the phone (samsung 807) which came with my cingular contract, I was on hunt for a cheap, nice phone with not many internet features. Because the guy who stole my phone made huge bill using internet.After searching for a while I fixed on w200i. And after using it for a week, I am very much satisfied. The good points are1) Walkman player on the phone is very good. Sound quality is very good with the included earbuds. Also the included 128MB memory stick is sufficient for ~20 songs which is nice, but I want to upgrade it to 2GB stick.2) FM radio is good3) Voice dialing. I like the implementation of voice dialing on this phone better compared to samsung D807.On D807, there is no user control on how a contact is to be pronounced. Based on stored conact's name, the phone assumes a pronounciation. Since names are not standard english words, this always leads to wrong assumptions.Also being from India, my accent is different from American accent. And for me,it never worked on D807 satisfactorily.On w200i, you can record a sound and associate it with a contact. Whenever you pronounce the sound, the associated contact is called. This way I can use the correct sound for the name and also I can use nicknames. This is much better and for me more natural.4) Sound volume is good & clear. Unlike D807, I don't have to press the phone to my ears.5) Light weight and looks cool6) Limited internet features. This phone comes with no net browsing facility and limited data features. This way I don't end up with extra bill for using internet, after inadvertently pressing some button (many phones I saw have the important buttons associated with internet). This is good for those like me, who don't have/want data plans.Average w.r.t.1) Battery life2) camera qualityBad1) The hands free cable implementation is a mess. It can be designed better I feel. The clip should be above the heavy handsfree button. Also for me, the left earbud cable is a bit short
This phone is a nerfed version of the E61.  The phone being unlocked may possibly get around the java restriction imposed on the locked Cingular version, but the processor is very slow (slow menu transition and limited 3rd party app use), the Wi-Fi has been removed from this version, and it's not a 3G phone.  Shop around, you can find a much better phone for around the same price.
i didn't pay attention that the cellphone doesn't have or equipt with a camera so that is why i din't or i canciled the purchase otherwise every thig with this is excellent
This is the first truly tiny and iconic mp3 phone I have seen and used. Despite being alarmed at the size of the keys, I find it easy to use, and gratifyingly small.I'll attempt to be brief. For the previous 5 years ago, I have had touch screen 3G Motorola smart phones (A920, A925 and A1000), and before that, Nokias and a Palm Pilot.No longer needing full PDA functionality, I wanted something small (for a change) with strong battery life, which would provide very good music player functionally. I also wanted: speakerphone, good quality headset, plus a tri-band or quand-band for usability overseas. I already have a good digital camera, and didn't want to carry around a phone thicker than my wallet. That meant the Nokia N95 was out of the running, despite the lure of GPS.The good* Walkman can be controlled when keypad locked, but not accidentally.* Great battery life and ultra fast charging!* Menus are easy to navigate and comprehensive.* Clean crisp screen and versatile camera features* Doesn't crash (can you tell I've had a few Motorolas?)* Handles 3.5 mm headphones* The noise reducing in-ear headphones with great soundThe bad* Minimal amount of text it will hold in contacts, notes and calendar entries - its not quite a PDA in that way* Working out how play lists work was a hassle* Minimal instruction manuals in the boxSurprises* How much I use the Blog functionality - I take a photo, type up the text and upload it to my site - very convenient diarising or blogging when on the run* The ability to auto-stitch photos into a landscape shot* The music syncing software allows you to specific (ie downgrade) the bitrate of songs being transferred so as to save space* It copes with a 2GB M2 card  despite  saying it is only upgradeable to 1 GB* Its feel very solid.VerdictElegant, small and highly functional - I was surprised as how much easier and better phones can get in just every few years. Worth the change. The in ear noise cancelling headphones have brought my mobile listening experience to a new level.
my girlfriend has this phone, and as a result, i've dealt with its beauty, its sleekness, and also its inability to provide adequate voice volume.  no, it's not my phone.  I use a cingular 3125 and the call volumes on that thing are so loud sometimes i have to hold the phone away from my ear.  connecting with the w880i, i have to really listen closely and pay really close attention to whoever is talking into the w880i.  sometimes the receive sensitivity on the w880i is so crappy that it doesn't even register some words making me think it's cutting out, but it's not a signal problem.  might just be her phone or maybe it's too small and the mic is too far away from the mouth to adequately pick up/transmit a loud enough voice.  all i know is, it's quite annoying to have to talk to someone using a w880i as its main function doesn't work too well.
If you want a whiz-bang phone loaded with LOTS of features that can be run over by a truck and still work, then go spend $100. I only spent $20 and really like this phone a lot. It has everything I need, which admitedly isn't much. I wanted a small phone with a color display, a speakerphone and a battery that lasted longer than just a few hours. It's perfectly good for my light-use situation, only needs to be recharged every 3-4 days and it looks like it's from this decade, compared to my previous phone. I've had it for about 2 months and love it!
I was holding off on writing this review because I wanted to see how this, my very first cell phone behaved battery wise, after reading the neg. reviews here. Yep, the other reviewers are absolutely right. I turned on the powersaver as recommended, but they're right, my battery died out in less than 24 hours; 15 to be exact. Not that charging each night would be a problem, but come on, if you forget, this could be a real handicap and charging isn't always possible. I do like the company's customer service and the fact that the cus. ser. lady didn't try to strong arm me into buying anything. Being that I have never had a cell phone before, I was clueless as to how to set this up, but I found the cus. ser. pretty good. I don't know how long I will use this phone exclusively, as I bought it just for emergencies, but given the terribly short battery life, I may just get the Cyclops instead. Other than the batterly angle, this seems like a pretty cool little phone.
I liked Virgin Mobile's flexibility and lack of contracts, so I became a customer. It all went pretty well until I had a problem. I bought the Marbl only a few days after it became available, so unfortunately I didn't have the benefit of reading Amazon reviews. Otherwise, I would never have bought this piece of garbage. After only four months, my Marbl phone died. I tried Customer Service (an oxymoron) at VM. I explained to them -several people, of course, to whom I had to repeat the same information over and over again, including my phone number--the problem, and that I needed my phone repaired, not just replaced, because there are a bunch of phone numbers stuck in it. No one understood, no one cared.First I was told I had a warranty. Then I was told I didn't. I had to fight customer service person 3 to admit that yes, I had a warranty, so I didn't have to buy a new phone. I could get it for free, I was told as if they were doing me a great favor. "But I don't want a new phone," I said (again). "I want my phone -with my phone numbers--working." Customer disservice person 4 or 5 got my information to send me a new phone--with the threat that I need to send my old phone back; otherwise they will charge me for the new one. "Why?", I asked. "Are you going to fix it? Can you get my numbers back?" Of course not. Steven (AKA Moron 5)  couldn't tell me exactly why they need it back --other than repeating over and over that the phone is not working, as if this were news to me. Virgin Mobile has just lost a customer for good.
I first bought this phone and used it and charged it. The battery life lasted 1 day and then tanked. I didn't use the phone for calls and it was on standby. I had Virgin mobile replace that phone. The second phone I charged and used it. The battery life lasted 5 days on standby. I didn't use the phone for calls. I tried calling virgin mobile to try to replace this phone, but a rude lady got very nasty with me. I stated that the phone was suppose to have standby time of 7 days (BTW, the website says 9 days standby time). She stated that the phone had standby time of 5-7 days. Then I said that the phone battery only lasted 5 days and this was unacceptable. She then stated that she charges her cell phone everyday and that 5 days was acceptable. She then stated that since I didn't use the phone at all 5 days standby time was good. Horrible service. Don't buy this phone, it looks nice, but the battery life is horrible. This phone is garbage.
I just got this at my local Radio Shack store for 30 bucks.  Activating on Virgin Mobile USA's website gave me $2.50 in starter airtime.  BTW the activation page appears to only work IE 6.0; I'd tried IE 7 and other browsers before I realized only IE 6 would work.The phone itself is stylish and very lightweight.  I find the battery life acceptable - but then, I only use this for occasional calls and I don't access the Internet (VirginXL) at all.What I don't like about the phone is it's painfully slow.  Even checking balance (by pressing the "up" key on the navigation pad) takes 30 seconds, vs. 5 seconds or so on my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless-running RAZR.  Sometimes, even pressing the End key to return to the standby screen takes a full second, which is really slow for such an easy operation.This is an inexpensive but useful phone, if you don't mind its being on the slow side.  You can still find it in Radio Shack, Virgin and many other stores, as well as on Virgin Mobile USA's website.
When I called VM on the issue of less than 24hr battery life, I was told to tun off the screen saver.  Why it matters when the phone is always closed, I don't know... but it does help some.  Good luck to those with a Marbl phone.  I was aslo told that the Oystr has the same problem. This was from VM customer support.  Other than that, they didn't offer any solutions.  I also read somewhere in another review that this phone uses more battery when searching for signal even when closed in standby, wasting more battery. So turning it off when not in use is your best bet!
I use a cell phone only occasionly for short calls to confirm where I am or to be asked to be picked up or for permission for something. That's it. Otherwise I use a landline. That's why I chose prepaid. (Also- if I lose it is it a big deal? Nope.) If you're looking for a long-lasting, life-line type phone this one's not for you. Otherwise, everything about it has suited me well. While the battery life isn't the best it works for someone like me (though it would be nicer to have less charges.)Some of the Virgin Mobile phones are definatley better but also more expensive.Oh, and if you're gonna get this phone go to a Target or the Virgin Mobile sight itself. It's cheaper.
I guess I should have read some reviews before purchasing this phone...As others have said, the battery life is terrible. I thought I was getting a good deal at $20 but this is another case of you get what you pay for.
The phone has nice features, of which multiple alarm settings and a decent speakerphone are my favorites.  The battery life will leave you cursing, as this thing will die on you when you least can afford it.
I tried to upgrade my teen's ancient kyocera (so old you have to extend the external antenna!) to the Marbl.  My teen rarely uses his phone, but it gets the job done and "never" needs charging.  I charged the new Marbl and left it unused and closed overnight and in the morning the battery was low and the phone could not be used.  I thought about exchanging the phone until I saw all the CNET reviews complaining about lousy battery life.  I returned the Marbl and will wait till something better comes along.
First off, I love my Virgin Mobile.  I like to have a mobile phone handy, as everybody does.  But, the thing isn't glued to my ear...that's why I went with Virgin prepaid.  I use it a few minutes a day to several minutes a week.  I have phones at home and at work that I can use.  Having said that, this Kyocera Marbl phone was supposed to be an upgrade (for me) and a replacement for the AudioVox 8610 that went bad after nearly 3 years.  The good:  nice features like speakerphone, easy texting, speed- and 1-touch dialing, and voice recognition make this a feature-packed phone for only $30 bucks.  It's very compact and easy-on-the-pocket, with an internal antenna to boot.  The bad:  the battery takes several hours to charge, and can be depleted in only a few calls (with the 8610, battery usually charged in an hour, and would sometimes last several days).  The Marbl has a nice look to it, but it's mostly all plastic, and the color screen doesn't have many pixels.  The buttons are all very small.  My chief complaint, though, is that when I flip it open to talk, when pressing it to the ear the screen goes out...not sure if this is a defect, but it happens every time.  Simply flipping it open a millimeter or two beyond its fully-open position will knock out the screen, whether talking or just looking at the screen!  Is this an energy-saving feature?  I may exchange this phone for another if this proves to be defective.  Or, I may upgrade to the Cyclops camera phone.  I will update this review at a later time....***UPDATED***4/9/07Well, it turns out that the scenario I mentioned above was indeed a defect...it had a defective wiring that caused the screen to go out when fully flipped open.  I was going to exchange it for another Marbl, but instead opted to upgrade to the Kyocera Cyclops!!  My advice....UPGRADE!!
The battery life is as terrible as everyone has said, but the phone in and of itself has nice features and a solid feel in my hand (contrary to what other reviewers have said).I have used this phone for a month now and absolutely LOVE the voice dialing feature.Its a nice little phone - but if you don't have the opportunity or memmory to recharge it every night ... it is NOT for you.
Everything the other reviewers say is true.  The phone is "basic" but it does everything I need it to do (and more).  Unfortunately, the battery life is pathetic.  I thought I had a defective battery, but after reading the other reviews, the dismal battery performance appears to be par for the course.  Guess I'll be looking for another phone.
I love Virgin's pricing and gladly canceled my Cingular/AT&T; account when it was due for renewal.  I opted for the Marbl based on what I thought were complete reviews.  Somehow I missed the many, many complaints about battery life.  It is awful.  The phone will not stay charged for more than 24 hours, even when it's not in use.  Other than that it's a nice, basic phone.  But I can't live with that short a battery life so I'll use up my minutes and toss the phone.  I'll switch to another carrier because I won't be wasting money on a Kyocera phone again.
I had this phone one day and returned it immediately. (I have no comments on battery life because I didn't have it long enough!) You are not even getting what you paid for at $29.99. The phone looks cool in pictures but it is all very basic HDPE-ish plastic. It is unbelivably flimsy. Nothing durable or cool about it as soon as you hold it or pick it up. It's also fairly large, further betraying the appearance.
The one, overriding major problem is the battery life, as pointed out by just everybody who commented.  I called Virgin to get a replacement but they don't just sent you a new battery (which is the smart and cheap thing to do) but instead sent an old? phone and battery (not in box, so I assumed it was used).  The battery is the same one used in the K10 phone but in this phone, it lasted (I timed it 3 times) 16-18 hours on standby only, I made maybe 1 or 2 text messages and no actually phone call.  Yes, that's pathetic.  So, I returned the "new" battery since it was just as bad and instead of having Virgin send me another useless battery again, I just used the one I got.  I charge the phone almost everyday now.  Aside from that, I love the size, the style, the lack of too many extra features (which I don't need).  But I got it for $20, so for that price, I'll give this phone a passing grade or else it would fail with the battery life and useless support from Virgin.
A long-time Motorola phone user now converted. Not only is this phone lightweight and amazing looking, it's feature packed.Pros:- Crystal-clear calling. No static and loud when needed.- The screen is amazing. The resolution is awesome. By far the best I've ever seen on a phone this size.- This phone is tiny; in a good way. Super-slim and tucks nicely in your pocket. Being that it's a slider, you'll never have to worry about pocket-dialing. :)- The software is very easy to navigate. This is nicely improved over the Motorola interface of my older RAZR.- The MP3 player rocks; no pun intended. The Walkman software lets you sort by Artists, Albums, Tracks, Playlists and more. This is light-years ahead of the my old RAZR's MP3 player. This one rivals any standalone MP3 device I've used.- The stereo headphones that comes with it include a 3.5mm adapter. While the included headphones sound great, this adapter gives you the flexibility to use your Bose, Shure or other stereo headphones. A very nice option.- Unlike "some" other sliders, the camera is protected and kept under cover when the slide is closed. This works great in keeping dust off the lens.- The 2.0MP camera is actually pretty good. It takes great outdoor photos.- I LOVE the fitness/step counter. It measures distance in steps and calculated miles along with the calories you've burned. It also keeps a daily average and each days results.Cons:- No 3G- Sony Proprietary Memory Stick Micro M2 versus easy to find and less expensive MicroSD- No LED Flash or Photo LightIn conclusion, if you are looking for a super-slim phone with great call quality and superb music capability, look no further. This Sony wears the Walkman name with pride.Note: I recently bought a SanDisk SDMSM2-4096-A11M 4GB Memory Stick Micro (M2) and it works perfectly. 4GB of music!!!
I have had this phone for a little over a year now. I absolutely love it. The camera has great quality. If only it had a flash. This is a very customizable phone. I probably have over 50 themes on it and even more games. One of my favorite features about this phone is that you can control other bluetooth devices with it. You can use it for presentations or hook up your computer your home theater and use it to control iTunes. There is just one thing that i wish this phone had that it doesn't, and thats EDGE. If your with t-mobile and want to use the internet this isn't the phone for you. Other than that it is a GREAT phone.
I have to admit I have been anticipating this phone ever since it was announced in 2006.  I have to say overall I am very satisfied with this device.  I does have it's faults that will disappoint, but on the other hand it has managed to exceed my expectations in some respects.  First, is stability.  I have owned my share of phones and the headache that comes with hoping the next firmware will fix some glaring usability problems (e.g. crashes that only pulling the battery will fix).  Thankfully, I am pleased to see S60 3rd Edition is better implemented here and I have yet to run into any major application crashes.  This is surprising given how complex this device is and Nokia's recent past with releasing devices initially plagued with bugs (e.g. N80 & N93).  The OS responds pretty well when opening menus and applications.  It is not instantaneous most of the time, but is quite fast and significantly better than on other phones that I had the displeasure to deal with.  There are some problems.  I wish this phone had more memory.  If you end up browsing several complex web pages, you will eventually run into the dreaded memory low situation.  That is the problem, the browser is so good at rendering pages as it should that you will get irritated you have to close and reopen the browser to clear out the history of the last several pages you visited which are taking up whatever available memory exists (somewhere like 20 out of 64 MB).  Nokia should have went with 128 MB since the browser, multimedia functions, and multitasking capabilities can never have too much memory.  Still, it is all still very usable it is just annoying Nokia made a poor decision with such a high end phone.  Speaking of the browser, as I mentioned it is amazing.  I do wish the screen was slightly higher than 320x240 resolution as Nokia has previous generation phones with smaller screens at a higher resolution.  It would simply make browsing even better as you wouldn't have to scale it down or scroll all over the screen as much to take in the entire page.  The screen is, however, quite large and it simply looks perfect.  Colors are beautifully rendered and picture/video viewing looks excellent on it.Multimedia, as expected, is incredible.  Sound quality is good, maybe not as good as my old Sony Ericcson K750, but still good nonetheless.  Thank goodness Nokia provided a 3.5 mm jack for standard headphones, it is about time.  The N95 will have no problem replacing a flash based MP3 player.  Multimedia keys work well, but I am not sure how useful they are since the 4-way pad also provides similar functionality.  The radio works well enough and manages to pick up a lot of stations in my area, but unfortunately it mostly defaults to mono while occasionally shifting into stereo.  The camera is really good.  Bright outdoor shots look, sometimes, just as good as any consumer camera.  Like every other camera phone, indoor shots with low light will come out noisy and dark.  That is to be expected.  The LED flash will help provided whatever it is you are taking is not too far away.  Make sure to update the firmware immediately as it fixes an annoying shutter lag problem.  Pictures though sometimes come out too processed to hide noise.  With the 5 MP sensor, I suppose noise is inevitable but I hope Nokia improves their processing algorithm in future updates.  Overall, you cannot expect the N95 to replace your dedicated camera but with some practice you can get some very good results.  Video recording is excellent.  It is NOT DVD quality and you will clearly see lots of compression artifacts on your computer monitor.  It is however the best on a phone and probably by a long shot.  So much so, that video recording finally becomes useful when you spontaneously need to record an event.  The camera soft is very good.  All of necessary settings are here, though not all stick when you close the camera application.  It takes some time to set up for the next shot, but you can turn off viewing the shot you just took so you can take the next shot quicker.  The phone supports TV out.  I haven't had the time to explore the possibilities, but it does appear useful for showing slide shows and video playback to your friends.  I haven't found it terribly useful for much else, but YMMV on this.I was a little disappointed by the storage provided by the MicroSD format.  Nokia provides a 1 GB card in the box and states the phone phones supports up to 2 GB.  It has been confirmed though that the newly released 4 GB SanDisk microSDHC will work in this device.  This, IMHO, is an acceptable amount of storage for this device and will be needed given the multimedia possibilities of this phone (e.g. MP3s, video recording).The GPS is very slow to lock onto satellites when first turned on.  I wish the software also provided better feedback on what is going on as well.  However, a GPS packed into such a device is pretty amazing and as long as you are patient, it does work pretty well.  I personally don't have a lot of use for a GPS therefore this unit works well enough for when I need it.  I am still getting the hang of it.  It will not, however, replace a dedicated GPS unit that is used on daily basis.Construction of the unit is fine.  Some complain it feels cheap for such an expensive phone, but I just don't see it as a problem.  The slider functionality works well enough and the keyboard feels good to me.  It is very tactile though so if you like soft keypads it may not appeal to you.  I wish the keys were a little bigger, but I always say that about every phone.  They will be large enough for most.  Everyone I have shown is impressed by the appearance of the N95.  I will admit I considered a qwerty smartphone, but I needed something to fit in my pocket.  It amazes me Nokia was able to fit all of the N95's features in such a small form factor.  There are much thinner and lighter phones out there, but none will have a fraction of the features of the N95.I won't beat the battery issue to death as it has been widely reported on this device.  If you just use this as a phone with texting, e-mail, some web browsing and even MP3 playback, it is quite good.  What is the point of getting this phone though if that is all you are going to do with it?  If you start using WiFi, bluetooth, GPS, and particularly the camera/video recording the battery drains pretty fast.  I suppose given the current technology and the small battery size, there is no way around this.  Don't believe it is not manageable though because it is.  If you plan on using the maximum capablilities of this phone all of the time on the go, I would suggest a car charger and possibly an extra battery so you don't get caught with a dead phone.  I charge mine every night when I go to bed, but then again I have always been in the habit of doing that with my phones.I am quite pleased and despite some concern over my purchase, I feel as if I am going to hold onto this for a long time.  It is too bad Nokia priced the unit so high and it will be up to individual if it is really worth it, but right now the N95 is probably the best implemented and featured multimedia phone available.
My take on some of the features:Camera - It takes two seconds to load up, two seconds to focus, and two seconds to see the photos on the screen after a shot is taken, which hardly qualifies for a point-and-shoot.  Overall picture quality is dependant on the environment where the photo is taken.  If the surrounding is well-lit, photos look impressive.  But, in a relatively dark environment, photos look pretty awful.Media Playback - I played mp3 tunes and quality was pretty good.  Obviously it doesn't sound as good as dedicated mp3 players like my iPod, but I think the quality is more than acceptable.  But, I noticed that there was some noise in the background.  This is especially noticeable when I was listening to my music in a quiet environment.  Video playback is pretty decent too and the screen size was large enough to allow me to watch my recorded tv show comfortably.Battery - I know a lot of people moan about N95's short battery life.  But, I thought it was pretty decent considering all the features this phone offers.  The first day I got this phone, I listened to music for about half an hour while commuting, browsed Google map to get directions, check news online for about half an hour, took about twenty photo shots, talked on the phone for about half an hour, and I still had several bars of the battery left.  As long as you don't overuse WiFi or GPS, you should be fine with everyday charges.GPS - This is my least favorite feature in the phone.  It is simply too slow to lock down the location.  I find myself using Google map (for mobile) more often than this feature.Design - It is passable, but certainly does not look like a $700 cell phone (since it won't attract others, is this a good thing?)  One thing that bothers me the most is the front slider.  It is wobbly, so whenever I press a button it makes that 'click' sound.  You do get used to it after a couple of days, and there is a DIY way of fixing this (available on the internet), but I don't think I want to open up my phone and risk breaking my $700 investment!Conclusion - I was a bit hesitant at first because of the price and the well-known drawbacks discussed above.  But if you're a semi - power user like me and wouldn't mind the features being just above average rather than fantastic, you will not regret the purchase.iPhone or N95? - I pondered waiting for the iPhone, but ultimately decided against because 1) I don't like the idea of using touch screen to make phone calls.  These are first and foremost cell phones, so the convenience of making phone calls matters the most to me. 2) iPhone does not have 5mp camera. 3) I do not want to make a two year commitment to AT&T; (I like my month-to-month contract with T-Mobile, thank you) and who knows how much it will be if unsubsidized?  Also, I don't know when it will be actually available unlocked.  4) I love Apple's simplicity and elegance, but I needed flexibility (of a Symbian based smartphone) and functionality.Alternatives? - I also considered getting Sony Ericsson's upcoming W960, but I coulnd't wait that long!
I have to admit, Nokia is a client of the company I work for, but I assure you, this review is written from my perspective, and not the company I work for.The N95, in my opinion, is the most amazing phone ever made. iPhone? Doesn't even come close to what this baby can do. With it's built in GPS, 5MP Carl Zeiss digital camera, DVD like video, and the amazingly sleek look, I wouldn't use any other phone.I do have some negatives with it though, so this isn't all roses. I don't like how when I slide it down for the media controls and it switches to landscape that it doesn't switch back to profile when I slide it back. I also don't like that it doesn't work on American 3G (or HSDPA). Over seas, of course, this isn't an issue.Things that I like:-The layout of the front keys is a vast improvement over the N80 and the N73.-The number buttons really stand out and let you feel for what number you mean to push.-The image on the screen is brilliant and beautiful.-The quality of the camera is BREATH TAKING!-It's light and small even compared to the N73.-Everything else about this device.
I've had this phone a few weeks now and I'm not particularly impressed overall.The good:- Reception is good where I currently live;- Functions well as an MP3 player;- Display is nice, but certainly dwarfed by iPhone;- You're not stuck with AT&T;/Cingular;- Great PC interface;- 3.5G is nice (they have it where I currently live);- Overall very functional for day-to-day use.The bad:- GPS is almost completely worthless. You have to be standing still at least 10 ft outside of a building or car to get it to lock on to enough satellites to locate you, and even then, it'll take 2-10 minutes to do so. And if you get in a car and start moving or are walking in a big city (i.e., where you might actually need the GPS), it has a really hard time tracking you;- Battery life is good for 1-2 days depending on use;- It's not a very convenient size;- Camera, though 5mp, takes pretty unimpressive pictures under most lighting conditions;- Enormous price tag.I probably would not buy this phone again, but mostly on account of the GPS functionality. That was the main reason I bought the phone, and the GPS has also been my biggest disappointment. You're better off buying a cheaper phone and buying a separate GPS unit that actually works.
First, let me just say i'm a gadget freak! I've been through A LOT of cell phones. From the motorola startac back in 1995 to my recent N95 (1st batch Asian edition).  I got mine overseas cos it wasn't available here yet at that time. True, the symbian OS sometimes slows down if you have too many applications open, but all u have to do is close them if you're not using them. Just think of it as a computer with only sufficient RAM..  and for the issue that the phone freezes and reboots, you'll find that in the long run it happens less frequently to none. Like a computer your phone is learning how you use it.  My phone doesn't even do it anymore and sometimes i'll have 3-5 applications open at the same time. I'm not gonna tell you what all the features this phone has cos you can just go to the nokia website and they'll have a better presentation for you.  But i will tell you that the all these features packed into one beautiful gadget is better than any phone out there.. specially the iphone!  I'll just give you a few examples..The video quality is the best you will ever see from a cell phone(true DVD quality), once i even saw a reporter in a news video using his N95 to capture the same news event.The mp3 player sound from the speakers is the best i've heard, clear and crisp! i even compared it to my friend's iphone, no contest!Mine is an Asian version, yet the GPS works over here.  I just needed to update the firmware to get faster GPS signal capture.As for pictures, 5mp is more than you'll need unless you're a pro photographer, and like with all other digital cams keep ur hand and subject steady and voila! Great pics!Radio tuner works very well! I use my phone to download and read books from mobipocket so why would you even buy thos big bulky digital readers?I even watch TV on mine when i'm out and about, via internet connection or through GPRS.. well that's cos i have a slingbox media and i downloaded the free media player onto my phone.Buy the bluetooth wireless keyboard and you can work on documents and spreadsheets while texting or having a conversation on your favorite instant messenger.Often people stare with amazement, when i'm having my java at the local coffee shop or at the bookstore, while everyone else is on their laptops i'm typing away on my keyboard and looking at 2"x2.4" screen.  Well i guess i know why they're staring. =) So much more stuff, but i'll leave all that for u to experience yourself. About 3G, mine came with 3G but is useless to me since my carrier is TMOBILE who doesn't work on that netowrk. I can't wait until the US carriers start supporting VIDEO calls cos this phone is PERFECT for that! Oh and here's a tip if you decide to get the phone.. if you're not using 3G change you're network mode settings to GSM instead of dual  for longer battery life(well at least that's what the salesman told me). Ultimately, I personally think that whenever you buy a phone you have to accurately match it with your lifestyle and your needs.  With the N95, I think this phone aims to please almost everybody.  Well except for the apple worshipers. =)note:  To all US carriers..  SUPPORT VIDEO CALLS  NOW!!!
Years ago, I replaced my regular home phone with VoIP but now it looks like I'll be replacing my home VoIP phone too! This Nokia N95 *is* my VoIP phone when I'm home! AND... I can take it with me everywhere I go.You can be anywhere in the World and as long as you have a WiFi connection, your phone numbers will be active for incoming and outgoing VoIP calls. I say "phone numbers" because with VoIP you can have multiple international numbers ring on the same phone. i.e. I have a Miami number, a London UK number and a Caribbean phone number all ring on the same Nokia N95 phone. How? You need a good VoIP provider that offers multiple numbers on the same account (called DID's).Throw all your other phones away!!! Seriously - but give yourself a couple of weeks first to get acquainted with this phone. It's different from handling a Blackberry... both physically and operationally. It took me a couple of weeks to get used to it - in fact, it was a week before I took it for a walk outside the house :) It's just a few ounces in weight and it feels very delicate - like it might break or drop. But that's only because I was used to handling a Blackberry which is much bulkier and heavier.VoIP guys - Bear in mind that you MUST install a SIM chip to get the phone working properly - without the SIM chip, the phone goes into "off line" mode and it basically impossible to get it to do anything. i.e. you can't get the VoIP working if the SIM chip isn't installed.Of course, there's so many other features like GPS, Camera, etc... there's a pretty steep learning curve but it's definitely worthwhile!Give yourself enough time and you'll fall in love with this phone!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
I'm the Chief Engineer for a major San Francisco Bay Area radio station and when my old phone died, I went over to the AT&T; store to get a replacement. I wanted one that would do audio streaming, wifi and played mp3's, AAC+, AAC files and, well just about everything. It also HAD to have a STANDARD headset jack so that I could use it with the headset of my choosing. I didn't want any goofy adapters or delicate plastic parts that would break off and leave me without service. AT&T; didn't have anything like this. They also wouldn't sell me an unlocked phone that I need when traveling internationally. I did some research and found the Nokia n95. While expensive, I decided to get one and hope that it didn't suck. It's possibly the most satisfying technology purchase I've made in a decade.It has the cleanest audio of any portable device I've found, including the IPOD and other mp3 players that I own. I found other features that I didn't think would be useful, like the GPS and even VOIP support. I get real time traffic and navigation from google maps and the included GPS enabled map prgram has proven very useful. The 5 megapixel with Carl Zeiss lenses takes great pictures and the smaller videoconferencing camera is useful too. It even has a high quality FM radio! The included software package installed painlessly and even made it simple to 'flash' the phone firmware to the latest revision,and sync up with my PC. No problems, frustrations or surprises. It's GSM and EDGE (data) here in the USA (AT&T; and T-mobile) and 3g worldwide (where available). Bluetooth, USB, IRDA and WIFI connectivity.Nice job Nokia! The feature set and hardware beat the Iphone in every area except possibly user interface, and I'm not at all unhappy with the UI. I'm amazed and recommend it to you now.
I have to say spending so much money on a phone made me nervous, but I have to say having an unlocked GSM phone was great.  I was traveling outside the country and my provider uses CDMA, so I needed a way to stay in touch with family and friends in case of emergency.  I picked up this phone and the MOBAL sim card deal that Amazon has, and I am very pleased with the combo.  I also have the slingbox and when I bought the phone they just released a mobile player for it for the symbian OS.  The phone worked like a champ.The good things are having this phone, I had a way to take photos without having to carry another camera with me when I just wanted to walk on the beach.  The only bad thing about the phone and the reason I gave a 4 out of 5 stars is that the battery is weak.  It only lasts about 2 days without the need of a recharge.  Other than that, it is an amazing phone.
Just impressive. This phone will provide everything you need and more. I've been using it to record my golf practice and the video quality is excelent!! Used the camera on night events and the flash will a good job..calendar, alarm settings, Office documents, movie device and music jukebox...just have in mind that if you use a heavily your multimedia options(video specially) the battery will only last for a day if not it will last for 2 days...wich was pretty much the same as my old Nokia e50.Yeah...the iPhone surely looks nice, but you don't have all the stuff that comes with this one. It's a must for every user thats wants to have it all in one device.
I bought the product mainly for the internal GPS. At first it worked, a little slow but worked fine. Then after a couple of weeks the voice guide was gone and the worse thing is that it is a service that costs you extra (almost 150 $ for a 3 year license). I mean, I already paid almost 600$ for the phone, why should I pay more for the use of the GPS with voice guidance. There are also somethings I didn't like about the phone and that is that it slides open easily inside my pocket and the screen gets very greasy and oily and its very hard to clean. I have had other nokia phones before (N70, N72, etc) but this one didn't really fulfilled my expectations. Although it is a great phone with lots of features, I was a bit disappointed with the fact that the GPS is not completely free(again just the voice guide). I read a lot of bad things about the battery, but as long as you don't have all the features such as Wi-Fi, bluetooth and GPS ON, the battery should make it for a day or 2. It also charges pretty fast.
the title says it all. this phone is equiped with basically everything that u can put in a phone today. the camera, the endless ways of connection, the navigation system, the display, the interface, the speed of the operating system (Symbian s60)..... everything is just fantastic.I would strongly reccomend this phone to anyone who is per say having doubts between this phone and lets say sonyerricson p880i or any similar phone. i personally was never a big fan of nokia phones but this one really amazed me!!!!  2 thumbs up!!!
I bought this phone a month back. I am highly satisfied with phone. Its GPS works great. Camera and camcorder mode are good in good light. TV connectivity is something which i also like.
This is the best phone I ever had. I use to use windows mobile phones, but Symbian is better.
I bought this phone for my husband about 2 months ago and he LOVES it. Its 100X better than the iphone and has just as many, if not more, features. It beats any Smartphone out there.The ONLY downside is that the battery dies extremely quickly, but you can always get a car charger for that. And, one small downside is the walls on the sides of the keypad..they are too high and make texting a wee bit difficult.I would totally recommend this phone and I think it was worth the $600+ i paid for it.
I bought this phone a little while back, to use around the world.  Right now I am in Kuwait, and it works great.  I have excellent service coverage.  I have used it to connect to WI-FI networks, take pictures and send them over 3g networks.  I also have used the GPS.  It works great for all of that.  It has so many uses available, I don't know if I will ever use them all.  The only thing that this phone could use is a different key pad for entering information.
Im really happy with my new cell phone unlock works really good the only thing that dosnt like me its the battery :p.It work perfect, the camera is just amazing, is not as cool as the iphone but its a great choice (y)I recommend this product
i got this phone when it first became available in the us and i couldn't be happier.here is what i use this phone for:1. well, as a phone. this is a really great phone, with great reception and a really good speakerphone.2. internet:email -- i have installed gmail's little mobile client on it, and i check my email obsessively.traffic -- i have bookmarked seattle traffic sites and i check traffic when i am on the gonews, weather, facebook (their mobile or full-blown sites), random googling ("starbucks 98112")3. soundmp3s, audible through the standard audio headset output.another really cool thing is that n95's bluetooth supports stereo sound, so when i am on the go, i listen to my music on my wireless bluetooth headset (motorola's s9, which also doubles as my on-the-call headset), which makes works really great, and especailly on a threadmill.i use the same MicroSD cards with mp3s in my car's stereo, and in my laptop.the stereo speakers are surprizingly loud and good.4. gps: i have a gps in my car, so i don't usually use n95's, but it's great for when i get lost in someone else's car.5. random things: what else. oh yeah. well, the usual stuff -- my outlook schedule is sync'ed up with my phone, as well as my contacts. the sound recorder is great for taking down voice notes (i programmed one of the buttons for quick access, although i wish it was even easier).6. camera: i use the camera a great deal, but i don't think it's that great. i mean, it's better than any other cell phone camera i had, of course, but it hasn't replaced my actual digital camera as i hoped it might, it just isn't as good.i charge the battery every day. which i wish i didn't have to when i travel, but it is fine in everyday life.i guess the buttom life is that it has everything i need, in a way that actually makes sense, and that works, in one package -- one thing to carry, one thing to charge. when iphone came out i contemplated switching, but as slick as iphone's interface is, i just didn't want to give up the gps and stereo bluetooth.i am very happy with my n95!ps oh, and i am using it as a modem for my laptop (i connect thru bluetooth, look ma, no wires!)pps oh, and i dropped it so many times, on all kinds of surfaces (carpet, hardwood floor, pavement, etc;) and it's corners have scratches, but the screen is still like new, and it works really great!!wishlist for what i'd like to see in the upcoming versions of n95:1. n95, slim down a bit. thinner is better.2. can i listen to the radio via my _bluetooth_ headset? (yes, i know i need wired headset for antenna, and i am willing to have it plugged in. i still want to _listen_ via BT, though).3. can the gps be faster to acquire signal on startup? also can i preload maps for where i don't have gprs?4. can you make the battery last 3x longer?5. can you simplify access to voice recorder (one button push and hold?) and recordings -- i use it to capture thoughts, and i want it to be quick and easy.6. can you do sometihng about the camera? more than all the giga-megapixels, i want it to really be as good as my canon sd800 -- picture quality-wise, and ease of use-wise.7. copying mp3s to the phone manually is not as easy as sync'ing ipod with itunes, can you simplify things for n95?man, n95 is pretty sweet.
Ok, here's the deal: The phone, overall, is the best in the cell phone market so far. I had the Sony Ericcson P990i and it was absolutly great, but the N95 really exceeded all my expectations. The interface is really fast, it comes with all the gadgets you need if you are a obsesive compulsive worker who never really gets the office out of mind like me. The camera is so great I put the  digital one I had away and now I take all my pics and videos with the phone. The desing, OMG!!! It is so so sleek, so elegant, your friends and co-workers will turn their heads around with envy, I can assure you that. It's operating system is very friendly and complete, helping and guiding you all the way when you first use the phone. IM has never been so fun and fast and as always. The screen is very bright and large and you can see in the most defiant sun light who's calling. If your hesitating, please dont, go, buy the phone, my final word is: YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!! IS MONEY WELL SPENT!!!
Dont get scared off yet just because of a few other bad reviews.The good1/ big screen, prominent style looking phone along with great reception.2/ best quality mp3 phone just like dedicate mp3 player.3/wifi internet is great , you can get to use free internet wherever u go along with available free wifi spot such as mall and other places.4/ shooting a vdeo clip is very easy along with acceptable quality mpeg 4.The bad1/ camera 5 pixel if you take with factory setting. i agreed not impresive, but take my advice all you need just to reset the setting ad exposer compensation and set on flash. i bet you will say wow. if you are still not satisfied. A little knowledge on computer not a problem u can fix or edit with any program such as photoshop and etc.2/ GPS is almost completely unreliable. i agreed; cant expect much from just a phone , but if you are just walking GPS is not that bad.3/ battery life is okay , if you are both mp3 fan and phone talker i suggest an additional battery ; The price it just a little bit high but hey it all about the brand name.OVERall: it's a great phone and deserve an attention. All in one. phone, mp3 player , camcorder, camera and GPs, you just cant carry it all.Hope this will help you decide according to your need and desire.;.'
Yes, the phone is very expensive but if you're a gadget freak like me, then it's money well spent.  No other phone on the market has a 5 megapixel camera and DVD quality video on it.  Super fast web browsing through available Wireless LAN Networks or MMS...even works with Flash websites.  The only dissapointment is that the GPS tracking to use the maps feature doesn't work with Cingular Wireless yet.  Cingular uses TeleNav to locate your phone via GPS but unfortunately TeleNav doesn't support the Nokia N95 at this time.  A TeleNav representative told me it won't be available for a couple more months.  One of the drawbacks for being the first kid on the block with the coolest phone out there.
I don't know how people can be run out of battery in half a day. My battery lasts for 2 days. It might be because I have a new phone ??. I bought this phone a couple of days ago and so far i like what i bought. it's expensive, that is for sure but it's also handy if you don't want to use many gadgets instead. I haven't explored the phone fully. The battery runs out in 2 days ( which is not what I prefer for a cell phone) and the WLAN is not as strong as a laptop's integrated wireless receiver. Other than these I realy like the phone. My review might not be very trustworthy since I was using a nokia 6310i till now:)) .
Wow! This is the best cell phone I ever had. Much better than iPhone. I love its high resolution and its beautiful design. It is expensive, but it worth it. If you're a gadget freak (like me), buy it... You won't regret!!!
Hola a todos, yo soy dueño del Nokia N95 desde hace unos 2 meses y me parece un telefono muy muy completo, El GPS funciona muy bien despues de bajarse el software de actualizacion del telefono. Solo tengo 2 pequeñas quejas del telefono la primera es que cuando filmo un video no es de tan buena calidad sobre todo cuando hago un acercamiento, y la segunda que a veces su cuelga cuando estoy usando aplicaciones en internet. Pero en general le doy un 4 sobre 5. Gracias.
Buena camara, muy buen telefono, lo malo es que la pila no dura mucho, y que no puedes personalizar cada uno de los tonos para cada contacto.
it have everything i ever wanted in a cell phone, only one complain the battery drains very quickly.
this is the best mobile phone ever made.everything is usefull and there is no another need to takevideo is most perfect part of this productand also symbian software is the fastest evernegative is only : battery...there will be a nokia bl6f battery for nokia n95 8 gb and this new battery will probably be a solution for battery problemand all parts are well madeit is really little and not heavy
It's a nice phone but for the price , Nokia should have done a lot better with this phone . First of all , the housing looks toy-like than the other phones that they actually manufacture for a lot less . The GPS is so basic that it doesn't even come close to the stand alone units that other company makes . If you do want a more refined GPS info , it's going to cost another $132 for the upgrade version for the phone . For this much money , it should have been a perfect or almost perfect next gen. cell phone .
SOY VENDEDOR DE CELULARES EN LATINOAMERICA, Y NO PUEDO ENCONTRAR EN OTROS CELULARES, LA CAPACIDAD, LA FUNCIONALIDAD, LAS CARACTERISTICAS QUE EL NOKIA N95 OFRECE. SU PANTALLA ES MUY BUENA, AUN MEJOR SU CAMARA. ME HUBIERA GUSTADO QUE SEA TOUCHSCREEN. NO LE ENCUENTRO NADA MALO. LO RECOMIENDO AL 100%. SALUDOS A LA COMUNIDAD LATINOAMERICANA!
I had high expectations of this phone because it had so many features and Nokia is renown for it's usability.  But after a few weeks of persistance I am frustrated, dissappointed and am going to sell it.Until now I had a low end Nokia phone and separate ipod, camera, & GPS. My old phone could make calls & txt and the battery lasted over a week. The battery on the N95 does not last very long - especially if you are using WiFi. I find I have to charge it most days. I had to buy an extra charger for work and for the car.I text regularly - but find I've got to do more key presses to initiate a text than I did on my old phone - only a small point but slightly annoying.The GPS is fustrating - it's nice that you can get maps from anywhere in the world - but you do have to remeber to download them via the wifi before you go anywhere because here in NZ the network charges are to high ($10/MB from Vodafone!!!) to use the 3G network. I tried getting it to navigate to a couple of addresses - but it didn't find them. My Garmin Nuvi is so much better and easier to use. I couldn't see myself using this GPS unless I was lost and desperate. I downloaded the sports tracker application - but in the 3 runs I've been on it's never managed to find the satellites. I did get it working when I went on a boat.It's nice having a good camera in your pocket - I know I'm being picky but it's slower than my little Cannon IXUS and I miss the zoom. I also find that the camera shutter often opens in my pocket.The MP3 player is OK. I was eventually able to copy a selection of my music onto the phone. I had trouble making playlists on my PC - but did work out how to make them on the phone. I downloaded a podcasting application (I mainly listen to podcasts on my ipod). I was dissappointed I couldn't download the podcasts to my PC then sync them with the phone like I can with my iPod. This meant I had to download them using the wifi networks at home or work (which chewed through the battery) and I had to manually get them to update - I couldn't get it to automatically update from one of two networks.I tried video calling with my wife once and it didn't work - I don't know why and couldn't be bothered trying to troubleshoot.The browser was OK. I found it useful to access the web remotely in some cases - but it is painful to type in URLs. I couldn't access my web based exchange email - they URL just didn't open - no explanation. I was surprised there wasn't inbuilt support for email through exchange - you could buy something but I never got round to that. It did sync with my address book and contacts on exchange which was great - however I couldn't work out how to change the volume of the alarms that happened to remind me that I had an appointment.The final straw was a memory problem. If I try to open my contacts or send a text message I get an error saying that the memor is full and I need to close some applications - even though I have no applications open. This has made the phone all but unusable. From what I've read on the web it looks like this is a known memory problem that Nokia are working on but I'm not patient enough for them to fix it or to spend any more time trying to find a work around (I've already upgraded the firmware - which didn't work and is more than your average users should have to do).
The product is very good designed but think about the cost? If you did not have any mony const, you may buy one. Its GPS is not so good especially with its pre-installed software. You have to pay Nokia for the most GPS services. Only map is free. Its VOIP is a good opurtinity for free talk.Also visual radio, want to charge you. Be carefull!!If you had money buy a bluethooth keyboard for easy typing. If Nokia makes a mouse driver for surfing, It will be best product :)
I got my N95 3 month a go I have been traveling out of the U.S. and the GPS worked beautifuly, the phone is really wonderful
This is the ultimate show-off gadget, as it has all features anyone could dream of, yet fail to deliver when being turned on.The battery lasts four hours when used on a typical day at the office. Using any of the other features besides calling, sms and calendar drains the battery way too fast.I had to return the phone, as I work longer days than 4 hours - and need a phone who can keep up.
The phone overheated when charging and so I had to return it.  Very disappointing.
I don't understand the life style of the people who excitedly gave 5 stars in a row, but here's one question: "how do you royal slaves are doing to keep that demanding masters from being hungry?". The phone will not leave you unworried about having low battery signal even for half a day! One full day? No, if you are making about 5~6 calls and if want some musics for about 10 minutes, definitely you will have low battery warning right after the lunch. Taking a picture? Wifi internet? you can do them when you are connected to the charger or to your laptop. Maybe, with some luck, you can take 1~2 pictures or at least get loggen on to an internet site before you get the warning. Once again, this is never a mobile phone. This makes you a mobile person because you have to carry every things to feed this annoying master. You will be more organized person because once you tragically get this phone, you have to schedule everything in your life into 10 minutes chops. Don't say you've never been warned.
I bought this phone to replace the Nokia 8801, which was, basically, a pretty phone . . . So ok, yes, I learned my lesson: Never buy a phone because it's pretty! . . . But anyway, I should have learned all I needed to know about Nokia from that experience, but I didn't . . . So I bought this one . . . And it didn't even last a week! . . . Between the crappy, not-very-easy-to-use features, the ridiculous automated-machine voice-dialing and the poor battery life, I was fed up in 2 days . . . But then I made the mistake of leaving the phone in the car on a hot day and the thing just shut down . . . Now yes, I know, cell phones are not meant to be exposed to extreme temperatures but I've left lesser (and better) phones in the car and they survived it . . . And this phone with it's toy-like exterior and light-weight, I felt sure could handle it since it didn't seem to have too many metal parts (which would have contributed to overheating)  . . Needless to say, for a phone that costs so much, I'm amazed at how little you actually get . . . Now the music player is cool and so, I assume, is the camera but really folks, this is supposed to be a cell phone . . . I have my iPod and my digital camera for the rest . . . If Nokia is gonna persist in making crappy phones, they could at least lower the price! . . . As for me, I am officially done with Nokia after this experience.
I've used Nokia phones all my life, except well for the P990i from Sony. There are absolutely NO other phones, that even compare, beleieve me i've dealt with Sony Erricson, Samsing, LG and what not. Nokia are the best. THey're previous Communicators were bigger, and as amaing, I never thought they could beat it. But of course, being nokia, they paved the way.  This phone, is smaller, and thinner than the previous 9500 and 9300i. It is just slightly wider, the chasm used to open it is much stronger, and the keys illumuminated (finally! in the inner keyboard), and the outer keys are amazingly easy to use. The software, the speed, and camera, all amaing. Nokia outdid themselves on this one, this is a much improved phone, working seamlessly, keeping up with every task. The camera, 3.2 MP is a nice addition as is the 2nd VGA camera. Dont be fooled by the review above me, this phone is amazing. I've had it for abt 3 months now, bought it for a very high price. I cudnt be happier...if you do hear bad reviews abt this, its coz most ppl are new to the symbian software. It allows multiple programs to run simultaneously, for e.g. you can surf the net, access the menu turn on the media player listen to music, and at the same time  view a powerpoint of word file. Course, you can switch between these like on a computer, but you need to know how to. Many ppl new to this, just think like any other phone pressing the 'end call' button closes everything. Thats not the case here! Ppl forget to close the programs, and open in addition to 4 or 5, and then complain abt it crashing. It can handle many many at the same time, but sometimes you forget and have too many open (there is a dedicated button to see whats open and switch). So anyone complaining it abt it being slow, is simply not using it properly. All Sumbian 60 series phones can do this...my last phone was the N93. Enjoy
I bought this phone to replace my Nokia 9300 and let me tell you, what an upgrade. Even though this phone's 3G capabilities will not work on AT&T;'s network, I find it to be a real pleasure to use. It is very well made with little plastic involved and the keyboard now has a back light as well as a two screen setup that now handles millions of colors. In short, if you are looking for a computer and a phone in one, this is your best option at this time in the U.S... It is very expensive but worth every bit of dosh you part with!
The product is fantastic but the software that manage the contacts, the calculator, and SMSs have a lot less features than the nokia 9300. The performance is good. Hardware can be rated as 5 stars, but the software compared to the 9300 is 3 to 3 1/2 stars.
The Nokia E90 Communicator is a mobile office device , features a combination of advanced technologies that allow faster and better quality access to important information.Operational all over the world using quadband GSM and 3G networks, the E90 also offers fast broadband connectivity via 3GWCDMA, WLAN and HSDPA.  It also has an integrated GPS and Nokia Maps application. For entertainment purposes it has an FM radio, a music player, a video player and two cameras. A 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera with flash and a second camera for videoconferencing.The only problem for me is that I find the Nokia E90 to be too bulky, but it is still worth it, given all of its features.
For former users of touch screens, this machine, while beautiful and functional, takes lots of getting used to...the jury is out, whether with practice it will be as intuitive as other PDAs.Also, the manual leaves much to be desired, re comprehensiveness and clarity.
Nokia e90-super:o suchfunktion in allen dokumentarten inkl. terminen, sms, etc.o kartenanzeige (schnell, detailliert, zoom funktioniert, schöne darstellung)o display ist hell, schön und scharf.-negativo lange startzeit (ca. 10s, früher 0.5s) da das ganze teil abgeschaltet wird und nicht nur der telefonteil. Wenn ich also am abend meine ruhe will, dann schalte ich auf flugzeugmodus - dann geht's schneller.o das ganze software-konzept entstammt dem s60. die hardware hat aber die (tolle) konzeption eines neuen communicators, nur lässt sie sich kaum bedienen - der alte communicator liess sich schnellstens 2händig bedienen (esc links, tab links für programmbedienung, ctrl-x, ctrl-v, ctrl-c für alle arten von elementen, inkl. files, etc) - beim neuen wird die maschine fast ausschliesslich rechts gesteuert, und zwar abwechselnd am deckel und am gerät, das heisst, die linke hand hält das gerät und den deckel, damit der nicht wegtaucht, wenn der rechte daumen am deckel/rechts vom bildschirm bedient.o Die suchenfunktion ist zwar überall hilfreich, sie lässt sich aber nur über ein sub-submenü aufrufen.o Die taste arbeitsplatz ist redundant mit der ()-taste, eine telefon-taste wurde leider weggelassen.o einstellungen die sich auf einem bildschirm vornehmen lassen werden fast konsequent über 1-2 menüs und 2-3 bildschirme geführt. möglicherweise werden e90-anfänger damit in den ersten 10min vor reizüberflutung geschützt. alle anderen werden genervt sein, jedesmal, wenn sie etwas am handy eingeben.' die anzeige der (wenigen) details von fotos zum beispiel, sind erst nach dem scrollen über 2 bildschirme ersichtlich, 4 zeilen würden genügen. Eine andere darstellung der fotoliste (mit den details) ist nicht vorgesehen.o Möchte ich fotos ansehen, wird mir immer eine auswahl aus allen im gerät und auf der speicherkarte verfügbaren angezeigt. Damit ist es obsolet, überhaupt mit ordner zu arbeiten. Abgeschaltet werden kann das nicht (die idee wäre ja als ergänzung toll). Will ich also die privaten bilder nie bei einem kunden sichtbar haben, habe ich sie nicht auf dem gerät. Anders geht's nicht. Die bilder/filme-files werden auch immer mit vorschau angzeigt, was ja an sich auch eine tolle option ist, aber abschaltbar wäre nötig.o kleinschrift gibt's nicht, das erste wort wird immer gross geschrieben. Für notorische kleinschreiber wie mich ist das nervig.o Die anzeige-einstellungen (beim vorgänger meist in etwa 3 grössenstufen) sind hier zwar einstellbar über schriftgrösse (einmal pro gerät), aber sie werden nur an ganz wenigen stellen überhaupt eingesetzt, der rest bleibt unverändert.o Ein neues sms ist reingekommen, beim alten gerät ein tastendruck, das anzusehen. Beim neuen 4 bis 5.o Beim alten gerät konnte ich in einer langen liste (profile, töne, bilder, ..) mittels des ersten buchstabens des gesuchten (z.b. taste G für golf.jpg) springen. beim e90 drücke ich dafür zb 48x die nach unten taste.o Wenn einstellungen in einer liste dargeboten werden, wäre es optimal die rauf/runter-taste für die auswahl des listenelements und die links-rechtstaste für die werte des ausgewählten listenelements einzusetzen.wäre. gemacht wird das über rauf-runter zur auswahl des listenelements, dann option, dann ändern, dann wählen, dann links-rechts für die werte-auswahl, dann ok. Damit drücke ich um den lichtsensor etwas schwächer einzustellen anstelle 1 taste (links) 5 tasten.o Insgesamt braucht das gerät für die umständliche bedienung 4-5mal mehr tastendrücke = aufmerksamkeit als früher.o Das alte konnte ich über weite strecken blind bedienen (über taktiles feedback und die bestätigungstöne). Beim neuen kann ich aufhören zu arbeiten, mich zurücklehnen, und mit der einstellung beginnen.o Wo ich beim alten gerät alles über esc abbrechen konnte (z.b. habe ich aus versehen eine neue notiz erstellt oder eine bestehende notiz verändert), konnte ich dies mit esc/abbrechen wieder gutmachen.beim e90 gibt es das nicht. Kein rückgängig, kein abbrechen, kein speichern unter. batterie raus, das könnte helfen.o Dafür gibt es in fast jedem menü ein eintrag hilfe. Das wäre ja grundsätzlich nichts schlechtes, da aber die menüs auf dem breitschirm immer vertikal, von oben nach unten angezeigt werden (ein absoluter blödsinn) muss jedes menü gescrollt werden. Der eintrag hilfe macht einfach noch ein bisschen mehr scrollen nötig.dabei ist die hilfe jederzeit über die tastatur ganz einfach zugänglich.auch in jedem menü ist ein eintrag schliessen, um das menü zu schliessen (beim alten 3390 wurde einfach die taste menü nochmals gedrückt, oder esc). Beim e90 werden die menüs einfach noch etwas länger.o Wer hofft, dass er bildschirmweise texte oder lange liste scrollen kann, vergiss es. Das handy hat zwar 5 tasten shift, alt und strg, diese werden aber nicht für solche feinheiten eingesetzt. (worte markieren in texten, das geht mit shift).o Es gibt eine kurze liste mit tastenkürzeln für das e90 (im internet, im handbuch). WICHTIG: Das sind alle, dies gibt. Aus, ende. Wer mit enter einen listeneintrag auswählen will, hat selten glück, meist geht das über option - auswählen.o Wer mit ctrl-c ein bild oder ein programm auswählen und in einen anderen ordner verschieben will: vergiss es. Das geht heute so:zum ordner navigieren (auf der rechten seite sind die files sichtbar, aber das ist rein informativ, die lassen sich nicht auswählen oder anspringen, die rechte seite des explorerfensters ist verzierung. Also den ordner öffnen (dann ist der ordnerbaum weg, aber die files sind sicht- und auswählbar. Dann file mittels rauf/runter auswählen, dann option, dann 4x runter: in ordner kopieren, dann ordner suchen (immer vom stammordner aus!!), dann enter.hier haben früher 9 tastendrücke gereicht: ordner auswählen, tab, file auswählen, ctrl-x, tab, ordner wechseln, ctrl-v.heute sind wir da bei 14-20 tastendrücken.o Fazit: der e90 hat zwar eine tastatur, nur kommt diese im bedienkonzept nicht vor. Und er benützt menüs, so als wären menüs heute im jahr 2007 eine neuheit, anstelle von links nach rechts, wo platz ist, und sie sofort erkannt werden sind sie von oben nach unten angeordnet.o Die software ist unausgegoren und für dieses handy nicht konzipiert.o Eine der schlimmeren erfahrungen ist es, einen termin von heute auf morgen zu verschieben. Ging das früher mit 3 tastendrücken auch zur not noch auf der autobahn, so ist heute die nächste raststätte aufzusuchen, ein kaffee zu bestellen, oder einfacher: ein notizblock mitzuführen. Das gleiche gilt dafür, einen termin zu ändern. Nachdem ich den monat ansehe, die woche ausgewählt habe, den tag ausgewählt habe, den termin ausgewählt habe, kann ich ihn, verteilt auf etwa 3 bildschirmhöhen ändern. Sorry, nokia, aber das ist absolut unbrauchbar. Termine in outlook erfassen und am e90 anschauen, das geht, schöne darstellung. Aber etwas daran ändern: no way, das werde ich in zukunft wieder im kopf machen.o Diese liste liesse sich beliebig verlängern. Doch leider habe ich dazu nicht die zeit. Und auch keinen usability-test-auftrag von nokia.
I'm not someone who buys a phone on a whim.  I'm too poor for that sort of extravagance.  So when my last phone went kaput it became inevitable to buy a new one.  I wanted something sturdy and no nonsense, but didn't look like it weighed a ton .  I wanted something that didn't make me feel like I needed a degree in phone science to operate it, but also oozed technological savvy.In short, what I was looking for was something like the Sony Ericsson K800i.  I fell in love with a lot of the features:1. The fun, quick camera that you could operate quickly and without a fuss2. The user friendly interface3. The fact that it could probably double as a music player if you wanted it to.4. The large screen5. The elegant design of the phone (in a stylish black, with clean design lines)and so forth.The only real sore point with me is that the phone doesn't interface with my PC as well as I had hoped it would.  I don't know if it's a driver problem or whatever, but Sony really should have hammered out the connection routines a bit more before releasing this gem.  A small flaw in an otherwise perfect package.  I love this phone and can't think of a more fun one on the market.  Buy it if you want something that is simple to use, but has bells and whistles to boot.
Excellent product. I should have chosen a quadband to capitalize on the scope for using alternative service carriers who offer service on different frequencies.
AFTER HAVING MY N70 FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS I DECIDED TO UPGRADE MY PHONE AND SURELY DIDN'T MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE. THIS PHONE WORKS WONDERFULLY. THE BATTERY, THE MENU, THE ENDURANCE, EASY INTERFACE. LOVE EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF IT.
This Samsung comes with 2 batteries and a desktop charger that will charge both batteries and sync you to your PC all at the same time. It has features dripping off it. The PDA looks and acts exactly like an HP Ipaq. It is however a bit bulky and the buttons on both sides tend to get bumped very easy setting off a barage of functions. Functions like the lady saying "Please Say a Command". All in all the phone is feature-rich. It has a full qwerty keyboard that slides down. The voice commands work well when setup properly. If your address book has all the phone numbers filled in, it will ask you when you say a person name if you want to dial their home, cell or work number. A good phone and PDA that is a little bulky in todays market. Made by Samsung is a real plus.
I purchased this phone as a gift for my wife, who wanted a "flip phone", but didn't want to learn how to use Motorola (she's had Nokia for the past few years).  This really is a great phone - it has full functionality that you expect from high end Nokia phones (e.g. syncronizes with Outlook and other Microsoft Office products); easy to navigate around and with cameras, MP3 and video and PTT, has everything you could possibly want.  The only downsides are (a) the keyboard is a little hard to get used to - but after a couple of weeks even that becomes less of a hassle; and (b) the camera is good for outside shots, but not so good for inside with poor light - but as another reviewer said, buy a camera if you want good quality shots.  For spontaneous snap shots and video (e.g. of your kids playing at the park), it's fine.  4 Stars as a phone - 5 stars if you're a Nokia user looking for a flip phone.
I would rather give this product "Zero" star. It looks good from picture, but once you receive on your hand, you will understand what I am talking about. The battery cover is extreme difficult to remove from the phone.For a phone marked as $400+, it is not worth at all. The phone keeps unresponding or could not power it off. The only way to rest this phone is removed the battery. The N76 I got is really a piece of junk.I bought this phone for my wife as her birthday. After few hours with the phone. She just wants me to return the product back to Amazon ASAP. Don't waste your time and money for this good looking phone.
This product was finally shipped to me after several delays, and when I finally got it, the box was opened and the phone was damaged on the sides. It had no plastic cover for the memory card, but it didn't need it, since it didn't bring the included memory card neither. The charger was also missing.My choice was to send it back (and pay the 2-way shipment) or living with a "new" cellphone that looked like it was roughly used for a year.At first I though the box was opened on the way here, but unless someone in FedEx put his really mistreated cellphone (identical to the one i bought) in the place of the new one, I doubt it could be accidentally (or even on purpose) damaged that way.Since the shipment from my country was waaaaay too expensive I had to keep it, so don't let it happen to you. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!
10/10 on form factor...this is a sweet phone, bought it for my wife and she LOVES it, and looks SO hot using it!  Slight reception issues outside of major metropolitan areas, some dead spots in small cities due to the tri-band, but overall surprisingly better than expected (we use AT&T;/Cingular).  No problems with SIM card interface.  Not a phone for tech junkies although the whole touch screen is pretty slick.  Camera is actually better than I thought.  Has flash but not auto.  Does come with earphones, a 128MB card and beautiful packaging.  USB port works fantastic just like flash drive for data transfer to desktop.  You WILL stick out like a sore thumb using this thing - and love every minute of it!  Highly recommend it, but do check out tri-band reception in your area first to avoid major disappointment.
this product was ok , seller give us all acssorseries except one extra battery, lot of people still  dont know when you buy the new LG prada it come with 2 battries not only one so, thats why always seller take advantage and keep one battery. He should give to coustomer all acssorseries as he receive from to compney. thank you
It is easy to think of this phone as being similar in appearance to the iPhone. In fact, most reviews compare this phone to the Apple iPhone. However, I don't agree with that at all. Really all that these phones share is a touchscreen interface. The LG Prada is in fact, a more traditional cell phone. It's features are simple and pretty much what you'd expect out of a cell phone. I like that it is light and love the interface. However, be warned the interface also requires that you are always touching the screen for something. Without a tactic feel for buttons or numbers, this phone is almost impossible to use while driving or any other task that also requires your attention. (The truth is you shouldn't be fiddling with any phone while driving). The sound quality is excellent on my network and I had very little trouble receiving texts, photos, etc. The camera on the phone is pretty good (I love all of the software features (including a flash). The MP3 player is very nice too, and unlike most phones, I can set my MP3s to be my ring-tone.Can you tell I like this phone after using it for a month?!I do. The only drawbacks to me are the very delicate scratchable screen and the need to continually touch the screen, whereas a RAZR or traditional cell usually has more dedicated buttons or you train yourself to know which buttons to push by tactile feel without having to look at the phone. OH and it is a little annoying that people ask you about the phone waaaay too much.
I bought this phone in Paris a month ago for my wife Karmen, and must to say that's the best looking phone I put my hands on. A few suggestions (or complains) from my wife though:1. The ring volume is not that high so you might miss your call in a public place.2. The battery is not that great, I have to charge it overnight every day.3. The "buttons" on the screen are a bit slow, so you need to be patient especially when you deal with SMS messages.As for me, I'm waiting for my wife to get me iPhone, once it is available:)
Since it's touchscreen phone, if you aren't used to it, well, i guess better get used to it.Small, light, great to listen to music, sleek design, and oh, did I mention it was Prada?The price is a bit high, but it has decreased, compared to Jan., when it first came out.I've bought mine from Europe and been using it. Love it.Only thing would be the camera. Though the quality is good, but for the price, i would've like it if it was 5 meg. pixel.Or maybe like 10 meg. pixel, like the ones in Korea.
The carrying case pictured above is not the same one that came with my phone. The one I have is a slip case in black Prada saffiano textured leather and is apparently easily recognizable by Prada fashionistas. I've read other reviews that reported the case scratches the phone. I haven't had that problem and I hope I won't. I like the pictured one better, the slip case requires you to completely remove the phone and if you are not careful, it could be easily lost.The phone itself is fun. Navigating through the menus is a but more tedious than the Razr (my previous phone) and the screen is almost impossible to see in bright sunlight. The touch screen is sensitive enough and does not require pressure, just contact. The camera is impressive and captures clear bright colors and has a flash which is actually just a little white spot light. The included earphones for the FM radio and MP3 player are Prada branded so it matches the phone and the available LG Prada Bluetooth ear piece which I guess is a good thing if you are looking to show off the fact that you have a Prada phone.The one thing that I am really disappointed with is the small cover piece that fits over the charger/ear piece connection slot. It feels very flimsy and just barely hangs on while the charger or ear piece is connected. I'm sure its just a matter of time before it breaks off. I think its great that the slot is covered but the small plastic piece is just not acceptable for a phone this expensive.If you're looking for the latest technology in a touchscreen phone that looks good, this is the one. I purchased this because its significanlty smaller and thinner than the iPhone, other than the size difference, there really shouldn't be any comparisons made between the two. Why be an iPhone clone when you can be a fashion victim!Of course if you're truly a fashion victim you would already know that Samsung has partnered with Giorgio Armani and released a touchscreen phone in Europe. It should be available in the USA sometime in 2008. I've also read that Levis will be coming out with a branded phone too. A joke? I don't know, remember the Gucci cadillac and YSL cigarettes?
Overall the phone is nice. It has a easy to use interface and provides clear voice quality. The downside on this phone is its antenna. Signal quality is easily lost on this phone in North America.
I had to return this product.When calling a 1-800 number (in my case, my company's teleconference service) it didn't allow me to press number keys (seems like it didn't understand that the call was already in place...). That was the major reason for me to return it.Besides that, I was disappointed with the finish. Looks very cheap. All the "chrome" look is just fragile painted plastic. Seemed to me that it wouldn't survive its first fall.The look is great. But don't let anybody touch it or feel it, otherwise the magic will be over.Mine had the owner's manual completely in French.Buy it if you love the look and glamour, and don't care about the price or lack of functionalities.Also keep in mind that there is probably a reason for the fact that no carrier released it in the US market.
The phone is very beautiful and slick. I love it. There are a couple of things I would like to mention, though. The company that sent it did not include the instruction booklet in English. I received it in French. i wrote to them but not even an answer was returned. Fortunately enough the phone takes you by the hand and you can learn everything it does by playing with it a little. Very Friendly. On the down side, the lather casing it comes with that is supposed to protect it, has made horrible marks on the back of the phone and a couple on the front becuase when you slide the phone in, it rubs againts it. This only after using it for  a couple of weeks, Now I don't use the leather casing to prevent more ugly marks. It is odd that such a luxurious and well thought item did not come with a casing that would actually protect it from scratching. The casing is beautiful, though. Overall The phone is great!!!
Yes - as everyone says this is a great looking phone and you will get lots of comments from onlookers because basically no one has the phone.  But it is also a great device.  I have tmobile and have had good reception and service.  I am also excited that I can use the phone with an overseas sim card, since it is unlocked (oh - the iphone cant do that).  the software definitely looks a bit dos/windows like, but its more utilitarian than anything.  hope you enjoy it as much as i do.
I just got this phone and I really like it. The interface is easy to use and you don't have to wait for the phone to response. I have a cingular before AT&T; 64 Ksmartchip sim card. On the top of the phone's task bar is a roaming  icon. I was wondering if anybody had the same issue with the phone? It is a great phone and it has some of the basic features that  the iphone should have.
I bought mine from Singapore when I was there. It is quite expensive, but in my opinion quite a sexy, sleek, and trendy phone to have. It is somewhat a fashion statement, and is a must-have for those fashionistas!! The functionality of it is okay; I would not rate it as a phone with excellent functionalities. But it serves the basis functions you need: SMS, Email, Camera, etc.
One of the best phones I've owned. Call quality and reception are tops and this phone is a stunner. Finger prints are annoying, but expected. I constantly have people come over and ask about it. For the people that are bashing this phone, it isn't an Iphone and isn't intended to be. For those of you that are looking at the Apple "product' and are desperate enough to use ATT, let me say one thing. I tried the Iphone for a week only because it was a demo. I wanted to see if the reviews were true. They are. The Iphone is the worst phone I've ever used. I'm talking about the phone features. Bells and whistles are nice when the phone doesn't lock up. Terrible call quality and iffy reception in medium strength signal strength areas. The speaker phone is a joke too. terrible sound levels. Too bad Apple decided to forget it was a phone first. I'm still laughing about all of you that overpaid, only to see them discontinue the model and then drop the price. You'll never learn. Well maybe you will if you buy the LG.....Top notch
I just love the way it looks, and the touch screen is great. I also find it very easy to use.
This is NOT innovative, not impressive, and a real missed opportunity.  This phone is nothing better than a RAZR with a touch screen.Some quick observations from my limited time with it:*  Not quad band...ok, so it's a step lower than a RAZR.  I'm sure most people don't need 4 GSM bands, but it's always good to know you have them if needed.*  No QWERTY keyboard, uhh, what?!  The very reason I bought my iPhone was because of the QWERTY keyboard, and I looked at this phone prior to selling my soul to Apple.  The thought of triple tapping a touch screen to send text messages seemed utterly ridiculous.  "The PRADA Phone offers a virtual numeric keypad, instead of a virtual QWERTY keyboard, for dialing of numbers and writing text messages (with help from the integrated T9 predictive text entry technology)"...and they advertise this as a good thing.*  You can move the clock...ooh, stop the presses.  That's really a feature...and worth every dollar.  Not.*  I've never had a phone where the minute you touched it, it looked like it'd been manhandled by greasy mitts.  Its super polished look looks great...when untouched.  Usually, I've found phones to have a dulled finish, I thought for this reason.*  OS.  This is a phone.  Nothing more.  It's not a Blackberry replacement like the iPhone kinda/sorta is, and why it's considered iPhone's competitor, I don't understand.*  Size - it's almost the size of the iPhone with nowhere near the functionality.* Its storage can support a microSD card (this is a bonus over the iPhone), but this means it's an extra expense and is limited to card size.  There should be 8gig cards coming out soon.It's unique, but unique and cute does not equate to particularly being useful.  And for $600, you can get more of a phone than this.  It's not worth it.
I tried one out at the prada store and was really unimpressed. The apps are all kinda crappy looking, and typing is absolutely impossible. Only saving grave is that its really small.
Update: Do not buy this phone.  I would re-rate it to one star if that were possible.  The problem is build quality.  After 6 months the outer case was chipped and scarred.  A colleague who bought one at the same time has the same problem.  I had the case repaired under warranty but 3 months later the replacement shell is also chipping.  As soon as it's out of contract I'll be replacing the phone with a decent one.Pros:  Clear speech (both caller and called).  This was a No. 1 priority - a new phone had to have clear speech.  The N76 doesn't have speech clarity circuitry but it's excellent all the same.  Has a great MP3 player with ample volume. Voice dialling, neat size, clam-shell form factor, 3.5mm standard headphone socket.It synchronises with Outlook.  This works efficiently and it's easy to find a date and read the appointment. It's not so easy to amend an appointment, but I can do that on the PC after I return home.Cons: Poor quality. Expensive.  The front screen is prone to showing fingerprints.  Some users may need to use fingernails to operate keys as they are rather small (not a serious shortcoming).  Doesn't have anywhere to attach a neck or wrist strap.Some might criticize if for not being openable with one hand.  In fact it takes a practice to use two hands.  I fumbled and dropped it a few times - fortunately it's landed in my lap. It closes securely and doesn't have a spring hinge that might break down.Not really a pro or con but the camera is a standard Toshiba fixed-focus 2mp unit with all the shortcomings this implies. It takes reasonable photos in sunny conditions but nothing to get excited about.  In other-than-good light the photos are, as you would expect, very noisy.  It's for emergency use only.Battery life is very poor although it does charge quickly.  From fully-charged 20 minutes listening to music, 10 or so phone calls using the loudspeaker,(say, 30 minutes in total) is enough to completely flatten the battery.
I am a die hard nokia fan.  When this phone was released, I was one of the first to purchase it.  It looks like a great phone, and the functionality is amazing.  Very well made.. HOWEVER.. within two weeks of buying this, the silver paint started chipping off to reveal white underneath.  Let's be honest.. You spend $450 on a phone.. it's paint shouldn't be chipping!!! For that reason alone, I DO NOT recommend this phone.  Boo nokia.. you disappointed me.SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A DIFFERENT PHONE!
This phone is great!!!  I just got it 4 days ago.  it has Push technology just like blackberry, qwerty board, buttons easy, windows mobile 5.0, i've been getting apps like crazy.I installed old school DOOM on it, and it looks and plays just like the original!!!  Manager to install an Atari emulator and got every atari game ever made on my phone!!!  I know i'm just talking games but that is sick!!!oh yeah, it's Wi-Fi.  Need I say anything else!!!basically, I can play movies, record video, play music, play games, browse the internet on Wi-Fi, text, MMS, use office style programs, sync with outlook for work and have my computer at work basically on my phone.and it also is a phone and I can make calls...This phone has everything available that can be done, well almost, can't watch live tv, but i love it!
I have had this phone (T-Mobile DASH) for a year. Ever since upgrading to WM6, it has been miserable. The phone has to be restarted with battery and SIM taken out at least 4-5 times a day. If there are any third party apps, it gets worse. It won't start with the SD card in it so I have given up using it as a music player which I did from the beginning. All of these issues are documented on the various support boards including HTCs.I live and breathe by my phone and email capability and this one is no longer dependable. T-Mobile replaced it but the same issue is happening and they can't fix it. I love the form factor of this phone and what it could do - it just doesn't. I will be moving to another device in February as I have to have a phone that works all the time.
I won't give any more details than the previous reviewer (Mark), I just wanted to add my comments to say that I agree with him and that this is the best of the 14 cell phones I had.Light weight, not so big, great hand grip, great battery life, fast wi-fi connectivity, loud ringtones and not expensive! What more can I ask for?Other phones with slide keyboard (which have better "looks") won't do what this phone with the integrated keyboard does: the capability to type with just one hand.I'm really happy with this phone, won't change it until is dead, it has ALL the features I need from a phone, all of them.
This thing is great. Light weigth, I can finally have a thin light phone on my shirt pocket. The windows connectivity is perfect, when something is updated on my outlook automatically is updated with my HTC and viceversa, no need to press any sync button. The keyboard is good and now that I got used I can type really fast. I will kiss goodbye my bulky Palm Tungsten T3 and my old Nokia 6230. Now I have all in one gadget. They never really got along well.I just wish it had a touch screen so I could run my HP48 Emulator on it. But I think I will find a good polish calc.And I wish it had already WM6. I need to update it but I think it will not by any problem.
I have been looking for a PDA phone.  I have few must-have and Good-to-have features as my guideline to hunt down my next phone.Must-have=========VOIP supportUnlocked 3G/GSMQWERTY messaging keyboardWiFi & BluetoothSync with Outlook Address Book, Calendar, and NotesMore than 2 days of battery lifeSupports SD cardBuilt-in camera with video recordingGood-to-have============IM MessengersDictionaryBusiness card scanningMP3/Video playerWeb browserTouch screenLike many other people, they may have separate address book in their PDA and cell phone respectively.  This is the main reason I want a PDA phone to combine them into 1.  I could have bought this phone earlier to solve the problem.  I was just waiting for Apple iPhone to see if it does any better, but I eventually gave up iPhone.Why did I choose E61i?1) It is a unlocked phone2) I can use truphone, a VOIP service for Symbian OS phones, to make international call over WiFi/3G network.  The quality is even better than my home Vonage service.3) The battery can last 2 or more days with normal usage.4) QWERTY messaging keyboard makes my life easier on SMS.5) It syncs with my address book, calendar with Outlook perfectly.6) For the Web browser, I feel the N61i browser is better than the one in Pocket PC but worst than iPhone.  You are able to zoom in and out a web page.7) This is not important to English speaking users.  I bought the Hong Kong version of E61i.  It supports Chinese on typing and displaying.  There is a built-in Chinese/English Dictionary too.The nice things I figured after I bought it1) The speaker is loud and clear.2) It supports Podcast3) There is a IM+ software you can purchase.  It supports many popular Instant Messengers.4) It has a message reader to read your text message with voice.5) It can print documents with some HP printers that support LAN/BluetoothThe things I dislike about this phone1) Hard to find the right place to configure certain features.2) Not much software supports Symbian OS.3) It does not support WMV and WMA files4) No built-in auto keypad lock.  Fortunately, there is a freeware.5) No Bluetooth power save feature on handsfree mode.6) No touch screen.7) A little bit too wide on the size.
I used to use Blackberry on Cingular; needed to change to a phone with W-CDMA due to extensive travel in Japan, etc. Cingular does not support this on Blackberry, and their W-CDMA phones are (Aug/2007) just horrible. Some are WinCE too, which would only add to my pain if I had to use windows on my phone as well. And the iPhone is basically useless here too.So, I got one of these. It works; but the menu system takes some learning. I actually had to read the manual. Simple things that made my life easy with the Blackberry - like being able to click on the email message and get a screen to call back the sender directly - are completely missing. It does not have a learning dictionary to speed up txt messages with fast auto complete and the keys are also weird; just don't feel right.The dialing system is annoying if you travel a lot; whereas my old Blackberry just got on with it and inserted the "+" before the country code when I was dialing from Taiwan or UK or wherever, the Nokia dialer barfs at this. So now, I need to go through my entire address book and update the numbers to include the "+".On the plus side, it does have flawless BT support - my Jawbone headset locks in very nicely every time. It also has wickedly good battery life (nearly 2 ~ 3 days) and excellent VOIP call capabilities. (I use TruPhone; works great.)The camera can be used a a video camera as well, saving me the trouble of packing another item. (I always take short videos of where I've been to show the kids; the e61i is great for this too.)The sync with Outlook is also flawless and the SW package includes a media manager that does additional compression.As an Engineer, I'm also impressed with the construction; the back is solid stainless steel, and it has already survived pretty intense destruction testing from my younger son giving it near mil-std grades in my book.As a phone, the sound quality is excellent. This is fundamental, but something that is often missing on other phones.The default menu can be configured to show what you want - I have it showing an email summary, a calendar summary, and a bunch of gadgets. And since I use TruPhone for VOIP, I also have it scanning for WLAN's from time to time. Its a busy little machine, and has never hung up on me yet.Based on the narky user interface, I can't give this 5 stars. But, its definitely better than 3 stars and is good at what it does right. It definitely does do what I bought it for, and hopefully, with time and new software releases, things will get better.
I bought it as an all-in-one solution:phone/office/email/navigation/pmp and own it for almost two months now.I don't regret one cent I spent for it.The DESIGN is one of most simple yet elegant on the market and you have to hold it yourself in your hand to see how it feels as I can't express the feeling ;).Perhaps one thing I appreciate the most is the BATTERY LIFE. Wifi on for almost the whole week-end and still had enough juice for the next monday.Allthough the size of the screen is not as big as a PDA screen, it is still big enough for enjoying some movies (divx also) while travelling. I installed TOMTOM on it and it's great for navigation! It's true that it doesn't have gps built-in (I had to use my bluetooth gps receiver for navigation) but it's a fair compromise compared to all the other features it provides.It connects to almost EVERYTHING. The only problem I had was related to the fact that it doesn't support "IP passthrough" (for sharing internet connection through the data cable provided and the Nokia Network Bridge software). It also doesn't support "PAN bluetooth" for connecting to bluetooth networks, but this will not make me rate it with less than 5 stars.I will not go through all the features and apps which can be installed on it, as other reviewers already did this. And I cannot agree with the previous 1 star rate, the "symptoms" described lead to lack of knowledge rather than a "bad PDA".It doesn't have touchscreen, that's true, but I didn't feel the need for such a feature, considering also the size of the screen. And remember, a touchscreen comes with its own disadvantages: the screen loses brightness in sunny environments due to the extra layers it adds. Choice is yours.. ;)Although it has an average browser, I installed the free Opera Mini which comes as a freeware and is reacher in features.The Symbian OS platform has been on the market for a loooong looooong time, and there is a diverse choice of apps and games including the ones from the third parties. There are two things to keep in mind when searching the right app for your needs: it has to support the Series 60 (S60) version 3 (or Symbian 9.1a) and it has to fit the 320x240 resolution (as the reversed - 240x320 is usually most popular amongst the nokias).I owned other smartphones and PDAs, including Palm, Nokia and Blackberry, but I feel that E61i is the ONE for me. I recommend it without any hesitations. Enjoy the elegant and powerful E61i ;)
This review is written from the perspective of someone moving from a Blackberry or Treo.  If this is your first smartphone, you'll probably like it.  If you are switching from another device, you'll probably be disappointed.  If you are trying to use this for business, you'll likely be frustrated.My biggest frustration is with Mail for Exchange (and Mail in general).  If you don't need to sync over the air with a corporate Microsoft Exchange Server, this bit isn't for you.First, some good things.- MfE syncs quickly, sometimes even before my laptop.- MfE was easy to install and set up.- Battery life is great, on par with the Blackberry.- Very easy to switch between email accounts using the D-pad.Now the bad/ugly:- Let's go through the steps it takes me to send a new email:-- Why is `text message' the top option and "E-mail" the bottom option when I'm *already* in MfE and making a new message?-- Why do you ask me which account to use when I choose E-mail, especially how quickly I can switch between them? 99.9% of the time I want to write an email in the account that I'm in.-- Why do you make me jump to *another* dialog box for Corporate Lookup? Why not just give me an option to look up the name I typed in the to or cc line and come back with a list? The lookup itself is also incredibly slow. It probably takes me 30 seconds to get the name in the field. On the blackberry I've already typed and sent the message (and probably sent another 3 emails).- I can't click on a phone number or link in the email. WTF? The Treo's been able to do this since they were Handspring. Someone sends me a number in an email and I'm supposed to copy/paste? This is not fun for dialing into conference calls.- No auto-replace, e.g. youre -> you're. Try typing "I'd", I dare you. Annoying as hell. Why is the apostrophe buried under the slash key?- No ability to turn off notification buzz when in silent mode. This is really annoying.- Why don't you give me the option of downloading the whole message? Sure would be nice to be able to read the whole message on my flight, not just the first 2K.- You can't sync notes? Come on.- Don't get me started on the initial sync wiping all contacts and calendar entries. Here's a radical notion -- make a group called "Exchange" in both my contacts and my calendar. Delete that one all you want, but leave my personal entries *alone*. I know that this is probably a Microsoft ActiveSync issue, but deleting data to avoid dupes is a cop out. You give me separate email accounts, give me separate calendar and contact accounts.- Existing, repeating calendar entries aren't getting picked up.- Corporate Lookup doesn't give me a phone number, and isn't available in Contacts. How am I supposed to get phone numbers from the directory?- Far too often, MfE just stops checking mail. No error. Whether this is a network issue or a MfE issue I don't know, but I just don't trust it.Phone issues- Why is the zero off to the right? That's just weird. Put it where the @ is (and share it with the apostrophe key).- It's way too hard to see the numbers at night (or any blue key, for that matter).- I have fairly big hands, and the phone is wide.  Reeeally wiiiiide.  But it is very thin, and sturdy.  (But it's wide...)- The buttons are pretty flat.  They're easy to hit, but I found it tiring compared to the Treo or Blackberry.Then there's the whole network switching issue. Take a lesson from the iPhone -- if my WiFi networks aren't available, use GPRS. Or if I'm not getting mail on WiFi, go to GPRS. Don't make me chose every time. In general, Symbian needs to make the network switching more elegant. The iPhone's *killing* you here. I should NOT have to worry about it. SmartConnect helps, but this should be built into the OS. I have to pay more money to reliably connect to different networks on a mobile device? Often it would just sit there, not checking mail because it shut off the WiFi even though GPRS was obviously available.  Not cool.The whole issue of where settings live (not just networking, but everything) is a whole other issue. Way too many places, not very elegant.The e61i has potential. MfE has potential. But it's not ready for prime time. Sorry if this comes across as snarky, but this has been an incredibly frustrating experience given the potential of the phone (impressive battery life, great camera, wifi, well integrated VOIP).  I'm also worried that Nokia is prioritizing on their N series phones and won't be focused on improving the E series software.Summary: if you're coming from the Blackberry, you'll be disappointed by the Exchange-based email.
Absolutely love everything about this - with one exception.  The numbers on the keyboard are buried in blue background, and are not illuminated.This means in anything but bright light, using the phone function requires memory and some guessing.The screen is fantastic.Online performance fantastic.Everything except those numbers.
I have a Nokia E61i and it is really a very frustrating experience. It is a good phone but a very bad PDA.Networking is a nightmare with the phone it keeps going to different networks at random. Seems it stores the access point with the bookmark, who does that. Constantly get out of memory cards when there is plenty of mem left and I have also added a @ GB card.Would not want anyone else to go through what I have gone through after spending good money on this. Not recommended please do not buy.Also there is a reason why Nokia is moving away from their own s/w and will start using MS s/w for their phones some time in the future.Really bad the way Nokia is able to pass this on to consumers with deceptive marketing.
Small and compact. Lot of functions and features for business people. What I liked the most was the ability to update the calendar, tasks and notes with my outlook using the PC suit. I have my contacts hence stored or the phone and outlook and then though the outlook to a web server. The calendar and tasks gives out reminder even when my notebook is off... because my phone gives the reminder!!! I never misses an important appointment or to do task.It is not a fancy or too good looking phone. And no WiFi compared to its advanced models. Else the phone is just great with GPRS/EDGE and bluetooth support.The hands free function is great and loud enough than many other phones I used.
Well, my phone that came with my service plan is.. well.. its now a paper weight (darn razrs!!) I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T; monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone.The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too.VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover.came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection.it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards.my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone.----I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried.I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke.I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on.After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does.It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something.I highly recommend this phone. I'm going to buy another one soon, heck I might even pick up 2  one for an emergency replacement.
This phone is great. Simple to use, great battery life, always has a strong signal and AT&T; has a great pay-as-you go plan. I'm happy.
Easy to use features, slim in size at a very good price. It is better compare to my exsiting T-Mobile prepaid phone. I called from a landline to both phones and the at& t picked up within 13 seconds while the T-Mobile at 25 sec or most of the time, just jumped to my voice mail only.I highly recommend at&t.;
I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T; :( silly me.  I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price).  They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use.  I bought the phone and loved it.  It was very low cost, came with airtime.  It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems.  It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone.I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery.  The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight.  I was also really surprised at the battery life.  Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip.  Wrong :(  on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone.  It wouldn't turn on :(  I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained.  She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds).  Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T; rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM.  Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T; plan so I had to be migrated.  Atleast the phone didn't cost too much.  I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T; rep didn't tell me about).  And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.
I needed a temporary phone for a friend in a retirement home until he got settled in his new place. I charged it up and it ran for several days on its own. He would have preferred a larger key pad due to his poor eyesight, but he seemed to do okay with it, and it was simple enough for him to be able to use it to simply make or receive calls (I didn't get into the answering system with him!).Now that he has moved and has his landline installed, I am giving it to a friend who has no cell phone, and cannot afford the price of a regular one. This will be just right for her limited calls when she is on the road. So.... two for the price of one!!
It's designed for use in Hong Kong and has a strange plug on the charger.  It's awkward getting the Sim card in and out as the battery is in the way.  For some reason it does not show when a missed incomming call has come in. It's really a pig in a poke. It will work in the USA but for the price you can probably get something more "mainstream"!
this is by far the best phone I've ever had, great sound, great durability. only one bad point: Battery life. I use it to sync with my pc and to handle my agenda.
Pretty decent phone with good features, but this phone is very fragile. Lcd screen broke just being in my pocket, without dropping it. The warranty had run out. I only had it for two months. I had insurance with t-mobile, but the replacement phone was higher than what I paid for the phone. I got the phone on discount by entering a two year contract. I will never do that again. In short it was a bust. I feel I got ripped off.
El MOTORIZR Z3 es un celular innovador. Es el primer modelo de Motorola con diseño slider, o sea, hecho para que abras y cierres el teléfono con tan sólo deslizar la parte superior sobre la inferior. El acabado de goma y el teclado azulado hacen de éste un celular aún más novedoso. Además del diseño avanzado, tiene recursos multimedia como MP3 Player, cámara de video y de fotos con 2.0 Mega Píxeles. Para almacenar todo esto, usa la tarjeta microSD(tm) de memoria expansible y para transferir tus archivos, del celular a la computadora, usa la Tecnología Bluetooth, que no necesita cables ni dispositivos.
Excelent product for the money. Only that doesn't come with any accesories. No headset, no bluetoth, no nothing, just charger.
When I decided to buy a smartphone I seriously considered buying the Treo 650 since many reviews written at the time the 680 was launched mentioned a poor battery life for the Treo 680, and an apparent lack of improvements over the previous model. Most reviews were written before the camera patch came out which solved the battery drain problem, so, here's a review from a longtime Palm user who got his first Treo. The Palm website includes a page where you can check if your device needs to have the camera patch installed (you need the Treo's serial number).This is a great combination of a high tech phone and a Palm PDA. It has all the functions I was used to on my previous Palm-powered devices. I have owned a Palm Vx, a Clie PEG-615T, and a CLIE-PEG TJ25, and lately a Palm Tungsten E2. The only thing I really miss is the grafitti (handwritten) function. The keyboard is a little cramped for my taste, but I assume I will become used to it. Apart from that, I just love this phone. The battery life is adequate, since I used to charge my handheld daily, charging the Treo's battery daily is no big deal for me. The device's stability is also great. So far I have not had any trouble with the Treo blacking out or restarting on its own. This device is great for people on the go, and I still believe it is far superior to any blackberry device and Iphone, since a Palm-powered device is a handheld computer and not only a fancy cell phone. The Treo 680 is easy to use and very intuitive. I comes packed with useful applications, and there thousands of applications you can buy and install customizing the phone to your personal needs. The documents to go application is great to take with you spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations, and word documents. The pocket tunes software is great for listening to your favorite music (with a SD card, not included), and the amount of RAM (64MB) is just great for taking all the applications and games that you need on the go. The only thing I wish it had is wi-fi capabilities, which it doesn't. It is great to finally take along only one device instead of two (PDA and phone)!!!
this is a great phone; in fact I guess the best on the market. The Palm operating is system is so easy to use. I have had a blackberry, t mobile dash, and some Samsung phones. In fact, the convenience and quality that Palm offers is unmatched.
If you're looking for a smartphone that's intuitive and user-friendly, but also is a major powerhouse, check out this phone!  I've used several smartphones in the past, both Windows Mobile 6 as well as Palm based.  I keep coming back to Palm because of its ease of use and stability.I love the keyboard on the Treo 680 as well.  I can fire off emails very quickly, and the keyboard is quite spacious.One thing I like most about the Treo that no other cellphone or smartphone offers is the threaded chat feature.  Your Treo keeps all incoming and outgoing texts in a chat-style layout, so you know exactly who said what, and when.  Very cool!
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked)I bought the Treo in November of 2007, and noticed intense battery drain from the start. Even worse, the battery drains completely overnight. I'll fully recharge the telehpone, unplug it, and leave it off overnight. In the morning the battery is completely dead - the phone won't respond at all. I'm very disappointed in generally poor battery performance, and especially disappointed in the complete drain of battery power overnight while the device is turned off. Palm needs to come up with a solution or design a better GSM smarthpone.
This phone was obviously refurbished -- it's parts aren't flush, so pieces of the back cover stick up and out of place, it's charger port is missing the cover and is exposed when not in use, and the reception is AWFUL -- even when I have three bars (in some places), the phone still won't pick up reception... The car charger that came with the phone doesn't work, and the home charger, which is equipped for EUROPEAN outlets, fell apart the very first time I tried to use it (there was a US adapter).  I would have gladly returned this phone, but was willing to put up with the  other flaws and didn't discover the broken car charger until a week after I had thrown the electrically hazardous home charger away!
Unable to charge phone - out of box failure.  Sadly as the phone came with a partially charged battery I thought I had received a working phone until the Amazon return period had expired.  Tried getting a new battery at Batteries Plus, this worked until the new battery also ran out of charge.  Had to buy another phone, basically wasted my money on this one.  Morale of the story - I will NEVER buy a phone online again...
purchased this for phone for a friend, she just told me yesterday that the phone would not charge. just requested a return for the phone
First one I got appeared to be refurbished not new.Second one I got had the battery completely died in 3 weeks.No sure if it's a problem with the vendor or Amazon, but this source is definitely shady.  I'll give it a 0 star if I could.
The phone works as it should, and it came with some accessories I was not expecting including a ear piece and speaker for hands free talking.  The charger is european and comes with an adaptor that sometimes loosens, so check it periodically.  But the phone itself is great.  I got it as an OLD ATT customer trying not to loose her plan.
I read all the reviews of the Pharos 600 and bought it anyway.  I'm glad I didn't listen to the people who disliked it.  The Ostia navigation software, contrary to a review I read elsewhere, is easy and intuitive to operate.  I programmed in a house address and followed the prompts while driving, and it got me there perfectly.  I was early for my meeting, so I kept driving, and Ostia kept calculating new routes to get me back there!The phone sounds crisp and clear, and it's easy to use.  The only thing I'm reserving judgment on is the camera, since I haven't fully tested it yet.  The images I've taken so far don't impress me, but as I said I haven't mastered all its settings.It connects to the nearest WiFi for internet access, and even displays the week's weather forecast on the home screen.  I downloaded Google Maps, and when using the GPS it can show the satellite image with traffic report overlays.My goal was to have one compact device to carry around, especially on trips, that had a phone, camera, internet, basic computing (MS Word), and GPS all in one, so my briefcase wouldn't be cluttered with crap and all the power cords and adapters necessary.  The Pharos 600 does it.
Very disappointing. I had hoped for a full-featured Windows smartphone plus a substitute for an in-dash car GPS. I got neither.First, the good parts. Nice feel, small form factor. Crisp screen. The windshield mount worked well, and the belt clip is nice. Deserves at least a star for that.However, the small form factor kills ease of use, as the 1.25" X 2.75" screen is far smaller than an in-dash car GPS. Many important features require tapping tiny icons or pull-down menus - not linked to buttons - and you have to pull the Pharos out of its carrier to get at the stylus.It is difficult to add waypoints to force it to take a certain route on the way. The manual barely covers this. I guess I'm spoiled by google maps, the Ostia zoom-in/out requires 5-6 diagonal strokes to get to city level and street names don't show. While moving the map with finger or stylus I often accidentally zoomed in to some part of the city I couldn't recognize and had to start over. It appears the designers thought of this and put in a Power User feature to display the entire route, but that menu item was always grayed out for me. Only alternative is to check the route in turn-by-turn text form.And check it you must. In Houston we have these feeder roads that run alongside the interstate. The GPS often thinks you're on the feeder when you're on the interstate and vice-versa, and gives bogus instructions accordingly. More than once I was told to exit - travelled along the feeder road through a light - and then back on the same interstate! If you didn't spot this before departure, it's too late when you're driving to try to zoom out and see where your GPS is sending you.The area I live in also has some new roads and exits since 2003 which aren't on the map - a minor annoyance when you know more than the map, which squeaks and squawks in protest until you come into an area its familiar with again. POIs out of date and incomplete, and Live Update takes too long to load to be useful here. Also, if you forget to turn off the GPS after arrival you might not have enough battery to make it through the day.As a PDA the Pharos 600 is unstable and memory-starved. I think that comes from it being an ETEN 500 repackaged by Pharos with GPS stuck on, and they tried to squeeze all the maps into memory. Getting MS Active Sync to work was an agonizing troubleshoot - I'm not sure that is all Pharos' fault, though their technical assistance was zero help - unreachable after 5.30pm and don't return calls. The website is for marketing with one screen of FAQs masquerading as support. True, I do have 6500 contacts but I never had a problem with the Palm, which synced in minutes, not overnight.I've never really played with any of the other features like email or internet, if it can't do rock-solid contacts it's worthless to me. In fact, right now it's locked up again and even a hard reset isn't bringing it around. If I can get Tech Support to pick up the phone I'm reluctantly returning this - what a potentially nice device.My advice: skip the Pharos. Spend slightly more for an in-dash GPS for the car, and a Palm for contacts. And spend more time with the kids, rather than listening to hold music.
I've owned the k700 (stolen), k750 (returned to employer when I quit), k800 (wife washed with clothes) and now the k810 and the k810 is the best of the lot. Round buttons are easier to use than old square ones, camera (with excellent flash) takes detailed photos, and I find the software much easier to use than Nokia, Siemens or Motorola. k810 is also thinner than earlier k series, camera cover less lumpy, and phone feels very solid. Screen is very bright and sharp, and scratch resistant. I have a 1 GB card in it, so I never worry about filling it up with photos, mp3s, etc., phone connects to windows, mac and linux via (supplied) USB cable. Battery goes almost a week on a charge with steady use.
A long-time Motorola phone user now converted. Not only is this phone lightweight and amazing looking, it's feature packed.Pros:- Crystal-clear calling. No static and loud when needed.- The screen is amazing. The resolution is awesome. By far the best I've ever seen on a phone this size.- This phone is tiny; in a good way. Super-slim and tucks nicely in your pocket. Being that it's a slider, you'll never have to worry about pocket-dialing. :)- The software is very easy to navigate. This is nicely improved over the Motorola interface of my older RAZR.- The MP3 player rocks; no pun intended. The Walkman software lets you sort by Artists, Albums, Tracks, Playlists and more. This is light-years ahead of the my old RAZR's MP3 player. This one rivals any standalone MP3 device I've used.- The stereo headphones that comes with it include a 3.5mm adapter. While the included headphones sound great, this adapter gives you the flexibility to use your Bose, Shure or other stereo headphones. A very nice option.- Carbon grey and anodized blue color is slick; nothing else like it. The back side of the phone, when in the up position, is where the anodized blue metal is. Amazon doesn't show a photo of it. It is stunning.- Unlike "some" other sliders, the camera is protected and kept under cover when the slide is closed. This works great in keeping dust off the lens.- The 2.0MP camera is actually pretty good. It takes great outdoor photos.- I LOVE the fitness/step counter. It measures distance in steps and calculated miles along with the calories you've burned. It also keeps a daily average and each days results.Cons:- No 3G- Sony Proprietary Memory Stick Micro M2 versus easy to find and less expensive MicroSD- No LED Flash or Photo LightIn conclusion, if you are looking for a super-slim phone with great call quality and superb music capability, look no further. This Sony wears the Walkman name with pride.UPDATE 9/27/07: I bought a SanDisk SDMSM2-4096-A11M 4GB Memory Stick Micro (M2) and it works perfectly. 4GB of music!!!
I have used RAZR, PPC phone, and other "state of art" phones. I think this SE W580i is the best phone I've had. Of course, this is from my personal preference. I don't like big and heavy phone with short battery life time - like PPC phone. I don't and won't ever like text messaging or watching video over phone screen. But I like small and long-lasting device with multiple (and useful) functionalities. Following are what I found with the phone so far0. This phone is light and small enough for me to do running exercise with. Its size and weight do not bother my running at all. Handfree headset fits well in my ears so while running, any ear piece does not fall off from my ear.1. Memory Stick Micro (M3) slot with 4GB capacity to store any type of data. With 4GB memory stick micro (about $64 from Amazon) and bluetooth connectivity, the phone can act as wireless multimedia device with 4GB hard drive.2. 2M camera that is far from perfect but much much better and tolerable than 1M camera from usual phone. picture quality of 1M camera was too terrible to use it for any purpose. But 2M camera actually provides enjoyable and sharable(?) quality of the picture.3. Media player is very good. It automatically identifies album title, singer, and other info from MP3 and WMA - Yes it can also play Microsoft wma file. This means you don't have to subscribe anything or download/buy any software to convert your existing music files. You just connect phone to PC with USB adapter or bluetooth, and copy the files into the phone. That simple. About ringtones, as one of reviewer said, you have to make music file size less than 600K to use it as ringtone.4. handfree headset includes 3.5mm (mini plug) adapter. With the adapter, you can connect your W580i not only to any PC speakers but also to car audio system if your car has 3.5mm Aux Audio port. Luckily, my car has the Aux Audio port. I don't even use CD changer in the car any more. When I connect my w580i to the Aux Audio port, I can listen to thousands of songs in the small device.5. Battery life is surprisingly long. Talking life time is about 9 hours as advertised. As I frequently use bluetooth connectivity for various purposes, I always keep bluetooth on in the device. But unlike other phones, the bluetooth connectivity does not eat up battery life that much. In my case, full charge once a couple of days would be enough with bluetooth on.6. Internet browser has been much improved. It is still not Safari on iphone. It can only read WAP web sites, not normal web sites PC can display. But it has nice zoom capability and tolerable speed. Don't forget to subscribe a AT&T; Media.Net program - cheapest one is $10/Month. Otherwise pay-per-connection may cost you hundreds dollars after you download several files.7. Email software is automatically checking email arrivals and let you know.8. Voice Recorder is good enough to record a call session or a lecture.9. Yes, keys are not big but once you are used to them, it does not really matter.10. I love screen of this phone. It's bright and sharp. Still I don't like to watch TV on it but I love to see pictures taken with the phone on the screen.Briefly, this is poor man's iphone.  With 2 year contract with AT&T;, you can buy this phone from Amazon for 1 cent. The price and many functionalities I mentioned might be the reasons this phone is #1 bestseller in Amazon these days.
I have had several different phones over the years. I am a long time AT&T;, then cingular and now back to AT&T; customer. My own preference was to get an unlocked phone and not deal with the locked version (when i wanted to upgrade, the current selections sucked).I do agree with the previous remark on the keys. They are quite small and from the touch, seem delicate. I sometimes wonder if the keys cracking are due to pressing the keys with a finger nail vs the tip of your finger. Time will tell with this phone. I will remark later if any of my keys start cracking.The OS on this phone is very good, I used to have a nokia and liked the symbian OS, so this feels very similar to that. The Windows OS for the smart phone is not very good. Actually it was quite cumbersome, all the subscreens and white screens of death (oh yes, even the OS's they create for phones have this windows fault).Reception quality has been very good, the camera is ok (no standard flash like the other sony ericsson phones),the fitness feature is interesting (if you exercise enough), Internet Gui is still better the Windows OS version and the phone is very compact.This phone overall is good, not perfect (what phone is), it gets the job done and has the extra bells and whistles to keep you entertained at church.
Sony Ericsson W580i Gray Phone (AT&T;)I'm a former Motorola customer. My last phone was the RAZR. I recently purchased the Sony Ericsson W580i after reading several reviews. The size of the phone is comparable to the RAZR (with the RAZR folded) however I find the W580i more comfortable to hold when placing calls.This phone is feature packed. The MP3 player has a great interface and is easy to navigate. The shake to shuffle feature is also useful, just hold the walkman button and give it a quick shake, then voila a new song starts playing.The fitness feature is what sold me on the phone, over other MP3 capable phones. It keeps track of the steps you've taken in a day, and if calibrated (easy to do) keeps track of your distance and calories burnt also. There is a training log, and easy to use application to keep track of your training progress.The phone has the usual calendar and appointment reminder most phones have these days. But the W580i comes with software and a data cable to sync with your Outlook Calendar also. This is a great tool for those who are shy of needing a more powerful PDA, but could still use some help with weekly or daily reminders.The camera is decent, compared with the RAZR it is fantastic. I do believe there are better cameras out there, but my main concern was the MP3 player, and the camera was an added bonus.I could write forever about the many features and possible uses for this phone. It is easy to customize, looks stylish, good battery life, and so on. But on top of all this the most important part of a phone should be the phone. The W580i has great call quality and good call coverage. Even my callers claim they can hear me better. What more can you ask for?
Pros:MP3 Player with great sound with and without earbuds, comparable to standalone mps players I ownBluetooth built inInternet is fast2 Mega-Pixel camera with excellent quality photos and videosFitness application which counts steps, calories, and records progressHigh Resolution screenCamera protected in sliderLots of Lights giving a cool futuristic lookSlick look in generalShake and shuffle mode makes listening to your tunes easy and funMemory card allows up to 4 gb of songsVideo upload capablitiesLong talk time of 9 hoursGreat sound quality, the person on the other end of the phone sounds almost thereCons:I got mine last week and the 4 and 6 are cracked in half and the 7 is falling off also with little wear. The keys are made up of very thin plastic and crack if hit wrong; went to the AT&T; store to find the store model also has cracked keys.The keys not only break easily with minor usage but are very crammed and you will find yourself punching in more numbers then desiredThe screen also isn't very well protected and very exposed which will most likely lead to future damageThe whole body and frame is made of plastic and feels cheap and flimsyMemory card has to be a special one for sony phones only and are alot more pricey than the storage disk for competitor phonesNo flash on cameraBottom LineIf you aren't a perfectionist, texter, or cellphone gamer and are looking for a cheap phone with incredible technology and mp3 playback and don't mind if the phone is cracked up this is the phone for you. If you are one of the previously mentioned look to the new lg shine cu720 slider phone offering almost all of the same functions in a stainless steel body and keys. It may be more expensive but it is worth it. It was not in sony's best interest to produce such a top of the line phone from a technological stand point and then skimp on the materials, they should of charged a little more to make a more durable, less delicate phone.
Love the phone great reception battery life is less than the W300i Extremely easy to use well worth the 5 buck for the ericsson charger though
Original post from the end of August: (amazon wouldn't let me update the star rating for some reason so I had to repost...)I bought this phone as an upgrade for my W600i since cingular has such a horrible selection right now.  I've been a SE owner since they were Ericsson only and have had there phones go off roofs, get wet snowboarding and handle the dust of being a on construction site with no problem.  I'm having to send my phone back in because the keys on the keypad are cracking.  If you search on google apparently the first bunch that went out had a problem though getting their tech support to admit that won't happen, trust me, I tried twice.  What I get for being first in line I guess....Only 3 stars because for an upgrade they sure took away a few of the features of the 600 and some changes they did make should have been more up to the industry standard.Obviously the 600 was a rotating phone as compared to the 580 slider... so that in mind.....-On that note, my slider had a little bit of play in it, maybe it was cause I got a bad phone but that may be an issue later with the shake to shuffle feature.  That was pretty cool but all that shaking might shake it loose I'd be afraid.  Oh and You have to HOLD the walkman button for a couple secconds while in the walkman and then shake it a lil and it'll change.  Figured that one out thanks to the add-in flyer-manual wasn't any help on that one!!-The light from the camera that could be accessed independently of the camera function is gone.  I didn't use it that much but it was nice to have as a last resort.  Other half of that is this phone is MUCH lighter and half the thickness of the 600 so its a trade-off, I don't know where they would have put it.-The Instant Messenger software is gone but that may have been a cingular add-on because I had a locked phone.-The shortcuts on the Nav circle aren't as good because the camera is locked to the top position.  You can change the left, right and down to funtion whatever you want but this is ratehr annoying when I had my 600 set to write a new text when I hit the up part of the circle.  Why they didn't just put independent internet and camera buttons is beyond me.  You can access alerts from the menu or put that as a shortcut if you want.-The alerts button was convienient but much rather it eould have controlled the camera so I could over-ride what was on teh shortcuts at the Nav circle.-I couldn't figure out how to make the RSS feeds/updates work so anybody with experience on this feel free to comment back cause I'd love to know!-The M2 micro card expansion is nice but why not use the SD mini like every other co?  Besides its only good to 1 gig supposedly.-Walkman had no changes but the radio feature you can play over the speaker now.  still have to have the handsfree attached as an antenna, kind of pointless to have it play over the radio if you still have to have the cord of the handsfree attached.-Camera was a little better, should have been from a 1.3 to a 2.0MP now.  Its also one handed operation.  Bad part is unless you put it in panoramic mode you can't zoom in!-The lock feature is annoying.  If you end a call by sliding the phone shut, you then have to re-open it and slide it closed again to lock all of teh keys.-Call Clarity was great, little better then my 600 and seemed to hold a stronger signal.  That may have been because its an unlocked phone and my other was locked.-Big bonus points for downloading all of my internet and SMS/MMS settings when I first started up the phone.  Saved me time fighting with gettin the settings off the old one and possibly calling cingular which I was my only hesitation to getting an unlocked phone.They seem to have a problem with there keys on the W580i and 500 right now if you google it thanks to another reviewer.  Think I'll wait before I buy it again, even at that I'm hesitant after talkin to the customer service for SE who was almost rude and ademant that I broke the keypad when you can find it several places online that a SE spokeswoman admitted it was a problem and some shipments were stopped in transit because of the issue.  They could have done better overall but its a good phone for what your payin.UPDATE-10/12/07-JUST RECEIVED MY SECOND PHONE FROM AMAZON AFTER WAITING A MONTH HOPING THE ISSUE WITH THE KEYS SPLITTING WOULD BE FIXED.  KEYS STARTED SPLITTING AGAIN IN 3 DAYS USE!!!!  SAME AS BEFORE AND AS DETAILED IN OTHER REVIEWERS COMMENTS.  I WILL TRY AND POST THE COUPLE PICS I TOOK OF IT, YOU CAN'T TELL MUCH BUT LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE 4 AND 7 KEYS, YOU'LL SEE HOW THE SIDE OF THE KEY CLOSEST TO THE EDGE OF THE PHONE IS SHINIER THEN THE REST OF THE KEY. WHERE THE GLOSS STARTS IN THE MIDDLE IS WHERE IT SPLIT-PERFECTLY VERTICAL IN THE CENTER OF THE KEY.  CHECK OUT THE OTHER REVIEWERS COMMENTS FOR A BETTER PIC ON THE SAME PHONE EXCEPT WITH ORANGE KEYS IN A LINK.  ANYONE WITH THIS PHONE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IT IN A DARK ROOM AND CHECK, THE BACKLIGHT WILL MORE THEN LIGHT UP THE CRACK AND YOU CAN SEE IT IF YOU HOLD THE PHONE AT AN ANGLE TO SEE IT THE KEYS ARE LEVEL ON THE KEYPAD.  3 DAYS USE AND ABOUT 100 TEXTS WITH HARDLY ANY CALLING, WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK AND SONY STILL WON'T ADMIT TO THE PROBLEM AFTER A 3RD CALL TO THEIR TECH SUPPORT.I HAVE NO REASON TO RECCOMEND THIS PHONE AND WOULD ADVISE ANYONE NOT WANTING TO BLOW $300 ON A SHODDILY CONSTRUCTED PHONE TO WALK AWAY NOW. IF YOU CAN HANDLE LOSING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR PHONE, BE MY GUEST, WASTE YOUR $300.
Pretty nice phone.  Everything works well.  Highly recommended if you're a SE fan.
I bought this phone for my teenage son as a 2006 Christmas present and have no regrets.  One of his friends has a monthly plan and exceeded his monthly hours and was charged $150.  My co-worker's daughter exceeded her monthly hours and was charged $350.  If you don't want an unexpected, unwanted  additional phone overcharge go prepaid.Overall, my son really likes his phone and it takes good pictures.  He says the number 7 button sticks a little now but, the phone still works well.
I found the previous review by "tj" very inaccurate, so I decided to write my own.I've had this phone for over a month, and I LOVE IT!!I don't talk much on the phone, but I listen to music, watch video, take pictures, and send text msg with it a lot. I charge my phone maybe every three days. I think the battery last a very reasonable amount of time for the way I use it.The keypad might take awhile to get used to, but I am a keyboard person and I really love the QWERTY keypad. I can type pretty fast with this keypad (I used to think sending text msg was a pain because of the ABC keypad).I don't understand what the previous reviewer meant by "cannot download the pictures in a format that you could browse on your computer." The pictures are in standard format: .Jpeg. Of course it's readable on the computer. The video taken with this phone is in .3GP format. You can just google search K-lite mega codec and download the codec pack. Then you can play the video you take on PC. And the codec pack is free! Or if you think installing codec is too much, you can just download Quicktime. It's also free.When you buy the phone, there is everything you need inside the box, including menu and CD software.On the home screen, there are 15 shortcut spaces for you to put some "hard to locate" applications. For internet browser, I recommend Opera. It's way better than the one came with the phone. When I use internet, I always go to the connection (top left corner) to make sure I am connected to a wifi connection. So I never have a problem with it.The previous reviewer mentioned that his/her phone froze a lot. I think he/she just got a bad phone. My phone has only frozen once for this one and a half month. Compare to M600i, P1i is really tons faster and responsive. Everything is just so smooth.I love this phone because it's basically a small PDA with phone function. I can make to-do list. I can read pdf, doc, ppt, etc files. I can watch movies and videos on it. I can listen to music on it. I can use Skype. I can use messengers. For the music player, you can minimize it. So you can actually do something else on the phone while listening to music. There are pretty useful symbian and uiq softwares you can install onto the phone. The most I use is AED (advanced english dictionary). You can also download/buy game console emulator and play old games on the phone! Like GBA, NES, etc.I also bought a bluetooth receiver for my computer. So that I can connect the phone with the computer through BT, and it is VERY convenient. I can transfer all my files and photos within seconds. I do use card reader to transfer big files like videos since BT is not a fast way to do it.Now Sandisk makes 8gb M2 card and this phone supports it!There is only one thing to complain: I still can't get the PC Suite to work... But I can live without it.In a nutshell, P1i is a great phone. I don't think I will need to buy a new phone within the next three years :D
While it is true that the Nokia 6555 has very short battery life, it is common to all 3G phones.  However, there is a way to increase battery life: change connection type from UMTS to GSM from Auto.  This will disable 3G and force the phone into GSM mode, which will greatly increase battery life.Hope this works.
I bought this phone last week directly from the AT&T; store.  I renewed my existing contract with AT&T; so I already had their service.  I am very impressed with the phone overall.  It is sleek and stylish with a lot of features which work well.Pros:  Styling and Features  Call quality and signal strength  Micro SD card slot  Dedicated USB cable port  Dedicated headphone jack (albeit a small one so you still need an adapter)  Pin type connector charger (not the clip on connectors)Cons:  Battery Life  Lack of installed ringtones, (correction, see below)  Hard to navigate folders and menusI mostly use the phone to talk on and not much else.  I need to charge the battery pretty much every night.  I can go about a day and a half or 2 days if I stretch it.  If you talk a lot or intend to use the other features plan on charging it every night.  In their defense the battery life is rated at 3 hours of talk time and that is pretty much it.  You won't get more than that and like I said you won't get even that much if you do games or other stuff.  The other thing that was kind of disappointing was no ringtones installed except the standard ATT ring. (Correction).  There are a couple of ringtones installed I just wasn't looking in the right folder which is the biggest problem I have with it now.  The music hides in different menu folders and depending which menu you are in you won't see them which is why I didn't think there were any tones at first.  You pretty much have to download anything you want to play.I really like the phone and if the battery would last longer it would be about perfect.  Since all I do is use it for talking and not much else it suits me.I have had this phone for about 5 months now and still really like it.  I am not a tech wiz so I have not even used the music player and other features until recently.  I downloaded some ringtones from a 3rd party website and it was easy.  They play great.  Today I used the bluetooth capability to load pictures from my camera to my MacBook and also loaded a few songs onto my phone.  It was easy for a novice like myself. No compatibility issues.  Call quality and reception have been above average.  I fly all over the east coast and it works pretty much everywhere you would expect.
Just got this phone on Weds, as replacement for my old Nokia - I was looking for a phone that is reliable, easy to use, has texting capabilities, sleek, has a streamlined design, a loud alarm (I rely on my phone to wake me up), and takes clear pictures. This phone is compact, and performed well when I saw it at the Cingular store.BUT today, I experienced the worst battery life that a cell phone could have. After charging this phone to the max, I texted my friends, and talked for about 3 hours when the battery indicator showed that 1/4 of its capacity. Then, my phone died. Usually, I'd have at least 1 hour left to use the phone, with an indication of 1/4 battery. BUT NO! It just died, and luckily, I wasn't in a situation where I needed a phone (I was at home all day today). Everyday since I got this phone, I've had to charge it. Usually every 2 days I'd charge my old Nokia phone.I will be calling Cingular to ask for a replacement battery.
I replaced my Motorola L6 with this Nokia 6555. I liked the L6 except the keys were very small and close together, so I would sometimes hit the wrong key. Also, I had to lock the keys whenever I carried it so a key would not get pressed accidentally. What I needed was a flip phone with slightly larger keys and this Nokia was just the ticket.This cell phone has so many features that I will only list a few. First off, my friend just got a Samsung Blackjack II and this Nokia does almost all the same things that his does. They both have MP3, 3G, Bluetooth, internet access, camera, Micro SD memory ready, organizer, and more with services through ATT. As far as we can tell thus far is the only thing the Smartphones have the Nokia 6555 does not have is Microsoft Mobile Suite. The Blackjack keys are so tiny that I do not know how anyone can use them. Plus, the Blackjack cost much more. The better choice is by far the Nokia 6555.The only problem I am having is navigating the menus to find the settings I am looking for. I have to keep referring to the manual. I suppose after a while I will learn where everything is and memorize most of it.The battery life seems to be about average for a fully loaded cell phone. Maybe some day they will make batteries that last much longer for those power users that complain about short battery talk time. For now we just have to charge the battery more often. Not a big deal for me. If I plan to use the phone a lot, then I simply charge my phone and headset at night to have a full charge on both and I am ready to go the next day. If I do not use it very much, then I only have to charge them about every 3 or 4 days.Pros:Slim and stylish.Good sound quality.Many features.Cons:Menus difficult to navigate.UPDATE:Another con is the backlight only stays on for 10 seconds and there is no way to adjust it to stay on longer.
I have had this phone for almost a week, and unlike all others I have tried this on works in my home which has very poor cell service.  I would have to go outside to use other phones.  I tried a Razr and it would not even work well enough inside the house for it to wring in and I could run outside to take the call.  This phone works in my home!  It is clear and has not dropped a call!  As for battery it last a few days and it is a quick charge so I do not have a problem with that,,and since this is my only phone (no home phone) I am very satisfied with it so far.  That said I have a camera so that is just something that I would use in an emergency and don't care that much about rings, as long as it is loud enough and it is.  Some others may want all the bells and whistles but if you live or travel to a place with poor cell service this is YOUR Phone!  The sleek design is a plus!
I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my 3 year old Nokia 6230. I won't bore you with comparison trivia, instead I'll jump foward to the summary.Beautiful phone utilizing the latest wireless technologies hampered by poor power management in a rush to market.I am not a power user so a benchmark of 3 hours talk or 11 days standby should easily cover my usage. After talking as little as 10 minutes a day for two days the battery had to be recharged. Twenty minutes talk and two days standby is too high maintence for me.The call quality of this phone is the very best and cannot be distinguished from a land line call.After two visits to the AT&T; store - they swapped the first 6555 for another with a "special setting" - ??My new cell phone is the Nokia 6085 - rated at 5 hours talk or 10 days standby. I'm on my 5th day with 58 minutes talk and the battery icon is still displaying a full charge.... now I'm happy!
I got this phone two days ago. I have to charge the phone twice. After fully charged the phone last night, I only made one 15 minutes call, now the battery indicator shows the remaining power is only 1/3.Other than the battery, the phone is great, with good range -- I used to have Verizon with Motorola Krzr K1m, due to the poor receiption, I switched to ATT, and this phone has very good signal for me -- I can talk in any room inside the house without drop the call.The sound level is on the soft side.One plus is the phone book actually has address information in it also. While Motorola Krzr only allow phone number and email address.  It also can sync up with Outlook without purchase additional software.  I downloaded the PC sync suite, then using a PC bluetooth adapter, I was able to sync the phone with PC.But I don't like to charge the battery everyday.  With average 20 minutes calling, I expect the phone only need to be charged once a week.  Nokia gives me some extra daily work, that is not good.
I've been a hard-core Nokia-only user for years (my last 4 or 5 phones.) My old candy-bar style Nokia with a tiny screen was getting old, so when I heard about this hot new flip phone from Nokia that was the same size, I wanted it.  Well, I got it and it isn't that great.  The 320x240 QVGA screen is nice and clear, but the software and services for it are not up to par with the latest from Sony, etc. that my friends at work show me.The USB connector is "micro-USB" so I had to order a new cable since all my cables are "mini-USB" which is only about 1mm larger.  Also, it has the narrow charging port, so all my old Nokia chargers are worthless.  The headphone jack is also micro-sized.  Who has micro-headphones?I'm pretty technically inclined, but I can't figure out how to wirelessly transfer my pictures off this camera.  So the 2 ways to get pics off are to buy the micro-USB cable, or yank out the micro-SD-RAM chip.  I say yank because it is behind the battery, next to the SIM card.
Thanks to all the previous reviewers who helped me make the decision to choose this phone. Let me preface my review by saying I upgraded from a classic design $50 Tmobile Nokia that I bought two years ago and which had no fancy features but served me well. So I decided to go for a Nokia phone again and decided to buy the Nokia 6555 :)My verdict is I think its awesome and I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures, has a nice interface and is sleek and easy to manipulate (keys are great).Like previous reviewers, I was surprised that the battery doesn't necessarily last a day even with just phone usage since my previous basic phone had a battery life that lasted up to a week. However, after chatting to my friends (who thanked me for coming into the 21st century with my new phone), I discovered that most 3G phones have a short battery life.So in all, I am really happy with my upgraded phone and recommend it to any Nokia fans :)
I always associated Nokias with reliability and sensibly designed phones.  The 6555, however, has the worst battery life I have ever seen.  Even for someone who doesn't talk on the phone much, the battery cannot last through an average day at work. I have had it for two days and cannot bear it any longer. For their sake I hope Nokia pulls this phone from their product line before their reputation is irreparably damaged.
When I purchased the Nokia 6555b five days ago, the salesman recommended it based on my criteria that the phone have strong reception. When I buy a phone, I'm looking for...well...a phone. I don't need internet or an MP3 player.  This phone is a beautiful phone (I had the black and red version) and will slip into even a small pocket.  After purchasing the phone, I looked up the reviews.  You've probably read them....kind of disappointing and even scary. A battery charge lasted two days for me.  (Turning it on at 7:00 a.m.; off at 6:00 p.m.; with about 50 minutes of talk time/day)  I decided to take the phone back since 2 years is a long time to have a phone that begins with disappointing features.  The AT&T; service rep. took back the phone with no questions asked. Before I told the rep I was continuing with the service, she even asked if I wanted to cancel the 2-year contract. It was a pleasant exchange for a different model. I was in and out within 25 minutes.  I give AT&T; customer service 5 stars.
Bought this from AT&T; store and noticed that the battery life is way too short. Even with very moderate use the battery runs out quickly. I have to charge it every night, as it dies quickly.This is my first Nokia. I liked its other features such as the buttons and ease of navigation menus and browsing in general. Voice is loud and clear. It has a good display, bright even in daylight. It is light and just small enough for a phone. Doesn't drop calls.Well, inspite of al the above positive aspects, I will not recommend this to a friend because of the low battery life.Thanks
After the Sony I had needed replaced for the 4th time in a year and a half, I decided to get a new phone.  After reviewing the phones available and having a family member review the phones available, I decided to purchase the Nokia 6555.  I had previously had Nokia phones and had no problems with them.  The battery life is poor, but I can adjust to that.  However, I had my phone less than 10 days when the mini screen showed a crack in the LCD.  I had not dropped the phone, smashed the screen of the phone in any way, or gotten it wet.  The outside of the phone shows absolutely no damage at all.  When I called the AT&T; store where I bought the phone, they said the initial 30 day warranty that the store is supposed to provide for the phone does not apply to the LCD screens.  The  AT&T; customer service does not cover the phone for 30 days and will not cover the LCD either.  I am now supposed to pay the insurance deductible for a phone that is less than 10 days old.  Without the mini-screen, the outside called ID will not work along with the clock.  I don't know if I am more disappointed in the phone or the service I have received from AT&T.;
Everything that these other reviewers have said about the battery life being very short is absolutely true, but I haven't seen anything anywhere written about the horrendous sound quality of the ringtones! Not the (el lame-o) ones included on the phone; they sound OK. But if you download music ringtones (whether they are free or purchased), it sounds like GARBAGE. Incredibly distorted and waaaay too much high end, you won't often be able hear this one ring after adjusting the EQ to sound halfway decent. If you leave the EQ in any of the normal modes (rather than customizing it), it sounds like an AM radio turned up all the way...only without the volume. I actually thought that my speaker was blown and exchanged it for a new one (another NEW one, not a refurb), and it sounds just as crappy. All this added to the short battery life, which I wouldn't have minded at all if the sound quality had been better, makes this a "no-go"!
I love this phone.  It does everything that I want.  But the data cable is not available, even from Nokia.  You will need a bluetooth-capable pc or a bluetooth dongle in order to download your photos.
I purchased the nokia 6555 just 3 days ago. The phone dies after just 1 hour of talk time, not even using the multimedia package. Also, the phone heats up to the point it is hard to touch. After reviewing the specs on the phone I find out it emits HUGE amounts of radiation compared to phones of similar caliber. The radiation is believed to drain the battery and make the phone hot to the touch. An AT&T; sales associate warned me not to use the phone when it is hot because it may EXPLODE, yet they are not willing to exchange the phone. Again, I only purchased the phone 3 days ago. I have never experienced such poor customer service. I have been with cingular for many years and now that they are AT&T; this is the first time I have ever experienced a problem.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE. It is not safe for you or anyone you love. Even if it didn't get hot, the battery life alone makes the phone pointless.
Incredible Machine. 100% with all features. I can listen "stereo" music with my HT820 bluetooth. HTC Rules!
UPDATE (12/8/2008): I NO LONGER recommend this phone.  I have had it for 1 year, 2 months now and during that time I have experienced several quality issues.  While one of them (the ear speaker died) may have been isolated to my unit, I also had my keypad crack twice.  This seems to be a common issue with this model, just search online.  I had to send in the phone twice for warranty repairs, but my warranty has run out.  Now, the left soft keys have stopped working.  Another search revealed this to also be a common flaw, which can be resolved by pushing on the area between the navigation keys and the LCD screen (where there is either the W logo or the at&t; logo).The bottom line though is that this phone has some serious quality flaws and therefore I do not recommend purchasing this model anymore.  I would change my rating to 2-stars since the phone is still a very nice slider design with excellent software/interface.I will leave my original review below if you would like to read it.------------------------------------------------------------------------I am a fan of Apple's products.  But since I'm locked into a T-Mobile contract, I did not join in on the iPhone frenzy.  Yet, I was in need of a good phone with a decent camera.  I was impressed by my friends' different Sony Ericsson phones, so I took a trip down to the Sony Style store and checked out the models they had there.  Among the models, this one stood out immediately thanks to the slider design.  I was hooked.  The interface for the phone is very nice to use BUT it does take some getting used to if you're switching from Samsung, Nokia, or Motorola.  For example, if you're used to green and red phone keys, this phone does not have them.  But several days and many mispresses later, you should get the hang of the interface.  The call quality is pretty good; not perfect though, as sometimes the person on the other end sounds muffled.  Then again, they could be holding their phone too close to their mouth.  But no one has complained that they couldn't hear me, which was common w/ my previous phones.  Bluetooth works very well with the phone; I've been able to sync with both my windows and mac computers.  With mac, iSync (under Mac OS X 10.4) does not support this model but you can Google for a plug-in, which worked perfectly for me.  I have tested the walkman feature, which is quite good.  The only catch is that you have to use the handsfree dongle to connect standard headphones.  The most interesting feature is that the phone counts the number of steps you make in a 24-hr day, and had an application to analyze how many miles you have walked in a day, etc.  It's pretty neat, but I think it may be inaccurate.  I walked what I counted to be 100 steps, but the phone counted 120.  You can calibrate the function, though.  Finally, regarding the design of the phone: you may notice in the picture that the phone is not straight, and sort of curves in the bottom.  This curve is actually helpful for sliding the phone open with one hand.  But it does not really get in my way when I keep the phone in my pocket or on a desk, in case you are worried about that.Overall, this is a great phone and I hope it will last me a while.  I'd highly recommend this phone, regardless of if you're already a Sony Ericsson user or you're switching, like I did.
A long-time Motorola phone user now converted. Not only is this phone lightweight and amazing looking, it's feature packed.Pros:- Crystal-clear calling. No static and loud when needed.- The screen is amazing. The resolution is awesome. By far the best I've ever seen on a phone this size.- This phone is tiny; in a good way. Super-slim and tucks nicely in your pocket. Being that it's a slider, you'll never have to worry about pocket-dialing. :)- The software is very easy to navigate. This is nicely improved over the Motorola interface of my older RAZR.- The MP3 player rocks; no pun intended. The Walkman software lets you sort by Artists, Albums, Tracks, Playlists and more. This is light-years ahead of the my old RAZR's MP3 player. This one rivals any standalone MP3 device I've used.- The stereo headphones that comes with it include a 3.5mm adapter. While the included headphones sound great, this adapter gives you the flexibility to use your Bose, Shure or other stereo headphones. A very nice option.- Unlike "some" other sliders, the camera is protected and kept under cover when the slide is closed. This works great in keeping dust off the lens.- The 2.0MP camera is actually pretty good. It takes great outdoor photos.- I LOVE the fitness/step counter. It measures distance in steps and calculated miles along with the calories you've burned. It also keeps a daily average and each days results.Cons:- No 3G- Sony Proprietary Memory Stick Micro M2 versus easy to find and less expensive MicroSD- No LED Flash or Photo LightIn conclusion, if you are looking for a super-slim phone with great call quality and superb music capability, look no further. This Sony wears the Walkman name with pride.Note: I recently bought a SanDisk SDMSM2-4096-A11M 4GB Memory Stick Micro (M2) and it works perfectly. 4GB of music!!!
I've been wanting a mp3 player and thinking about getting one (how much would I really use it...would it be hard to work with?). When I saw this cute little phone, with a 2 mega-pixel camera...AND ORANGE keys...well, I just had to have it!This is my second sony-ericsson phone. I just gave my old one to my kids (which the vice principal now has locked in his office...long story). My kids have their own line now. My old phone is still going strong. Only bad thing is, my kids now have all my favorite games.I have to say the interface and software on the Sony Ericsson phones is very easy to learn. I also love that I can synch my outlook calendar and contacts onto my phone. I could synch it using blue tooth wireless if I wanted to, but I use the USB cable. I was curious about the blue tooth thing, though, so I paired my new phone with my old phone and sent one of my contacts to myself. Surprisingly, it worked! By the way, who named this technology "blue tooth" and why?It has very clear sound on phone calls. I noticed it right away. I'm actually slowly going deaf,I think. My four children are definitely to blame, I'm sure. Anyway, if you are going deaf, this phone is great. My calls are noticeably clearer than my old phone.I tried listening to the music on my walk this morning and it was very nice. Finally, the dog is old enough not to pull me through the neighborhood at 90 mph! Of course my son wanted to go along too. Never mind that it was six in the morning. What 10-year-old is up at 6 a.m.? MINE! Anyway, the music was great.One problem I had was the computer doesn't recognize my phone in the file transfer mode. So the disc-to-phone software doesn't work. Bummer! But I found a work-around. Yeah! But it doesn't always work. A[...] I connect the phone in the phone mode (sounds redundant until you actually see it). Then I open the file manager, find the memory stick, find the file that says "music" and I drag and drop my music in there. The user manual says that the phone is Windows Media Audio (WMA) compatible, but sometimes it is and sometimes not. Apparently, it's not the phone, it's that some music is encoded differently than others. Still, I got my Simon&Garfunkel; on there, and I'm good. It's also compatible with MP3, MP4, 3GP and more. Music is getting worse than Greek. I remember when I had to choose between a 45 or an albumn (yes, spelled with an 'n').Okay, I think I'm done now. I'm very happy with the phone and with the Sony-Ericsson people who talked with me no less than 4 times in one day, while trying to help me learn how to get music onto my phone. They were extremely helpful, polite and patient.Oh, the pictures are really good too! Oh, an it comes WITH everything! (earbuds, charger, usb cable). It's hard to find a case for it though. Okay, that's it, finally. I'm going to find an MP3 version of Mama Mia!
I loved this phone.  It worked great with my network tmobile. Relatively fast internet connections and email.  Very easy to use.  PDA was great so I tossed my palm pilot.  I purchased this phone and had for approx. 1 yr before it was stolen.  Loved the touch screen and the clear cover to protect the screen.  My insurance company replaced my a1200 with the tmobile MDA...yuk!  Unlike the MDA this phone is small and light weight because of the clamshell design my cheek doesn't accidentally disconnect or mute my calls like the MDA.  The buss. card reader is a great time saver it will scan and store info in your contacts....no more losing other people's business cards!  Voice  recognition  works well.  I loved how easy it was to use.  It's built well...pretty tough I could never find a good cellphone cover for it and it held up really well being tossed in my purse and even dropped it a few times and it never got a scratch.  The stylus is sturdy and easily accessible.  The 2meg camera is great for pictures and videos outside or in bright lights but has no flash....it's one major downfall, that and the phone had a few  applications that I was unable to  use, do to language barrier (some of them in chinese)that's why only 4 stars.  My contract is up with tmobile and am looking to purchase another a1200 in red.  Red was the color no one wanted about a year ago and now it's the one that costs extra.....they're calling it special edition red now!  Go figure.
I received this phone about 3 weeks ago.  I can say, this phone is unlike any phone I have ever had.PROS:  Touch screen display.  PDA applications in a small design.  Very easy to use.  Very unique, I get asked all the time "where did you get that phone."CONS:  If you have multiple applications running, it does have have a tendency to be a bit slow.  The red case is very appealing, however it displays a LOT of fingerprints.  The red case is not rubber like the black one.  It is a monochromatic case.  You have to have a special earphone adapter for the earphone jack.  IT WILL NOT TAKE A NORMAL EARPHONE JACK!!!!I do a lot of overseas traveling, and the phone hasn't let me down yet.  I have my service through AT&T; and I have not lost the signal yet.  I did however get a signal booster, so that might have helped a lot.  Overall, I love this phone.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm picky when it comes to the CONS, but if you can look past those, I'm sure you will enjoy this phone.
had just minor problems to set the internet connection but at the end it works goodi recommend it to all
I bought this phone in purple - in support of pancreatic cancer awareness and because I wanted a quad band phone.It is nice to look at, has a nice "feel", but the features are basic.There is very little you can do with it in terms of the telephone aspect of it.  I guess it is great for photos, especially since it has the photo editor. The screen is the best feature on this phone. It is big and performs well even in direct sunlight (a plus for the camera users). After 6 photos which I transferred from my Nokia I was told that the memory was full.  My Nokia 6320 has loads of photos and music on it.With regard to ringtones, you'd probably have to buy the memory card, or stick with what they have on the phone.  I was not too enthusiastic about the ringtones the phone came with.  I like naturelike sounds and classic ringtones.  I read a review which said that Sony was targetting the younger folk (I am 45), so that accounts for the type of ringtones and graphics which are embedded in the phone.The slide mechanism is sturdy, as is the keypad.  The slits which represent the select and menu buttons can be a tad difficult if you have long nails, or large fingers (again the target was young folk).The downsides are that the vibrating mechanism is weak and for some reason unknown to me, after 45 minutes of talking on it, the phone cuts off.
This phone has a photo editor on it. You can turn your photos into black and white, has brightness and contrast, and you can send them to the internet. This phone works great with a Cingular SIM card. The only bad thing is that this phone is European, and doesn't support ringtone downloads, and I'm not sure how to make it support it yet. I am just going to have to play around with it.Lookswise...it's lightweight. It's really cute. I would say it's more of a girly phone, but's it still very high end looking. The more I play around with my phone, I love it even more, and It's so user-friendly. My last phone was a Razr....glad to have upgraded.
This review won't be the highly technical sort that you might read on Amazon and other sites.  This will be pretty simple and straight forward.This is a nice phone.  It does anything and everything you could imagine a cell phone could do...and then some.  As an avid user of a Treo (Palm) for years, I was ready for a new handset, and my new job required a Windows Mobile platform.  After quite a bit of study, I made the switch to the HTC TyTN II...with no regrets thus far.The description will give more detail than I could ever give, so suffice it let me highlight a few things:1> Is a great PHONE. So many of these PDA phones forget what they are first and foremost. While I really liked the form and function of the Palm OS on my Treo, it left a lot to be desired in it's ability to catch and hold a signal. This TyTN II does that really well.  Perhaps it's a bit of a carrier issue too, but I've had very few dropped calls in the 2 weeks I've had it.2> The internal GPS works really well.  If you're all about reducing the number of "things" that you carry with you, you've now got a very capable GPS strapped to your belt.  Is it as feature rich as a stand-alone GPS? Probably not, but I downloaded the TomTom 6 maps of the US and Canada and it works great.3> It has a cool feature that lets you take a photo of a business card, and then export that to your contact list with fields populated.  Kinda cool and works pretty well.I recommend this phone highly. It's a few bucks, but if you rely on your phone as a business tool like I do, it's worth the money.
This is a great phone/pda.I recommended previos version of that phone HTC Wizard to couple my friends and now they threw away their pdas and only use this type phones. The only couple negative things (minor ones) about this phone are1) When using GPS batter dies very fast. I'm talking the entire batter will be dead within couple hours of using gps so if you want to use GPS on that phone you better buy car charger.2) Speaker is not as loud as on previos versions of that phone. For example HTC Wizard had 2 speakers this one has only one and it's very small. I wish HTC made the speaker on it a little bit more powerful. It's really hard to hear if somebody is calling so I have to use both vibrate and sound just in case.Other then that the phone is great.
The phone itself is great. Lot of features and nice looking. But Amazon's version does not list Cingular or T-mobile as a selected carrier. End up I have to return the phone.
Just got it. And these are the problems:-Keypad buttons are too hard to press, i have a sore on my thumb already.-Equalizer settings on MP3 player go to default each time I start the application. Very annoying!-No capability to work with files like on  W810i before. Files have very limited  options to assign.-Flash in the camera sometimes goes weak, so the pictures are very dark.  Other than that the phone is good, i like the sensor buttons on the bottom of the screen. But i need to get rid of it. Unless they release the firmware that will correct all the bugs. I think i can leave with the sore on my thumb, women might find it a trait of masculanity. Lol.
Bought this phone from Flashiso via Amazon.  I wanted the blue but I received the green model.  Great photos, full frame video lots of extras for the price.  The phone MSS and Internet had to be unlocked by Sony though, in order to use it on AT&T.; Touch screen works well but not as multi-functional as the Iphone. Make sure you get a case and the 4Gb micro card for extra files.
Actually, I bought this phone by mistake, since I thought it wouldn't be shipped all the way to Colombia, but it did (in less than seven days). To this point I had only bought books through Amazon and in trying to buy other products had failed due to shipping restrictions, although Amazon and its reseller E-tronics came through this time. Great job guys.Ok, down the brass tax: the Nokia N73 ME is a complete multimedia experience, camera, music player, and yes a phone, complete with all the extras, which led me to sell my old iPod just last week. And since I didn't own a camera, it was fantastic. The camera works great (for a phone), although, you have to become a wiz at adjusting all the settings it comes packed with for your picture to come out great in environments with little light. I'm totally psyched with it, shooting everything that moves. The Symbian OS is well designed and pretty robust, supporting any kind of application you might find.The only downside is that at the beginning it was a little slow while browsing in between applications. But you can fix this problem by downloading the Nokia Software Updater which allows you to update your phone's firmware. I updated my N73 with the latest version (v.4.0727.2.2.1) and the problem was solved, along with dozens of other bugs. And in sync with the Nokia PC Suite it's like having your office in your pocket. Really it is.OK buddy, that's it for now. Hats off to Nokia for making an awesome phone. Your bank account might get pissed off, but your life will most definitely improve: your life in there. Oh, and the best of all is that my childish and unfounded need for the coveted iPhone is now gone. Righty Oh!
Screen hard to see for 'older' eyes. Be aware that about 2 weeks after activating Net 10 phone I began getting calls from another cell phone provider on a daily basis. When I stopped answering the calls, I began receiving text messages, which automatically deducts from your usage time. Didn't set up voicemail for this reason.
I had no problem with the phone no problem with the service.  You get what you paid for with prepaid.  I always click the end when I end a call, instead of just closing the lid.  Had Virgin Mobile since the beginning, never had a problem with phones and when I swapped a phone and did not get credit called them and they quickly rectified the situation.
PROMISED BATTERY NOT INCLUDED TWICE!!  BOTH PHONES RETURNED IN SAME PACKAGE.  (I DIDN'T DISCOVER THE MISSING BATTERY ON THE FIRST PHONE UNTIL AFTER THE PACKAGE WAS THROWN OUT.)  I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE REFUND.IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE FOUND THE SAME PHONE (I PAID ALMOST $30) FOR $20, AND BOUGHT ONE FOR $9.00.  YOUR PRICE WAS NOT THE BARGAIN SUGGESTED BY YOUR AD.LORET EGELSTON
WARNING!!! IF YOU TEXT A LOT THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU!!! Having said that, let me say that I had been looking at this phone for a very long time. One of the most common comments/complaints that you will read is that it is "hard to use" or that the spinner is "impossible to text with". The first objection is easily overcome. If you approach this unique phone with the knowledge that it's user interface is utterly different then any other phone you've had, then learning to use the Navi-spinner is actually fun. Now, that being said, it is true that texting with this phone is a real pain. Even if you get quite fast/good with the navi-spinner it is still difficult. So, common sense should tell you that texting without a keypad is not easy. So buying this phone and expecting to text a lot with it is digging your own grave. So what's the trade off? How about a phone that looks like absolutely nothing else out there? The mirror surface is fascinating...the navi-spinner lights are amazing...people can't believe that it's a phone! Call clarity is awesome, and the design can't be beat. Worth every penny as long as you know what the shortcomings are.
This phone is wonderful and shiny.  unfortunately, it is impossible to actually have conversations on it.  The battery life is good for about 1 30 min. call, and then needs to be recharged.  it is very shiny, though.
This is a cool phone but be careful because Amazon will send you a Chinese version, not an English version like they have in the picture. I ordered from Amazon because I thought that they would not do this sort of bait and switch like you see on ebay. Unfortunately I was wrong to trust them.

I purchased this phone and a 2 gig micro SD card for it.  For some reason, I can't view images saved to the memory card (although I can play music from it).  I called Samsung, and was told that they don't support phones that aren't "manufactured in the US."  Come on, nobody manufactures cell phones in the US!  They refused to offer my any support or hints on where I could get support, other than "search the internet."  I had searched the net, and found many issues regarding Samsung phones and SD memory cards.The documentation is missing information on several of the phone's features.  If you're in the market for an unlocked phone, then you're probably technical enough to figure the features out on your own, but if not, sorry, no help from Samsung.
Samsung U600 is an impressive slim slider cell phone which is a member of the Samsung Ultra Edition II range. It is available in many attractive colors which include white, black, garnet red, and gold and is loaded with great features like a 3 megapixel camera, high-speed web connectivity and extensive multimedia and audio capabilities.The most impressive feature about the Samsung U600 is the extremely large high-resolution  screen, especially considering that this phone is only 11 mm in thickness. The large sized screen makes it easier to view documents, pictures, and videos.Samsung U600 is designed to manage a large amount of media files; it comes with a 60 MB of shared memory and also includes a microSD slot to provide the maximum amount of storage space needed by its user.Samsung U600 cell phone uses Java technology  to enable you to enjoy many interactive, vibrant games, which can be downloaded and stored  directly to the handset, it allows you to use your favorite MP3 tracks as your ring tone. The loudspeaker level is very high and can be heard in the noisiest place.The Samsung U600 comes with an integrated music player which can play all popular music formats, to enjoy a rich music experience The Samsung U600 can also be used as a voice recorder.Bluetooth technology allows the Samsung U600 to communicate with other Bluetooth devices such as headsets, laptops and digital cameras without any wires, within a range of 10 meters.It has also a USB connection which allows you to connect to compatible USB devices when Bluetooth® connectivity is not possible.I definitely vote for the Samsung U600 as the most impressive and stylish world phone.
I was contemplating buying the Nokia N95 8G, but when I saw the specs for this phone I changed my mind - mainly due to the use of microsdhc memory cards on the N82.  Although the phone only shipped with a 2G card, I theoretically could expand up to 8G at the present time, and possibly higher when flash memory is developed further.I guess the phone doesn't look all that interesting - silver on silver, candybar style, average size screen - but at the same time it certainly isn't an eyesore.  Go to Nokia for the full specs, but I thought I'd mention a few things I've found handy over other phones of the same ilk.1.  Sliding lens cover protection.2.  GPS, with added voice nagivation.  Voice does come at a price, but in the scheme of things it's negligible.  I'm not sure text-to-speech is available for this model, and I haven't been able to download it as yet.3.  Having the speakers on one side makes it easier to listen to music or videos - although it should be noted this phone will not stand up on its own, it needs something to rest on.4.  3.5mm generic headphone jack on top of unit.5.  Music sounds great through headphones, car cassette etc.  A nice touch is that if you happen to be playing music in the car through, say, a cassette adapter and the phone rings, you can answer the call using the car's sound system, hang up, and the music will resume, gradually increasing to previous volume - nice touch.6.  Excellent 5mp camera with Xenon flash, plus front vga camera for self-portraits etc.  Of course there's the usual slideshow functions, zooming, emailing.7.  3G networking.I guess the only real glitch I've experienced thus far (only had phone for 5 days) is getting my iTunes ACC encoded songs onto MusicPlayer.If you use the PC Suite software that comes on CD, you'll need to download WMP 11, as there's an issue with protected files.  To do this you'll also have to download Microsoft's Genuine Advantage Support (WGA) -which I wasn't that keen on.The way around this problem is quite simple.  Instead of using PC Suite when loading songs, use Data Transfer.  No probs with protection, WGA etc. Music goes on seamlessly and sounds great.If I feel the need to add anything further on the N82, I'll update at a later time.  All in all, I think one of the best phones of its type on the market today.
A common complaint relating to this phone is the lack of a graphical interface.  The e-paper display limits the phone to alphanumeric characters and a few symbols.  The 8 character display is at times inconvenient, particularly for sending text messages and navigating through the phone book.I find the voice features to more than compensate for its deficient display.  The speaker and microphone function superbly.  If volume ever becomes problematic, the speakerphone is quite loud.One of Motorola's marketing points is prolonged battery life (compared to other phones) because of e-paper's low power consumption.  I would subjectively rate battery life to be "excellent."  The only trouble is the long charging time.  On an up note, the charging port is a cylindrical plug, which I have found in my experiences to be more durable than clip-type connectors, which tend to wear and fail over time.One small annoyance with the phone: from a dead boot (i.e. take the battery out/in and power on)...  The phone's clock seems to be completely internal.  Unlike other phones which retrieve time from the network, the phone always asks you to input the date and time (which is lengthier than one might like).  The phone has a voice-help feature, which audibly dictates menu functions (e.g. "send a message"  "read a message"  when the corresponding icons appear on screen).  This feature can be disabled, but also resets and resumes from a dead boot.  Therefore, one should silence the phone rather than turning it off.Overall, this phone functions hassle-free to make and receive voice calls.  Any other features like text messaging and alarm clock are slightly inconvenient to access.  Personally, 90% of my mobile phone activity is voice calls.  The lack of texting, camera, games, and the like are no bother to me.
This phone is hard-to-find-common-sense approach in design and technology. I have never seen better phone.  This is not a gadget that makes your life miserable because you need to worry every day that batteries are charged or you need to spend 1/2 day on setup or figuring out why current  time does not show on screen. If you need features behind phone, get Apple iPhone if you need just a cell phone, get Motorola F3.
The F3 is probably the most sensible phone made by Motorola. All it does is phone things. It's not an mp3 player, nor does it pull email or control a TV. It - now get this . . rings!It's unassuming in design as well as function. At perhaps 1/8th of an inch thick, I can't feel (nor sometimes find) it in my pocket. The speaker phone is plenty loud, although options a little clumsy. Battery bar hasn't budged in four days,receptions good, and it keeps time. I'm sure you've already read other reviews, so I'm not going to elaborate about the "Space 1999" screen. Welcome to the future. . .It's only been about a week since I got it, but I'd buy another one. This is a great no-frills phone. I have a Thinkpad, and it's designed as if it's an afterthought to the Z61. . . Oops! Forgot the phone. There it is. . .we should find a way to get this stuff here in the USA.
Inexpensive, flexible (not locked to any carrier), and functional.  If you're looking for a backup GSM phone, or an inexpensive way to get an "emergency-only" cellphone for someone, look no further.  If you're shopping for a primary phone for yourself and don't need all those frilly MP3 and camera and data features that just tack on cost, this is the phone for you.I purchased one for my brother who still doesn't have a cellphone, just for emergencies.  We set him up with a prepaid account on one of the two major American GSM carriers, with $100 credit so that the phone will last for a year before he needs to worry about "recharging" it (the one scam with prepaid phones, if you're not going to be using it much -- you need to put more cash on the account every N months or it expires; typically N=3, but currently N=12 if you put enough on at once.  This is a flaw with the carriers, not this particular phone).  We opted to get this phone, rather than one of the carrier's phones, because frankly this phone is a much better choice for the expected use than anything offered by the cellular operators themselves.He hasn't gotten it yet as of this review (it IS a Christmas present after all), but I'm in love with the phone enough that I'm tempted to order a second as a backup for my Samsung A747.  It's designed to do a few basic things, and it just works.  Practical design in a cellphone -- who'd have thought?
I've had this phone for almost a year now. I love the looks and the feel of the phone but it does leave a bit to be desired. The worst thing so far is that the case cracked towards the top so the back cover now easily comes off. I'm not even sure how this happend. It's never suffered a hard fall or anything of that nature.Another issue I have is the volume for both the ring tones and during voice conversation. I'm only 35 and still have decent hearing but even on it's loudest settings, I have a hard time hearing it ring or hearing the person on the line when there is minimal background noise.The phone offers basic functionality which should be sufficient for those who aren't looking for an all-in-one device. I just use my phone for voice and an occassional text message and picture so the functions are fine for me. Those younger folks more into the cell phone craze may be disappointed with basic features.Overall I like the phone for the looks and feel. If I had to do it again, I'm not sure I'd make the same purchase.
I received the phone and it looked in excellent condition, however it never works.  For every 5 calls that come in, it shuts down or displays enter SIM card.  Very frustrating, I am going to attempt to contact the vendor for either a refund or a new phone.
Motorola V360 is an excellent MP3 player, and a cell phone, too. This tiny little phone has extremely large number of features, such as camera, ring tones, calendar, Bluetooth, mini USB, memory card placeholder, and lot more exciting goodies. Creating a ring tone from my composed MIDI file was easy, just copied the file into the phone, and that's all. I bought this cell phone with a headset and data cable. With USB cable I can connect the phone directly to my computer running Windows operating system. Synchronizing music with Windows Media Player is a click! The Media Player recognizes the phone right away when it is connected. You can also use Bluetooth connection to connect the phone to the computer or other peripheral. The computer software that comes with the data cable is outstanding. I can now write short messages using my keyboard, and more! V360 really is worth buying. It's small, lightweight and has huge number of features!
This phone was bought used as a temporary "el-cheapo" for use during international travel. Though locked and useless in the USA, it was cheaply and easily unlocked by the Motorola dealer once in a country where locking phones is illegal.From then on, it worked great, with good battery life even on an old battery and stronger signal in weak areas than most other phones. I was sorry to have given it away when going to the USA - it took me a while to find a handset I likes as well.
What's good: Excellent design and weight.What's bad: Poor diary without many fields for information
My husband told me many times Motorola phone was no good but I did not believe it. Last month I lost my three-year old Samsung A670 so I bought a Motorola KRZR K1 because it was pretty-looking. A month later, my phone quited working, went to the local store and found the battery was dead. Plus, charging by computer function was never working with either my laptop or desktop. Maybe I got a lemon, and the customer service with Verizon was excellent, but I will never get another Motorola phone again
I bought my krzr through amazon. It looked like a cool phone with impressive features for its size however upon receiving my krzr it became extremely clear that motorola didn't put enough thought into its design or at least who the target market was. The phone is not ergonomically designed for a male hand unless you're under the age of 13. Moreover the glass finish on the front panel is far too delicate to be practical. If u are a normal human being you will scratch, break or in some way damage the face of this phone. This phone may however be perfect for people suffering from OCD and will treat the phone like a newborn. In conclusion I regret purchasing this phone the razr series is much nicer and I would recomend to anyone considering this phone to invest in a razr instead
Ok so the iPhone is incredible. It seems to be years ahead of its competition. Like imagine in 1998 a motorola razr being availible, where what would phones look like now? Will this iphone is the same analogy, imagine the iphone in 2007 where would we be now. This phone will set a precedent to many companies, that they have to raise their bar. Ok so the review:Design: 5/5- cant complain about the glass and aluminum which makes the devie surprisingly thin and very light.Functions: 4/5 I would like there to be a flash player meaning i can watch trailers and other things like that use video on a website.Battery: 2/5- battery is horrific. Dont expect to be able to listen to your music, browse the web and talk at the same time. If you listen to your ipod and browse the web at the same time, the battery is draining exponentially. And when it reaches the 20% mark it seems like theres only 5 minutes of battery life left no matter what you are doing with the iphone. The battery issue is a huge problem and hopefully when i send it back to apple they will have invented a much better battery for its users. I would say that if you use your iphone's ipod 2 hours a day, and browse the web 2 hours (including email), and talk for about 2 hours you pretty much used up all the battery has to offer. This means charging the phone nightly. The more you charge, the weaker the battery gets. Now if you talk lets say for 1 hour listen to music for 1 hour and browse the web for 1 hour, you'll still need to charge daily because overnight the battery will still drain because the phone never really shuts off when its on stand by. If you do shut it off at night though, you probably wont have enough battery to go through the next day anyways. It seems like the first 50% used is twice as long as the last 50% used.All in all the phone saves plenty of room in my pants and is a great phone and practical. Careful walking around with it on your belt. Its probably the #1 desired item for pick pockets right now. However dont forget that the battery is atrocious and offensive that they couldn't give us a battery as strong as other pda's. But enjoy it while it has power.
Don't expect to replace your iPod with an iPhone if you do anything other than listen to your iPod through headphones.Between the odd, recessed headphone plug that only accommodates apple ear buds, the fact that you can't manually manage music, and the inability to play tracks that are on your iPhone through a computer that it is connected to, the iPod features of the iPhone are seriously crippling.
I am shocked! Didn't anyone test this thing before they put it into production?So when I use the phone and bump the touch screen on my face it activates the end call command on the bottom and hangs up.The internet is slower than molasses, the Icons need to be pressed with a finger much smaller than mine or else you press 2 at once and if you have any oils on you face or maybe makeup too, you will have to clean the screen after very use or you will just see a blurry screen. I am glad I got to try it first.
The ipone is a new, cool, and amazing product. im not saying its bad, but apple has already has the fifth generation iphone in plans. i dont see why you should get this product unless u are willing to loose money. FYI im a proud apple user and all apple products are genius.
Why is there even a listing for the iphone in Amazon if it is not offered?
I bought two C139's from the TracFone site.  140mn/6mo [with online activation] for $19.99 seems like a pretty good deal.  Excellent coverage nationwide - no dropouts for any major city or Interstate.  One-touch int'l calling does work at the same rate for local calls - you just need to register the numbers online and add the 800 redirect numbers to your phonebook.  Phone features are basic but intuitive, and the audio is first rate.  If your cell use is modest or you need a phone for the road without roaming charges or coverage issues, this one's a good bet.  Can't comment on customer service since I never needed it and hopefully never will.
The phone may work fine but the company managing it is awful!! Get ready to waste all your minutes on 611 calls. (Unlike other companies 611 customer service calls are not charged as actual phone units.)Took forever to get to customer service, which is not properly trained and cannot understand plain English (some do some don't).Charged me for calls not connected etc...Really disappointed.. I lost close to 60 not so cheap units in a customer service call and they did not take care of the issue. I could not make international calls like advertised in their website. Really sad. With Tracfone  you really get what you pay for...that is their motto and that is the reality....
