I've owned my Samsung e105 for over 2 years now and it still works great.  Moreover, it went THROUGH THE WASHER AND DRIER two days ago.  I gave it 48 hours to dry on top of my CRT monitor and turned it back on today without any problems!

For quite a while T-Mobile required a $100 purchase to get a 12 month duration on their service. As I live in a rural setting on the opposite side of a large hill from any local cell tower and I don't get good coverage from any carrier, I don't use this phone that much and when I called T-Mobile to add minutes to the card, the customer service person recommended that I not buy the $100 refill but the $50 one. He explained that once you've bought the $100 card, T-Mobile will let you get the full year of minutes for any refill amount. The rate I'm now paying is higher per minute but I since don't use that many minutes I am actually paying less.Since T-Mobile has the most flexible and lowest rate pay-as-you go plan I certainly recommend this card to anybody needing fewer minutes than with a monthly plan.Also, T-Mobile doesn't connect me to the tower in Victoria, B.C that I can access when no local ones are available. Since I live in the U.S. that is helpful. ATT used to charge me international roaming charges on my some of my local calls.. They always fixed the bill when I called customer service, but still it was a monthly hassle. I called T-Mobile once and they fixed the system to not allow me to connect with the problematic tower.
Second time I've done this and there was even a fifteen dollar discount on the $100 (1000 minute) card. I don't use a thousand minutes a year, but near the end of the year, I bought another, arrived in a few days, activated over the phone (only function of the card is that it bears an activation code number) and rolled over the remaining minutes from previous year. Some negative reviewer said you could get a better deal directly from T-Mobile with no sales tax but that is impossible - a company with stores in your state has to charge sales tax - where does he live, Antarctica?Amazon is the place to go for T-Mobile to go minutes.
The product was great.  I am serving with the 101st in Afghanistan and had a family emergency.  I needed to cancel my order.  About three to four days after sending an email, I was told that the order couldn't be canceled due to it already being shipped.  It didn't ship out for a week.  I was very disappointed and will not do business again with this company.
Witty, ironic, sarcastic, hilarious, but at the same time touching and causes you to reflect on your life and relationships.
This got to my house in exactly the condition described and it arrived very quickly. Thanks!
This item got to me in exactly the time it posted it would.  I love it and have already watched it along with my Season One.  I love Amazon and the sellers on Amazon.  You really cannot beat the prices for the value and quality you get.I am a long time buyer from Amazon and will continue to be.Thank you!
Scrubs is one of the best comedy TV shows, and this second season is hilarious! Really worthy buying!
Loved it!  The person who sold it to me was fast, reliable and just awesome, too!
is even better than the first season if you can believe that.  With guest stars Heather Locklear and Ryan Reynolds coming into play on Scrubs for awhile.  It only made the show with the off beat, quirky and downright funny personnel of the Sacred Heart hospital that much more likable even Dr. Cox as he has a new reason to change his tune (just a little) with a baby boy that gets him and his ex-wife to still throw verbal snaps at each with ease.  But show some more love as well.JD is still weird, nerdy and downright lame as can be. But he's more interesting in his character and growing with confidence as a doctor.  Along with his surgeon best friend Turk who takes his relationship up a notch with Carla, the ever spirited and fiesty nurse that has no prob letting folks know when they are having relationship woes among other things.It's just a great show to sit back and watch at anytime and you'll know what it is to watch a great show that knows how to make it fun to watch TV and just have a good time in general.
Makes you love it even more...the story, the characters...it all works.  I love Ben and I wish he would have been around more, but...
I bought this season in addition to Season 3, 4, 5, and 6 from the Amazon all at once.  I can tell you that I never regretted buying them.  This TV show is hilarious, and I really enjoy watching it after I come from the hospital.  The daydreaming of JD (and sometimes other actors) is what makes it so special and funny. The last DVD of this season has a gag real, which I enjoy watching.
This series is awesome...best contemporary take on hospital life...Have watched it a million times, and it still doesnt get old.
This has got to be the funniest show I've ever seen. I really enjoy watching it. Scrubs is such a well written show.
Scrubs - The Complete Second Season put this little and much ignored show on the map. Season 2 is really strong and the writing is unique and remarkable. It's pretty sad this show is ending this season but hey I'm glad Scrubs made it work for seven seasons even though it was never a ratings darling. Zach Braff continues to shine and the rest of the cast are a hoot as well. Get this season and the rest today. Enjoy!
This was a birthday present for my brother, it's his favorite show. He was thrilled with it and couldn't tell it was a previously owned dvd. It arrived right on time and in perfect condition.
Scrubs is hilarious!! I also received it in a reasonable amount of time and in perfect condition.
The phone works well.  I bought it as a backup phone, should something happen to my Razr.  Other than not being new and having somewhat of a muted color display, I'm happy with it.  Pros: it fits comfortably in my hand, the voice sound is clear, the lighted buttons, the price, and it's not complicated.  Con: camera picture quality is disappointing (it has the same camera as my Razr V3, yet the Razr takes better pics.)  Would I recommend it?  Yes, I would.
I have used it for 3 years now. This phone seems like Model T or Beetle of flip phones. Lately battery has been draining a lot, which is expected. I have dropped it so many times, and it doesn't break. The camera still works good (4x zoom). This is like toyota of phones or something. Ha, enuff with the car analogies.
Doesn't have all the modern frills that the other phones have but if you break phones the way I do its a good stand in.
I for the most part like the model and that is why this is my second one but with this new one the problem is the back of the phone does not stay on and I did not have this with my first one.
My employer had purchased several of these phones for work use. First, this phone felt cheap & broke easily. The screens broke under lite to moderate pressure. Secondly, the number keys broke or stuck after a year of moderate use. Thirdly, the ear pieces failed & I'd be forced to use it with the speaker on. Sometimes the camera function wouldn't turn on. I suggest buying a different phone.
Very Good phone. It is not thin but for the price it is an excellent product. Delivery was prompt and well packaged. Lasts for days without rechraging.
Got the phone tuesday and put on charger would not charge and the logo and the lock on the back fell off , would not work was suppose to be unlocked, with my sims card. Looks like a cheap phone, can't tell you abouit the camera would not hold a charge!
Horrible Service!Shipment arrived very late.Over and above that they sent me a locked phone and couldnot provide me an unlocking code over the phone as well...They promised replacement...but hasn't arrived yet after 15 days....when original order promised delivery in 3 days.Dont ever consider this product and the seller company!
WE PURCHASED THIS PHONE (WHICH IS A VERY CHEAP PHONE) AND IT BROKE WITHIN 1 WEEK.  WHEN WE TRIED TO GET WARRANTY WORK DONE THROUGH MOTOROLA, THEY SAID THAT THE WARRANTY WAS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MANUFACTURE THESE PHONES ANY LONGER.  SO, DON'T BUY IT THINKING YOU CAN GET WARRANTY SERVICE!!!
you get what you pay for...I live in Nashville, TN and have AT&T; (I detest AT&T;)...the reception on this phone is worse than any phone I've owned since 2001...ALL SALES ARE FINAL... I would return this phone if I could...
I am very pleased with my new phone.  It was perfect and I am so happy that I had a good experience with Amazon.  Every detailm that was described was accurate and I thank you so much.  Sincerely M.Moore
This phone is a piece of junk. The phone i received had AT&T; logo on it. The phone feels like made from cheap material. I used to have the RAZR before and it was good. Believe me unless you want to waste your money and time, DO NOT buy this junk. I am sending this back today.
This phone rocks! First, it has an unbelievable signal wherever I go. I never have a problem connecting. Also, it is incredibly clear. I can hear the caller and they can hear me. Unlike those "candy bar" type phones, this one wraps around your face so you talk directly into the microphone and the person on the other end can hear every word you speak and not hear all of the background noise. I don't know if it has some sort of sound filter on it or not, but it sure sounds great to the person on the other end.Another cool this is how light and thin it is. You barely even notice that it's in your pocket. But the vibrate on this phone is very strong, so you know when you're getting a call.Last, this is an UNLOCKED phone. This is a big deal, since you can hop carriers and not have to switch phones. Also, very cool to have an unlocked phone when you go out of the country and want to make local calls in that country. Just buy a starter package abroad [usually about $10 USD] and make local calls until you use up the card. Way cheaper than trying to make calls using your US carrier.I love this phone!
I am very disappointed with this purchase.  It cuts out after only a couple of seconds and will not hold a charge.  It does say no warranty so I am completely out of luck I guess I should have realized that no warranty means...don't expect it to work.
I've been using a silver RAZR for 2 months and here are my conclusions:THE BAD:- BROKE!! After 1 month it stopped operating - the screen turned on but I had no access to my data nor could I make any use of the phone to receive or make calls. So despite the positive aspects mentioned below, I cannot rate it any better. Goes to show that quality control isn't Motorola's strong point.- Short battery life. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Calendar, alarm, notes, contacts cannot be synchronized with Outlook.- Awful camera resolution. Plus, the camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 player.THE GOOD:- Free! (or at least very cheap if you don't buy with a plan).- Decent reception.- Universal system - you can travel with it anywhere (you might need to pre-authorize this with your operator).- Can be charged with a USB cable.- Slick, slim, cool look.- Bluetooth range.
Well, I've had my V3 Razr for about 2 years. In that time, it's been unusually trouble free. Okay, once or twice, it has freaked out with a whitescreen but I attribute this to heavy use and some cheap aftermarket batteries.The good: Yes, it's sleek and pretty. It's well built. It's packs away in a vestpocket. The range beats most other phones in my area--I get more bars than anybody I know in concrete buildings and I actually live in one.It has the features I need: bluetooth, speaker phone, conference call, etc. And a few features I don't need: camera--I'm a very small investor and I'm not Steven Spielberg. Still, I keep a foto of my family as a background screen--it's a nice touch.At 95 bucks, you can't top the price for this kind of quality. I paid $250 for my current V3 Razr when I bought it overseas. And I'm buying a second phone as backup and to take advantage of the commonality of all the accessories I now have. Plus, my wife is eying my current Razr rather hungrily and she'll probably wrench it from me before too long, anyway.The bad: Battery life is only fair; I get a full day in my home office with 3+ hours of calls and most of those bluetoothed for handsfree action. But you have to expect to recharge nightly. Even moderate use of an hour or so necessitates a nightly recharge. I can live with this. I just can't afford to have my phone fail on an important call. So I charge it daily. Often, it's on the recharger at work while I use my bluetooth headset. This works for me. It's always ready to go when I am.Hey, I consider 3+ hours of use to be a serious workload for any cell phone. It's really not fair to beat on your phone on a daily basis and then complain about its performance.For the benefit of those worried about the warranty, well, I live abroad. The Razr is a very popular model. There are numerous service centers with people skilled in the repair this phone. If it's not up to snuff when you open it on day one--send it back to Amazon on their 30 day return policy.But if it works fine, then rest assured it's no big deal to get service for it in any large city abroad or in the U.S.I give it 4 stars for all of the above reasons. To me, the good outweighs the bad. I don't need a ton of features. Just a few that work consistently. And I have 2 years of mostly heavy but trouble-free use so far. Hey, the best endorsement I can give is the fact that I just bought another one.
It is a decent product for regular voice users. The design is quite neat and clean. One charge of the battery gives almost one week's worth of standby hours. Another plus is that this phone has Input in Chinese.
Got this phone less than 1 year.  But, now as I talk, the phone becomes so hot that it hurts my ear and my hand.  I hate this phone.  It's a piece of junk.  It looks fancy but not practical.  And then I have to charge it every night otherwise, the battery dies so quickly even though I hardly use my phone.
I recieved this phone a couple of weeks ago and I really like it. My old Sony Ericsson had a couple of features that I miss with this phone (timer, stopwatch, programable daily alarm clock), but otherwise I really like it. I'd never go back to my old phone!! This one has a much better signal and keeps a charge a LOT longer.
Good phone just be careful with the glass on the outside screen (i'm 17 which means i'm hard on phones, broke mine twice) for future reference you can get replacement glass for like $3 +shipping on Ebay.  Don't let the fleamarket guys hassel ya for $15, $30, + to fix it.
I got the razr v3 and i'm very happy with it, only the European charger was not included. This is exactly why I chose this particular phone, because Im an exchange student and when i go back to belgium, I will need the european charger! So Im pretty sad that it's not there. If its not going to be included, it shouldn't be listed on the website, That's just fooling people. I could've gotten the phone anywhere else.
I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone. I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it. I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery. Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years. I'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape. No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon.
After receiving my new cellphone, I discovered that it was not compatible with my phone carrier (Verizon), but the seller was more than accommodating by informing me to simply return the phone and they would reimburse me, which they did. Excellent customer service. I look forward to doing business with them in the future. Thank you.
I am so disappointed with this phone. From day one, I started experiencing dropped calls after about 20 seconds, and after about two weeks of use, my LCD died. I replaced the LCD and had the phone flashed, and flexed and nothing helped. It's currently packed away in the box, and I'm hoping to have it stripped down and the individual parts sold. If you're thinking about purchasing one, try your luck with one of the other models if you insist. Mine was likely refurbished according to the technician who worked on it, and there are probably alot more like it on the net. So, buyer beware.
I will never buy another refurb phone. I was not happy at all.When I purchased this phone, I expected it to be fully functional,IT WAS NOT. I could not access the Internet or recieve text messaging with pictures. The only thing it did, was make and receive calls. Was not worth the money.
Product arrived without a battery - make sure you order one separately and don't take anything for granted!
I used this phone for 2 years and would still use it for another 2 years if I didn't get a new phone for free.  I was 100% happy with my RAZR past two years.Frankly, I don't care much for all these special features that come with a cell phone.  I have a digital camera for taking pictures and video, laptop for instant message and web-surfing, and iPod for music.  They all perform much better than any of the cell phones out there because they do what they are supposed to do.  I expect one thing from a cell phone - make calls with good reception!RAZR worked very well as a cell phone.  It had a decent battery life that I never had a dead phone as long as I charged it while I was sleeping.  I dropped it many many times and had only some scratches on the surface but still no damage to the screens or functionality.  It was slim and fit perfect in my back pocket.  It paired and performed perfectly with my Bluetooth.  What else can I expect from a cell phone?  I absolutely loved this phone and will keep it just in case the new one I've got malfuncitons or gets stolen.
Great ..prodduct.. as describe.. But the volume is too low when it's ringing.. Ready to used in foregn country such as Vietnam.
I think one of this phone's best (and one of its only) features is its slim size.One of my gripes about this phone is that the battery stops holding its charge after about a year's use, and you must buy another to get it to work for more than a day.  I recommend buying the extended battery pack instead of the Motorola replacement.  This phone is incredibly not durable, and the first time I dropped it without its case the outer screen shattered.  For this reason I would recommend buying the silicone case that's sold for pennies online in various places (I dropped it dozens of times with this case on before dropping it without its case).  Overall the phone takes somewhat decent pictures and videos, but don't expect them to look good at sizes much bigger than the phone's screen.The phones ability to use speakerphone mode while closed was a valuable feature, and the phone's internet capabilities made the phone useful for browsing the web every now and then, but not for everyday use.I dropped my phone in water twice by accident, and took the battery out right away.  This quick thinking allowed the phone to continue working, but once when the phone was accidentally left on a table under the spray of some sprinklers, the phone finally stopped working (I didn't remove the battery in time).The refurbished version of this phone proved to be a complete failure. within three months I had gone through more than 5 different phones before settling on one that only usually worked, and usually made calls.The phone would occasionally decide that it was time to restart, even in the middle of a call, so not only was I disconnected, but I had to wait for the phone to start back up.  In addition to this the last refurb I received got terrible reception, but again I settled because this was the best one I had received up until that point.5 months after receiving my last refurb, it died completely despite the much more careful care this phone recieved compared to my first RAZR.  It simply bricked itself, and now it serves as an expensive paper-weight.Overall, the V3 razr is a mediocre phone with a not-so-great retail price.  If you can get one of these for free with a contract, I'd suggest taking the deal, but I wouldn't spend more than $10 for another one of these.
I purchased this phone and took it to Jamaica for a friend...it wouldn't work and when the repair person looked at it we were told that it had a used board and was not fixable.  My paperwork had been thrown out before I got home and so it ended up being a mistake that I couldn't remedy.  Very dissapointed.
I recommended for those who dont want to spend to much money on the phone This phone will be perfect
I had my Motorola RAZR for 9 months, and I'm glad to be rid of it.  There was slight delay between when I pressed a button and when the screen would pop up which was irritating and made simple tasks confusing.  Several times it froze up for a minute after I ended a call.  I talk on the phone probably 30 minutes everyday and rarely text, but still the battery life was poor.  I had to charge it everyday.  I also found the keypad awkward and difficult to use.On the positive side, however, it sleek and has a very bright, attractive screen.I don't recommend the RAZR to anyone looking for a reliable phone.
The worst ever! I had it for only one week and had to return it... thank God! Main problem: BATTERY. Terrible battery life. I'm not a big talker at all! You will need to charge this phone every night.
good phone but did not serve my purpose, couldn't use with my cell phone service provider
I bought this product and I had trouble charging it. The CD that came with the product was just a fake copy of an original Motorola CD. The contents of this CD have nothing to do with the purpose. Unfortunetely I have to leave USA, so I could not return this phone. I took this phone to an authorized motorola dealer and they found out that this phone was a used one. They even noticed rust in the inside. This phone was sold as new altough it seemed it was refurbished the technician mentioned. I was completely dissapointed. I would never buy a product from DataVision again. I am sure they knew they were selling a defective item. Be careful, really careful!!!
I got this free with a 2 year service plan w/Verizon.The battery life could be much better (sacrificed by small profile?), and Verizon doesn't allow a lot of the basic ring tones and sound bites from other websites (free stuff), like my wife's "Chocolate" phone.It's a very attractive phone and easy to use, but since it was free, I like it.  If I were to buy this phone outright...I would have been mad.It has still camera and Video mode alone with an easy to use/setup Bluetooth option (I have the Motorola MOTO H12 headset)I'm looking to replace this phone when the time is right.  3 stars is a fair rating.
I had a Motorola V190 and I wanted the RAZR cause it looked much more cool and my husband had one and liked his.  So, I bought a magenta RAZR.  I really liked the way it looked, it was easy to use and the talk/standby time was good.  However, about a month after I got the phone it started powering down on it's own or the screen would go white (if during conversation it would disconnect).  I bought a new battery thinking that was the problem...it wasn't.  My husband then was going to upgrade the firmware on it only to discover that the phone already had the most recent firmware.  I did use the phone for about a year as it only powered down about twice a month but after about a year it started powering down daily.  It wasn't convenient to have it power down during an important conversation.  So, I took the SIM card out and put it back in the V190.  The V190 may not "look" cool but at least it's reliable.  I now have a KRZR K1, but I will hold on to my V190 just in case.  My husband never had a problem with his RAZR but I do know a couple of other people that had the same problem with theirs.  I would never buy another RAZR.
It has been a very satisfactory phone. I would suggest getting US phone charger in place of the foreign one and adapter that came with the phone.Good value for the Money
I've gone through a number of Nokia, Ericsson and LG phones, but I have never enjoyed a phone as much at my RAZR.It is thin enough to carry in my front pocket, but big enough to hold comfortably while talking.  I like the look, it has a decent camera, bluetooth, a sensible plug (unlike my Nokias), the battery life has been excellent.  It is generally a convenient, well designed phone.  This alone makes it worth a recommendation.  But the reason I really love this phone, and the reason you should seriously consider it -- it is rugged and extremely well built.I was at the top of a four story open stairwell, as I pulled it from my pocket I clumsily dropped it over the rail.  It fell cleanly down the center of the stairwell - I'm guessing over 45 feet - and cracked against the hard concrete floor.  I rushed down to get it, knowing nothing could survive a fall like that, and found it working like nothing happened.  Not only does it still work great - it didn't even get scratched or dinged by the fall.  I know enough about physics to be completely baffled.I have no idea how they can make such a thin, refined phone so darn rugged, but thanks to the Motorola's engineers and factory for putting together such a high quality product.
This may be an old model, but it is a very good, basic phone.  It's still relatively small and light, and both the talk and ring volume are much louder than other phones I've had over the years.  If you buy the Motorola Phone Tools software, not included (I bought mine for a prior Moto phone from Amazon for a couple of dollars) and have a standard USB connection with your PC, you can load your own photos for wallpaper, etc., and make your own ringtones from MP3 files.  It also backs up your phone book and SIM card, all very easily. Now that the phone is so old, the price is realistic.  I got mine, new, for under $130.  For that price, I'm not too worried about the lack of a US warranty.
I bought this purely because I love the appearance of the Razr.  I don't use the phone for much except phone calls, text messages, alarms, and the occasional quick snapshot in a pinch.  I've had a RAZR V3 in the past (silver original) and have never had a problem with either.  works great and looks great!
We each have a razr, dh has this one and I have the Cherry Blossom Razr. We've had them for over a year and dh is very pleased. I had an issue with the screen on my first one, and got a replacement and have had no more issues. I have to say I have had cheaper phones in the past that have had better reception than this. I love the thin and sleak style though. :)
For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and didn't need all the mins I got on the $39 plan(with taxes came to $44)  pro: I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con:When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I didn't have to record my voice on each number,anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement ,which it's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned ,and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial,taking your hands off the wheel  .Wake up Motorola ,Thats stupid .
The phone did not work when I received it.  I have sent it back and am waiting on a replacement.
This phone was given as a gift, and the recipient has had only great things to say about it.  I'm very satisfied by the comments it's received, and glad that I purchased it!
I rec'd this product and could obviously tell it was a secondhand product that was painted (paint 'patch-ups' are obviously visible).  The product seems to have been a very much used secondhand phone that was refurbished, but it was not refurbished well as the phone has a constant buzzing sound when calls are made and rec'd.
I had a RAZR V2 and it was the best cell phone I ever had so I up graded to the RAZR V3 late last year (2007).  The RAZR V3 is by far the worst cell phone that I've owned.  It is beautiful and has great features but it keeps failing I have had 5 of these phones so far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 2nd phone would not charge from the get go / 3rd phone after about a month the screen would no longer light up / 4th phone after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 5th phone has been working for about a month now.  I really like the RAZR phones, WHEN THEY WORK but this V3 model has been terrible and I would rate it lower than 1 star if possible.
About two years ago I bought a Motorola V3, it was fantastic, the phone was great. About 5 months ago I decided to buy one for my wife, so I bought it in HassleFreeCell, one day before the celphone arrives her mother gifts her a Nokia, so I decided to have the phone as a backup cell phone.Last week my current phone started having issues, so I decided to use this "BRAND NEW MOTOROLA V3". When I opened the box I found that the mobile does not have the same Quality of my last V3, the battery cover is made from bad quality material, the quality of the pieces is awful. I had used the phone for two days and it already stop working, now I get why they didn't compromise with the warranty of the phone.I will never buy something there, this phone is completely different from the first V3 that I used for two year without any problems.
-Phone has what I call "pauses", in which it just goes blank in mid-text or call or whatever, and is useless for up to 20 seconds, before it goes back to normal (often causing a text message to be lost since you've pressed buttons during the pause)-Phone cuts out during calls-Poor, poor reception - it fails to work in places other people's mobiles have no problem with-Every now and then the phone just freaks out and the screen flashes white, and it must be set aside for anywhere between 2 minutes and half an hour-Phone just sometimes stops working - blank screen, can't turn it on or off. I went as far as going to the store to get it replaced when it started working again-The ring tone changes of its own accord. I kid you not, you set it to vibrate, then later on it will ring out on "loud".In short, I would cut off a finger before recommending this phone to even my worst enemy. A terrible failure of a product. Was it designed and assembled by chimpanzees? My last ever Motorolla product.
Do not waste your time or money on this phone. Of course it starts off working fine but as time goes on things start going wrong. I have had this phone for a year and am not happy at all with it.The battery life is not what it advertises (6 hours). If your downloading ring tones, clips, videos or anything else you will be lucky if your battery life is 2 hours.As time goes on don't expect to get all your text messages in a timely manner and then when you do get them you will get them more then once (that could be the provider's fault but other people who have other providers have told me they have the same problem).If you plan on doing any videos on this phone make sure you have a large enough space on your sim card or buy one with a large enough space to hold video. Pictures are only good during the day or in really good lighting.I know not all cell phones have great sound but this one really does not have great sound. It also comes with minimal ring tones so be expected to buy plenty if your into ring tones. I personally hate the sound that it makes coming on and the Hellomoto ring tone.If you do plan buying this phone make sure you get a cover or protector for it because once you drop it it's all over.Just know that when you go with a provider most contracts are for 2 years. Thank God when I got this phone my contract was only 18 months. I think I would have died if I had to stay with this phone any longer.Read all the reviews on this phone and seriously consider the cons on this phone before you buy into the pros.
The phone is great, when it comes to looks. It is slim and lightweight, but the battery life is SO short! You have to charge it every other day, if you don't use it at all. If you do have to use the phone for any reason at all, you'll have to charge it everyday! It's so annoying! And of course, when I emailed the seller about the product and inquired about the battery life, they ignored me. Not a good phone to buy if you actually want a phone that you can use.
Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Cell Phone with Video Player--International Version with No Warranty (Black) Muy buen producto. Llego en tiempo y forma ofrecidos por el vendedor. Me gusta el diseno.
I see this phone has mixed reviews. Let me add my two cents.It's not a bad phone at all. It has Bluetooth, which can gather some decent ringtones, and it has a camera and video, though those aren't that great. It's nice and thin, with a bright screen. The only bad thing is that I don't know how to get online with it.One more thing: This phone can take a beating. My mom accidentally washed it, a few months ago, and it's made a full recovery, sans the camera, which is busted.
After 3 days i found there is something wrong in the screen where i see blak patch when screen is off. after one week the phone is silent and not responding. i thing this is very bad stuff. additional the sound quality is bad and camera is not good . this phone look like coming from botton of the ocean
I got this phone from AT&T; and started a contract with then. They are wonderful, customer service has been wonderful and this awesome user friendly phone died after 3.5 months.  I was so upset so before sending it to motorola for warranty repair, i went on ebay to buy another one.  Listing said "new"....I removed my sim card from my dead RAZR and shipped it to motorola.  I receive my "new unlocked" razr and put my sim card in.....Nothing was there! An error code popped up and the date in the phone was for 2004...hmmm, I call customer svc and they look up error code on the internet since they said this number was not an AT&T; code so long story short it was a TMOBILE code and this phone must have been 4 yr old maybe refurbished.  After about 4 hours of phone chat with approx 7 different tech people, we determinted that i've lost all my sim info....why? who knows, we also determined that since i'm not able to receive pics or send any, that this phone's codes do not match the already preprogrammed AT&T; razr phone codes.  TIP- IF YOU BREAK A PHONE, ESPECIALLY  AN AT&T; ONE, MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NEXT ONE PURCHASED FROM A SELLER HERE OR EBAY IS ALSO WITH/FROM THE SAME PROVIDER.  I AM NOW RETURNING THIS RAZR BACK TO THE SELLER and getting a new one that IS AN AT&T; phone with the proper codes already installed.  ANOTHER TIP- THE RAZR THAT DIED AND WAS SHIPPED TO MOTOROLA HAD A TON OF PICS IN IT.  THIS IS NOT SAVED TO YOUR SIM, EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR PICS AND YOU WILL PROBABLY NOT HAVE THEM WHEN THE PHONE IS RETURNED TO YOU.  I am looking forward to my new razr, the AT&T; specific one and when my original one is returned (from the warranty work) i will have an extra one for back up.  This is a user friendly phone, not heavy duty, rather dainty so be careful with it...mine broke right in the hinge pin and never powered on again.  Over all, i love the phone.  Just hope to have better luck with the next one, keep yours in a good protected case.
It works well for a few months and then totally goes haywire and stops working.  Would not recommend to anyone
I bought this at Best Buy as a "Go Phone", along with a Motorola phone case. The phone case ended up having a yellowed spot in the most noticeable spot possible, and when the rzr was opened for a picture, the support straps would dangle into camera view. It turns out, I bought "the old version" I was told 2 weeks after purchasing. It accepts no memory cards (at&t; store assured me it would), and despite the fact that it has a usb connector, it doesnt link to computers to charge, or to transfer photos (unless you purhcase the Moby Dick of Motorola software "phone tools", which is both rare, and 60+ dollars.) I had to buy a rocketfish bluetooth dongle to send pics to my comp, and even that I have to trick it into doing, like force feeding a child beets. I have to fight myself from snapping this thing in half, or sledgehammering the hell out of it on a daily basis. The only thing that has kept me from doing so is the idea i could donate it to some sort of charity, but its clear that no ones life is so bad that this phone could better it.
This is one of the most stupid products I have ever had the misfortune of owning. The ring tone buttons on the flip lid are impossible to maintain as every time it is opened, the ringer is adjusted. There is no button lock feature to prevent this and the amount of missed calls are frustrating. If this is what having a cell phone is all about, I can do better without. Hard to believe so little thought went into this phone.  I guess I can use it as as a mediocre camera and at least it looks good.
am having to return the product back to amazon. the standby time on the battery is barely 1 day. also the caller pic id function does not work. the camera resolution is pathetic. however i like the phone overall and am buying another one from another sourcehowever amazon has been good in terms of a full refund (yet to recieve, but they have promised).
The phone is piece junk.I was excited when i got it but so dissapointed when i used it.Phone doesn't work.It just wasting my money.We returned the phone last 22nd of december but until now we never get any response and dont get our money back yet.Out of 5 star i would rate this 0.
I thaught this phone was going to work for Verizon. But, no, because Verizon don't use "sim'card. So I had to return it for credit.  On 08/28/2008 Thursday Amazon said I will get this phone "next day delivery" 08/29/2008 Friday so I paid next day air. But I didn't receive it till Tues.09/02/2008.So, I'm rating Amazon 1/2 star. for false delivery service. Sharon :)-
Pros:Great battery lifeSound quality and consistencyLayout good - placement of menus, etc - easy to manueverCons:Cheap plastic casingVery basic camera - e.g. no zoomEvan Glueck
I am having this phone for past 1.5 years now.Features of this phone are really impressive (1.2 MP camera with sliding cover, Symbian OS, Office application etc.)It is little bit heavier than other smartphone (Blackberry Pearls, Sony Walkman). Keys are also very small and sometime troublesome to operate.However biggest problem with this phone is that it has that so called "morning sickness" problem. Phone gets frozen or automatically switches off every 4-5 days. I have all the latest firmware and so but that could not solve the problem.I was Nokia fan and all my previous phone were from Nokia. But I am very disappointed with this phone.
We got this phone for our 10-year-old daughter, more for our peace of mind than hers.  Then, the problems started almost immediately.  The internet interface is almost impossible to use, and is impossible if you own a newer phone.  You simply can't program the pnohe on line. The phone connectivity was terrible - and we live in a city with great coverage.  Worst, the battery lasted maybe 30 minutes on standby, and maybe 5 minutes of calling time.I think my daughter was able to use this phone 3 times before we gave up.Save your money - buy the cheapest cell phone possible and add your kids to your own plan - shared minutes are much cheaper than the Firefly both in actual costs and in frustration!
I could not be more happier with this phone. You made me very happy by delivering a high quality prouduct, as good as a new one...Thank You so much!~Lou
I've owned a 6101 for 2 years and never had a problem even dropped it once or twice and still worked great the only reason i'll purchase another is because they will not withstand a 250lbs person acciendetally falling on it other than that i enjoyed the phone
I've had my 6010 for years.  It just never breaks down, never locks up, never goes wierd.  I've fallen back to it several times, once after my blackberry became quirky, and once with an international phone.  Originally, I purchased a much more expensive spiffy phone with camera, bells and whistles.  I brought it back to exchange for this phone failing to get a clear line.  I live in a poor reception area.  The sales person said the signal would be better and there would be less hassels.  He was right.  I can always depend on this little fellow.  It doesn't look like much, but I am secure that my calls will happen when I want them to.  This is a great back up, no headache phone.
Very happy with the phone.  Just needed a basic phone after the phone at&t; gave me broke.  I took the sim card out of my broken phone and put in this one and it worked great from the start.  This phone works in places that my wife's will not.
These phones are to replace the same 3 year old phones. My parents, 90 & 89,  have no trouble seeing or using  the buttons. Took  the chip out of the old cell and into the new no problem. I on the other hand got my new one from the cell company who did not have the same phone. Can not see the screen in daylight and some light rooms and the buttons are a nightmare. If you don't need a camera or flip postage stamp size phone, get this one.
the phone is great if you need a easy to do phone i just wish it was a little smaller to fit in my pants pocket better but its a good phone
I received this phone very quickly.  I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.  I had no problems at all with getting a new one.  Excellent service with the seller.
The keypad had died about a month ago.  I had been shopping for a replacement phone in that time and I couldn't find anything that I liked.  Especially since I'd lose the majority of my contacts if I switched phones!  So I decided to buy this.  It was the perfect choice: great price, fast delivery and easy installation.  Was talking with my family 5 minutes after receiving the order.
this was terrible - did not work, I am thinking that the old product had been in original case for so long that the battery was completely dead (not responding to charging). Bought an Iphone instead of wasting time on this garbage
I had this phone since 2005.  Never needed to buy a new battery.Pros1/ has a camera, has a voice recorder, has a good alarm clock, has a calendar.2/ survived water damage in 2008.  1st day it was inoperational.  By the 3rd day, it was dry, and it worked just like new !  Working well for 3 weeks and counting.3/ calls are loud and clear, both to me and the recepient, given the phone's got 2 bars or more.  T-mobile service.Cons1/ resolution of the photos are 0.3 megapixel, I believe.2/ it's a basic, basic phone.interesting factoid.  This phone is old enough and outdated enough to be seen on 2008, CNN India, where a villager was storing video footage of an Indian girl, which villagers recognized as structural similarity to a known Indian deity.
I previously owned a T-Mobile Dash by HTC, which worked well and I liked it.  After crunching that one by accident, I decided to get an unlocked phone that seemed a bit more beefy.  I don't like Blackberries, so I decided to try the Nokia 9300.  It was discontinued by a couple years, but I still managed to find a brand new in the box North American version for a strongly discounted price.  I had an old Nokia bar phone a few years back, and that thing still works today, so the reliability is great for Nokia's based on that experience.The 9300 is honestly the best phone I have ever owned.  I have had it for five months now, and the Symbian 7.0 series 80 OS has never crashed, not even once, the entire time I have owned it; my Dash's Windows Mobile 6.0 OS used to crash every week, at least once a week.  The Dash could not take a call while working in a spreadsheet without freezing, but the 9300 seems to manage just fine.  The spacious 80 MB internal memory also seems to stand the Nokia in good stead.My Dash had a 1.3 Mpixel camera with video, and the Nokia has no camera.  This may seem like a drawback, but I honestly don't care; I never cared for cameras in phones to begin with.  The Dash has a full QWERTY keyboard crammed onto its lower front, while the 9300 has a gigantic inner keyboard that is more akin to a miniature laptop!  I love the keyboard on the 9300, and I doubt any other phone has such a one, except possibly the 9500...My T-Mobile service is decent, the customer service is outstanding, and I hardly ever drop calls.  When I had Cingular/AT&T; back in the day, my coverage was wider but I dropped so many calls that I couldn't really carry a long conversation.  I prefer the stability of T-Mobile calls to the wider coverage area of AT&T.;  T-Mobile was also willing to accept my unlocked phone on my service plan without extending my contract, and they do not require a contract if you provide your own unlocked phone; AT&T; requires you to enter an 18-month restriction even if you provide your own unlocked phone.  Also, T-Mobile's EDGE network is nearly three times faster in these parts than AT&T;'s.  I get almost 250 kbits/sec on T-Mo's EDGE, while AT&T;'s only got 100 kbits/sec tops in practice.  Also, the tethered modem capability is available with T-Mo's 19.99 data plan, while AT&T; will not include it unless you spend 65.00/mo on data alone.  So, I like T-Mobile for my 9300, and it works great...One funny thing about the 9300 is that there is no vibrating alert, but since I sit and type on it in meetings, I actually prefer not to have vibrating alert.  So it works out for me in a funny way.  It is as if somebody made this phone just for me.  It does great on everything.  Adobe Reader for Symbian does make a few errors on displaying pdf's once in a while, but everything else... email, internet, phone as modem, voice calls, display, calendar and alarm functions, applications, speakerphone, conference calls... everything else works beautifully.  The phone and the OS are not totally seamless, though; I think the phone and OS are not nearly as integrated as they were on my Windows Mobile smartphone, but I actually prefer them to be somewhat seperate.  Once again, somebody must have been thinking of me...The fact that this phone takes an MMC card instead of SD, miniSD or microSD was a little wierd, but I got a decent MMC card to go with it.  It will take up to a 2 GB MMC or MMC-Plus card, and since MMC cards will fit into SD readers, I have had no problems.  A nice touch is that the MMC slot allows for hot swapping.This phone has handily survived a couple of drops since I got it, and does not have any scratches, dents, marks, cracks, or otherwise as a result.  It has stood up to some nasty situations; getting rained on, sitting out in a hot car, falling onto a wooden floor, being attacked by my cat...  It takes a lick and keeps on ticking!Once again, a great phone by Nokia.  The nicest and best phone I have ever owned thus far...
This phone is quite unique, but you need to be very careful with it. If you are known to be even slightly rough with anything, then you might want to look at their more stout 7380.This phone is not a woman's phone by the name 'lipstick' but it probably would be safer being kept in someones purse. I kept it in my pocket and am a very skinny guy, hardly bumping into anything, and it still tends to hit the hang up button alot (thus turning off the phone).Also once you get it in your hands you can feel that the entire case feels like a very thin, almost eggshell like plastic. It feels breakable, but underneath is a thick metal plate holding all of the mechanics safe. So even if it feels like its going to shatter in your grip or fall apart in your palm, you really only need to make sure you don't scratch the plastic.Main flaws of the phone (for me);~power button is raised and not flush with the phone (obviously due to style), which caused me to accidentally turn off the phone when it was in my pocket and by slightly leaning against just about anything.~rotary dial is literally the soul of the phone, and mine died. There is a seller on ebay that has cheap replacements for $17, and its easy to switch out. But by doing so you will have to break the warranty sticker on the phone.~my phone had random stickers on the red plastic (once slide open), which were hard and obnoxious to remove! I think my phone might have been a refurb!~As with the other very sexy 7380, the mirror front is a nice touch but makes it impossible to use outside in most daylight.~possibly just on mine, but the speaker is somewhat weak. It eventually gave out and all sound came from the side port (speaker phone out i think). I'm typically good at personal repairs but i doubt that i can fix something like this easily so its going to have to stay like that.With all of this in mind, do remember that i'm a somewhat physically active guy, but no moron. I kept my phone safe, and refused the craving to play with the dial by swinging the phone back and forth with it (cause it is sort of fun...but DONT!). But even with my caution, just keeping it in my pocket eventually damaged the dial and the the fact that it kept turning off is sort of annoying, but my own doing.If your looking for a high tech phone that is pure style, then get this. If you've ever broken a phone before by your own actions, look for something else!
I purchased this phone for my wife, as a replacement to her broken RAZR V3.She has complained ever since that the reception is terrible. I spoke to a young man who unlocks phones for a living and his response was that it was not properly unlocked. For the money spent, I expected a phone to provide identical results as the same model it was replacing. As this has no warranty I am stuck.
I had to replace my other razr because it fell in the toilet.  so i ordered this unlocked phone, it came in a few days, which was really great.  the phone does the job, unfortunately, it didn't take the previous SIM card, but that may have been my fault mishandling the sim card, or the sim card was damaged anyway, what with getting in the toilet.  the only complaint i have about this phone is that it doesn't really accept text messages, maybe that is an issue with the plan i have.  the battery life isn't great, it starts beeping low battery after about 2.5 hours of talk time.the color is briliant.
This product is cool, I particularly am a fan of Moto Razr. Bought this item as unlocked and I am not pleased with the programs that was left in, like the graphics and ringtones, wasn't much, I was expecting fully loaded stuff, but it's okay, I could downloads stuff.It takes great pix and it's got lots of room and potentials. But other than that,this product is as explained and best of all the price is right."awesome!!
This is the worst cellphone I have ever used. I brought my RAZR in June/2007. The first piece of keys falls from the cellphone in the end of 2007. The second key, which is the "OK" key on the panal, falls from the phone about three months ago. And now, finally, the round key disintegrated. The phone itself is good, with a nice battery. However, I wonder, what can I do with a cellphone without keys??? How to dia numbers with such a stupid low quality RAZR! Within one year, this whole thing becomes a crap.
This is a great cell phone for any one who is living overseas. Its convient to have for prepaid services. And if you still want to be in style. Its unlocked, so you can use it in the states.
Hello, I just wanted to let everyone about the 5 starr customer service of this product.  They customer service team allowed me to returned this phone even though the policy stated other wise.  Thanks for your understanding and excellent customer service.Marjorie
this product was for my mom.  it is exactly what she needed and delivered 100% satisfaction!  Great deal!!!
I've had this phone for about a year and a half and it's great.  I even inadvertently ran it through the entire wash cycle and it still works!  Not one function lost.  I'll probably get another one.
I bought this phone mainly to use in Italy for extended visits and plan to get an Italian SIM card. The phone itself works well (I tend to like Motorola phones -- others may not) and the quad band capability should ensure compatibility with European wireless networks.One big selling point of this phone was Amazon's claim that it was unlocked.  However, after trying two SIM cards from provides other than AT&T;/Cingular (one from an Italian provider and one from a Hong Kong provider) the phone is quite definitely LOCKED as it asks for a subsidy code when you boot up with a non-AT&T; SIM card.  So I will likely have to fork over another 15-20$ to get a code to unlock it from a third party.I think others have had similar problems --- as the phone was supposedly sold directly by Amazon (but I am sure they are using a third-party supplier), my suggestion to their quality control department is to pay a little more serious attention to this issue of selling locked phones as being "unlocked".One other thing -- it appears one may need to buy the software necessary to use computer-communication features on this phone (but I have not done a deep search on the Web to see if the software can be found for free --- what I know is my XP-system does not have a device driver to mount the phone and the phone manual indicates one needs to purchase such software).
The phone was not unlocked as advertised, and the IMEI unlock code could not be found, making it impossible to use the unit.  Returned after a week of frustration -- unclear how the vendor intends to profit by paying to ship phones around the country.
This is an excellent basic phone.  No complaints whatever.Not many bells or whistles, but does averything that you wanta phone to do.  Very good sound quality.  Screen very legible . Comes with a good selection of standard utilities that do everything that I want a phone to do, and a lot of things for which I have no use on a phone(sending faxes, internet browsing, etc).  The phone has been extremely reliable, no problems whatever and has worked perfectly at all times.This is a phone that works on the GSM system.  There is no problem with GSM service anywhere in Canada where I live. European SIM cards for it are readily available, which allow for very economical local use in Europe thus avoiding very expensive roaming charges.  I have had no problems with GSM service when I am in the USA, but can only speak for the northeastern USA.This is a mobile GSM phone  It does not have bluetooth, it does nothave a camera. It is not an MP3 player. But it is extremely good at the basic function of any telephone :  sending and receiving phone calls.  Additionally, it has excellent sound quality and has been 100% reliable.As far as I am concerned, for what I want a mobile phone for, it hasturned out to be a most economical and an excellent choice. Highlyrecommended.
This phone was advertised as "Unlocked". When they arrived, I put my sim chip in and when I powered the phone to use it I was asked for a "code" to use the phone. After talking to customer service I was told this phone was not "Unlocked" and I had to return them.
Ordered the UNLOCKED V190 in black, Amazon sent me a LOCKED V190 in SILVER. The label on the box said it was an unlocked black V190, but it seems the order processors at Amazon did not open it to verify if it indeed was a black unlocked V190. There was a silver locked V190 inside.Thus, I returned it and got a refund.If you order this phone, be advised that you may get the wrong one.I rate two thumbs down on this one.
Like others have said.  The order was switch from a V190 to a V195 without asking if this was okay.
Doesn't matter the phone or the service, the area in which I live causes a lot of dropped calls.  This phone is worse than the last though, and its battery isn't all that hardy either.  It will get me through my contract, and then I will scrap it along with my carrier.
This is a great little phone. I am going to use it when I go to Europe, in the spring . No camera, but I don't take pictures with my phone
The phone call was not the same as the one that was shown in the picture. It was a different color and a different model. It was also made of cheap plastic, and it got scratched on the face within a matter of days.
This is a nice, basic clamshell style cellphone.This phone fits the bill as a replacement for a lost phone.It has all the basic features speed dial, speaker feature ,auto redial etc.The keypad is easy to use.The battery standby time is excellent.It lacks a camera otherwise this has been a good phone so far.
No frills here, just good basic phone use and features. Makes a perfect backup or travel option to more feature intensive devices. Mini USB is a plus for quick and easy connection with computer or laptop to sync contact/calendar info. Great battery life. Lack of bluetooth for wireless headset is drawback, but 3.5mm jack is satisfactory alternative.
I was very pleased with the Motorola V190 phone. It was shipped promptly and was exactly as described. Price was very good and we were just able to insert our sims card and it was ready to go.
I really like this phone; it was easy to learn and hasn't failed me yet.  I had hoped to use the feature that allows connection to my computer, but, alas, that's another $50.
I was actually sent the V195. Great phone, simple, easy to use, and long battery life, which I really love.
The phone was sent on time, but they sent me the wrong phone and their sales are final IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE WARRANTY. So i pretty much just waisted my time and money. I haven't had any luck with getting in contact with them YET. Don;t buy it.
The item was brand new.  It was good except it doesn't look like what the picture shows.  a little bit different other than that it's good.
UNLOCKED MOTOROLA V190 V 190 FLIP GSM BLACK CELL PHONEwhat I ordered I did not receive. The phone was all "Silver" not to mention that there was a #30.00 charge to the list price of $54.99
I purchased this unlocked PEBL phone for my daughter to use while she was studying in Greece, so once there she could buy a Greek SIM card, with a Greek phone number, and avoid roaming charges from using her US iPhone.  She was still in the US when it arrived, and the PEBL came with an international charger and manuals, but did not come with a SIM card.  This phone needed an inserted SIM card before it would allow her access to any setup menus, or to try it out to make calls, so she used the SIM card from her iPhone temporarily and it worked fine.  She was easily able to bluetooth sync the PEBL to her MacBook and transfer her contacts list using iSync, and to make calls on the ATT network.  Once she was in Greece, the phone has worked great with a Greek SIM card.
The product' excelent, it's really unlocked and worked for my country, Brazil...the shipping was extremely fast.Great deal!
It is pretty cool but it does not have enough memory, so its hard to get music on.
I love the phone! Its super sexy, easy to use, all i wanted. I am in love.
I recently bought this phone in preparation for some travel abroad.  I'm now using it in Brazil, and have had no problems with it.  It's compact, durable, and easy to use.  I particularly like the magnetic closing action that makes it easy to open, close, and use one-handed.
I've had a pebl for 2 years now and up until its unfortunate swim in a cup of french vanilla coffee- it worked like a dream.  Although the phone was years old, it remains in great shape. This is partialy due to me taking good care of it(minus occasional swims), but mainly bc of the cool texture that is virtually scratch resistant. I still have others asking me "what type of phone is that" or "is that new". The opening feature has spoiled me tremendously and I'm having a hard time finding another phone as chic and cost effective. Even after the spill in the coffee- my pebl remained true and worked fine after a few days or airing it out. It's only now (2 months later) that I see that it's time for a new phone. I think I'll stick with what I know and love and get another pebl.
The PEBL does have a nice hand feel, the opening mechanism is well thought out and works well in Europe but the "good" ends there. I have used the PEBL for over a year and have had 5 or 6 mobile phones prior to this one. I use it for work which takes me overseas a fair bit.The Motorola contact management interface is cumbersome to deal with. Most phones allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but PEBL does not. If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times. This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you'll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with phones.The "mirror" dialing pad and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking oily. And the dial pad begins to show up on the screen in a shadow pattern after a while. A brilliant design weakness.Connecting to the Bluetooth headset requires a multi-step sequence.The voice commands are cumbersome. As another reviewer noted "I would say "name dial" and it would keep asking me to repeat the command or tell me that the command could not be found." After some time I noticed that there is a beep after which you say the command. As long as you wait for the beep, the voice commands better - not perfect, but tolerable if you don't mind repeating yourself.The phone opens when dropped, which is often since a decent belt holder is hard to find for this model without buying a leather sleeve which sort of defeats the nice palm feel the PEBL has. And now when it drops it not only opens but the back falls off and the battery spills out.Photo taking is frustrating. Easy to shoot the photo, but then the phone forces you to decide how you want to "store" the picture by making at least two selections from the menu! This is obnoxious.  I would like to just take the photo and have the phone store it without me performing several selectionsMaybe it is my cell carrier, but I've had voicemails that it didn't inform me about for several days and sometime up to a week! Like another reviewer, I have yet for it to let me know about a voicemail within a few minutes or even hours of receiving it.Also annoying is the fact that it will beep nonstop every 3 to 5 minutes when the battery is getting low about until the battery is really and truly dead. I've had to get up at 3:00 AM to turn the damn thing off. There are notification options buried deep in the directory that will turn this "feature" off.
I order this phone NEW from amazon. I actually can't say anything about the phone itself, because I didn't get to use it at all. First of all I ordered a NEW phone and the one I received was defenitely not new. It had all the plastic sheets on it, but it was udes before. So I returned it within 5 minutes of receiving it. I am very dissappointed with  amazon. I don't think I'll order anything from them again.And the phone doesn't support the my faves plan from T-mobile. Well, just the graphics of the phone doesn't support it....so you may be able to call your faves for free, you just won't have the symbols on the screen....which is a big turn off for me.
Phone arrived DOA, after company sent 2 replacement batteries phone still did not work.  Sent replacement phone, worked for the first charge and now it's dead.  If you plan on wearing the phone on a belt phone case, the phone will flip open on its own.
Beware!!  I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola, to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.  That said, you can't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it, and you can't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago.  I'll probably still use the Motorola for traveling, but if I were you I'd think long and hard about purchasing a product for which it's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty.
I can't say I had problems with this phone... being a former owner of the older version, V3. While both looked the same, the V3i have a lot of added features that, for a while confused me. But after a week of tweaking, I finally came to love the added features and was happy with it.While it's true that this phone is not MAC-friendly, I also found out that the Phone Tools software do not recognize it as an existing product of Motorola. Extra features aside, I got this phone because of the memory expandability that the V3 lacked. I'm one phone user who doesn't use whatever extras are stashed in to make a phone worthy of one's time... so long as I could make/receive calls; send/receive text messages, and listen to a bit of music. Internet access via the phone may be nice to some but not to me. That's just added expenses to my hefty monthly bill with AT&T.;To sum it up, this phone isn't the best there is out there but useful enough for my own needs. I'd buy another of this V3i, hands down (i.e., if I happen to have the extra cash to own a second unit). With Quadband frequencies-- it makes a good phone for travel outside America. Battery life is also a big plus. Some people could downplay this phone for what lacks but not me. :D
I have been using this product for over three years, I have bought a new V3i a second time after two years of use of an old V3i. Compared to the New Motorola V9 as well as countless other new phones on the market, the V3i still retains its glamour, as the V3i was marketed as a top-notch phone. It has longer battery life than the V9 and has all the features that are necessary in a cell phone.The durability of the V3i is also excellent. Cell phones with too many integrated electronics will be damaged easily. I had my first V3i crushed slightly by a car that drove too close to the curb. The front screen was slightly cracked, but the ballistic durability of the hard plastic is still surprising. The phone still worked perfectly. I then bought my second V3i, and fixed the old V3i. All the store had to do was replace the glass on the front screen and my old phone became as good as new again.I prefer the unlocked International version, which has slightly different menus and features and uses Digital Audio Player instead of the Apple iTunes software.
I have to give Motorola credit for the entire RAZR lineup, because it is definitely the coolest phone I've ever seen.  It created the market and improved it on each iteration.  So, design is five star, without question.  The phone itself makes calls, and the speakerphone is loud, as it should be.  I love the exterior LCD screen.And that's about it for likes.The dislikes are numerous for me, because I own a Nokia 3650, which at the time was the best phone you could get (2003).  Now it's outdated, but here's some interesting points:-my phone takes pictures of equal quality-sound playback is equal to my phone-I have unrestricted Java applet usage, including a MUCH larger library of available programs-my sync manager does much more than Motorola's, including much better integration with Outlook-my UI doesn't suckI've had my cell phone for five years, which is an ETERNITY for cell phones, but it's still not out-featured by this phone.  I tried to get an eBook reader for a RAZR and all I could find were sites that basically make you compile a JAR file and unlock your phone to transfer it... where it may or may not run.Contrast with my Nokia 3650: I downloaded a free eBook reader (Mobipocket) using Nokia's software (which can be downloaded for free from Nokia) and I was in business.  Vendor lock-in for cell phones is a big problem for me, and maybe it is for you, too.This is a stylish phone that epitomizes form over function.-C
I bought the L7 slvr last month from Amazon and it came in as advertise.  This phone is not bad.  Looks real smooth in black, easy to use and it sounds real clear.  The battery life is not bad as well.  I haven't charged it in 3 days with moderate usage and it still has one bar up.  One thing I would suggest is buying a case for it because it's easy to smudge fingerprints on the screen.  So far the phone is fine.  If you're looking for a basic phone with so-so bells and whistles this would not be a bad choice.
I'm not the super tech, iphone type, so I was really just looking for; Good reception, Cool looks, Decent Camera, Bluetooth, Good reception, Sturdy Build, Good Reception, ability to actually hear those talking to me and be heard, and a few other small frills. This phone really has me. Again if you're looking for extreme sofistication, go somewhere else. IF you want to be able to talk to people and look cool, get the Mto SLVR L7. Don't get it for the itunes junk, buy an ipod for your music needs. Umm, yea, I really really like it, best phone I've had so far, 5 star.
I am completely satisfied the phone worked in germany with no problems and is a very good quality and it was very much worth the small amount of money i spent.
Worked great, right out of the box with my SIM card. I had to do some modification to get iTunes on it, though.Through J&R; it came with a european plug w/american power adapter. Otherwise it looks just like the first couple of pictures on this page.I love this phone, I've had it for over 2 years and decided to get another one off Amazon. Buttons were small but I got used to them. It feels really well built and is very sturdy. Too bad they don't make these anymore...
I was a little upset with the fact that I had a perfectly fine MicroSD card, and yet the phone did not recognize it.  Online help said to reformat it on a computer, and I did reformat that, but when I tried to access my card from this phone, it did not work and asked me to reformat the card, only to fail and ask for a retry.Also, just because it seems all computer compatible doesn't mean it is: the Motorola phone software costs $35 extra.Also also, this phone came marked for Cingular, and was set to use their services.
the phone was in perfect shape , brand new but the ear phone were in  poor shape not able to use it , wire wrapped up with electric tape and didn't work at all.thanks
Great PhonE works every where i have been with great reception! you just can't send pics or get them in mail but thats okay!
I bought this because you can set it up for international calls. However, I have not needed to use it yet, but Motorola phones tend to be OK, so I am not concerned that it will have problems for what I need it for.
I haven't received anything. Frankly, the calling to get reimbursed or see why the phone hasn't arrived is not worth my time.
I got 200 tracfone minutes from my sister this past christmas. I went out and picked up a phone, seeing as it was only $15 anyway. When i turned on the phone i got an 'insert sim' message. i went through troubleshooting and did everything it told me to. i then called and after a few robots, talked to someone. they told me it was normal and would work by tomorrow. he set up my account and put in my minutes while i was talking to him. days went by and still nothing. i called again and they forced troubleshooting on me. i couldnt get one answer out of anyone so i talked to a supervisor and they sent me a new sim card. now i have this new sim card but all my info is on my old one. i talked to someone for about an hour, putting in codes that accomplished nothing. they told me i had to wait 2 weeks so they could file an investigation on my case. i needed to talk to a supervisor to add minutes to my phone and the entire time i was treated like a liar and called ma'am every 2 sentences despite my obvious deep voice. the entire process of being able to have a quick and affordable phone took over a month. overall their service is terrible, and  their product hardly works. my mother also has one and i tried to set up her account online but it wouldnt go through. i needed to call and put in a handful of codes again. after all this trouble I can only make outgoing calls. I was able to get a call earlier today... but when i called it half an hour ago and when my friend called me the other night, there was a message saying i'm not taking calls.  also, if you ever want to set up a voicemail or anything on your phone, you have to use YOUR minutes. you cant use a LAN line or anything. thats a long time with the elaborate "you're probably a moron so let me slow it down for you" instructions they give for setting up a voicemail. I set mine up and the voice went on about different features of the phone, trying to drag out your minutes so you can go buy some more. and if you decide to buy this phone you'll most likely be put on hold while you see what the problem with your phone is and you'll hear them actually say "with tracfone, you really do get what you pay for" in between the holding music. I recommend this product to anyone who has done me wrong. go get virgin mobile if you want a cheap, reliable and easy to use phone. my girlfriend sets all her information online and everything works the way its supposed to.
I bought this phone because I was sick of Sprint's contracts. It has been great for the following reasons:- cheap ($13)- superb coverage: I travel coast to coast and even get service in the backwoods of rural Alabama (Costa Rica too)- battery lasts and lasts (and lasts)- easy to useAll I wanted was a phone that worked.  After previously owning the $700 mini-computer type phone I was ready to kick 'em all to the curb but this has been great.  If you're tired of the high charges and contract hassles, give this a try.  I spent $100 on 1200 minutes and a year's worth of service.The only caveat to this service is that you get dinged for an entire minute even if you only used 2 seconds of it.  But with all the other good stuff that it does have, that little detail doesn't bother me a bit!
First of all, I am not a cell phone person. I only use mine for out going calls. I buy the yearly service from Tracfone, $96 for 400 minutes and a years service. BUT, before you order do a search on "Tracfone coupons" or "Tracfone promo codes". There is always a promo code for 200 free minutes out there. Now you have 600 minutes and a years service for $96 plus tax. You can always add minutes if you exceed the 600 minutes. Also if you don't use your 600 minutes during the year, the remaining minutes will carry over to the next year when you purchase another years contract. So, if your use your cell phone on a limited basis, I would recommended Tracfone. I have never had a dropped call or not been able to connect.
I have owned a tracfone for a long time now and find it gives great service. It's very economical on my budget with no monthly bill to pay. It gets good reception and I have no problems making calls from any location. I highly recommend the tracfone to anyone who doesn't want to have a monthly phone bill. try a tracfone.....you'll like it.
I have a Motorola C 139 Tracfone which I bought for emergencies since I have a heart condition. I have found the phone to be reliable and sturdy. I dropped in on concrete twice and never phased it. I can hear better on the Motorola C 139 then I can on my land line house phone. I text message which is great because I'm partially deaf. It is basic phone, but for what I use it for, it is just what I need and at $6.66 dollars a month I pay for service, you can't get one any cheaper that works as good.
If you do decide to buy this phone, never let the airtime due date pass. Every time you add minutes to the phone it adds a certain # of days to the expiration date of the minutes. I barely missed the date and it has been total chaos trying to reactivate the phone and buy airtime since. We've had to call customer service several times to try to get the phone working again. It's still not working at the time. Well, if your commited to not letting the expiration date pass, then I would say it is a good phone. If you don't need all the extra features like web access and things, I would considerate it a good, simple, easy-to- work-phone.
May rating would be 0 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that option.While it's convenient to have a pay-as-you-go phone plan, the service and equipment provided by Tracfone is abysmal!I have had three Motorola phones that have not even lasted a year. Customer Service - no such thing. The solution for most issues is to sell you equipment. Most representatives speak, but do not understand English.FYI - Net10 is the same company.
The Trac-Fone 's I bought were in perfect condition and on time just as the seller promised. I love them. Thanks ever soo much!
The connection is good only at home. 20 miles away from home, you get connection only by LUCK. Do NOT depend on it.To add airtime from Tracfone is extremely painful:If add it from their website (most of time it ends up ERROR and ask you to call the service representative), the webpage asks a lot of unnecessary information, then sends hundreds digits you have to key in to your cell phone.If add it thru calling their service representative, the representative will try to STEAL YOUR IDENTITY by ask you all unrelated information. Besides credit card and your cell phone ID, they ask:* Name* Address* Other cell phone numbers* Social Security Number!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Birthday?????????????????If you refuse to answer the question, they will argue that 'Our System Requires It'. Who cares about their system? I do care about my own IDENTITY SAFETY.However, if you still want to jump into the trap, there is a way to beat their stealing:***** Besides credit number and you cell phone ID, give them all FAKE information. ****I tried the strategy, and it works
Let me start out by saying that I got this phone just under a week ago, so I'm a new user and I haven't tried everything out yet.  But overall this is the best cell phone I've ever seen.  I've owned a few dozen phones over the years, got my first when I was 16 in 1996 and have upgraded over and over again.  This is the third time that I bought a phone over the internet from a place other than the cell phone companies page and the first good experience.  The other two were on eBay, and I know you can get it cheaper there but the first one turned out to be a refurb and the second had problems and neither lasted 6 months.  Amazon is a good place to buy because they will take it back and issue a refund if there is a problem, they pay the shipping on broken returns so you don't have to worry about paying anything if you get a dud.I have Cingular, and yes this phone did work immediately without any problems.  I do not have the data service (I don't use text messages, e-mail or web) because my work phone gives me that for free, so I can't comment on those features or on how you set the phone up to work with them.First impression:  The phone looks great!  Not as great as the picture though for one reason:  The speaker, which I was assuming was charged by a EMF and worked without wires, is wired through the clear part.  However, the wires look like a frame drawn on the clear part so it doesn't look bad.  The phone functions great, and comes with everything I need except games (I'm looking for some good card and skill games for it now).  It came with an international charger, which I don't trust so I tossed it in a box and kept using my old phone charger (which was the same).  It also came with a sync cable, which is a growing trend in Motorola phones that have any PDA functions and one which I am pleased to see.The software functions very intuitively.  When I open the screen it brings up a dialpad with a redial button.  If I clear that, it brings up my last call.  If I clear that, it takes me to my various call lists (missed, dialed, received).  If I clear that I get to a home screen.  I can also just hit end and it goes to the home screen.  The home screen is nice, but it has 4 hotkeys that you can program and it would be nice if it could have more or less depending on your needs.  It also has a grayed out background which, if tapped, overrides the screen for you to see it, then goes back when tapped again.  Cleaning the screen is a problem because I keep hitting keys, a key lock button would have been nice to relieve this.The settings menu is well laid out, except it took me forever to figure out how to set the clock (it didn't download the time from Cingular, perhaps because of the lack of internet settings).  Look through all the menus, you'll find it.  I forget where I did, but I was standing in a line for 10 minutes and in that time I set everything up including the elusive clock...I haven't tried music or videos yet, I'll update my review when I get around to that, and when I get some games on it.I took the phone to Disney (my old phone broke 2 days before we were going, thanks Amazon Prime overnight shipping for $3.99!)  The battery said 100% for two days including at least 3 hours of talk and 2 hours of playing around with the menus.  Then it suddenly dropped to 50% (I guess it isn't such a great meter) and stayed there until the night when I decided to charge it, so I can't say how long it lasted but I think that is pretty good for a phone (my last needed a daily charge to make it).  I'll charge it daily anyway, since I'm used to it.Overall, I would reccomend this phone to everyone out there, but I like being the "only person on my block" to own it, so I'll tell you not to buy it instead  :-)More details to come in a month or so when I have really tested everything out!
You can't beat this phone for features and that is what lead me to purchase it but now I can't wait to get rid of it.The phone comes in some other language (Chinese I think) so you have to guess your way around to convert to English. Not too difficult if you know what to look for.Then I had a problem with the memory card (1G), and still am, which I purchased seperately. I tried contacting Motorola for support and was rudely informed that Motorola USA does not support this model. They didn't even direct me where/who to go to.The amount of steps I have to take to make a call. Sometimes I think I am finished and while waiting for a connection I realize I have another step before the call is made.The processing speed is slowwwww[...] It is frustrating.Lucky me, I found someone who wants to buy it, even after I told them about the draw backs. I am going back to my good old faithful Razor.Don't waste your money.
Motorola A1200 Ming Black Phone (Unlocked)I lost my cell phone recently on a camping trip and since I still had many (MANY) months on my contract, was not permitted to upgrade with my service provider.  As their "full retail" phones started in the mid to high $200's I thought I might as well try to find a phone that really worked as a phone.  Enter the Motorola A1200, or The Ming!I have never purchased an unlocked phone and was concerned that it would not work on my network (my service provider- AT&T;/Cingular) as it was never released in the US.  I called the retailer (JR Electronics out of NY) and they assured me it worked on my network as well as others that used the standard SIM card.  SO I went ahead and took the plunge.This phone is AWESOME!  Out of the box, it was completely in Chinese characters - this scared me a wee bit - but after pressing just about every button, I finally found one that said English and as if by magic, I could read the menus!  It immediately found my network and I have had no problem with it at all.  In fact, as a phone, it has the best reception I have ever had with a cell phone, and I have been through many.  My home is a terrible dead zone, and my wife still gets very little reception there but the Ming works like a charm.It is also a very sleek and easy to use phone.  I love the way it looks - very Star Trek savvy - but would agree with some of the reviewers, it is difficult to open the cover with one hand.  A benefit of that, however, is it never gets stuck on clothing, accidently opening, a problem I have had with many other flip-phones. In fact, my only complaint would be every time I am checking my voicemail, I receive a blank text message.  I am not sure the purpose of this message nor have I yet to figure out how to stop it from happening.Although it is a PDA phone and I do sync with my outlook, I am not a heavy PDA user, using it only for an address book.  One cool feature that really works is the business card scanner.  The camera on the phone takes a picture of a business card and parces out the information into your contacts.  This works well, as long as your hand is steady and the business card is fairly standard.All in all, for a cell phone, I don't think you can top the Motorola Ming.  Maybe in the future they will add Wifi to the package, making it a more excellent work phone!
The phone and its capabilities are perfect and then some but the few options that are not compatible with our(US) network is a slight downer. For what's it's worth though it is still definitely a great buy.
I LOVED this phone... it was everything I have looked for in a cell & pda ... it looked gorgeous. It was user friendly and I thought I was going to have a long relationship with it.. EXCEPT.. It  wouldn't charge!... I plugged it in.. the phone lit up.. but wouldn't charge... so I emailed amazon. They were fantastic, replied the same day (a Friday) and I received a new one on the Monday. They just asked me to send the other one back.The new one arrived on the Monday it charged beautifully. I went on vacation and used it once.  I put it (fully charged) into my suitcase not needing it on vacation... Upon my return I went to use it.. the battery had died. I thought maybe because it hadn't been used for three weeks.. I charged it again.. Used it ONCE, to check text messages, made one 1 minute call.. and later in the day. I looked at it .. it was dead.. the battery had died.. so in effect it held its life for one use...I emailed Amazon. they told me to send it back as they had received similar comments.. they gave me a full refund.Deeply disappointed as the Ming has the potential to be wonderful!.. and it looks so sleek and hot too!.. darn.
Not much to say about this phone...if you are a geek like me its great and easily hackable...screen is bright..the camera being 2 mega takes great photos...as a phone its clear as a bell....take note..only takes 2 gig mini sd...wont support higher....would I buy it again.....yup....Love it....Esta
This phone does everything i need and more. I have it working with my tmobile service. If you're not that computer savy you might run into a little trouble setting internet and sms, mms service. since tmobile does not support the phone. But you can find everything online. Motorolafans.com is one sight that caters almost exclusively to the a1200. Only dislikes that i have with the phone is texting. It's almost impossible to use your fingers. you have to you use the stylus. and the screen and clear flip cover smudges so easily. Besides those small things, the phone is top notch! A couple of my friends seen it along with all the features, and they are hooked. Not many people know about this phone which makes it even better. I'll take this over the Iphone (which is everyone has) anyday. If you have trouble with the memeory card. Use a Kingston brand. the phone recognizes that one. It can also take a 2gig kingston card!
This phone came with everything on the description.  It is multi-functional, sleek looking, compact and the PDA functions is just fine.  I charged the phone right after it arrieved but found out it has a chinese interface (so I suspect it is from HongKong?).  Luckly I do read chinese and know how to change that into an English interface. The big disappointment is the camera function.  It does not have a built-in flash so you can only take picture under bright condition.  Otherwise the pictures seem out of focus.  What a waste for the 2-megapixal resolution. For the same reason the business card reader does not work as well (it uses the camera lense for reading). My other phone, Mio GPS/PDA phone, works a lot better in many ways.  The catch for buying an unlocked phone is that you need to call the phone company in order to have internet function activated. I do recommand it since it still out-perform other handsets on the market for its price.
The phone is a really nice looking phone that I am glad to say I own mainly because no one else I know has it. I'm unable to give reviews on its processing speed venturing online since I do not use that feature very much where I am here in Europe but the main thing that breaks my heart about this phone is that it is not text friendly. Because of that I will have to get me another phone. The touch screen is great but the qwerty pad on the screen has very very tiny letters which slows down the process.Also the camera is very sensitive to movement while taking pictures but I'm pleased with video recording on it because I'm able to record videos on it up to 30 minutes if I wanted to. I would say it's a decent smart phone but my main reason for 3 stars is the qwerty on it. other than that I will continue to use this phone for other reasons.
For me I wanted a phone that was small in size, looked nice, did some things and had a MP3 player.  I dont need the most tekkie phone, I'm not interested in WIFI emails or internet surfing so wanted a fairly simple phone.this is SUPERB! took an hour or so to convert from Chinese langauage as the manual is crap and does not include this info so I went online and found a forum which answered that one.  the internal phone memory is almost nonexistent so you must buy a memory card to out anything on.  Battery life if you play the MP3 for over 5 hours in a day is draining but I always charge my phone every night anyway.business card reader is a nice touch and I love the look and feel and the touchscreen is perfect with the stylus - not so accurate with my fingers for the smaller things.I love this phone, everyone I know wants one now!
My wife is SUPER happy with the phone; very advanced technology. Touchscreen and pencil makes it very easy and fun to use. Voice recognition, built-in camera, agenda, etc. Good reception also.
This is one of the most innovative and brilliantly put-together phones I've ever used.  I switched to the A1200 after using the Motorola Q for several years.  The A1200 is elegantly-designed, very responsive (which often cannot be said about other Motorola phones), and comes with a tremendous amount of features.  Additionally, because it is linux-based, there is a lot of additional software that can be added to the phone for free, and there are several websites dedicated to "modding," or customizing, the A1200.
I bought this phone twice.. first i got the black one then the red one...it has everything you expect a cell phone would have...nice size for a touch phone.....2 Mega pixel camera....external memory....and more!! you wont regret buying it i promise...works for T-Mobile perfectly and for all carriers that use SIM Cards..
I got this phone for my husband last year.  He loves it!  Uses it to sync his calendar(outlook) with his computer.  Uses it for a dayplanner and loves the stylus.I would agree it might not be great for texting but we don't do much of that.I think it is the best phone around.  I can't believe it isn't really sold in the USA.  Also since it is unlocked we can use it in Europe(with a different card).
A very attractive phone with lots of good features, but quite a few problems.  The touch screen is great, sound quality and basic phone functionality are all great.  The PDA functions are not so great -- not a fan of Motoroal phone tools - which will synch contacts with both my Outlook and Lotus Notes -- but will not synch the calendar with either.  There are a lot of petty annoyances -- the voice recognition is terrible, no speed dial, the calendar is almost unusable, setting up the browser is difficult, the phone came set-up for Chinese -- finding the change language to english screens was not totally obvious.  On the plus side, the MP3 player is great, the radio is great,
This phone is pretty awesome, especially considering the low price for a touchscreen phone. The touch screen is nice and has a stylus that comes with. I usually use my finger unless i'm typing a text message. very beautiful phone and interface. would recommend to all. The plug for the charger is a mini usb so it's compatible with many plugs. The box comes with a usb cord, charger, european plug adapter, stereo headphones with a mic, and two software cd's.
This phone is very easy to use,the best phone i've ever had.No english manual but i still figured it out easily.Go get one people,you wont regret it.
This cell is perfect for me, but i wish i could add more languages... and I don't know how...
this is a great phone, it works well, it looks ever so pretty.  it's way to expensive for what is in essence a pdf with a phone.  if you like the beautiful look to the phone and don't mind paying the cost, get it.  but, if you are not rich, and need something that does all the things this does, get a cheaper phone.  i think there are $150 (almost half the cost) that do them better.
The Ming was great, I like the phone.  But it didn't work with my sim card and I could not get the text nor the pictures to work with the phone, even when I went to At & T!  So I was very disappointed.
I bought this phone for my son and he loves it.  The features are great.
The following are my first impressions.This is the first time I've ever purchased a smart phone.  I just received my A1200 yesterday and all in all I would have to say, I'm very happy.  Aesthetically the phone is very pleasing although it's fair to say that's more of a personal thing.  It also feels good in the hand, smooth to the touch and just the right weight.  The screen is bright and easy to read, I haven't tried it outside while the sun is shining so I'm not sure if the screen will still be as legible.I don't do a tremendous amount of texting, preferring to communicate by voice but I can imagine for those of you who are stalwart two finger texters this phone may be a little problematic.  With that in mind, I would agree with other reviewers this phone may not be well suited to avid texters.When the phone arrived, the display was in Chinese and it took a few minutes to get it to the English setting but it wasn't a big deal.  I also received the European charger with it, someone had put what they thought was an adapter that would fit over the two horizontal prongs at the top of the plug but of course it didn't fit.  Thankfully my old Moto. Razr chargers work just fine.  I also purchased a 1gig SD card.I've had no problems syncing the phone with my PC, I installed the Motorola Phone Tools software, downloaded the updates and off I went. I even managed to download a wav. file and install a new ring tone with no problems at all.  There are quite a few recourses on the web for those of you who wish to change the theme of the phone or the wallpaper, just Google A1200 themes or A1200 wallpaper.The Business Card Reader may cause you some problems, apparently it was set up for more of Chinese style of business card so it may have problems grabbing the address of English style cards, at least that's what the scuttlebutt is on the net.Although I haven't thoroughly investigated all the bells and whistles other reviewers have I've initially given this phone 4 stars because for a user like me, it has everything I need, it looks good, feels good and the voice quality is just fine.
The other reviews say everything about the pros (& some of the cons): Real Player & other cool software etc. I have never been bothered about how fast the phone was, but I am bothered by this: when someone calls me and I pick up the phone, I  have to wait 1-2 seconds before the call connects (with my previous phones, the calls connected as soon as I picked them up). If you say 'hello' as soon as you open the flip to answer a call, your caller will not hear that 'hello'! I have puzzled quite a few of my callers by seemingly appearing to be non responsive because of this problem! You have to wait about 1-2 seconds to give time to the call to connect (a good landmark is when the call duration displayed on the screen is 1 second). That's frustrating, but after I noticed that glitch, I adapted myself to it. Try calling yourself to your Ming to see. (I am unable to say if this is due to a defect to my phone only, or if this is true for all Mings.)But otherwise, I am happy with this phone.
My experince with a1200 have only one problem that Motorola have to fix. Battery has not good performance, it's only for 2, max 3 days. Also, when it's going low, you don't have to much time or chance to get charge until total discharge.The heahset button didn't work, I wonder if it happends with otherOtherwise, every aplication is practical, linux is easy, good cel
I love this phone. Because I'm not very tech geared I had minor problem setting my internet with my att account. But faq section on motorola really help where the techs at att could not.  Now i'm up & running.  I can use my sd memory card to get set my ringtones to music I already have-no more purchasing ringtones Yeah!.  only draw back is I can't figure out how to get games-none seem to be compatible to the phone.  Otherwise great phone & pda
Fast shipping...the only issue that i had with this mobile is the menu came in chinesse!!...And i had to spend hours trying to decode the menu...besides that, everything ok....
This is my best phone yet!!! It's sleek, lightweight,has all the features you could need, like memory card, playlist for your tunes etc... It connects to the net, email, the whole works, everything a blackberry can do and more.  Really soft on the eyes not bulky at all!!All my friends are in love with it!!!So am I!!
I love this phone, I'm on my third one, unfortunatly they can't take the abuse I dish out. The computer like interface is so much more intutive than the razor I used to have. The size and feel of this phone is perfect. The only thing that could make it better is wifi and US warranty.
This is the WORST phone I have EVER used.Short battery lifeRandomly scrolls through menus in cold weatherSends random blank text message to itself after voice mail is checkedRandomly turns offWhen it is turned back on, all ringtones resetNo backup keys for when the screen goes bad - and it does go bad.  the display on the screen randomly moves over or down rendering half of the display unusable.Keyboard too small to use while moving.Poor sound quality - A LOT of background noiseDoes not hold a signal - literally signal goes to 1 bar whith active line, hang up and watch the signal go to full bars instantly...Notification for voice mail does not go away after messages are checked - needs to be cleared manually.First I thought it was just a lemon, so I returned it and got another... The second phone produced the same results.  I'm throwing mine in the Hudson.  I recommend a MotoMing Tea Party!
Everything about this phone is excellent since i had it i never had a problem with it. It's easy to use the sound is excellent and the touch screen is perfect one tap and it open's the link that you want when other touch screen phone's you have to tap a couple of times for it to open. I don't need to talk about the look of the phone yall can see that for your self.
Motorola A1200 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD--International Version with No Warranty (Ming Black)I love my motorola A1200, just wish it was possible to download a european keyboard, and that the battery lasted longer. Otherwise I'm hooked.
This is a very nice phone, which only i could state against the fact of having to turn it off to charge the battery .That's despite i haven't started playing around with all the customization software that's hanging around.Of course, i spent the first 10 minutes trying to change the default language from chinese to english .Pablo .
I bought this for my teenage son.  He loves it and it seems to have a ton of cool features and capabilities.
The phone is fine, but the service was excellent.I was impressed that a refund was processed so seamlessly and so quickly; customer satisfaction is obviously your major concern...as it should be!Thanks very much.Carlos G. SANTOS
It was hard to find the U.S. conversion button because it was written in Mandarian, otherwise, the phone had alot of sassy features.
Bought this phone for my 15 year old! She absolutley LOVED it, loves everything it will do!  Would recomend!
Doesn't work with iSync. Doesn't work with OSX Bluetooth File transfer. Sad.Hours wasted trying to make it work. Save your money.
I owned this phone for less than two months before having problems with it. The first problem was terrible battery life followed by no signal. (even when standing under a cell site) I finally sent it in for repair. It came back with a note claiming it was not econimical to repair and that the warranty was void siting corrosion. In the short two months that I had it it was never in a corossive environment. I have since learned of other people that have had the same problem with Nokia's failure to honor their warranty.
I have owned this phone for over a year and  a half now and it still works great! When i got it, i thought the flip button opening would break in a few days, but, yes, it has lasted. Its the one thing that sets this phone apart from any other! I have mainly used this phone for taking pics and vids....i had a baby and have caught his entire first year on the phone, i have dev a lot of pics from it and the quality is amazing! I even take vids but the problem is that you need to first download a 3pg player in order to play on the comp...also, if you sent vids through email, you need to be certain that the person u have emailed to also has the 3gp player downloaded, otherwise it wont work.I also use the MP3 of this phone a lot...the sound is clear and the speakers are loud enough to be heard while jogging in the park or runnin on a treadmill at home (meaning if you decide not to use the headphones.)Another great thing about this phone is its durability. It has gone through thick and thin (a lot of drooling on when my son plays with it...) and yet it has held up.I really recommend this phone to anyone who needs a functional phone that will last and doesnt confuse you!
Im located at the philippines and it is very rare for people here to have this kind of phone, but I never had to think twice when I decided to purchase this phone. it really works good. the signal is very good, the speaker phone is good. the camera resolution is really great and the mp3 player works really fine. My friends wants to have this knid of phone too after I purchased it and they saw the features. this is the best phone I ever got..
This is one amazing phone. I've had it for close to 3 years now and I'm very happy with it's durability and the features. I use every feature on this phone and it's amazing how versatile it is. Since it's an unlocked phone, if you get the cheap internet with your phone service provider, you can do even more. I pay $4.99 a month for internet from T-Mobile. With that, you can do push email, instant messanging (using the web, so it does not count as text messages), browse the web using the downloadable Opera Mini Browser (it's free to download). You can download programs for free from the Sony Website such as Google Maps. I've used this many times to get directions to places. It has a fm radio (downside is you have to attach an antenna to hear it, which is annoying), great as an mp3 player (once you add a memory stick to it, I added an 8GB one, which you can store thousands of songs on it),  It has a flashlight, which I find very handy at times.The way the menu's and the settings are organized on the phone it's very easy to get used to. Before having a Sony Ericsson phone, I've had 6 phones from different manufacturers and I find the Sony to be so easy to figure out.I also have dropped this phone over 50 times easily on many various surfaces and heights. With the exception to the scratches, it still works great.The BAD side of this phone..the size of the screen is too small to browse the web comfortably, if you want fast internet you will not get it with this, cannot stream video from the web, the camera is not good in low lighting because the flash is weak. The operating system of the phone seems to lag at times.For the price of this phone now, around $200 (if you check on ebay), it's very well worth it. I paid a lot more for it at the time it came out, but no regrets.
I have used several Nokia phones for work and had bought a Sony Ericsson T310 for personal use as it offered (and delivered) ridiculously long battery life: an average of 11 or so days without charging (I don't do long conversations on cell phones), an intuitive interface and all the features I needed then. Years later I was forced to change the phone (dropped it too many times) and natually another Sony Ericsson was the first choice. Based on the price and features I settled on the W800 series since I was now walking with two phones and a Walkman radio. I did a poll of the persons I knew with non-basic phones and the majority responded that the Sony Walkman phones were the phone of choice for persons who didn't like Motorola phones. In fact persons who had owned them stated that they LOVED their phones. Cutting a long story short, I bought this phone from Amazon in January, I've had no problems since the purchase and I LOVE this phone. The intuitive interface and the 'info' option for most menu items meant I only had to read the manual (a month later) to see what other features were on the phone otherthan those I figured out on my own. This phone meets all my media needs (FM radio, MP3, 2MP camera) so I just plug it into the MP3 jack on my car radio and I'm good to go. I'm definitely going to get the 2GB expansion card... My only minor complaint is that the connection interface only allows one item to be connected at a time; a non-issue really...
I PURCHASED THIS PHONE AND IT IS NOT FUNCTIONING.  I SENT AN EMAIL WITH MY SITUATION AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN A REPLY.  EVERY YEAR  I PURCHASE FROM AMAZON AND THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED SUCH SERVICE.  I PAID FOR THIS PHONE AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH IT.  UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT RECEIVE THE PHONE UNTIL AFTER THE RETURN TIME.  I AM PRESENTLY NOT IN THE US AND HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE COULD HAVE BROUGHT IT FOR ME.  I AM NOW LOOKING FOR A SONY ERICSSON STORE THAT CAN HELP ME TO REPAIR IT.  I STILL NEED HELP ON THIS
I got this phone 2 yrs ago becase of the MP3 and radio.(You'll need to purchase more memory.) I love, love, love it. I plug it in to my car stereo every day, the sound quality is awesome and the radio is also nice. The picture quality from the camera is excellent. Call quality is excellent; although, I wish the speaker was a bit louder. Besides that, I haven't had a problem in 2 years. Normally, I'm an electronics junkie, and can't wait to get a new phone after my contract has expired, but I'm going to keep this one until it's on it's last legs.
I bought this phone over a year ago, and absolutly no complains about it, my only regret on it was never activating a security option of block the phone is the sim is changed, why?, because they stole it a few months ago and now someone else is having fun with it.
I agree with almost all previous positive comments, so there's no reason to rewrite those.  There is a tiny drawback that a potential buyer should be aware of: The data transfer is at USB1 speed and thus too slow. Since you are unlikely to use this phone for any heavy-duty data transfer it is ignorable. Besides, you could copy your data directly from your MS card it could be avoided. However, this may become a problem if you want to upload music directly, and not by the SE-provided software. Then, unless you encoded your MP3 files with a compatible encoder and at a 192 or less bitrate, the phone is unable to play continuously. So, in effect, you'll have to use the SE-provided software. Still, this does not take away from other nice features of the phone.
I bought this phone as a gift for my boyfriend and he is just crazy about it. It has a lot of cool features and it is very compact.
took a few configeration downloads from tmobile site, got it working, i am so happy i took the leap oSony Ericsson W810-Black Phone (Unlocked) of faith and purchased an unlocked phone, best phone ever , walkmans rule,
This item stated it came with a head set, etc.  They were not included.  The phone was a nightmare from the start. After getting the battery and sim up and running, I began to use it.  In the middle of each and every call I made or received, the phone, without warning would begin to dial another number in my address book or my voice mail.  This was always during a conversation. The other party on the phone could hear what was happening.  I lasted with it less than a week and am now looking for a way to get a refund.  Not sure if I can since it's unlocked and came with no warranted.  clearly it was a lemon.  Be careful with these phones.Joanne
ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO I BOUTHG A V3 RAZOR AND I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM IS VERY GOOD PHONE
I really hate this phone. For the simple fact that the battery has to be recharged every night. For the money I spent on this thing, the battery should be a whole lot better than what it is. I did not buy my phone for this seller so I don't know about the quality of his stuff (By the looks of it, not very good either). I bought mine at a Verison store (brand new). IMHO, this phone sucks! That's just my 2 cents. Should have read the reviews on this phone before I bought it. BUYER BEWARE!!
This just wat I was looking for. I brought it for a friend in Jamaica. I will by another one soon. and I know where to get the one I want.
I had washed my previous phone it was in the washer for a day before I found it. I still had a year before I could get a new phone from AT&T.; They told me I could buy any phone I wanted on the  Internet and just put my sim card in and go. I found my exact same phone. I'm thrilled.
Thank you Amazon.  You were back ordered when I purchased this, the phone shipped long before you told me it would.  My wife loves it.
My girlfriend has been wanting a new cell & when we saw this one for $99 she couldn't pass it up!  I know it's an international phone but was really surpised when everything (manuals, quick guides, etc.) where in Italian but whatever a quick Google search & I had the language changed to English & I was on my way to programming it to work on the AT&T; network.  I bought an unlocked cell from Amazon before so I knew I wouldn't have a problem getting it to work with AT&T;, took all of 10 minutes to input all the needed info & she was in business.  This phone overall is pretty sweet, even thinking of picking up a black one for myself.  Can't say anything negative about it, but for reviewing sake I'll nit-pick & say that expandable memory would be nice & maybe a better camera but she's not one that lives & dies by her cell's camera, she wanted a cell that not everyone had & she wanted a pink phone, this definitely fit the bill!
feels good in your hand......looks good BUT I couldn't use it because my sim card is old technology and my company won't upgrade me without changing my plan.... so if you have the same issue, don't get it!!!! Can wiht Italian wording which I didn't attempt to change cuz I sent it back.
It's a great phone - the only annoyance was that it wanted to text in italian and it was a pain to figure out how to change all the language defaults to english.  that said, it wasn't a big deal and i'm very happy with it.
loved this phone - works fine with my current service (T mobile) has great features and it's PINK!
Well, it was a basic working machine until suddenly and without any specific reason, display didn't work! So now it is like an ordinary phone set and I can't read the contacts and all numbers!
If I could give it 3.5, I would.I've had this phone since August 2006.  It was my first cell phone at age 18.  I can't afford a plan, so the prepaid plan works for me.The phone works great for me.  But I have 2 problems.  First, the battery life is not that great.  If I leave my phone on all night, when I wake up, I have low to no battery life left.  My second problem with the phone is how the ringtones sound.  I have bought so many ringtones of songs I like.  They sound great online of course, but then I play them on my phone and they sound like crap.  I do have some ringtones that sound great still, have static though it isn't a big deal.  However, for example, all my Evanescence ringtones don't come out right.It is a good phone though.  The graphics are great and it has really good features.  I just wish it came in other colors or was slimmer.  It is too lumpy in my pockets.  (I will admit I want another phone, one that is purple and has a camera, but those all have plans attached.  Bummer)  Though the phone does the job.
Nice little phone. Does so much for the low price.  Virgin service & coverage is excellent!
I love this phone almost 2 years old now and no problems! Virgin is great too! I have several! Great for kids: just do text: $10 a month! no contracts no fees! it's freedom!
I bought the green version of this phone (was a Target Special, ~$18) about 2.5 years ago. This phone has been a gem. I've had no problems with battery life (lasts about a week on standby). However, I got the white version for both my parents and they did experience problems with battery life... I read somewhere that had to do with a specific version of the phone, unfortunately I don't remember the details. I use cell phones mainly to make calls on the run... I don't do text messaging,  the web, emails, etc... That's what computers are for in my world;) So the fact that this phone is really basic is a positive for me... I switched over to Virgin Mobile approximately 5 years ago, and I've been very pleased... I don't do much wireless calling, so paying by the minute has saved me hundreds of dollars per year versus my earlier contract deal with Sprint. I even got my parents (they're 70+) to switch over to Virgin... They also couldn't be happier.. We must be some of their oldest customers;)... This phone is $9.99 at Virgin's website, with free shipping... Don't pay a dime more.
I finally gave in and joined the portable phone era when I bought my very first one in Fall of '06 (the Virgin Oyster).  There were only a handful of requirements I had for this purchase:  I wanted to stay to be able to contact and be contacted while away from my home; I wanted to be able to text message; and I wanted a service plan that didn't require a long-term contract or the purchase of huge block of time.The Oyster fulfilled all these requirements and proved to a sturdy and reliable tool...that is, until one day recently (about 20 months after I first bought it) the display screen suddenly disappeared and never came back.  The phone still turns on, and makes and receives calls, but needless to say, without access to the ability to read and navigate menus, I lost access to any texting capabilities and my contact list.Before i wrote this review, I read through some other user's reviews about this phone and two mentioned having encountered the same problem of the disappearing display screen.  It's such a shame, too, that Virgin couldn't manufacture a dependable and durable piece of technology because i would have remained a customer of theirs, but now I doubt I will when I replace this phone.  Sure, the argument might be made that it was only a $20 purchase, but VM was getting about $100 dollars a year from me for their service, and because they couldn't even make a product that lasted for at least two years, now they won't.So if you are already own one of these phones, take this notice as a warning to be sure and copy your contact numbers, and either copy or forward any text messages you might want to save.
Virgin mobile deactivated 4 of my phones and never notified me. I had changed a credit card which was excepted on line on a MOnday and on Tuesday I tried to make a call and found out they turned off all of my phones. I called my credit card company and they said my card was fine and don't know why Virgin Mobile did this. I went back and forth with Virgin and even asked for them to take a different card and they refused. I said then connect me to customer service and they said I had to email them. It would take 24 to 72 hours to resolve this. I emailed several customer care and was told to call Virgin again. I thought they were crazy. I called and once again was told I couldn't do anything about it. So again another email and a return with the same answer. Finally I received a email a week later at a address called charge back,she asked what she could do and I said please send my credit card info back. Well it was done and I was never notified and they only activated one phone. I have 3 dead phones with a lot of money in them. I wouldn't go with this company because if anything ever goes wrong with your account it will take at least a month to resolve it. I am now with a different cell phone company and still trying to get these 3 other phones turned on so I can use up my minutes. I have over $300. invested in this company.
I bought this phone for my younger son.  It was perfect for him.  The buttons were big enough for him to use.  The phone was easy to set up and easy to use.  Virgin mobile is a great service also for just about any age of user.  They have great options and keep getting better!
We bought this phone in December of 2006 because we needed something to be able to call taxi's when we had our car stolen.  It eventually became a second phone because we loved the service so much.  I used this phone specifically for five months and then gave it to my husband and then got another VM phone.  I had no problems for those five months and the battery life was nothing like what other people were experiencing.  What others fail to realize about battery life on any phone is, if you are constantly searching for signal, have your phone in your pocket, purse, etc. it's going to eat the battery on the phone.  If you live in an area with bad signal, it will deplete the battery faster then normal, just like a laptop when you are using the internet, the wireless (because it's always searching for signal) will make the battery life less.Overall, the features of the phone are basic, can download ringtones, graphics and that's about it.  It does come with a few games (which I can't even get to now..more on that later) and it's compact, stylish and great for a prepaid phone.  Overall, for the service I give 5 stars, but for this phone--I only give it three.It's cheap, we only paid 20 dollars and now today (about 14 months later) the screen turned a bluish hue on it.  About a few minutes later, I restarted the phone and it just shows black as if the backlight had finally burnt out on it.  A phone should last much longer then this, BUT for it being only 20 dollars and lasting more then a year...I guess we really can't complain.
I am one of those crazy Ye Olde Tymey Gen-Xers who just want a phone that rings and such.  I feel like a real fancy boy because I can do a bit of flippage with this phone.  It works great for a cheap piece of (expletive).If you are like me and hate using a cell phone, and think all of the unnecessary bells and whistles are useless, than here we go, it's fun time.  BTW - all the chicks dig it, especially Rhode Island Reds.P.S. if you don't know what a Luddite is, look it up and learn something for a change.
Lets be straight; this tiny phone was bought for one reason, to replace my main phone of a 2-year plan that is beyond its one-year warranty.  Nevermind any of the reasons why the original phone is dead, at the end of the day, it would cost almost $150 to replace it thru my service provider, or anymore else for that matter.I needed a cheap unlocked phone to last the next 3 months for when I can have a free replacement if I re-sign my 2-yr contract.  This phone is it. It has some minor games, the keypad isn't too small, and the sound is crystal clear with an excellent speaker.That being said, I wouldn't buy this phone just to have. The menu is hard to understand, the keylock doesn't seem to work, saving phone numbers is tedious and limited.
I bought the Nokia 1600 to replace a fancy-pants Motorola V600 that went haywire when the hinge became loose (after 3 years). Moving parts always break first, so no more clamshell phones for me.The 1600 is no-frills, but it's really a gem. The phone's sound quality and screen are both excellent. I can also confirm the previous review regarding battery life: It seems to last forever and charges very quickly, too. (And it's so good to be free of that horrible Motorola charger connector.)Only one complaint: The UI isn't the finest I've seen. Too many menus I just don't care about and which I haven't found a way to disable or hide forever. (But then maybe I should read the manual. ;)The only feature I miss is Bluetooth for syncing, but that's not a complaint. I knew it was missing.
As most reviewers have noted, this is a basic phone with a lot going for it. It is cheap and unlocked. It's small and light. The battery life is excellent. You get at least one bar in most places and usually a lot more, so I'm saying it detects a signal very well. Most importantly, no dropped calls as of yet. That's a biggie for me. My motofone f3 dropped calls and that is why I replaced it with this Nokia.If you just want basic features to make/receive calls and text messages, you'll be very satisfied with the Nokia 1600. I took one star off because I'd like to see still better signal strength. I have an old Nokia 6061 which seems even better in that department.
Overall, this is a good, cheap, basic phone.  It works fine for text messaging and phone calls, which is about all I use my phone for anyway. It will keep a charge for 1-2 weeks if not used, and stays charged through even long phone calls.There are a few annoying quirks to this phone, though, and doing research on this phone before I bought it, I discovered others had a similar problems:1. If you reject the call, sometimes the phone will freeze and you'll need to turn it off and back on again.2. If you let the phone ring and don't answer a call, it will continue ringing indefinitely, even after the caller has hung up or left a voice mail message.  I've left my phone at home when I left for work, and got home in the afternoon with my phone still ringing from a 9:00am phone call.  If you try to answer it then, it freezes and/or makes the three-tone beep in your ear.3. The alarm clock doesn't work properly.  It likes to go off around 3:30am regardless of what time you set it for.  When it goes off at 3:30, you can check and it says the alarm is actually set for 6:30 (or whenever it was set for).  Sometimes it will go off at several different times during the night.*All of the above problems are intermittent, none of them happen every day.
I bought this phone for my wife last month (April 2008) and she has been very pleased so far.  We both have been using Nokias for years mainly because of their reliability, ruggedness & ease of use.  We also are out of our AT&T; contract so rather than be tied to another contract we decided to buy an unlocked phone.  Well, we got it and charged it up and slipped in her Cingular SIM Card (circa 2005)and it worked great.  She loves the compactness of the phone and the additional "bells & whistles" compared to her old Nokia bar phone from a few years ago.  Don't get me wrong this isn't another iPhone it is very basic but it is all she needs.  I too have an old Nokia bar phone and plan to order this same phone when I get a chance. Note: One nice surprise is Nokia includes a hands free ear piece in the box.  Also,all the old chargers from my previous phone still work with the 1600.
This is a great sturdy little phone.  It has lots of features, can use Bluetooth, and the setup and option menu is very user friendly.  This was to replace a rather fragile phone for our young disabled adult son.  He even commented on how easy it is to use and to change things on.  I'd highly recommend it.
Pros: Cheap and covers basic needs.Cons: None because of price, but it has a very small screen.
well i wanted a very basic phone and thats why i bought this one. Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are. the only problem is it hangs quite frequently when i receive a call. keypad wont work and i have to restart the phone everytime it hangs.I am in the process of sending this phone back..may be its one bad device but it sucks nevertheless. I wont buy it again.
nice cell phone. i like the compact and simple style. however, there is bug in the operating system. it does unexpected behaviors sometimes. other times it freezes and you need to turn off and turn on. i dont know if it is possible to fix by reinstalling operating system through USB connector.
My old phone had terrible reception ever since I had bought it.  Since I was going to be traveling, I wanted a reliable phone.  This phone got great reception and has everything I need in a phone.  Not alot of "bells and whistles," but has basics and the battery life is wonderful.  I used to have to recharge my old phone everyother day, this one lasts over a week before it needs a charge.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good phone with great reception thoughout the US.  FYI, I have AT&T; service.
Easy to use phone with a great battery life and fair price. I didn't need all kinds of bells and whistles. Keyboard letters a little small for texting but overall I am very satisfied. I did not want to be saddled with a 2 year extension from my cell phone provider so an unlocked phone was key..
I puchased this phone with the aid of the Amazon cell phone specialist and told him if was to be used with a SIM card in Europe and the Black Sea. He assued me it was an unlocked phone and if ordered with the appropiate SIM card also being offered by Amazon it would work. Needless to say it didn't work at all in Europe or the Black Sea area and when I contacted Moble, the SIM card company, they told me the phone would only work in the US. This was very poor advice from the Amazon cell phone expert and fortunatly we didn't have a serious emergency where we needed to be reached or had to call out. Also Amazon as not been cooperative in resovling this issue and allowing me to return the phone for full credit.
Considering this was a few years newer than my previous Nokia 3125, I figured it would have the same qualaties at the very least, if not better.  Unfortunately my old phone turned out to be far superior to the 1600.  This phone is similar, and I couldn't find the 3125 for less than at least one hundred dollars more, so I went with the cheaper model.  Long story short... it shows.  A lot of the things on this phone are the same.  The fact that I cannot save a text message, cannot view any kind of picture sent to me by another phone, and most importantly cannot send a text message without it taking numerous tries in just about any environment makes this phone kind of a downer.  I'm sure there are a number of other things about this phone that annoy me, but those are my main complaints.  I have had numerous brands and styles of cell phones, and after going through a number of options, I liked Nokia 3125 the best.  It was simple, intuitive, and fit my needs.  Hoping I could get the same quality in this phone for slightly less money, I gave up a lot in the quality department.  Don't get this phone unless you are down to your last 50.00 dollars and need something to communicate with.
I wanted a cell phone that worked well as a cell phone, with clear audio and good battery life. This is exactly what I got with this purchase. I am very pleased and recommend it.
If you are looking for the basic functions in less price,this is the best option.
When we first opened this we thought that we had made a big mistake because it was so light and cheap feeling.  However, it has surprisingly good sound quality and when you use the hands free earpiece it still works really well.
I got one of these in case something happened to my regular cell phone. Turned out it was needed, and it worked so well, I got another one to put away in the event that something goes wrong with this one.A great little phone for the money. Unlocked is great too. Sometimes no frills is nice. I am really pleased with this purchase.
If you are looking for a decent-unlocked cell phone this is a great one. I purchased it when my Sony Ericsson Cybershot broke and am using it until the new iPhone comes out. Big ups for Cingular/ATT for being intelligent enough to have SimCards so I didn't have to go through the store to make the change.
Fantastic! can't ask more for the price I paid.Voice is clear, light weight, battery recharge is quick and last really long and this piece comes with hands-free set(wired).
The Nokia 1600 cell phone that I purchased did not accept some of the telephone numbers that I put into the phone book.  I didn't think it was any better than the cell phone I have which is an old Nokia.
Great basic cell phone, with almost a week battery power ~ best I've ever had.
I've had the phone for 1 month now and the buttons are already starting to sieze up. Chinese crap!
Great signal strength, very good sound quality, battery holds a charge for a good week, easily. Can't beat the price.Annoying features:not a flip phone so face buttons easily pressed unless you lock the keys. Menu features and center square button cumbersome.Ready to step up the line.
Me like phone. Make phone call. And then get call with phone too.Phone good...fire bad!!!
My SIM card didn't work in this product.  Make sure yours will.
Phone is really cheap, But it doesn't work as expected, When the caller disconnected the calls and the call is not picked up, still the phone is keep on ringing. and the screen display is also not changed.I tried with another piece also, It does have the same problem.I wouldn't recommend this phone for someone.
Just got the phone.  Love the way it looks and feels.  Went to Sprint to activate/switch from old flip-phone to this Nokia 1600 to find out it DOES NOT WORK WITH SPRINT!! What a suprise.  Sure would like to have known that $51.00 ago.
This phone does not work on Verizon cell services. I bought it as a replacement phone, and found out this phone version mostly is used in Europe, even though ad says US version. Not all US carriers can activate this phone.
I have used Nokia, Samsung, and now Sony Ericsson-the P990i being my first Sony Ericsson.  I read many negative reviews and a few positive reviews of this phone.  I finally determined that almost all negative reviews were the result of owners not updating the firmware and not using the phone properly.  This phone does everything it is advertised as doing and it does it very well.  The picture quality is amazing, the WiFi works perfectly, (after getting used to the operating system) it is easy to navigate around the screens, and the battery lasts for days with my normal usage-an hour of talking, 30 minutes of internet, take a few pictures, look at the pictures, etc.  I removed the keypad and think it looks great and can use it with one hand, thanks to the touch sensitive screen.  It is not too large-fits in my front jeans pocket easily and the price is the best I found for all that it does.
1. The device is VERY reliable. I have zero problems with it.2. The device is very study, my kid landed it more than once on all kinds of surfaces under many angles and it is still alive nice and shiny!3. The included software is quite complete and very useful.4. The audio recorder is not a toy but a real tool I can rely on.5. The battery life is exceptional.6. The camera is just enough for a casual shooting and videos.7. The videophone is terrific!8. It is sophisticated devices that takes time to appreciate. There's still no better phone even after two years have passed. Awesome.
This product is definitely outdated by today's technology levels. However, for a business person on the move this product had the most thoughtful set of features I could find at that time in a phone. I had 2 years of absolutely trouble free superb service from this phone. One of the features I liked the most was the ability to create specialized lists of contacts from whom alone, the phone would allow calls called the "accepted calls" list. This feature is extremely useful to people who spend a lot of time in meetings and run projects. This product convinced me that in many ways symbion OS is far more stable than even MS-mobile OS. If not for the fact that it is bulky and out of date today, I would still buy this phone. Sony ericsson took a definite step backward in features when it went to X1 after this phone. THIS WAS AND IS A MATURE PHONE.
I have had this phone for about 1 month now and it is a great looking phone that screams out (im expensive) however it is a little bulky.  -GOODS-0 I like the business card scanner, it scans business cards and inputs all the info on your contact list, however it does not always transfer all the info correctly.0 The 2mg pic camera is a good alternate camera that takes descent pics.0 I like the radio feature that allows you to listen to local radio stations if you opt to (sony ear phones required).0 I enjoy playing the golf game that comes with the phone, it really is an upgrade from usual phone standard games.0 contact list/recent calls/missed calls is well orgainized and is user friendly.0 supports microsoft media and pdf  -BADS-0 My RAZR had better connections; when I call sometimes I get bad audio feedback and I have to hang up and call back to get a better audio feedback(very annoying).0 the phone does temporary freeze up if you are too quick for the processor and you pick to many options at once.0 The speaker option is available at the beginning of phone calls and then goes away, you must choose between this small time frame to pick speaker phone or not.
I have been using this phone over 6 months.Pros :Its a Smart phone.Its also a 3G phone -- 3G is one of the best technology for faster internet on phones. you can do video conferencing via phone( you see people while talking on phone). You can watch live streaming video with out wait.T-Mobile USA is going to launch 3G network capabilities in summer 2008 as per web sources.This phone has a 2MP camera, bluetooth, speakerphone, touchscreen, qwerty keyboard ( just like laptops)and it has a detachable key numeric keypad.It also has video player,reocorder, games.It has a cool feature-  business card scanner. when you take picture of the business card, it automatically grabs the information from it and stores it in the phone book.It has many more features which take a day to write.speakerphone works great. reception (i.e. bars) are good.Cons :Didn't find cons much.sometimes ,i feel like programs take little longer to load.keypad buttons are slippery.Overall this is an highly advanced phone with LOADED FEATURES.
Ill make this qwik and painless.. dont buy this phone. I researched top of the line phones for months and this one seemed to be the best. HA! I bought it and it had sooo many problems.. Not to mention the very UN-userfriendly interface, the 990's best feature, the touchscreen, turned out to be its worst feature.. it made doing anything into a complicated task of measurment and hand eye coordination to access the correct button and navigate through tha bass-ackwards menus. Ohh and did I mention that it freezes and shuts off all of the time.. save your money. I went back to my 2 year old nokia and Im loving it in comparison.
This product is totally outdated. It has Wifi b instead of b/g, Windows Mobile 5 instead of 6, the camera is the worst I've ever laid my hands on, the video is ridiculous, it has no G3 internet (used in Europe and will be introduced in US), you have to pay for the GPS after 2 months, battery life is extremely short. Everything on this device is outdated and bad quality. HP Helpdesk people try to help you if there's a problem (and there are a lot) but do not know what they're talking about. Manual hardly explains anything. This thing, created in 2006, is WAYYYYYY overpriced. HP should discontinue it.
The device is an excellent piece of machine; however its life is just one year.  After a year or so, it started to give me problems.  First, I couldn't use WI-FI unless the devise was plug to the AC power, WI-FI on battery cause the devise to turn off and the devise reboot itself.  Few months later I could not use GPRS to get to internet, same symptoms as using WI-FI.  Although very uncomfortable to use AC power for WI-FI and GPRS, a managed to do it.  The worst came later, after 16 months, I could not use the phone, it simply disconnect your signal and you have to wait half an hour to use the phone again and then after a couple of call, it happens again, so the phone is useless, I swap the SIM chip to an old phone I had in order to use a phone.I talked to friends who also have the IPAQ 6945 and they report the same problems, I was planning to get the new version HP IPAQ 910, but with the experience I encountered, I am considering Nokia E71 or Blackberry.
I will leave the technical reviews to the other reviewers.My point is that the support from HP is awful.  The instructions manual that comes with such a complicated machine is a paltry 60 pages long brochure, so you really do not get any info on advance features. The Additional Product Guide in the CD is not much better, just a standard Windows Help, missing a lot of key functions (for example, try to find some useful guidelines for the GPS function).  After purchasing a 2GB Pertec MiniSD and installing it, I had to contact HP to solve some problems. Through chat, I explained my problems, only to have the HP Rep say "we do not support memories over 1GB and/or from other manufacturers" (this is nos stated in the manual). The DOWNLOADED manual is far from extensive: 204 pages, but most of them are only half full. An example: Functions like creating a playlist in the Media player are non existent or not explained, and of course, you can not synchronize the Ipaq with your MS Media Player because most everybody has more than 2GB of music in their PC. More problems like this abound.If you are willing to do a lot of experimentation to get the machine to work, it is quite good. If you want support and proper manuals to learn how to use all the functions (which I still can't), look somewhere else.
This product is horrible. I've been having alarm issues with this device since day one. At first the alarm does not work properly by either not firing or can't turn the darn thing off, tried to download the patches but it doesn't fix anything. And to aggravate things, the patch that I downloaded RESET EVERYTHING to the factory settings...you WILL LOSE everything(it does NOT come with backup software...so becareful). Expect to encounter these hard resets everytime you download a patch from HP. So you'll be re-installing any apps that you have in addition to setting up your outlook synch. The customer service people are clueless so it'll contribute to your aggravation. Also, setting up your mobile provider network isn't as simple either. Save your money and get something else that's NOT an HW6945...you'll save time and headache.I was greatly disappointed with this product, will never touch another HP PDA again....waste of money.
PROs:=====1. Adapters have backward compatibility to previous HP iPaq's.  I can now use my previous iPaq that did not have a power source.2. Uses Windows Mobile (although version 5 not 6).  It is able to handle my Microsoft Exchange emails with no problems, as well as share tasks and calendars that's on my Exchange server.3. Has the following main features - GSM/GPRS/EDGE/Bluetooth/GPS/802.11b Wi-fi.  WiFi really helps me out at home or at hot spots if I want to do a quick check up on the news without having to go to my computer.4. Having the QWERTY keyboard and capable business functionality has made my life easier.  I'm able to do my work emails while I'm away from the office.CONS (minor):=============1. GPS photo tagging is quirky (often times does not work, no fix).2. Help files sometimes does not have the right paths or software.3. VPN is hard to setup -- this is not an hp problem but a Windows one.
Pros:Replaces just about every portable electronic device you own.  You already know everything it can do from the description; I can't really expand much upon it.  Overall I like it although I have experienced some trouble.Cons:Battery life--sometime the battery unexpectedly dies--some attribute this to automatic syncing.  Wi-fi & GPS kill it really fast too.  On my unit lines go across the screen and shutdown the device around 20% battery.HP Navigation software is $129 extra; you just get a 60 day trial.  You'd think it would be included for the price.  You can buy a no-name navigation device for the same money nowadays, so I don't know how they get away with this price.  Plus if you have a data plan, you can use google maps for free.  The next cheapest program is Delorme Street Atlas, but the interface on this is tough--don't try navigating with Street Atlas on a PPC at 80 mph.  Also note, the included Pocket Streets doesn't do routing; it can just track your location.Sometimes the joystick pointer seems to be stuck (the screen keeps scrolling).Voice Dial isn't included either.  Something you expect from a phone nowadays costs you $40 (though cheaper alternatives exist).Bluetooth--doesn't autoconnect to either of my headsets.  I have to re-enter my passkey each time.  To connect, I have to turn on bluetooth then click on the shortcut for the device I want to connect.  I could operate my old phone from my headset while it was jammed in my pocket.Camera--takes about 2 seconds for the picture to snap, but makes a deceptive noise before the shot is taken.  Sometimes I wait a whole minute for the picture to come back for review.  Quality is OK though.Not a lot of programmable buttons.  My previous PPC had wealth of programmable buttons.
I LIKE TOO MUCH HP PRODUCTS, BUT THIS SMARTPHONE IS VERY EASY TO USE AND IS COMPLETE IN FUNCTIONS, THE KEYPAD IS EASY TO USE AND AS A PHONE IS SIMPLE AND GOOD SIGNAL RECEPTION.THE CAMERA TAKES GOOD PICTURES.I HAVE JUST FEW DAYS USING THIS IPAQ, BUT THE BATTERY I THINK NEEDS TO BE RECHARGING MORE THAN A CELL PHONE. I THINK BATTERY LIFE IS TOO SHORT IN THE DAILY USAGE, BUT REMEMBER IT'S AN IPAQ TOO, SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT IN A CRADLE WHILE YOU MAKE YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE AND PROGRAM YOUR ACTIVITIES. AT THIS TIME THE CRADLE IS RECHARGING THE BATERY, BUT IF YOU USE THE PHONE CONSTANTLY AND SPEAK A LOT YOU MAY CONSIDER THE BATTERY LIFE IN THE DAY. IT'S JUST THE EXCEPTION BUT THE SMATPHONE IS VERY VERY GOOD AND FUNCTIONAL.
This unlocked phone/PDA is just what I wanted and works great! Just switched the sim card and I was up and talking. I have a prepaid cell plan and wanted the use of touch screen, with pda functionality without paying for a data packet. (though I do pay for medianet for ringtones/answertones) The only one that doesn't work (or I haven't found out how to work it) is the email. I'm not concerned about that because I really don't need email chasing me. After much research I chose this one and glad I did. BTW - for syncing - I use ActiveSync to pull documents from my computer. Perfect for what I need.
It's the best Pocket Pc- Phone ever. I have it now for a year and a half.Keep searching for anything better but not yet. Everything you need in the palm of your hand. Mobile Phone, GPS, WEB, Mail, Games... Its Unlimited.
It is the best phone I had a part of the treo 680. It has very good function and is quite fast. Very good ¡¡¡
i like that the ppc-phone has gsm/edge/wifi/gps all in one, the system windows mobil works well.
Nice phone, has alot of features, including a built in mp3 player, camera, internet etc. great for work and checking emails on the run.
I switched to Virgin Mobile from The Evil TracFone several months ago.  I knew I wanted a camera phone, and I looked at the models that VM had to offer.  I opted for the Cyclops because I like the flip-phone design and the affordable price.You gotta remember...this is a camera phone, not designed to be your primary camera.  Picture quality is okay, pretty much what I expected from a camera phone of this price range.  The user interface is easy to figure out, I was able to figure out how to do what I wanted to do with the phone without having to look at the instruction booklet.I'm happy...both with this phone, and with Virgin Mobile's service.  If you ever have trouble with your VM phone, you can call them, and the person who you get on the phone speaks ENGLISH, as opposed to the reps over at TracFone.I've tried other pre-paid phones, but by far, Virgin Mobile is the best!
I just traded up to the Wildcard messaging phone and have owned the Cyclops for 3 months and highly recommend it for a basic prepaid phone. Texting is easy on this phone and the red-lit keypad is different from all other phones out there. The bright LED missed call/message indicator is very easy to see and the loud ringer really gets your attention. Battery life is excellent and the external caller id/message alert is nice also. This phone has many of the same features as the more expensive Wildcard,however the same 1.3mp rated camera works like a cheap vga camera compared to the one in the Wildcard. The only real complaints I have with this phone is the case is real smooth and it can slip away in a heartbeat, the camera quality,the installed graphics/icons are simple-minded and I could never get IM to work properly. This phone also has picture messaging capability and a basic internet WAP2 browser. Overall, it's an excellent BASIC phone and I miss using it.
I had this phone for about 7 or 8 months and it was fine. The texting was kinda hard but not too bad. I wanted a new phone so a couple of days ago i bought the arc from virgin mobile and it has bean great if you want a really good phone with some great features buy the arc because it is cheap at only 49.99 and has a camera and someother great stuff too. check it out.
I recently purchased this phone, because the camera on my Flasher was low-resolution and I think the 1.3 Megapixel camera on this one will be better, and because of several other things listed in the specifications and the manual (I have not opened it yet because I might splurge on the Wild Card instead and may need to return it. But I have spent a lot of time researching it and can share that), like:-Has 500 contacts available according to Amazon's product page-Again per product page "the phone's PC Sync capability means that you can connect the phone to a computer with a cable and synchronize calendar and contact information" (synchronization is not mentioned in the online pdf user manual from VM though, and the "optional data cable" is mentioned only on the diagram on page 3, item 14 of the user manual and I have not been able to find this mythical cable anywhere) -- this is vital for me as I have 200 contacts with multiple phones/addresses/URLs/notes -- can anyone confirm this? Has anyone done it? I was unable to find a data cable anywhere, nor info on this process.-1.3 Megapixel camera with flash and (Amazon page says 5x digital zoom)-3.5 hours talk, 7 days standby-Dual display-speaker phone-This phone is currently fifty dollars from Amazon's sister company Target (which recently had it for thirty-eight), and the service provider themselves has it for fifty as of January thirtieth; so it pays to always check the three.-Internal Antennae (although some reviewers have had problems with this)-txt messaging, picture messaging-real music ringtones-can lock it, on power-up/now/never (p.41 of pdf manual)-mobile IM, email, VAM Audio messaging (dunno what that last is;-) although you have to pay by day or month for web access-size is about the same as my Flasher (3.54" x 1.81" x 0.92")-When I held it in the store, it seemed well-made and less "toy"-like than some;-) I like the way it looks! Wish I could tell whether the user interface looks goofy like my Flasher's does-User's manual on page V gives specs for an extended-life battery(!)-Manual has a menu breakdown, very helpful(p.7)-Manual has settings menu breakdown, p.36-Contacts list better than Flasher; manual says each contact can have up to 6 numbers, 2 emails, 2 street addresses, 2 web addresses, and 1 note (my MTV slider had this and my Flasher didn't so it's good to know!)p.19-It *does* let you add another recipient once you have started a text message, which my old phone did and my Flasher does not-Camera goes up to 1280 x 1024 (p.46)
I "upgraded" to this model when it was $100 at BEST BUY. From Day 1 its been 1 problem after the other.. The texting isnt very solid. The phone would turn off in mid text for no reason. Camera sucks. Speakerphone volume is very low even when put to max. Try finding a car-charger for it in any store!!! The regular charger just stopped working 1 day out of the blue as well. the Yahoo/AOL feature doesnt connect anymore now too...lol Virgin Mobile had to send me a replacement when the screen permanently went blank 1 day. WAACCCCKKKK!!!
The item was fine. However, it would not work on my wireless network (not at all clear from the description), so I had to return it. I was promised credit minus a 10% restocking fee IF AND ONLY IF I wrote a review favorable to the seller, which I did. To date (February 8, 2008) my card has not been credited. I have never had a bad transaction through Amazon until this one, but I would not recommend that anyone do business with this ethically challenged seller.
I bought it from Amazon shiping to me fast. But next day I call Amazon to return it with the reason the manual book written in Spanish which I can't read or undwerstand and it look very cheap quality.Many customers like me complaint Amazone not reveal in small detail or correct something written on the goods( like Motorola V8 orV9.It is high end cell and expensive, the customers want to know what content it had in box?where it made from? The other sellers online Ebay, Bestbuy said very detail in box)
many bubbles in casing...phone keeps demanding i install a sim card that was not received...best of all, the charger is european, not american...co. rep has offered to work with these "issues" but i do not expect them to repay the time and $30.00 it cost to replace the charger, and i do not have the time to waste trading the phone for one that is not marred.
since the keypad is very sensitive very difficult to use it. Those who like to have speakerphone don't buy it. I cannot rate this product well
do the research...reap what you sew, I got my D&G; razor phone free! too muchmoney? not nuf time?
When I saw this cell-phone at first I was satisfied it seemed to be the phone i was looking for,good customer service, delivering time,and conditions item as well.the only thing that I have to say is that this cellphone is brand TIM ( An italian operator, this effects somehow the Menu and something about the cellphone' software ) and I was not aware of it before I bought this itme.Would be better if the seller specifies that in the description.Just to make things more clear for buyers in order not to find surprises once the item is purchased!!!
I bought this phone when I switched services, since I've had such good experience with other Motorola phones. This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand. The battery life is abysmal, and I have lost more calls in the two months I've owned this phone than I did in one year with other phones. I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem. Being able to play music is overrated, since in order to do so you have to separately purchase their music software and linkage package, plus set up a separate music program. I am making an unprecedented move and buying a new phone way before I qualify for the upgrade with my plan. What a waste of money.
I see a lot of negatives and things not working for other people and what not.  First off, I received a KRZR K1 that was Cosmic Blue... and yes it was fully unlocked.  Awesome for those times you want to pick up a SIM trip while travelling and make low cost local calls.In the 24 hours that I have had this phone:- Literally all you do is drop in your SIM chip and it works- It has NO chinese characters on the keypad- It comes with a larger 220/110 volt charger (its no big deal!)- Texting works without issues (though I hate texting!)- The voice dial works amazingly well! (Love the STATUS command!)- The Motorola tools support the KRZR K1, drivers and all (syncs nicely!)- My 3rd party 1GB memory chip is visible and functional in all respects- The speakerphone is clear and loud enough for most needs- The phone ear speaker is clear, loud and more than adequate- The buttons on the sides "autolock", so no errors possible there- Bluetooth connectivity works great with either headsets or computers- Built-in camera is acceptable and it sends pics and saves them to my card, but don't expect Nikon dSLR quality pics from this thing... its a PHONE!So for me, it all works... perfectly!!The only thing that I have not tested out is internet access on my cell, but honestly I do not need it... my last phone had access and I used it once in 3 years.  Bleh, what a waste of time.  I surf the net from a 5+MB connection at home with a 100GB monthly limit.  I doubt a 9600 baud cell phone modem will quench my surfing desires and it just wastes minutes for nothing.The phone does have a shiney front end that reflects fingerprints a lot, and it still looks great, but works even better than it looks (fantastic reception... 1-2 bars more than my father's cell on the same provider side by side in the same location) and I am looking forward to years of good service from this cell.I am very happy with the seller, the service was excellent and their product exceeded my expectations, as did their service.  HasslefreeCell really was... hassle free!I would purchase again from them without reservation... and very likely will!
I have had many Motorola cell phones over the years and this one by far is the worst.  I traded my razor in for the kzr and I have been disappointed ever since.  The first thing I noticed was the battery life was horrible.  It got to the point where I could only talk on the phone for 20 mins at a time.  Then I found out the only way I could talk on it was to have it plugged into the wall charger.  I went in to my provider, Verizon, and told them the problem.  They asked me to leave the phone with them and they would change out the battery.  Well come to find out they lied to me and never changed out the battery because Motorola isn't letting Verizon change out the batteries anymore.  So I had to call Motorola and let them know that my battery wasn't working.  I told them I work in the medical field and i'm on call all the time and that I had to walk away from Verizon with a phone that works.  They were no help at all.  They basically told me that they could send me a new battery in a weeks time.  I can't work without my phone so I told them there is no way that would work.  After going over and over it with them I got nothing acomplished. I'm now waiting on my battery with a phone that doesn't work. It's the worst experience i've ever had with a cell phone.  Not only am I disappointed in Motorola i'm disappointed in Verizon for not telling me the truth about the battery.  So my suggestion to you is not to buy the Kzr phone.  I've heard from many people that they are having the same battery problem and Motorola hasn't been helpful at all.
I'm rating this 3 stars as a phone with text messaging.  If you want to include the MP3 player functionality it would be 2 stars and internet access (at least through AT&T;) it would be 0.First off, as others have written, this phone looks and feels very nice.  I care less about the looks, but it just feels good in the hand.  Nice smooth curves and especially a nice solid feel.It seems to pull in signals well.  My house is a good place to test GSM phones:  the 1900MHz signal from T-Mobile and the 850MHz from Cingular/ATT are both marginal, but this phone pulls in AT&T; very nicely.  Even at one bar, it does not seem to suffer dropouts.  I also get an Edge data indicator (more about that later).The bluetooth works just fine with the built-in handsfree system in my car.  I had a problem with that on the CECT phone I tried earlier, so it is not a given.  You can also disconnect from the bluetooth while a call is in progress, for example if you reach your destination and want to get out of the car!The speakerphone capability is pretty decent.  Voice quality seems ok.  A plug-in earbud with mike also comes with it, and seems ok (did not really try it much).This phone has Ringer-ID (i.e. a personlized ring tone for different callers) but see below.  I never buy ringtones...I rip MP3 files from various places, or find MIDI files on line for free.  That works just fine.  But you need to have the SD card (as nearly as I can tell).  It does not appear that you can easily get an file on your computer to the built-in flash memory on the phone.  (There is some 3rd party software around, but that is scary...it lets you access the basic control files of the phone, and I'd rather not brick my new purchase quite so soon :-)The text messaging works fine ootb with AT&T; just as you expect (but see below about notifications).The reasons I downrate it as a phone are as follows:1) The voice pickup on the phone itself is less than ideal.  Contrary to other reviewers, I did not think that it was as clear as some phones.  I did an experiment:  I connected to my car hands-free and called my home answering machine and started talking.  Then I disconnected the call in progress and started talking on the phone itself.  Finally I went back and listened.  The voice on the hands-free was nice and clear.  The voice on the handset mike was somewhat muffled.  Not bad; just not crisp.2) This appears to be just a Motorola thing, but it drives be CRAZY!  I love Ringer-ID, that is setting up a personlized ring-tone for different callers, and this phone has it.  But guess what?  If you set it up for a caller the SAME MP3 or MIDI plays when you get text from them!  I've done a lot of internet searching; that appears to be just the way it is.  Grrrr.3) I don't really like the Moto menu system.  Wouldn't you think that the settings would be under "Settings"?  Oh, no, if you want to set up for messaging, that's under messages.  If you want to set up for web access, that's under web.  Settings has only the stuff that fit in no other category.  But that's just me.I said 2 stars as an MP3 player.  That's because while it seems to work ok, there is no obvious way to connect your own headphone.  There is no phone jack; only a mini-USB. The earbuds that come with it work ok, but darnit, I want to use my Bose noise-cancelling phones when I'm on a plane. You can buy USB-to-phone-jack adapters, but the ones I found either did not include or explicitly excluded Motorola.  Oh, but this has the Bluetooth profile for high-quality sound.  Fine, but you can't use that on an airplane.I said 0 stars as an internet device on AT&T.;  I spent literally hours attempting to get data access.  I combed the internet.  I even used the AT&T; Chat tech assistence (and they were actually really great!) but I had not luck at all.  I got all the settings as they ask (as nearly as possible; the profile you are supposed to edit is locked, so I created a new one...maybe that is the problem?) but I continually get a message saying that GPRS is unavailable despite the indicator on the phone that it IS available.  The AT&T; guy said there should be no difference between Edge and GPRS in terms of the settings, and my old phone could use GPRS with the same SIM card.  So my account is ok; I just can't get the right settings on the MOTO.  Ah well...I wanted it as a phone, mainly.Ah, the camera.  All I can say is that it is better than camera on my previous phone.  There is no flash, and I have not tried it in dim light, but the outdoor picture I took was passable.  Better to have this than nothing when need to snap off a quick shot, but don't replace your Nikon with it.As others have mentioned, the charger is for some other plug standard than US, but it comes with an an adapter.  No big deal.  Plus if you really hate it you can get an iGO charger from Radio Shack or Amazon.  I think the tip is A38.To summarize:  It's a pretty nice phone, especially if you will be using it with a hands-free.  Even just using the handset, it's pretty ok.  It's stylish, feels good in the hands, pulls in signals well, does text messages well with a possibly slighly poor outgoing voice quality.  Don't buy it because you want an internet device, and don't expect it to replace your iPod.===============================================14-Nov:  Someone else mentioned that the case cracked.  Mine did too.  The flip has a crack on the outside.  No, I did not drop it or otherwise abuse it.  It must be a poorly designed with stress points somewhere.  Too bad...it is nice looking.But worst, it seems today that the charger is refuseing to charge it, and the charge meter is inconsistent.  This is a all a sign of bad things to come, I'm afraid.  I don't recommend buying this phone (although it is still working ok as a phone.)================================================August 2011:  Indeed, the charger did die, but the iGo charger I had for it continues to work fine.  I have replaced this with an iPhone (on my second generation now), but I keep this phone for foreign travel.  Since it is unlocked, I can plug in a SIM card from a foreign telco and it works fine.  (I've used it all over India, for example).  The cracked case has not gotten any worse than when I first noticed it.  The whole thing continues to work pretty much exactly as I originally wrote.
The version of the KRZR-K1 phone sold by J&R; is actually manufactured for sale in Hong Kong.  I only discovered this when I tried to locate the serial num ber to register with Motorola for firmware updates, etc., and the Motorola site wouldn't recongnize the numbers.  Upon calling Motorola, they explained that my only options for support were to contact their office in the country where the phone was intended for sale - Hong Kong in this case, or the seller.  J&R; did offer a return authorization, but that's the extent of the their 'support'.  Nothing in the add posted @ Amazon indicates that this phone, while legal to buy in Hong Kong and resell in the USA, is actually violating the terms of support (or warranty) with the manufacturer.  The phone is OK, altho there are bizarre characters on the keys in addition to the western numbers and letters. Also, the charger is not for US plugs, but does include an adapter (a big and clunky one).  Plan on purchasing another charger if you ontend to travel with it.  My suggestion is to avoid dealing with J&R; for their practice of selling gray-ware.  Hopefully Amazon will do a better job of screening the merchandise that they permit on their site to avoid an less than reputable vendor from besmirching their reputation and undermine buyer confidence.
I have only had my KRZR for a month now but I love this phone.  I am able to get a signal in once dead areas and the battery life is amazing. The only small detail that is a little annoying is that its hard to keep the face plate clean.
Good* Really a very nice phone* Great reception* Great sound and speaker phone* The voice commands work very well.  There is not need to train the phone.* Voice command dialing works from the SIM address book ... On the RAZR it only worked for contacts that are stored on the phone* Small size* Battery life is very good* Easy to read keyboard and display ...  Much better than my old RAZRBad* My biggest problem is the music player only supports MP3* There is no WMA to MP3 conversion software in Moto Tools* Had to manually define the phone with Moto Tools to a K2.* USB interface will not work unless you go to settings ... select USB* The USB is very slow.  You are better off loading music via a SDHC USB external reader/writer* Camera is better than the RAZR, but still not very goodMC
I'm quite happy with the quality of the KRZR.  Being an International version though, the charger has a plug for use in Great  Britain that won't work in the US.  I had to go to Radio Shack to purchase an adapter to use it here.  I would have been a bit happier if Amazon had included this adapter or at least indicated that it was required.
The phone is very nice and at an excelent price.  Menus aren't ideal, but it handles blue tooth well.  Since I had an international sim card, the phone book didn't give much options (only one number/name and no voice dialing) ... not sure if that would be different with a standard GSM plan.  Note that the phone comes with a UK power adapter, but as it works on both 120 and 240 V all you need is a basic plug adapter which I had.  Of course if you travel in Europe you need the adapters anyway, so it doesn't matter much.  Camera on the phone takes nice pictures too.
I have had this phone for about 2 1/2 years now. I changed from the RAZR. This past weekend I was not paying attention and WASHED AND DRIED the phone that was in my pant pocket powered on!  To my amazement it still works just fine!!!!! I have had it slip out of my pocket before and hit the ground from standing level, but WOW I cannot beleive that it is still working after a full wash and dry cycle!!!!!!
If you plan to keep this phone a year or less - I do recommend it. But if you want one for longer than that - forget it.My mom and I each had one. And both of them after almost exactly a year of use started crapping out. First all the functions became very delayed. Then the battery completely gave up. I would charge the phone over night and after making one call in the morning, I'd be down to two bars. Another call over 1 minute long and the phone starts beeping "low battery". Note that the exact same issues were happening on both of these phones so it is not my bad luck on one particular faulty phone.Owning this phone past 1 year has been a torture and Morotola customer service didn't seem to give a damn. I'm exchanging it in the next week or so and this experience has made me steer clear of Motorola phones alltogether.
I had a Krzr before through at&t; and it worked great. I dropped it all the time and there was hardly a scratch on it. I recommend getting a cover though because it smudges alot from fingerprints.  The reason I gave it 4-star is because of the battery.It does deplete quickly, after about 5 months I had to charge it every day-but that's a battery problem and not a phone problem. The only reason I'm getting a new Krzr is because it went through the wash while still on. I just bought one from here today and am waiting for it to come in the mail.
This phone was great when I first got it.  My son and I have the same phone different colors.  It is very elegant looking.  He started having problems right away, they gave him a new phone.  Now we both have problems, mostly battery problems.  We have both replaced the batteries in this phone twice in one year.  From what I understand Verizon is no longer carrying this phone due to the amount of problems they have had.  A charge lasts about 12 hours when it used to last a week.  Very frustrated and would not recommend this to anyone.  I guess looks aren't everything.
It is a good phone, sound is clear, signal is good. Looks very sleek. You will find it difficult to fit it in any cell case available in stores as it has unusual dimensions. You can ofcourse find a pouch online. Motorola does not provide any Software CD with the phone. I am unable to connect to my laptop using bluetooth. Motorola sells the software CD seperately.Front looks like a glass plate, attracts finger prints and can crack easily if struck with anything heavy or sharp.Camera is good. It has 8x digital zoom but the quality is only good upto 2X zoom (after all what else can you expect from digital zoom).
I bought this as a gift for my mom, who needed a simple and elegant phone without too many inundating features that she would never use. This was a perfect piece and a steal at the price! Its a beautiful blue color - very pleasing to the eye and very stylish too! Its got all the standard features with a 2MP camera, an MP3 player and bluetooth. Even the 8X zoom on the camera works very well! pretty clear pictures, as long as you can keep your hand steady. The thing that I like best about this phone is its unlocked and quad-band feature - it is the most inexpensive quad-band cell that I have seen. I have never used a Moto before and thought it might be difficult to get used to a new OS, but its not that bad. Even my mom (who is not at all tech-savvy) found it pretty intuitive and easy to use. It is a good price to pay for a beautiful phone that just works everywhere in the world!
Nice phone BUT! It is an international phone it will not access internet after several calls to AT&T; Wireless and Motorola. Motorola finally said they cannot configure it to access the internet since it is an international phone. Charger has a European plug. Found that I can order a charger seperate.
- It more or less works like it's supposed to.- I like the sturdy build quality...doesn't have that cheap plastic-y feel- I find that I need to recharge every 48 hrs regardless of how long a talk (which isn't much).- I wish it had a more standard audio jack...the dongle/adapter adds bulk and i found that the lowest volume is too loud, so I have to use ear phones with a built in volume control...thus the one star deduction.  At least the mp3 feature exists :)It's still the best phone I've had to date, so... 4 stars.
The back of unit has cheap clips. One of the clips broke after changing the 'new' battery twice that wouldn't charge. Another junk product from Motorola.
This phone arrived on time as promised, no problems there. The phone itself had a small crack on the outside front of the phone across the the screen. Other than that the phone itself is awsome. It works great, has a good battery life, & I love the predictive text feature.  I hope the small crack isn't a clue about what is yet to come....
I am nearing the end of a 2-yr contract with Verizon on this phone. If I had to do it again, I'd probably have just gotten something cheaper and less shiny looking. This phone appears to STILL be quite expensive despite the fact it isn't really good at anything except plain, no frills phone calls. I found signal strength generally good, call quality ok but not exceptional. I liked the handsfree function (speakerphone, etc) and also the bluetooth. I didn't like the way the battery started to become EXTREMELY depleted after about one year of use. I started to talk to people for about two minutes (seriously, not an exaggeration) before I would need to charge the phone. While the solution is pretty simple - just get a new battery - batteries can be rather expensive and it is just a frustrating experience.Once the battery was replaced at 1.5 years, however (when I really should have just done it much earlier at 1 year), battery life returned to normal. That is, you could expect to have quite a bit of standby power without chatting, and you could have at least 1 hour of talk time easily with no fear.Internet is basically nonexistent and only in emergencies for Verizon's ridiculously slow and old proprietary browswer. I did use it a few times to view email in a pinch, but wouldn't recommend anyone taking its internet capability seriously.Texting is ok if you are relatively speedy on the standard non-QWERTY keypad. I was able to manage as I am not a power texter (a busy texting day for me would be 20 msgs). If you are crazy about texting you might prefer QWERTY.I didn't use the music player so I cannot comment on that.Very durable phone, dropped a few times onto pavement (ouch!). Scratched front not very noticeable.Bottom line: October 2008 means the technology is way, WAY better than when I got this. Get something nice for yourself - it'll probably be even cheaper!
I've purchased two of these phones but I didn't get a chance to use the phone I purchased from Amazon. My phone arrived fairly quickly but when I opened the box it was immediately obvious that the phone manufacturer's box that's inside the Amazon.com box had been opened. When I opened the manufacurer's box all of the packing material was missing and the box contained only loose phone parts (phone body, back cover, battery, AC adapter) that had apparently been bouncing around alot. The phone was badly damaged, the front of the phone was a spider web of cracks and it appeared that the camera lens may have been cracked as well. I sent it back the next day and Amazon gave me a prompt credit for my return in about a week.After receiving my credit from Amazon I went to ebay and bought this phone for about $30 more and it arrived brand new and in perfect condition. It also came with many accessories, including software CD, data cable, stereo headset, holster, car charger and 1GB memory chip. I installed my SIM card and the memory chip and the phone works like a champ.I loaded the phone tools software on my HP laptop and it immediately updated to the latest version. I just use the synchronization for my Outlook contacts and calender and it has worked well with only one minor issue. For some reason the software was synchronizing with the calendar information in my archive folder. Once I changed the synchronization setting to go to my current calendar folder there have been no issues.So far I've only downloaded a few ringtones from the internet and they have downloaded quickly and flawlessly.This is my first Motorola phone (I'm a former Nokia owner) and I have found this phone easy to use. The sound quality is very clear, definitely better than any of the Nokia phones I've had, and the signal strength and reception seem to be better as well. I've had no problems with accidental pushing of the buttons on the exterior of the phone.The phone construction is very solid, nothing cheesy here. I have the black model and the finish is excellent and after a week of use remains without a scratch. I'm very happy with this phone and would recommend it to others although I would purchase it elswhere since Amazon's supplier seems to to be getting a reputation for poor packaging and damage during shipment.
I just recently bought this phone a few days ago.  I owned a Motorola Razor V3 before.  I couldn't believe how much space this phone had compared to my older one. I loved the fact that you can buy and use a memory stick for extra space. I would recommend this over a MotoRazor V3 any day.
I ordered this phone because my husband's favorite color is Blue and he just had a Razr V3.  They looked quite similar.  Anyway, this phone is way better!!!  It has double the memory space and a lot of functions.  We both love it.  I might get me one some day if they come out with a hot pink or magenta.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is because the volume isn't as loud as the razr and my husband is a welder where there is a lot of noise.  We set it as loud as it can go and he sometimes still has a little trouble hearing... I will be getting a bluetooth headset and hopefully that will solve this very minor inconvenience.  Otherwise he is absolutely thrilled with it.  I would recommend this phone to anyone.
This is my second KRZR. I love this phone. I finally broke my first one, but I pushed it to the limits. It had been washed, soaked jet skiing, dropped, kicked, chewed up by my dog (twice) and finally destroyed by me trying to replace pieces without the right screwdriver. This phone lasted through it all. The best feature is that if you dry it out after immersing it in water, it still works. If you are hard on phones, I would recommend this one.
The speaker phone option was really important to me, and it is virtually useless on this phone. Most people complained that they couldn't hear anything I was saying over the speaker, I'm on Verizon Wireless, and my wife's LG speakerphone is crystal clear. Definitely would not recommend.
I have been using my Motorola KRZR for more than a month now and I am satisfied with its variety of features.
I was looking for a little and easy to use cell phone and that's exactly wath I found. The photos and the videos are excellente, and I change the SIM Card in Argentina and it works fantastic!!! I love this cell phone and I recomend it as well.
After my 2-year contract expired, I really wanted to buy an unlocked phone and choose my own service plan. I bought this one because it looked very slick and small. I just got it connected with AT&T; service and it's been working fine.The good: it's a nice size, very pretty, easy to use.The bad: It's easy to get fingerprint marks on it. It's from Hong Kong so it has special characters on the keys (though you don't notice them after a while). You have to buy special headphones to use the music player.Overall, I think it's a pretty good deal. You'll get a lot of compliments.
I like this phone. It works really well. I wish it would have been clear that it was a European phone. I had to go buy a new charger
My 14 yr old loves it although not able to send video or picture text messages.
The pros are, it is a nice sleek phone with Java Audio Player Application and with good sound quality. I had Motorola Razor and I broke it. I had installed software for Razor in my computer. Amazingly the same software works with KRZR. The MP3 audio quality is really worth.The con is there is no was to block a phone no in your phone.It is worth buying it.
hi i love my motorola krzr phone its perfect and and it came in good condition.
I love this phone!  It is slimmer, more memory and does everything I need in a phone!
I purchased this phone the last of May '08 and wasn't really concerned when it had no warranty. I figured it would last a while. After about 2 months, it started acting strange and dialing the number 2. A week went by and my calls wouldn't connect - even with 5 bars of signal. Another week and it said "Emergency Only". I have researched the issues on the internet and contacted AT&T; tech support but nothing worked. It was a waste of money. The moral of the story? Don't buy this phone without a warranty!
I bought it in February, and it was good for 3 months only; now I understand why it is being sold under " No warranty".Still don't know why it suddenly, after 2 hours of non-use or stand-by, the screen turns on white,and never change until I took out the battery. One night I forgot to turn it off, and the next day It did not work at all. Not even turn on! First I thought It was the battery, then I tried with another one, waste of money! Of course.This phone sucks, I have seen other reviews, It looks to me that I'm not the only one.
This is the worst phone I have ever owned. I've had this phone for one year. I am on my 6th battery and my 2nd phone. I can't even enjoy the bells and whistle this phone offers because the battery only last for 30 minutes if I'm lucky and 15 minutes if I actually make or receive a phone call. This phone does not deserve any stars.
I purchased my first Krzr in early November of 2007 and was very excited to have such a sharp looking phone. Unfortunately, I have learned that the appeal of the Krzr is only skin deep. As of yesterday, I have now had literally 3 Krzrs in 3.5 months for various reasons. The krzrs have been replaced for freezing up, dropping calls, and the plastic casing around the display starting to peel off. It has been a frustrating situation and I would do anything (besides buy another phone at retail) to get rid of my Krzr. My wireless service is Verizon and they have been helpful but not flexible regarding making me keep the phone. Moreover, whenever I wait in lines at the Verizon service center there are frequently other people who need their Krzr/Razor serviced. As I read most of the reviews I believe that many people are at first impressed with their Krzrs, yet after a short period of use, I would wonder if they still feel the same? I know that sometimes customers can have a "bad run of luck," but in my case I believe the problem is a poor quality product. I strongly suggest that you stay away from this phone.
This item just as advertised.  My son broke his old razor phone and we needed a new one quick.  This did just the trick along with being a better phone.
I have been enjoying this phone quite a bit.  The functionality is great.  The size, the color, the feel, all really nice! K1 help on the phone is helpful, yet going on-line and looking at K1 forums even more helpful. The only issues: trying to get music on it, and to play continuously. Have downloaded update. Not sure if this will fix the problem.
The phone is very good but I assume that the spanish (the second language in US) is available so pay atenttion because there are only inglish, chinese and japanese.
I purchased this phone about a week ago and I am very disappointed with it.  The front of the phone is made out of glass and I happed to drop my phone a whopping six inches, from my hand to the counter and the glass cracked/shattered.  The battery is decent and will make it through the day but you will most likely have to charge the phone frequently.  Oh and texting on this phone is a joke, and the bottom left key does not always respond when pressed.GOOD-Reception-Design-Speaker phoneBAD-Slow OS-Battery-Build quality-Menu structure-MP3 player software
Yes, it looked fancy and pretty. what's why I bought this.but it's not like old best-seller razor models.If you google this model, you will find out that this model is not durable.lots of case, people experienced error that display turn to white.  My krzr is broken in 4 months. Its LCD turn to white blank permanently and never came back. also when you use menus or look up phone book, you will experience delay. You may be able to stand it, but there are many other phones work better.my conclusion is, its appearance is cool but not durable.
Sorry product you can only make calls you cant send text its a phone that isnt under US warranty but sold in the US From HONGKONG so no one can help ya and if you continue to use it then you SIM gets locked dont waste your time or money I am still waiting on my REFUND
My phone arrived on time and in excellent condition. Love the look of this phone, love the features and functionality. Great Motorola phone.
saw the special deal on amazon so I bought it. The phone is alright but not at all what i was looking for.First of all people should know that the reason the phone is availible so cheap is that it isn't the US edition. Though it doesn't really matter, it is kind of annoying. The charger comes with a universal adapter and wont work without it, making the charger weird shaped and bulky. The other thing is that some of the menus on the phone are spelled wrong.The Good~Battery life is very impressive~2mp camera is not bad~Decently customizable~Comes with Platinum SudokuThe Bad~The user interface was my main problem with the phone. Defult analog clock and wrong date format. the menus just dont make sense, things that should take one button to do take 3 or 4. Menus are grouped strangely and things like bluetooth are a pain to find.~mutimedia is disapointing on almost every level, videos take a while to load aren't great resolution (176X144) max length is 30 seconds~audio player is ugly and slow, with a just plain bad interface~doesnt work with MircoSD card, or at least not a full size one, maybe I misreadOverall not that bad of a phone, just not made for mutimedia by any standards, I for one will be returning it for the Sony Ericson.
watch out for this add as you think that it is unlocked and will work just fine--read the entire description as the sd card is a mini and won't work with most carriers!  Returning tomorrow.
I ordered the phone last week, and it came this morning. I was very happy for the fast delivery. However, when I opened the box, it looked really cheap to me. The phone was in a old package. Even the phone looked old, and there're scatches on it. Inside the package, there're only a phone, a battery, a back cover, a charger and a old Cingular manual. The phone looked like a refurbished one because the tiny screws on the back was loose. I had to use the screwdriver to fix them. It cost $145 plus tax last week, and it dropped down to $139 plus tax this week. So I already got $6 lost!!!!
Im not real happy with my moto k1, nobody told me it come's from Hong Kong, and it won't connect to the internet. What's up with that?????
This phone DOES NOT work in the US.  The phone is from Hong Kong and the software inside is for that area and networks.  I spoke directly with Motorola and they said there is nothing you can do but, return the phone.
I purchased the Orange PEBL (unlocked). I absolutely love the phone and always receive compliments on it. However, after 6 months of usage the handset volume just quit. I can only use the phone in speaker mode. So, basically the phone is now a glorified walkie talkie. After some online investigation, this seems to be a problem with unlocked PEBL phones. Apparently the issue can be corrected by "reflashing the firmware". Great, if you're tech savvy and don't mind downloading suspicious software.Since the unlocked phones are not covered by warranty, I'd suggest just buying the phone through the carrier. It's worth it even if you have to pay more by not upgrading your plan. The amount you'd pay through the carrier would be about the same as buying it unlocked anyway.In fact, if you're a T-mobile subscriber, phones purchased through T-mobile are still covered under a 2-year warranty, even if you don't purchase a plan. Hope this helps.
I bought the Motorola Pebl because it seemed to have loads of features, all while looking so cute.To try and avoid any problems since there isn't a warranty on international Moto phones used in the US, I chose to get a new Pebl. It came in original packaging and pristine as you would expect for new. The charger was made to work in Europe, but it did come with an adapter and works as well as anything. The language was set to Italian, since that's one of the countries where they still sell them new. Changing it to English was simple, but that's most likely because I've had many Motos and am used to what's where on the menu. The user guide is in many languages, including English, and easy to use.As far as how the phone works in general, it is very useful and reliable. It gets the best signal of any phone I've ever had, and I've never had trouble hearing anyone or getting calls. The battery life is great, it can easily go four days without a charge, and usually I don't charge it more than once a week.For the price, its features are just great. The interface is clean, typical Moto. It has bluetooth, although I've never used it and can't say if it's reliable in that way. The camera is perfect for capturing quick moments - those times when you want a picture to remember something, but you don't have the or forgot it - both in still and in video. It has a voice recorder, good for quick notes. It comes with loads of good, preloaded ringtones that sound rich and get your attention. The couple megabites worth of memory is plenty for about twenty, 30-second videos or about 90 full-sized pictures. You an download and upload pics, sounds, and videos onto the Pebl, all you need is MobilePhoneTools 4.0 or higher, which I bought on Amazon for less than $5 including shipping. Also, the spring-open feature is kind of a neat little "trick." When you slide the front of it down, and release your grip on the front, it pops open to reveal the smooth inside of the little clamshell.Despite being reliable and having many features, it does have a couple problems. First is the fact that it cannot send or receive files via MMS, which may have something to do with the fact that it thinks it's roaming (doesn't affect your charges, the Pebl is just made to think it's from Italy), but it could just be a problem with my pumpkin. Another problem is not having expandable memory, which, combined with a megapixel camera, would make this phone perfect.Overall, my Moto Pebl has been an enjoyable and reliable phone. I absolutely love it, and have gotten many complements on its bright and fun color. If a good camera and expandable memory are top on your priorities, but you want the cute Pebl look, I would suggest the Moto Pebl U9, about twice the cost of the U6 but with improved features. Personally, the U9 will probably be my next phone because the Pebls are just too great to not get another one. :)
Motorola PEBL U6 Pumpkin Orange Phone  (Unlocked Intl. Version) no U.S. Warranty The phone is fatally flawed. Fully charged it could only make two calls before it warned of low battery and then stopped working. This happened every day, no matter how long it had been charged for.While it is possible I got a phone with a defective battery, I would avoid this phone given other complaints of short battery life (see Amazon  reviews of this phone in other colors).
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. We reside outside the US but use a forwarder in Miami.Due to unexplained delays in shipping it arrived too late & we've only just received it (Jan 9). This is not all the vendor's fault but their initial tardiness set it up.They took several days to respond to my query re this delay & upon reply only send the shipping details - no explanation or apology.Worse yet all the manuals supplied were in Italian & the phone language was also set to Italian. Nothing in English as was promised.I can't see myself buying from this supplier again.The phone itself seems fine & pretty much what we expected. Can't speak about battery life etc. but having owned other Motorolas (RAZR, SLVR, V186) before we're confident it will be fine especially since we want it primarily as a phone not a multipurpose device.***** Update *****After posting this review I've been contacted by Electronica Direct who have offered an apology for the delay and lack of notification.In addition they offered to refund the shipping and insisted upon it even though I said that the refund was unnecessary.Nice effort at damage control!Let me stress that I have no problem with the phone and that not all of the delay can be attributed to them.As well there are several good reviews so I may just have been the unfortunate sap who got the lemon as opposed to this being the morn.Anyway they tried to make amends and that's the important thing.
this is a great little phone..my carrier is cingular...and the phone is t-mobile..but no worries...i just put my sim card in and it works...only one minor problem..i cant access the web to download ringtones..but i really dont care about that at all..
I PURCHASE THIS PHONE IN CELERY GREEN,YES THIS PHONE COMES IN CHINESE I WAS DEPRESSED AT FIRST CALL AMAZON AND WANTED TO RETURN IT MY MIND SAID PLAY WITH IT A LITTLE SO I  DID, I CALL MOTOROLA SUPPORT LINE THEY TOLD ME HOW TO CHANGE TH ENGLISH WHICH I HAD DID BEFORE I CALL THE PROBLEM THAT I WAS HAVING WAS WHEN I WAS TRYING TO STORE NAMES IN PHONEBOOK THE PAGE WAS IN CHINESE I CALL MOTOROLA TWICE AND TALK TO TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE NEITHER ONE KNEW ANYTHING,SO I PLAYED A LITTLE LONGER UNTIL I FOUND THE PROBLEM I GOT THE PHONE IN ENGLISH FOR PHONEBOOK I WAS SO HAPPY...A PERFECT PHONE AFTER ALL GREAT FEEL GOOD RECEPTION.I HAVE PURCHASE THIS PHONE ABOUTSIX TIMES THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PHONE,DIFFERENT FROM ANY PHONE I KNOW I ALSO PURCHASE AN PINK FOR MY THIRTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER .IF ANYONE HAS THIS PROBLEM I JUST DESCRIBED PLEASE EMAIL ME AT:doe38039@bellsouth.net OR SENT YOUR NUMBER IN THE EMAIL AND I WILL HELP YOU IF YOU LIKE.DOE
The green color on the web page has a more 'sage' look, the actual phone is slightly more yellow-green, and metallic, which came as a disappointment, however, I really like this phone - it is a beautiful design inside and out. I have only used standard texting and call features, but it is very robust, easy to use and to notch design.
This phone was of no use to me. The phone was in chinese and so was the manual. This was not the phone amazon advertised. The phone I ordered was in english and unlocked. Amazon would not replace it for another one. Buyer beware.
I decided to get a phone that was multi-function having a camera, media player, one that i could use for e-mail, browsing the Internet and viewing office documents and this phone does all of this, but at the expense of speed.  The response time on this phone is quite disappointing.The keyboard pad is for those with small hands :-) Oh and there's the occasional freezing of the phone all together...The camera quality is quite good and there are preset modes for you to adjust your picture settings.Radio coverage is wonderful as well, screen display is quite clear and the battery life is also satisfactory.The phone is worth the money (it's feature filled) with one exception it lacks wi-fi. If you are willing to sacrifice some speed for the features get it, however if speed is a main requirement when making your decision to purchase, look elsewhere.
I am very happy with performance of this phone I think is one the best of Nokia.
I love the camera, great pic quality, it has a cover so the lens doesn't get scratched, flash is good.  The one thing that bothered me at first about the phone is the keyboard.  The keys are kinda small, hard to use for someone with big fingers.  But I don't regret getting the phone, very happy with it.
Hey i Love this phone. The image quality on this is excellent. It can do almost anything. Even works with almost every software i put on it. The audio quality is also exceptional. Only problem is that it does not support most video format. But i wouldn't trade it for an N95 even though that has WiFi
This was my first unlocked phone and I have to say, that I'm very satisfied with this phone and would definitely recommend it. I bought it on sale and I feel it was worth the price (best of all NO contract extension!). The camera (love that there are two of them on this phone) and music player are fabulous! It's user friendly and a lot of the features did not require reading the book.Although I do love this phone, it does have some drawbacks, it slows down at times when multiple programs are open (but what phone doesn't), I would like to have a repeating alarm, as I use my phone alarm almost daily. And lastly I do find the keys are a little on the small side.
I researched phones for months before deciding on the Nokia N73. My goal was to combine phone, mp3 player, and camera into one device. The N73 delivers on all three: excellent phone with smartphone capabilities (office viewer, full internet, etc) great sounding music player with FM radio, and an amazing camera with flash. Combined with its mid-range price tag the N73 bests nearly every phone in its class. If your ultimate goal is to have only one device for all your media needs, the N73 should be on your list. And Amazon (through TigerDirect) has the best prices for the Nokia N Series available. If you have the extra $$ the N95 has the edge, but the N73 only lacks Wifi and costs nearly half as much. And compared to the iPhone the N73 (and the rest of the N series) has a similar if not better feature set for less cost. I highly recommend this phone.
This phone has everything you need. The camera is great.The battery last forever. Its sturdy yet sleek. What more can I say its a Nokia!
This phone is awesome. I love the operating system, bluetooth, the way it works as an usb storage device and how everything is so simple and straightforward.
this is a US version with missing 3g capabilities in other parts of the world. look for one with the RM-133 for a better product.other than that the phone's great and i had no issues with it
I just bought this phone to replace my N75. This phone is an excellent phone, if I had known I would've never purchase the N75.  I'm about to purchase another N73 just incase something happen to this one I'll have a back up, that's how much I love it. Also I purchase a passport international sim card that's goes along with my phone perfectly fine.
The phone works perfectly, however, after approximately 3 charges, the charger stopped working. Had to go out and buy a replacement for $30.
The phone works great, had no problems up to now, very impressed with its capabilities. The picture quality is perfect for printouts, the user interface is easy to work.Music player and MiniSD slot gives you good quantity of memory for all your fav tunes. Not a fan of the D-pad because I have big fingers but i got for my sister so she's fine with it.Overall 9 out of 10
Nice phone but the fonts are too small for a big screen. Any way how to adjust to larger fonts please help.
This phone will not recognize a MicroSD card larger than 2GB. I have updated to the latest firmware and software and this phone is still glitchy. All of the adapters are proprietary. I bought this phone to listen to MP3s and its really not good for that. I paid $300 and I would say its worth $30. All i can do with it is make phone calls and send text messages. This phone is not a step up.
Muy buen celular, lo compre para usarlo en Colombia y no he tenido ningun problema.Lo recomiendo.
Pros:- Simple Phone, not a lot of bells and whistles.- Good battery life.- Sound quality good, although, occasionally, you do hear your own echo faintly.- Comes with speaker phone which is an important feature for me.- Customizable top two keys. I've set it to alarm clock, so my most useful feature is right on the home screen.- Predictive text typing is good. Remembers the non-dictionary words you used in the past and uses them, so a self-learning vocabulary.- Lightweight and Slim, so it fits nicely in the pocket.- Displays day and date along with the current time on the home screen (if configured). A useful feature.- Customizable Navigation Key assignments. You can assign whatever function you like to use when you press one of the navigation keys from the home screen.- Sending SMS text messages to multiple recipients with a single message.Cons:- Impossible to see the display in the outdoors during the day. (BIG flop)- 4-way navigation keys are cumbersome. Top and down is okay but for going left or right, the keys are buried between other keys and very hard to press, you almost have to resort to using the nail on your thumb to press it. Also the center navigation key is noisy and makes this cheap plastic clicking sound when you press it. It is the most frequently used key, so you have to settle for some noisy key operation. (During a meeting you can't text your friends to tell them how bored you are, because it will be too noisy, for example.)- Although this phone has the feature of Multimedia Messaging (MMS), if you buy it unlocked, this feature will not work with AT&T; service. Everything else works e.g. SMS, Call Waiting, Call Conferencing, switching between calls etc.- There is a mini USB port on this phone, between the charger and the headphone jacks, but this USB port is for maintenance personnel, and cannot be used to sync data between your phone and your PC.
The Nokia 2610 is a great basic phone. If you need a phone that is easy to use then this is the one for you. Call quality and reception are great. The phone is straight forward and very user friendly.
Doesn't matter if its free....this phone is trash....it is primarily designed to get you to run the cost meter on the internet...nothing more... screen times out in seconds, hard to read in sunlight, and contrary to the manual it is neither user friendly or intuitive...I have an older black and white screen Nokia "shorty" that runs circles around this phone.  Good luck.
Nice phone design marred by several faults that can't be overcome:1.  Who thought to put a tinted screen on this model?  You can barely see it inside and it can't be seen at all outside if the least bit of light hits it.2.  Manual states volume is easily adjusted by pushing the up and down arrow on the keypad.  Guess what?  I saw no difference no matter how I pushed the button.  The screen said the volume was going up but it wasn't.3.  No vibrate mode.  Claims it has it but the manual makes no mention of it.  Later discovered you can set it to vibrate -- while making a call!On the plus side, it does have good reception and it seems to last about 8 days on standby, give or take.
This phone is not advertised specifically as "unlocked"; therefore, there is nothing wrong with it if you read the description! It is functional for those who aren't interested in messing with extraneous applications.
the phone came on time, shipping was quick, but the seller had told me the product was brand new, when in fact it definitely was used for a short while, also i do believe the phone had gotten wet also before being sold, i dont think i will be buying anymore electronics online, you cant trust that they'll be in the best shape when you get them
I bought this phone about two months ago and I have to say that I have no problems with it what so ever.  Reception is excellent especially in my country of SVG, and it has so many features.  You could tell that they put a lot of effort into the camera which takes excellent pictures, with different frames, multishot, mosaic shots etc.  The speakers are good for playing music at high volume.  But I was a little disappointed in the music player,  its not as good as those on the sony ericsson phones, but thats okay.  Receiving and sending music is a breeze through the bluetooth.My one big problem with this phone is its operating system, you have to be a real phone geek like me to go through all the menus needed to access.  But once you get used to it, you wouldn't notice it so much. Also the body of the phone attracts a lot of grease or should I say body sweat,  once you get a silicon case you wouldn't notice that at all.If you want a simple phone this is not it for you.  But if you want a smartphone for a good price the Samsung Blackjack is the phone for you.
I've had this for a few months now and must say that overall, this is a good phone. It was easy to configure gmail and google maps. I'm surprised, however, that hotmail and messenger are not included in the software. I believe you might need to buy extra software if you want to use that (or maybe get the new version with the new version of windows mobile). Below are some comments on this phone:PROS: sharp screen, good voice quality, qwety keyboard, 3G, able to sync with outlook server.CONS: battery life (needs to be charged EVERY day), quality of pictures is not that great (although I rarely use the camera), no standard plug for headphones, you need to reboot every so often because weird things will happen (Windows problems, bluetooth will stop working, the time will get messed up, it will just hang).
This is an outstanding phone. The box included a very thin user's guide -missing some features. The travel charger as well as the USB cable were included in the box. I wish I had received the CD and the Getting Started booklet. Besides this, this phone is slim and has nothing to envy a blackberry.
After an initial set back of having the wrong phone delivered... The device works great, and the Customer Service was excellent, they immediately sorted everything out...
I purchased this refurbished.  It is a great value for the money.  Many people complain about the battery life, and initially I did too.  But, I found a few websites that talked about changing from G technology to E technolgy via a code.  When I first got the phone, the battery did not last the entire day.  When I changed the code, the battery life lasted up to three full days.  I don't use the internet much, but I do text a lot.  The phone is pretty easy to use - I am still trying to figure a few things out.  All in all, I really like it.
I got this phone from AT&T; almost 2 years ago and it's been one of the worst experiences I've had with any phone. I've owned many phones since 1998 and never had this many problems with one. I am on my 3rd BlackJack since I had to have it exchanged for various problems related to reception and software.The phone itself is not too bad, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The software on the other hand, Windows Mobile 5 is absolutely crap. My wife has a Palm Centro with the old palm OS and that is 100 times better than the Mobil 5 I have on mine. Last couple of weeks the phone randomly decides to change the date and I start getting all the reminders for an entire year. That's just one of the many annoyances I've had.I think you get my point and recommendation to stay away from this phone. I've see this phone upgraded to Windows Mobil 6 and it's slightly better but still not good enough to make me buy another Widows Mobile phone. I would recommend that you look into a phone that does not use the Widows Mobile platform. Just my two cents.
This is a refurb with a new exterior.Works great, no problems so far.I would buy it again.
easily this is the worst phone I have ever owned.the poor battery life has left me stranded on more than one occasion.you must keep a spare battery with you charged and ready at all times.I'd just assume crush it with a hammer and burn its remains in a ritual fire.
I haven't used the phone but was about to buy it,but for some reason I checked the sellers who are selling it used for $99 and I realized on their description they state that the phone is Not unlocked, although the title is for an (Unlocked phone) so I thought you may want to be careful, again if the prices is too good to be true then its not true:) of course the sellers morals are questionable in my opinion so I decided not to buy it.
I'm glad I waited awhile to write this review, because when I first got this phone, I loved it (I should note that I'm already on my second one as the first one stopped working, and was covered under warranty). The music player is fun, and the camera takes good pictures (the flash is a helpful feature). But, as time goes on, this phone really wears out - and fast. The power/end call button stopped working altogether on my first one, and the select (circle) button fell off. The power button was a warranty issue, so I had to pay $10 (S&H;) and got a new phone. Well, six months into the second one, I had the same issue w/ the select button. This is a well known defect with this phone, as I learned when I went into the T-Mobile store, but it is not covered under warranty. Then, about 3 months after that, the entire larger circle that contains the up/down/left/right arrows fell off. The phone is now very difficult to use as I must use my nail and press in one exact spot to navigate anywhere on the phone.
got this phone in rose color;-)so far so good love how clear the pics are and how it opens and closes i use to have a prepaid phone now i have month to month minites.the color is so cute
I've had this phone for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. When I first turned it on, it was in Italian, but it wasn't too hard to switch it to English.It has good reception, great battery life, good volume. It works great with my AT&T; pre-paid account.I bought a 2 GB micro SD card to put music on it and a Motorola USB to headphone adapter so that I can use my existing headphones.So far, there are only a couple of negatives. One is that I can't turn the headphone volume down low enough. Even at the lowest volume setting, it is still a little too loud for my liking. I may try to find a set of headphones with built-in volume controls. The other is a very minor issue, but still a little annoying, and that is the lag between when I press the shutter button for the camera and when the picture is taken. Since this is my 1st camera phone, I'm not sure if that is normal or not. When trying to take pictures of a 2 year old, you've got to be fast.Overall this is a great phone and was well worth the price.
I have owned 3-4 different Motorola phones and this is the one I like the most so far.Pros:SIM card - I travel to Asia often and it's great to be able to get separate local phone cards to be used on the same phone, instead of paying for all the roamings or having 2 phones for different places.Quad band - again, good for travelling.MP3/Camera/Videos - nice to play with.Micro SD card memory - store all your music, photos and video and other personal stuffs in the SD card.  If one day you feel like getting rid of the phone, or lend it to someone else, just take away the SD card.  No need to go through the entire phone and delete files.Slider - no worries about pressing some buttons accidentally.  Of course you can always program a keypad lock.ConsBattery life... well, it started out great.  Was impressed by only having to charge it 3-4 days with moderate usage.  A few months later, similar usafe now requires me to charge it every other day.Still a good phone, and looks cool.
This phone is fantastic! It has a good heft in your hand so it doesn't feel dainty. The menus are intuitive & can be rearranged to fit your needs. The camera is sharp and the speakers seem to be able to make some noise. Lastly I love how they included a multiple number under one contact system, that makes my entry of numbers a lot simpler. I would definetly buy this phone again
Got this phone for 90-yr grandmother who has forgotten how to use a regular cell phone.  I have programmed numbers into it (took a while since there aren't any number keys), and used it for several days with my own sim card just to see how it works.  The ringer volume can really be cranked up.  Ringer songs sound like kiddie songs---the upside is that they sound pleasant.  Overall call sound is great for this little phone.  During one conversation both myself and the person I was talking with heard a slight echo, but it was only one time.  I stopped using it after a few days because I was missing my own phone with its convenient bluetooth headset.  (Also, I charged it the first day, and then didn't charge it for 4 days.  I kept it on all the time and used it as my phone.  It was down to one battery 'bar' on the 4th day.)**The best part about this phone is that I got an unlocked version and it works perfectly with my TMobile family plan.  I wasn't crazy about paying for the special/limited service offered by other companies.  The Firefly phone uses GSM service, so any company that can use those phones will work.  TMobile is one of those.The phone size is tiny.  TINY.  The up-side is that I got a lanyard for the phone and my grandmother can wear it around her neck.  With her declining health and increasingly limited mobility, we were getting concerned about her ability to get to her 'land line' phone or the pull-cords that are strategically placed in the bathroom & bedroom (what if she's not near them when she falls/has an emergency situation).  And having to cross even the living room to make/answer a call is an ordeal.  Now having this little phone around her neck will be more convenient and give us & her peace of mind.There is a silly 'light show' button between the volume buttons.  I thought it would just confuse her if she hit it.  After removing the phone's casing, the button was really easy to cut off--problem solved.  Also, the case has lots of 'free space' that I will be decorating with little labels to help her remember what the keys are for.I was worried about the possibility of her accidentally calling 9-1-1.  You have to hold the emergency button (which doesn't stick out as much as the volume keys---it's almost flush with the sides), then push the 'send' button for the 9-1-1 call to ever be completed.I wasn't crazy about the 'Mom' and 'Dad' keys (poor planning on Firefly's part), and they were easy to rename in the menu, as well as having plenty of room below the keys to affix labels.My only complaint is that the screen is too small.  It does light up (as do the keys--very bright too), but it could be larger.  I got a small credit-card sized magnifying plastic card that is now also hanging from the lanyard.  Hopefully she'll use it as needed with the screen and any other uses she might have...Now that I have programmed, disfigured, and completely covered this phone in labels, I am sending it to her this week.  I will update my review after I see how she does with it.Hope this helps others who have an elderly friend/family member.  There really aren't many options out there for that population.  ;)
One would suppose that a company producing and marketing a product for young children would consider children. One might also suppose that children's product company would consider child safety.And you might also think that a telecommunications company would be required by law to provide what they sell. Or, that a telecommunications company would remember that phones are for safety as well as for fun and games. Not so with Firefly Mobile, producers of the flyPhone and glowPhone for children.I am a grandmother. When a family crisis hit, I decided my seven year old grandson needed to be able to have easy, friendly, reliable access to family members and to be able to reach help, an adult or parent when necessary. The phone was principally for his safety and security.At the heart of a phone for a child, regardless of age, the telephone is a way to reach a parent or helper when necessary and much more than just a way to play games or try out ring tones when bored.Firefly seemed to have considered children and produced a phone that is user friendly for young children, so I ordered one and had it sent to my grandson in a different state.Four months, two hundred dollars, innumerable hours and several other problems later, I can accurately report that Firefly Mobile isn't interested in your child, your child's well-being, you, or providing the services that you paid for.Now, why am I spending my time to tell you this? Because sixty years later and forty some years in the world of business, I'm still surprised and saddened that a company trading in the illusion of caring about children doesn't and that a communications company can sell communication methods that it doesn't provide.I purchased the firefly glowPhone with accessories and had it sent to my grandson. I signed up for their automatic refill option so that he would be safe, able to make calls whenever he needed to and would never run out of minutes. This plan refills the phone from your credit card whenever the balance is low.His parents and I spent several hours setting up the account online after the phone arrived, but the next day, the information wouldn't be there. We could never get the account to work and the phone worked for three days. After several thirty minute waiting periods to get someone in Customer Service, I finally did.The problem? The phone was out of money. I wondered how this was possible since it was supposed to automatically refill. I was advised that their software didn't work, but that it would be up and running very soon and they added some money to the phone from my credit card while I was on the phone.A very long story short, we tried for two months to get the account to work. At long last, I was advised that Firefly had no idea when the software would work. Their solution was that I could call in and wait the half hour for Customer Service to answer the phone and add refills verbally on my credit card on an ongoing basis. There was no way to know how much was left on the account without making the call.After needing to use the phone several times during a two day period, the inevitable finally happened. My grandson had an emergency and the phone didn't work because it didn't refill and I didn't know he had needed to use it as often those two days.Enough! The safety tool had become a liability. I called fireflyMobile, waited the allotted time to finally reach someone in customer service, added fifty dollars to the phone and was advised: "We have no idea how long it will take to get this problem fixed. It could be a very long time. The only way we can solve this is to change the phone number and hope that works."Needless to say, I got my grandson a different phone. One that worked. One he could feel safe with.So when I contacted fireflyMobile and asked to return the phone and get the balance on the phone account back, you know what they said? "There are no returns even if we didn't provide you with the services we sold you. Even if we kept telling you the last three months it was going to be fixed." Oh, the the balance? It disappeared from the account.I'm thinking there are a lot of people out there who have had this problem. People who spent a ridiculous amount of time, money and their child's security on a "refill" program that didn't work. I think this is called a class action suit. I'm thinking this is child endangerment.I'm going to post this to as many places and agencies as possible in hopes that telecommunication companies are stopped from offering services they cannot provide particularly to our children.Addendum: Three months later, fireflyMobile has never responded to these complaints, the unprovided service or request for a refund.This information was successfully added to the ConsumerAffairs.com database
I bought this phone mid November for a Christmas gift for my 8 year old son. It's a great looking phone and easy to use. BUT......when i tried to apply my pre-paid minutes (from the card i purchased with the phone), i had big problems. I has already activated my phone on line and had an account set up. I could go back and fourth to it etc.... but when i tried to apply my prepaid mins, the auto phone service didn't recognize my number. So i called customer service (after was on hold for over and hr)and they told me so many people had activated at the same time and they working on the systme still and my number should be recognized soon. They told me to give it 24 hrs. Well i did wait 48 hrs and nothing....so i was left with a phone where i could not apply mins. They were very happy to take my credit card details and charge my card and apply mins that way, but i didn't want to put more money into this company that were obviously having technical problems. Hail to Target.....they took the phone back and gave me a refund but the $25 min card could not be returned...so i am out this amount. I bought a $15 trac phone that immediately loaded my trac mins and is working great and has way better calling rates. My son prefered the firefly but couldn't use it...... very disappointing.
I purchased this phone for my son and had no complaints. I just made sure I added $10 every 3 months. After adding minutes to my son's phone on 7/3/08, it stopped working on 7/05/08. Apparently, the company that provided service for firefly changed. To make a very long story shorter, the new company now charges 35-cent daily fee (without informing us of impending changes), new sim cards were issued with new numbers and balances were not transferred. I think that their lack of disclosure is reprehensible and won't be adding any future minutes to that phone.
We bought this phone for our 7 year old daughter who has a vision impairment.  We thought the buttons were big enough and the phone would be easy to use.  Trying to refill minutes, getting a new sim card and using their worthless internet site has been a nightmare!!  Shop elsewhere!
I won't reiterate what everyone else has said about the SIM card, although I fell into that same trap. Back long, long ago, when the phone was still (sometimes) working, I never had the slightest clue wht my daughter was trying to say on it! It seemed to pick up and magnify every bit of background noise so that the speaker's voice came through sounding like Charlie Brown's teacher. BEWARE THIS PRODUCT!!! IT IS A TOTAL RIP-OFF!!! I CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH BAD THINGS ABOUT IT WITHOUT USING MUCH PROFANITY!!!
I gave both my grade school age daughters one of these. They are easy to use for the kids! Easy to program!!! It taught them to be aware and responsible without risking an expensive phone! Thanks so much!!
This item is a great concept, BUT, First of all you have no idea how many minutes are on your phone unless you go online to find out.  The phone does not hold a charge long enough to last the day.  Your child cannot text you back because the phone hasn't the capability, providing they can even receive them on this thing with all of it's need for tech. support.....I ended up getting my child a trac phone, cost less and worked much better. Do not waste your money on this thing.
This item did not come with anything that was mentioned in the Product Description. So, none of this:"Includes: Firefly Prepaid Phone (Blue) SIM Card (the unique identifier that allows your phone to have a phone number assigned. FYI, some carriers are charging extra for this.) 30 Firefly Prepaid Minutes Charger Backpack Clip"What a ripoff. When I called Customer Service for MobileCity, they simply said there were no sim cards included for any phone that they were selling.
EL EQUIPO FISICAMENTE ES MUY ELEGANTE DE EXCELENTE CALIDAD PERO EL SOFTWARE PRESENTA CIERTAS FALLAS (ES MUY LENTO).
I Just figured out that this phone has no warranty in US. So please be careful.
the sound is pour for a $100 phone,like many of the cheap go phone,well not that bad.the sony ericson z310 is a much better buy.and its a cingular go phone only $50
The product was received in good condition.  It was a new phone...not refurbished and sold new.  When the SIM card was inserted the phone picked up the authorized network and was ready for use.  Great purcase and would recommend to others who are in the market for a similar product.
I like the setup of directory part razr v3.Make it easy to use phone. in international calls
I was very satisfied with our purchase through this dealer.  The price seemed reasonable, and the phone was delivered in the condition described, and in a timely fashion.  I would recommend this dealer to anyone who is looking for an unlocked phone or phone accessory.
First the cell phone was used and not brand new. The display screen came off at the time and the body of the cell phone was all scratched up. When I contacted DataVision and complained (they make you hold like 20 minutes before you are able to speak to any representative), they apologised and basically told me to buy a new one and the best they could do was to send it for free while sending the previous one back. I had to gift this one to a family member just before christmass and therefore I had no option but to go ahead with their offer. However the return postage on the return item was paid by me and I have not been reimbursed the money yet for the return item even after nearly a month has passed. I will not buy anything from Datavision from now on.
This purchase was to replace a Razor that completely went black after 9 months.  Because I had all of the accessories for the Razor, I purchased another.  Half of my information did not transfer to the new phone.  This new Razor is an unlocked phone and obviously from a different service provider.  It is totally different than the previous phone and I am unable to connect to the Internet or receive picture emails.  Just pay full price for a phone with your provider...
This phone is junk. The design stinks. Buttons are too small. The back cover keeps falling off and won't secure tightly. Can't upload ringtones from a third party. Every now and then, you'll be dialing and certain number keys don't work. Then you try again and other number keys don't work. You reboot the phone and it's still screwy. Only after turning it off for ten minutes was able to get it working correctly. Good thing I wasn't trying to dial 911.Then a week later it's deja vu all over again. Not just one phone. Both mine and my ol' lady's phone too.Junk. Garbage. Cr*p.
This phone is a great upgrade from the 750ki.. I am an international traveller and with the G3 networks of this phone I now truly have global reach (Korea and Japan).  I won't even begin to talk about the great pics this phone takes.Excellent purchase!
only reason i gave 3 stars was because the phone feels cheap.The phone is exactly the way it was described, but coming from Nokia and at that price i expected something more "solid". Though, the phone does work and does all it says it can do. the cheap platic feeel is what i dont like. About the phone being"unbreakable" i doubt it. The sim card cover almost broke when i was trying to open it. If you dont mind the cheap feel, go for it. It works.16/11/08I am adding this review after using the phone for about 5 months.1. The battery is a washout. I have had to replace the battery since the one that came with the phone stopped working  about  month ago.2. The screen goes off by itself even with a fully charged battery.3. Some of the buttons choose when they want to work and when they do not choose to, they do not workConclusion: This phone is an imitation of Nokia. I cannot believe Nokia will allow  such poor workmanship in their phones. i have two other Nokia phones which i have been using for years without problems. My candid advice: Avoid this phone!
Product in perfect condition, but not a quad band as described when i bougth it, I need the phone to use it in another country and didnt work, very unsatisfied and can't returned because i'm not at the US.
Its a phone.  It makes calls, it sends text messages, and can even take some pictures.  If you're sharp, you can upload a custom ringtone to the phone.Can be pretty slow...typing a text message takes a while, since the text doesn't show up for half a second to a second.  Address book searching and scrolling is similar; don't press a button a few times to scroll down one thing, you will end up at the bottom.
i bought this cell for my mom as she said she wanted a simple phone.. this phone does the job its nothing fancy but it works. i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a replacement phone. i only rated it 4 stars because it does not have bluetooth.
I would have given this phone a '5'if I was warned that AT&T; operated on a band not covered by this phone! I had to search all over the internet to see how other customers got theirs to work. Once I got the program and downloaded it to the phone, I must say that I am very impressed by all the features that this phone has!It is indeed the best phone that I have ever owned. If you are an AT&T; customer, be sure to look for "the Edge" and Quad band. If you do not like technical stuff, I suggest that you stick to a phone that comes ready to be used!In summary, I love the design, the features, the size, sound (talk and music), picture quality, and the memory card that comes with it! This is a great find!!!!
Tiny (but thick) and packed with more features than an iPhone or Curve. Adobe Flash, podcasting, pdf, msword files, wifi, videocalling. This phone will be ahead of the game for a while. The N82 and the N95 are the only units that best this phone but they go for $100-200 more. Dependable and glitch-free. Best phone for the money. Third best phone regardless of price. The stealth phone to have.Caveat: This is a slider phone. Slider phones are not as durable as candy bar units. After 1.5 years of riding in my pocket and only one drop onto carpet, the flex cable broke. SLIDERS ARE PRONE TO FLEX CABLE ISSUES. Google 'flex cable'.
I must echo other online reviews about this phone. It shines... and basically that's what it does.This is a phone about fashion. And thus, I believe it's geared towards fashion concious women.I'm a middle aged male and I enjoy the shiny look and appreciate the elgant metal that covers most of the phone (so much that it's not just an "accent").I also appreciate the good sound of the MP3 player and the autofocus of the 2 Megapixel camera with Schneider-Kreuznach Optics (whoever they are).Therefore, I bought it for my wife. BUT I didn't notice that it didn't work on her operator's band, so I'm stuck with it.As a middle aged male who's looking for more function than form, this beautiful phone just doesn't work for me, and here's why:1. The scrolling wheel is not responsive enough.2. The keys are awkardly placed. Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3. Also, there's not much tactile feedback to notice the separation between the keys (so you must be able to look at the phone when dialing). Try texting fast with it...4. The interfase software is not great. Very basic MP3 player.5. Love the autofocus... Hate the autofocus! It's great that you can get the camera to focus on things 1 inch away from the lens. Great to take a good pic of a business card or any other stationary object. Bad if you try to shoot a moving target, because it takes at least one full second to focus. It just won't work because there's such a delay (at least 2 seconds) from the moment you press the button to the moment the picture is taken, that you get either blurred pictures or the events you want to picture have already passed (and gone). You can't shut down the shutter (no mute, can't change the sound either). And where's the ZOOM??? Couldn't figure it out: Volume keys don't do it and scroll wheel doesn't do it either.6. Shine! Really, I had never experienced such a frustrating thing as trying to use this phone in sunlight. It's near impossible. It REALLY is that bad.7. Bluetooth connection has not happened smoothly. I haven't been able to send pics via bluetooth to my BlackBerry Curve. And when I connect the ear piece to the Shine, the ear piece loses all settings and stops connecting to my BB (so I must do the whole pairing process again). I had a Nokia before and I could connect my ear piece to both phones simmultaneously without a problem (I'm not saying I could have two conversations at once, but I could receive a call from any of the two phones at one time).8. Reception is not good9. Scratches easily all over; fingerprint magnet10. I drive a lot. I LOVE voice dialing. Where is it?11. The loudspeaker is so underpowered that the speakerphone function is close to useless. I love speakerphones because I can multi-task with both hands free.So, if you're someone who expects a cell phone to be more functional than a basic $10 household phone, maybe this one's not for you.If you want to shell $200 for a great looking phone that only works as a phone (and not the best at that), that's your call. You can alwas look at it as a piece of jewelery (or get one of those gold plated phones with diamonds and rubies).I'm fine and happy with my BlackBerry Curve, thank you. Even if I still have to get me a better camera.Two other words of advice:1. I bought an unlocked phone imported from I don't know where. Thus, be sure to check connectivity with your operator first! Tri-Band means the phone works on any of 3 bands... make sure your operator has one of them.2. My primary language is spanish and the phone I got seems to be an asian version. Thus I can only choose between english and a bunch of asian languages (vietnamese, chinese, simplified chinese, etc.)
i looked at all the reviews for this phone and weighed the pros and cons.. i used to get phones based on all the new stuff out there, but i realized all i need in a phone is calling, texting, decent camera, and a nice stylish finish.. this phone looks alot better in person and in your hands than on the computer screen.. the features could be more intuitive but after trying them out 2-3 times it's simple and easy.. this phone looks amazing.. i recommend for anyone looking for a really nice phone that isn't into data stuff way too much
Purchased this LG SHine, received it in the box and noticed thebox had been opened and wires were not in a new package, looked to be opened and used, not sure why amazon would send me a used item, contacted them and they says they will give me %30 off so go figure
I bought this phone to replace my t-mobile samsung t629 or whatever-it- was-called slider phone when the screen on it decided to flunk after a year and a couple months. no phone insurance, and i was actually kinda glad to have an excuse to get rid of that awful phone that t-mobile conned me into getting. this LG is basically the same design, but 100 times better build quality and just all around a better phone. i slid my tmobile sim card in and when i turned it on immediately had full service, much more so than my old samsung. i opted for standard shipping and still receieved the phone within 2 days. this cell is perfect in every aspect, i'd give it 5 stars except for the lack of text message ringtones that was already previously mentioned. it only has 5 different tones and they all suck. you can set mp3's for calls, but nothing for texts. thats the worst part but i can deal with it. other than that a terrific buy, would have cost me twice as much to get a replacement phone even remotely as good from the t mobile store. another A+ for amazon, who never cease to amaze me with great deals and superb shipping you can't find anywhere else.
I got the phone today, but I used it on speaker for about an hour and a half and the battery didn't budge.  Feels sturdy, has a REALLY good sliding action, nice to have the "profiles" so you can easily/quickly change the alert settings, nice to be able to use mp3's as ring tones (unlike some motorolas I have had...) has a nice menu function with shortcuts, and is very nice looking.  The one thing I wish it had is a better AlarmClock.  It only has a very limited number of tones (none of them very good for an alarm clock) and you can only set on alarm.  That is the ONE thing I miss from my slvr, with it you could set multiple alarms.  If I find out anything else of interest, I will edit this review, after all, I have only had the phone for about 8 hours...
This phone was an international version, which we weren't aware of at purchase.  It came locked and we were never able to get the code to unlock so we could access our wireless network.  We got 2 weeks of run around and were finally given an overseas number to call.  At that point we finally returned it and called our wireless company to order the phone through them.
Bought this camera for my wife as a surprise upgrade from her Motorola C139 - what a big mistake!While the Shine is very good looking, the metal casing makes the phone much more heavy (good thing for some)and thicker than shown on the ads.what is truly bad with this phone is the poor software which has several layers to get what you want.  For example you can't get to your telephone directory list w/o doing a search for by name.  On the C139, you simply press the "up" or "down" arrow, and you are taken directly to your directory list.mp3 player - while there is a built in one on this phone, there is few (if any) options to figure out playlists etc.  moving songs to the SD card is also very cumbersome.  Again, i blame this on the software.Lastly, the battery life is terrible.  First, the charger is an international adaptor, and you need to be sure it's plugged in correctly to the socket as well as to the phone, often you could not tell if the phone was actually charging; you had to play around, press random buttons to be sure the charging sign was "on".Battery life is about 48 hours on an idle phone!!! much shorter if you actually use the darn thing.  With the software being so bad, you usually use about "2 bars out of 5" just going thru the various menus to add contacts, or try to figure out "short cuts" for the software (about 10 min of use).  Then you have to struggle with the charging aspect again....We really wanted to love this phone especially given its good looks and the price we paid for it +$200, but no love, can cure this dog...
This phone was a total disapointment. It looks pretty but was not worth the money for sure. Texting was a pain and with it being a European phone text the number 0 was not an option. Being in the US using this phone it would drop my calls and half of the time it would say no signal or no carrier, I would have to shut down my phone and restart it! Also you can not find any software to use the MP3 player. Sent the phone back within the first month.
this is a good phone except its designed for the over seas area, itdoesn.t work well with at&t; does work better for t-mobile, phone will roam to t-mobile network
this is a verry good deal it does work with my network (t-mobile) the only thing is the internet needs to be set by your carrier. the camera has a great picture and its a good phone to use. the roller bar is a little sensitive and you cant change it either. the mp3 player is great. all in all its a good phone for the price.
I was very thrilled when I got my new LG Shine phone.The phone itself is very sturdy and feels great in my hand. A great improvement to the cheap feeling phone I had before.The design is immaculate, the scroll down menu is very unique, and fingerprints do not cloud the screen as easily as I thought they would.And the camera is stunning. It seems to take pictures with equal quality as my digital cameras.All in all, this is a great phone. My favorite out of all the phones I have owned so far.However, it only gets a 4 star because of how disappointed I was with the image viewer and SMS message tones. The images load slowly and are still minimized part way when in full few. And you are unable to choose your own SMS message tone. This wouldn't be such a drawback, except for the SMS tones are very very annoying and just unsuitable in general.
This phone is really awesome. The shine effect, the signal quality, software, and batery lasting are very good. I first though than the battery would drain out in 1 day, but the phone with normal use lasts for 3 days no problem and 4 days if you don't talk to much. The screen brightness and colors are very good and the autofocus camera is also Ok.This is a must if you're looking for a fashion well designed phone.
this phone the lg ke780 shine is indeed a pretty phone but.internet dosent work.you can not send or recieve multimedia messeges..no sending pic or recieveing them either .it is an international phone so the service sucks..i never have any bars i go into my bathroom and it says no service emergency calls only.i have at&t; my old motorola crappy phone has better reception then this brand new lg shine ..hey it has some cool ringtones  though.
Great looking phone and nifty features. Too bad it doesn't work with my AT&T; service. Good thing Amazon accepts returns.
compré el ke970 más que nada por su apariencia, es muy elegante y cómodo, se siente fuerte (por ser de aluminio)sin ser demasiado pesado, al encenderlo me doy cuenta que es igual, elegante y fácil de usar, hasta donde lo he utilizado tiene buena recepción de señal, las fotos son bonitas pero la cámara es algo lenta para tomarlas...lo que no me gusta, es no poder personalizar todo, si acaso cambiar el fondo (y no he podido utilizar archivos flash, solo los determinados) con algunas imagenes, no me ha permitido utilizar los gifs que he encontrado en la webbueno, si les gusta el celular tal como viene de fábrica, está bien, pero si lo quieren personalizar... está muy dificil
Only just received the phone, and it seems great so far. Was a little surprised to find a 3-pin UK charger (with a cheap nasty adapter for US power outlets). The phone would not charge, so I investigated and it turned out that the CHEAP NASTY adapter-plug (not a sony product) was at fault. I had to bend the contacts in the adapter plug a little so that they would make contact with the pins on the charger. Not such a big deal...but wanted to share this in case anyone else is having problems. Also, the menus at start-up were in Japanese! Luckily I made a few good guesses and ended up at the English/Japanese selection screen. Apart from these minor details, so far the phone seems great. Love the design & shape of the phone. Has plenty of features, most of which I'll probably never use, but as a phone I love it so far.
This phone does it all for me.  I love the sound quality, & the functions.  I found it easy to use right from the get go.  The only problem I'm having is finding a belt holder that fits such a thin phone.  Guess I'm gonna have to start wearing suit jackets & put it in the inner pocket :)
I intended to purchase a true 4-band cel which I could use in any place, and I trusted Amazon description which states "Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz".But when I inserted the SIM of a 850 MHz network the cell did not work, after some searching in the cel menus I found out that Amazon description is wrong, since it is intended only for 900, 1800 and 1900 MH.So be careful if you need to use it overseas..........
This phone is awesome!  All I pretty much needed was the blue tooth and it has it so that serves the purpose.  Only thing I am dissapointed with is the fact that the phone service does not transfer over to AT&T.;  It only stays on for cingular so I often get dropped calls and no signal.  That can be a problem if I am in an area where the phone picks up no signal and I have an emergency.
This phone is the one I rely on to do what a phone does... make calls and retrieve my voice mail. The battery life is awesome, the phone is sturdy and very well made, and the flashlight and alarm clock come in very handy! I love this phone. Oh, and I am addicted to the little Snake game. But this phone isn't about extras, it's about phone calls. I can go a looong time without having to recharge it, too.
This is a pretty solid phone.  The one I got came from Mexico.  It still was easy to switch it to english, but some of the stuff is still in spanish, such as the games.  Not really a big deal to me, though.  It's pretty simple to use and everything.  No real complaints as of yet.
Good, cell phone, a good quality. A little more than a regular cell. Just perfect!
the purchase was a gift that was ecstatically received and is still very much appreciated...the only bummer was that i didn't notice that it could only transfer info via infra-red; i thought that Bluetooth was a given...that said, it's still an awesome product!well done!...Shipping was on time too!
fast shipping, nice phone, no complains...Lousy charger, but nothing that a little foil and duct tape can't fix.
I bought this phone because I wanted a cheap phone. This one is pretty bad. The battery life is poor and it is not user friendly at all. The speaker volume is very low.
This product says "U.S. version," but there is nothing American about it.  Mine came only with Spanish instructions and a foreign electrical cord and adapter that is not UL® listed.  I will not use it because I consider it unsafe.  The description should make it clear that this product was not manufactured for use in the US.  I am returning this unit.  I bought the w200a directly from Sony Ericksson and it is exactly what I expected.
the service..... its unbelievable just tell  them whats the problem and the answer is right there infront of you. God its  fasssssst. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope you got lots of items to sell.
So I ordered this phone a few days before the latest warning comments were written.  My phone seems to be from Russia, or somewhere else they use Cyrillic script.  The charger provided does not fit US wallsockets.  That is the dealbreaker right there.  If I hadn't been replacing a Sony Ericsson w810i and still had a charger that fit, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EVEN CHARGE THE PHONE.  It was simply luck on my part that this phone could even work for me.  !!  Thankfully, when I inserted my SIM card, it let me choose English as my language of choice, and everything is working fine, due to me having a correct charger.However, I'm sure some of you wouldn't be so lucky.  I'd recommend ordering this phone thorough the official Sony Ericsson website for just about... 15$ more, I think, and not having to waste time and energy on this seller.As for the phone itself, I'd give it a 4 star, due to crappy camera and annoying center/control button, but I feel it's more important to warn others of this seller.
This phone works terribly...although I do not think it is due to the quality of the product itself. Being an unlocked phone, it came loaded with software from the service provider of whatever country it came from. It came from a spanish speaking country and the internet software, games, and some other items are in spanish only. Even if you configure the phone to English it seems to operate in a sort of "Span-glish". Audio quality and reception are sub-par. Internet is simply impossible to use. If you purchase an unlocked phone it may be wise to buy one of USA origin (if even possible)
My girlfriend had an iphone that she ran over (dont ask how)and i bought her this phone to hold her over till she can afford a new one. When i got this everything is in spanish. All the books and cd is in spanish. The phone itself was in spanish. I finally found the settings and changed it to english, but all the alerts and alarms were in spanish still. I got little to no reception. 90% of the day the phone would read, emergency calls only. It feels very cheap like your gonna break it just dialing a phone number. My girlfriend used it for 2 days and i finally threw it away. On the plus side it did come with headphones and lets you download quite a bit of music to it. Also the wall charger was these two thin prongs, but came with an adaptor to fit in regular outlets. I dont know what country uses this plug in but i can make one guess. I dont recommend this phone for anyone unless your in dire need of a cheap phone fast.
Although this product is AT&T; "compatible", the seller fails to say that this product is not AT&T; "approved". When attempting to activate, it was discovered that it costs much more to use an "unapproved" device.
I am returning this midget sized unlocked cellphone. It lacks everything that a working Man needs for his everyday work week. Do not be mislead by all the fancy options that come with this pint sized downgraded version of the famous walkman. In this case it is simply a matter of what you get for the money that you have spent.
Alot of people have written reviews about this phone before me, and I must say none of the people on Amazon who wrote a review got anywhere near the truth.This phone is indeed slow. The Symbian software has it's flaws, but this is nothing to take seriously. This phone does everything it says it does, and better than it assumes.The bluetooth connectivity is one of the fastest I have seen so far, and I have owned 7+ phones. Infared has become obsolete, but is a nice gimmick for those with an infared port on their PC or laptop, although the data cable is faster, it might also be one of those thing you forget on your travels abroad. And at those moments I am sure you will very much apreciate that little black square at the bottom of this device.So much for connectivity, for those are the only options.Th keyboard is so pleasant text messages and emails will flow from the device within a minute or so, as I have experianced.It also does everything a computer can: numbers, symbols and letters are all included of course, but even things such as ctrl+c to copy highlighted text, and ctrl+v to paste. Highlighting is done by pressing the ctrl and the upwards arrow (located right next to it) at the same time. Very pleasant indeed.The joystick work excellent and makes navigating much easier and controlled.The screen is vibrant and very clear even in broad daylight. Bad thing about the screen is that wallpapers do not cover the entire homescreen, as I would have liked to see. A complete log makes up for that however, and a large clock makes for easy time reading.The possibilities are endless, it can and will open all Microsoft Office document, and has simplified applications wich can be compared to all major Office tools.Mobile internet looks and works the best I've ever seen. No longer will you jump from line to line, but a full cursor is available and works just as well as the one on your laptop/PC. On top of that websites load fairly quick, even though I am a GoPhone user.Pictures look gorgeos, videos look well but are a bit jittery, music plays well and loud through the integrated speaker and the voice recorder works well also.IM works just as good as on any other mobile device, although the keyboard makes typing much easier.Google maps are a nice addition. But maybe not suitable for GoPhone users as it sucks up your money like a crackhead.The signal is pretty good, not worse or better than other phones and the battery life is truly amazing. Using no push-email this baby is very carefull with it's juice, and does not spill any whatsoever.Various ringtones, wallpapers, videos and games may be downloaded from sites such as Zedge, and the phone will store quite a few before a mini SD card is needed.I am very happy with this Goliath (sizewise), even if it doesn't have wifi or even a camera for that matter. Most of it's functions and it's striking versatility make more than up for it. Especially for 50 bucks on eBay. A very handy thing to have if you run a store or are a bussines person who needs something that can (but not necessarily has to) replace a laptop for conveniance.
This model has no WiFi.This model has no camera.Skip it and buy the nice Nokia e61i or N95-3. They are far better choices.
Don't even think about it. You will regret buying this phone as I did. Extremely slow to open applications. Crashes constantly specially when using the phone as a modem. I am not happy with it. I gotta stick with it until I get the e71 that according to CNET reviews is excellent.
I have had the phone for about three months and the keys keep sticking. It doesn't compute when you hang up, so you have to take the batteryt out to end the call!  I called At & T and they sent me a replacement... which is much worse than the first one!  This one does all of the above with new added problems of cutting off conversations with a loud noise and then blank air!  They shouldnt sell this phone.Two experiences with this phone, both HORRIBLE!
Purchased this model for its file compatibilities (pdf,xls,doc,etc) plus the ability to take daily notes, writing.  Also it was nice that one could select arbitrary mp3s as ringtones.The keyboard it has is fairly useless but a bluetooth keyboard eventually fixed that.  However, getting notes and docs out of this thing is difficult.  Drag and drop is not implemented (God knows why).  Exporting text thru Outlook is the ONLY option as far as I can tell. major PITA.The sound quality is nearly incomprehensible, the only way it works well is on speaker phone.The operating system runs at a snail's pace, startup and tasks are very slow.To listen to MP3s on it, one needs to purchase special headphones.It has a tendency to freeze.  Once it does, the only thing to do is to pull out the battery, replace it, and restart the phone.This is the worst phone I have ever owned.  I will never purchase a Nokia again. Avoid it if you can.
I am very happy with it. The Wallkman interface is very useful, friendly, and the quality sound if you use a good  hearphones is a plus for avoid the carriying of another gadget, for me, this is a better choice than ipod. Unfortunely, this has no FM radio, but I knew this and agree when purshased.The camera is poor in low light conditions, the lack of flash, autofocus and poor withe balance settings dont help with this cons. In day light and outdoors it can get a good pictures, with good color and sharpness. The screen has very good resolution, more little than average but can reproduce amazing graphics and text. Phone interface come with the advantages of a sonyericsson mobile, easy of use, navigate, good features and decent life battery, althoug, no the better.The keypad is confortable, no very hard no very soft, but i must say that my fingers are thin. Design is beautiful, this SE has fine details. Is a clear All in One Gadget:Pros:Design, stainless still appearence.Thin.High quality walkman.Rubberized back cover.3G ready.High resolution screen, outdoor viewable.General Good performance.High Capacity, currently I bought 4 GB card and works perfectly (comes with 1 GB card).Good pictures from camera in good light conditions.Cons:Blurry pictures in low light conditions.Data cable and charger port is not protected by ruber cover, needs constantly cleaning.Data transfer via usb cable is very low, no USB 2.0 to memory card storage, you will need to buy card reader.Because of the thin body, the sound of the speaker is "metallic".
The title may be a little corny but this phone is great. The size of the phone is smaller then most if not all Sony Ericsson phones and it is definately a thin phone for being a 3G phone. The only downside to the phone is the minor learning curve to using smaller buttons, but that only takes a few days to get used to. Overall, this is a great phone.
Pro's: pre-paid, cheap minutes & texting fees, you can add plans (like, for ex; $5 a month for 200 texts, or $20 for 1000 texts). Virgin Mobile itself has really good coverage, it has a plan with Sprint for that.I really like the phone, I like the 'flip phone' feature, I originally had a 'candy-bar' phone, I liked that one, but since upgrading to a flip phone, i like the flip way better! A lot of people have rated the VM Marbl really low, on many reviews. Since I have the green version (called "green grass--limited edition", perhaps that is an upgraded version? because I love mine!) The texting is fast, easy, and battery life is good. Of course, to get the maximum battery life, you have to completely drain the battery before recharging, this way, you conserve the energy, it charges faster and lasts longer. It doesn't have internet on this specific phone (other virgin mobile phones do) but then again, this phone is $15 in stores. I bought mine at Walmart. The minutes (called Top-Up cards) are reletively cheap. 200 minutes is $20, 400 is $30, and 1000 minutes is $50. TracFone is double that ($40 for 200 minutes, and etc. I don't mean to put down TracFone, I had them previously, and loved it! no complaints, just more expensive. Trying to weigh out the pro's and con's of both of them.Its really light, durable, bright screen, the WORST ringtones i have ever seen, I bought some online, because...they were BAD... trust me. Online they're just 2.50...so not bad. the wallpapers are pretty good, but I still bought one online, just for fun... :)Thats about it. I added pictures of the green version to the website page, so you can see it. it's a little greener in person though. it looks more teal in the picture... maybe it's just me though.
I purchased this phone with minutes on June 12. On June 21, I called Virgin Mobile because phone would not stay charged. Replacement phone received June 26. Activated replacement phone July 1, after 1 week, the exact same problem -- phone does NOT stay charged. Called Virgin Mobile again. Told me nothing wrong!! Box states standby charge = 9 days. Phone only stays charged 36 hours without use! Virgin Mobile NOT sympathetic, said nothing they can do, REFUSED to refund money for phone or minutes. Said we can only send you another replacement. Said it was "normal" to charge every night. I said "false advertising?" Virgin mobile: no comment. By the way, the service area for my location is fair to good. NO reason for battery draining all the time except its a piece of pure junk. Overall review is F- don't waste your time
Battery really dies quickly even though there aren't many features to the phone. Easy to use phone and I like it but must be charged daily. I love virgin mobile and bought the Wildcard and love it.
The Kyocera Marbl is the third phone I've had in six years with VM.The Marbl phone is available for under $15 at the big box discount stores.  The VM plan I'm on requires a minimum "top up" of $15 every three months. If you don't use up $15 of talk time in three months, it rolls over.  (But in three months you need to "top up" again - regardless of how many minutes you have left.)  Right now I have about $300 worth of minutes remaining - so you can see my phone doesn't get a lot of use.The Marbl looks good - it's thin, sleek and lightweight.  The features, including screen savers and wallpaper are cartoonish and juvenile. However, I don't use it much and the price is right - I can cope.I was excited when I found VM was at last offering inexpensive flip phones with their plan. (There were always problems tossing the non-closing variety in my bag, since I'm not inclined to set the keyboard lock.)The biggest issue with the Marbl seems to be the battery life.  I carry the phone, but rarely make calls.  The battery on this brand new phone lasts about 5 days; of course, that time will decrease as the phone ages.  But at these prices it's hard not to just think of this as a disposable phone.If I used a cell phone regularly it would certainly be worth investing in a more substantial phone with greater battery life.For an ultra cheap phone on an ultra cheap plan - it's not bad!  If you want to have a cell phone, but rarely use it, this is a great deal.
Tracfone is giving these phones away free with Tracfone services of various sorts. Here are the positives and negatives:PositivesBattery holds a long charge when charged at home with the charger that comes with the phone.You can use it to make and receive calls although see negative limitations.Small size, relatively light weight, choice of ring tones and vibrate.You can hear well when you're in a quite place and even though I have a soft voice, other's seem to hear me well, too.NegativesClunkyYou can't hear well if you are using it in a loud place or in a car. The earphone.microphone in attempting to magnify your voice also magnifies all the sounds around you. In a restaurant or in a car this makes hearing even the ringing of other person's phone and their pick up difficult if not impossible. Having a conversation is out if there is a lot of noise.No alarm clock function, which I like to have on a phone.I really suggest researching this phone on the Internet before purchasing. Most Tracfones are pretty limited in functions and style but are reliable. I researched this and decided to go with it in spite of it's limitations and it works fine for me.
I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too.  This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red "jewels" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.
I have been their customer for a while ( I should say almost 5 years).  But since then their customer service has become hopeless.  Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing.  I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it.  They have just gone down hill.Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features.  But the processor is slow.  I have to reboot it atleast once a day.  If you have the phone , wife and gps on , most time it hangs.  Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess.  For e.g auto answer and setting # of rings etc.  Not worth the price.

I hope someone can come up with a faster processor and more main memory so you can keep all working without having to reboot.
I received my phone just fine, and started it normally, and it was great. Except that when I tried to use any of the functions of it, it went black. That's not exactly the kind of thing you want when you buy a phone of this price!
First of all The N95 is an excellent Phone!!The antenna is Great! Signal strength is excellent (the best I have seen)Battery life is ok, power users may need a spare BL-5F (which can be easily carried around in a wallet).Other great features with the v21 firmware include:0) The 5MP camera provides excellent pictures vis-a-vis phone cameras. Wont be embarrassed when you share your pics with your colleagues, they may never know it was taken with a phone cam :D.1) Native youtube support using the web browser2) GPS / Maps applications like Google maps, Nokia sport tracker (which tracks your speed/ altitude/ location in real time while bicycling, and the map can be dumped in Google Earth)3) The stereo speakers are excellent and have great clarity and nice volume.4) The screen can be set to be very bright.5) 8GB microsd card can be used :D6) Great bluetooth support! almost all protocols possible7) Good for reading e-mails etc. supports push IMAP mails8) Can be used as a wireless bluetooth webcam :-)9) Compatible with almost any wired headphones / ear plugs10) NGAGE games are very nice and engaging :D11) Can be connected to a TV to playback video / slide show12) Can be used as a radio tuner :)13) Can change orientation landscape to portrait etc with rotateme application or by sliding in opposite direction14) T9 input is fast! especially when driving / using  one hand.15) Light weight and compact package16) The 5MPixel lens is protected by a shutterThe bads1) WiFi is ok. It is incompatible with Cisco Access Points :((2) The user interface is not eye-candy type and has a reasonable learning curve.3) Wired headset picks up a lot of noise4) Many applications are power hungry like GPS, Camera, Video, Youtube vide, streaming video, Battery life is marginal with very heavy use of these features.4) The TV out resolution is low! Things appear slightly pixelated
Some pros, cons and advicesPros:- Good sound quality for voice calls and for media player- Good picture and video quality (but not at dark places or at night)- Built in VoIP software took some time to make it work with a brazilian service provider. Now, it's working fine- Supports high capacity microSD memory cards (not only 2 GB chips as mentioned at Nokia website)Cons:- If you use other resources such as media player, camera, GPS, etc, your battery will last no longer than 1 or 2 days- GPS takes too long to lock to sattelites- Pictures and videos are low quality if you shot at dark places (led is no good; flash would be better for pictures)Advices:- Buy a car charger if you intend to use the GPS resources in your travels- Buy one or more high capacity microSD if you intend to shot many movies- PLEASE, avoid buying from DBRoth. The package was clearly opened in advance and DBRoth did confirm that they did open the box to check if everything was ok in the package. The problem is 3 cables were missing in the package: The data cable (USB), the video cable and the headset cable (only the controller part). For the USB cable, I solved the issue buying a new one from Radio Shack. The problem is the video cable, which is not sold as an accessory.
I try many celphones, this is the very very best of them, tryed phones(iphone, eten m700, treo 650, a1200, etc)
The phone is great. There is only a little issue, sometimes when I open it, it gets stucked for a while. It shows the nokia logo and then it gets normal.
What I LIKE about the phone:-The phone camera is actually great and takes beautiful pictures with giant resolution, although not as good as a 5mp camera (still pretty good), the video is also great with almost dvd quality.-The software is nice, easy to handle and allows you to install many applications available for the symbian operating system, I've installed msn messenger, skype, youtube and google maps.-The call quality is great.-The gps works great with the included maps application and even better with google maps.What I DONT LIKE about the phone:-After a week or two of use the slider becomes loose! and when you press a key the screen wobbles... This is a defect ALL the n95s have, and for some reason they haven't fixed, my family and friends who bought it are having the same problem... a real pain in the ***.-You have to recharge the battery every day.In conclusion: if you're looking for an expensive phone with a lot of features and are willing to put up with the loose slider problem then buy it... Although I think that for this amount of money that problem shoud definitely not be present.
I bought received the nokia n95 a couple of weeks ago so I'm still discovering its features tough I always have a nokia cell phone. What I still don't know how to do is to connect to a wlan. It seems I have to read the instruction book!Anyway, great camera, gps is ok, the mp3 sounds perfect.
OK saying that the N95 is a phone is not accurate, is an excelent photo an video camera in good lighting conditions, lots of aplicattions and a powerfull and round package. My previous cel was an Nokia and is more than 5 years old and still works very well, so I think this one will last for a long time too.
Excelent gadget. I've been playing with this phone for over 6 months by now. I recently add the Garmin software to it and I've been using it as GPS for a week. The results are great. I can navigate to any place with it. I'm not sure if a Garmin Nuvi has more reception than this one, but the N95 works fine.The camera works great in sunny days or at close range, but with low light is not as good as a digital camera (still didn't see a phone with a better camera, maybe the latest Sony with 5mp but I think that its lens is the same Carl Zeiss one).I also bought a Sandisk 8GB Micro SD that works perfect with it.I used it to reproduce .avi and .mpeg videos with the cable in a TV and works perfect (the only downsize on this feature is the absence of a remote).You can retrieve your emails in a minute (Gmail - Yahoo or Hotmail) also can chat with it (messenger).Has also VOIP capability.Some of the Pros:- Many programs to add- Better camera than most phones.- Integrated and free GPS- Symbiam OS- Flash- Great video on sunny days and interiors with regular light- 3G- Expandable memory- Speakers volume and fidelity (compare to any other phone I've tried)Why is not perfect:- Pictures with low light- Absence of a touch screen (could have a better keyboard with this)- Use Interface (compared to the iphone one)- Battery (If you use it for playing video doesn't last one day long)- Absence of a tripod adaptor- Is not as slim as other phones (but is not too bad)- Small screen (compared with the iphone)- Wi-Fi range (compared with the iphone one- Headphones volume (don't know if is for protection but is low)
A super fine cell phone, but Nokia should offer classes to use it. Too complex for the ordinary user... But if you do not want to carry a camera, an I-pod and a cell phone in our bag, this only device is perfect! Great camera, great mp3 and great cellphone (all in one).
this is one of the best phone you can find in stock for now.  I use it as a camera, as a music player and of course as a phone.  I recommend this phone to everybody.
I love the phone. The features are great and I received the package from Tiger Direct in excellent condition. The battery life only dies when using GPS a lot. Make sure you get a screen protector for your phone. It took me a day with the manual to come to terms with my phone but now we are inseparable.
Excelent!!, lots of cool features. It would be even better if a spare battery is added to the set.
This is a good phone but the documentation is horrible.  It does not even list the extra items that come with the phone and what they do or how to use them.  I am sure their are dozens if not hundreds of things i could do with this phone but I can not learn from the poor instruction booklet.It takes an extremly long time for the shutte on the camera to snap after you push down and hold the button. It seems like 5 seconds. By then you or the subject may have moved.
This is an excellent phone.  I enjoy having a high-quality camera together with my phone.  I went to Europe for a month last year, and although I didn't have international calling on my N95, I used the phone as my camera and took high-quality photos, then transferred them via Bluetooth to my laptop.  I highly recommend this phone/camera.
Nokia N95 is a complete dread.  I decided to get this over iPhone.  I bought 2 of them - as I have 2 numbers, both of them are overheated when charged.  When I spent too long on phone, it gets overheated and the system shuts itself just like that.  I cannot do anything but to take the battery out and wait for it to get cooler, replace the battery and turn it on again.I sent them to service, but the same problems still occurs.This is the worst phone I ever had in my life.  And to be honest, because of these 2 phones, I am scared of the name "Nokia"
I got this phone as a gift for xmas after seeing my brother in law's Iphone.Although this phone will cost you more than an Iphone,it is definetely worth it,because it does so much more than the Iphone.This phone a bit bigger and chunkier than the Iphone(size of a palm pilot,I guess).But the Symbian operating system works pretty flawlessly.The email setting is a piece of cake and so is the internet.I have the AT&T; mobile service and I get easyly 3G speed in most places(faster than your wifi in most cases).But when I go home(which is in the middle of nowhere),I still get an edge speed which is a bit faster than your modem conncetion.It also has bluetooth,wifi built in.And also your mobile service's package data holds pretty well(atleast on At&T;'s case).So browsing on the internet would not be a problem at all.The phone also comes with built in GPS receiver in it with Nokia map and Teleatlas.It will give you your basic map and directions when you are lot as a blind bat,but it does take a while.And also it will never beat your garmin or Lowrance portable GPS system.Now the best part about it.I WATCH MY HOME TV ON THIS!!!Please do not tell my boss though!!But it also comes with a free slingbox mobile.So if you have Slingbox at home,your N95 will connect to that and you can watch your home TVwhatever you have..Rabbit ear,Dish,Direct TV,Cable..whatever) in your phone and when it comes on a 3G network,you get very good picture as well.Oh by the way it alos has a FM radio in it and it alos plays music and video files.Please be a sport and tell me if your Iphone can do all of that????MANY THANKS AND GOD BELSS...
N95 is (mainly when we consider its price) one of the worst product of electronic engineering I think I would ever come across.Let's first put it in perspective: the main (basically the only) task the engineers had in the design desk was to bring together in a clever way a set of resources that already existed in different devices (mobile, GPS, music and video player, 5Mp camera, internet browsing capabilities, etc). They plainly failed. It would take an extensive report to describe only its most conspicuous problems, but I will concentrate in one aspect: it is a product you just cannot rely on, in any single one of its resources.- Do you need a GPS? Well, I tested it in cities like São Paulo, Atlanta, Washington DC, Buenos Aires, and most of the time I get a signal only when I don't need it anymore (i.e., it was easier to ask around for directions, or look in a map)  - and this happened when things were ok, because it frequently failed to locate the satellites even under crystal clear skies (The GPS feature was the main reason I purchased this mobile - and subsequently my first and big disappointment...)- Do you want to browse the internet using the wireless LAN? Pray that the wireless network of the hotel/bar where you are does not ask you for a password in the browser - as far as my experience goes, it will not work under these conditions- Do you want to play games? The horrible disposition of the "dedicated" keys will make sure you also press all the surroundings keys, halting, stopping and messing the game all the time. No danger of you getting addicted to this resource of your mobile.- Do you want to watch movies? I put my movies (compacted to mp4 using Nokia PC Suite) to the "My Videos" directory to watch in airports. The inbuilt media player didn't find them- Do you want to use the camera? You better don't need it for a quick shot - if you had already the visor opened, you will have to go through many keys to make it work again.- Do you want to switch on the mobile without announcing it to everybody? If you are in a plane under terrorist attack and you try to switch it on, the ridiculous opening tune will make sure you will be the first to be killed (I tried to disconnect this tune on the settings - just gave up).Speaking of planes, the whole thing is completely useless there - not being able to switch off only the phone, you have to switch it off altogether.- Do you just want a mobile phone? Be prepared to feed up (as many other reviews pointed out) this little baby every few hours.In my case none of that no longer works because (as it seems that is very usual after checking in the internet) the mobile stopped working (after only 4 months of buying it) because the screen now lit up completely black, not showing anything. After waiting on the long line of people to be attended by the Nokia local authorized Technical Assistance, I had to leave and am under the temptation on giving up of having it fixed. I would be losing my money, but I might feel relieved of getting rid of such a piece of rubbish out of my pocket.Nokia, congratulations, you created one of the crappiest gadgets ever, and even so were able to sell thousands for an outrageous price. Not a trivial achievement.
I researched the capabilities of smart phones in the market and those about to be launched and decided to buy this one over the 3G iPhone. Unfortunately my phone shuts off by itself every few days even with a full battery.  I sent it to Nokia for repair and it died again 48 hrs after getting it back from them. I then found several forums on-line where people are having similar issues with N95s, and others where people complain about the hapless service from Nokia repair.  That iPhone is looking really good right now.
I upgraded to an E90 after 1.5 years using a Nokia 9300 to it's limits.My impression is that they made a list of every single complaint I had about the 9300 and addressed each of them! It's a fantastic cell phone and I love it.- on the 9300 I didn't even bother looking at the outside S40 screen, I opened it each time even to place a call; with the E90, switching seamlessly from screen to screen just by opening and closing the phone, I find myself using the outside screen more and more, I even T9 type text in the numeric keypad!... the outside screen is great for one hand operation, great not to call too much attention to a full qwerty phone when I don't want to and great for the casual email read... I think if I didn't have the option of switching to the internal big and high-resolution screen I'd find myself cursing the QVGA outside screen, but knowing I have the option of a big screen at any time makes me more tolerant to the smaller resolution outside screen and I use it a lot- the keyboard back-light is something you don't use all the time but when you do you realize how incredibly great it is- the inside screen, with even higher resolution than on the 9300 is absolutely great- the keyboard could be a little softer but the truth is that I find myself making less typing mistakes than with the 9300; the new layout is much better and the "joystick" much more precise- vibrating alert is great but I miss the timed mode that makes it come back to the ringing General profile at a specified time- the camera could have an optical zoom but it's good enough like it is... 640*480 30fps video is great- sound recording and playback has very good quality- the interface to the WiFi interface and to the GPRS/EDGE/3G APNs is great and makes me confident I'm in control of what is being used or not, unlike some complaints I heard with WM6 that you suddenly find yourself using EDGE when you wanted wifi, etc- the GPS and Nokia Maps is awesome but I also use Google Maps a lot with it- firmware/software upgrade through PC Suite is a blessing- I had a 9300 (no WiFi) and an unlimited data plan, I find myself using GPRS (or EDGE or 3G) data much more often than WiFi in the E90 but in some situations, specially when you are away from your country and GPRS data is expensive, Wifi is very much welcome- the 9300 Internet browser was a joke... very slow! when I found Opera Mini for it I never looked back to the internal browser; on the E90 the internal browser is very good, and the ability to play Flash and even YouTube video is very interestingThe single complaint I have about it is that it's S60 and not S80... the larger availability of software is welcome but I miss having a menu, I miss having more qwerty keyboard shortcuts, I miss the more elaborate S80 Calendar application...Not S60/S80 related:The few keyboard shortcuts it has are totally undocumented, I can't understand why.Another complaint is the lack of a "open new window" command on the Internet browser... it does that when you click a link that instructs is to open a new window, but this command is not in the browser interface! I'd also like the Back command not to reload the page... would make it faster!Last point: don't make the mistake of buying this phone and using a limited or expensive data plan, you'll be missing a lot!
It's a business cell phone, with wifi access to the Internet - and I would rather work with this cell than my laptop.You can install Skype, Google Maps, Fax Center, and it all works with the bluetooth.It's my new secretary. It stays on the table. Bluethooth on the year. And it's all there. I'm free working. Even in any hotel, anywhere.It's just superior.(obs: it's made of titanium the piece that joins both parts together - it'll never break).U$ 700 is a bargain (in April - 2008)
just an office, all the facilities are there and it is really professional. maybe it is not so small and the processor is not a lighting.
This is my first experience with Nokia product and after 2 week of using the E90. I am a satisfied user in both main funcionalities: as phone and as personal organizator. Eventhough, more (and cheaper) additional 3rd party sofware would be great, better keyboad desing (better key fedback) and overall smaller size.The performance of the phone operating system is very stable and the build quality is top quality.GPS maps application very good, email client just good, bt/wifi good, GSM phone reception good, battery life standar (1-1.5 days cycle), outlook integration good, entretaiment (fm turner, photo, video, etc) very good, internet experience, beyond standard in such devices. Overall features integation and funcionality: very good.WM: Should learn from Nokia how to make a product that doen't needs reset every day.
This is definitely the best cell phone ever!Of course this depends on your needs; however for business men as well as for developers, it is the best phone!!!It's one of the only phones I know that has all connectivity options: Infrared, Bluetooth, WiFi (b/g) and USB (mini).It's got a very fast 332 MHz processor with built-in 3D Graphics Accelerator.Almost 80 MB free RAM for the end-user!!! (that's huge and prefect for it's OS; you can do lots of multi-tasking!)MicroSD HC! (8 GB support confirmed; probably even 16 and 32 GB will work!!!)The QWERTY keyboard is just perfect: takes very little time to get used to it and keys are big enough.Both screens are awesome! You can play games, music and movies and read and write documents without burning your eyes.It's 3.2 MP Camera is pretty decent (It's similar to Nokia N73, without Carl-Zeiss optics). It even records video at 640x480 at 30 fps!!!It's got integrated GPS (with AGPS support).I can't say there are cons; however this is what I would improve/implement in future versions:-WCDMA 850/900/1800/1900 MHz-5 MP camera with Carl-Zeiss Optics and Xenon flash (like N82).-Camera lens cover (either like N73 or N82).-Multiaxis (3 or 6-way) Accelerometer (like N82/N95).-Pencil Key (Nokia removed this extremely useful key from newer phones; I got used to it with my previous N73)-Magnetometer (Compass) like 6210 Navigator.Hope this is useful for anyone thinking of buying this phone.It's worth every single cent!!!Regards,Gonza
I bought this smart phone and sold it within 8 months, I bought it as all in one smart phone, but unfortunately I was very disappointed. Very, very slow with 2GB memory card, also it doesn't support most common Audio\Video files such as WMA, WMV, AVI, MPEG and (MP3\WAV) some sound channels and rate. Slow application loader and file explorer. The battery's life 90 minutes maximum when browsing the net with full charge.  If you are looking for a smart phone or PDA, choose the HTC.
I bought an E90 in the hopes of supplementing (actually replacing) the HTC 7501 I currently use.When I first got the phone, I was so excited until I started trying to use it. I never realized how much I use the touch screen for!I then tried to browse the Internet with the browser - definitely not as nice as Opera Mobile 8.65.The final straw was the email client ... I couldn't get it to display the HTML emails I get (which is 80+%).I decided to give up as I would never warm up to the included software - much weaker than what comes with Windows Mobile 6 (not including the fact that there are many third party Windows Mobile programs to supplement / replace any of the standard ones).So, I boxed it up and returned it to Amazon for a refund.I am going to wait until the Fall and replace my HTC 7501 with a Sony X1 phone.
This was a wonderful experience.  The Customer Service Department called me before the phone arriveed thanking me for doing business with them.  I was amazed and impressed by their courtesy.  They even included an unexpected accessory.  The phone works wonderfully - just what I wanted.  A high quality cost-effective cell phone for everyday usage.  They deliered me exactly what I wanted - and then added one of the finest examples of customer service I have ever experienced.
Great phone, I payed only $260 for it. For this kind of money you can't really get anything better. Many complain that the phone is slow, this probably happens when the phone's memory is full, my advice is put everything on the card, that way it will run better. overall great phone and lots of people admire it although it is several years old.
At the time, this was the most expensive phone I had ever purchased. I fell in love with design and color of the phone and it worked great, especially overseas.  However, the silver colored plastic on the face of the phone started peeling (from contact with skin oils, perspiration, etc.) after owning it only 6 months or so. I researched it and other people who contacted Nokia got replacement phones that did the exact same thing within a few months. I was a loyal Nokia customer for over 10 years (my first phone circa 1997 was a Nokia). Needless to say, I am no longer a Nokia customer.
I like this phone I've bought so far. It looks really cool and is easy to handle. The sound and images are beautiful.
This is the worst cell phone I have had so far.Yes, it is true the phone looks sleek and stylish, however user experience is as bad as it gets.For one, the dialing responds to the heat of your fingers and not the actual touching so you can bang on it as long as you want but it would not work unless it is a worm finger LOL (yes ladies cut your nails and take your gloves off...). Sometime it really takes a while to dial a number and you have to repeatedly touch the number until the phone recognized what you are doing ..........In addition to this, when dialing voicemail, while listening to the actual message very often the phone feels the heat from your ear and dials the nearest number (eg. 7 to delete the message before you are even done listening to it).There seems to be a recurring issue with software when the screen freezes and you need to take out the battery and turn it back on to work.Last but not least, after about 4-5 month of use the sound in my phone completely disappeared it's like it is on mute - except that it's not. Still rings but you can't have a conversation with anyone because you do not hear them and they cannot hear you.... I will try and see if I can get my money back although it might be a little too late.My advise - avoid this phone. There are other phones out there - do your research and get one that works.
First let me say I am a die hard Mac head, I was in the line for the Apple iPhone on release day, and walked home with one... I love the iphone and its amazing BUT I don't like the size of it for my needs a bit to heavy and large to keep in a jeans pocket.I bought the Prada and Happy I did perfect size, and soooo Light!The screen is bright and clear, the pictures also come out wonderful as does the video camera Mode,Not having a bit of trouble at all, if you need to enter numbers for company's, you just hit the profile button and up pops the dial pad, easy as pie!In closing, I really love the Prada phone, it was the first touchscreen, and it works well.I live in the sticks(on edge of a forest) and this phone gets much better reception then my iphone, same mobile company, same location.I get 5 bars in most locations, and so far the battery has lasted a full 2 day with still have a charge left, very happy!I also posted a picture comparing the two!
I love the functionality of this phone, and the fact that it can be used with any GSM carrier (unlike iPhone).  It's also gorgeous, much better-looking than the iPhone.  I got it as a Christmas present, and mid-January, after the battery went dead one night, it will no longer turn on.  LG USA says it is not in the US market yet, and we will have to call LG France.
That Prada phone was to hard to navigate through.  Trying to call someone from the phone book took too much to do just to get a number to call.  Next was that the phone signal was always low indoors.  It was a great outdoor phone where as I never got any dropped calls, but the second I was at work or in my apartment there goes the signal.  The touch screen was ok but not as accurate as the I-Phone.  Don't just pay for the name Prada, pay for quality.
Pros -- Great Looker, cant think of a better looking candy bar phone out there.- You cant stop playing with this beauty.- Touch screen is super sensitive, making the investment in touch screen experience worth it.- This is a good choice if you want to be different from the iphone crowd and also want to make a statement. (Iphone is too big for me, this is perfect length.)- Has a great battery Life. Easy to Navigate. Decent camera and video in bright lighting, FM radio, MP3 player, bluetooth music headset support, Micro SD card slot, 256 mb card included, speaker phone.- It is slightly slimmer and classier than the LG VU or other similar LG US models.- Most 3rd party Java program work on this without issues. (Be careful what you install though - reserch.)- If you intend to take it back to a country which supports all available bands, then it is a good choice.- Good clear voice quality (at my home where att signal is good).Bonus - The new 2008 Prada phone also looks like this one, so you can feel you are carrying something hip at a lower price.Cons -- On ATT, lack of one of the US frequency, really hits you hard. I used to get 1 bar with the sda at work (bad reception area inside building), none with the prada. No bars inside hotel room during our vacation in orlando.- If you have big hands (most men) it is difficult to grip solidly. Better to invest in that bluetooth headset. I dropped it on the road twice when someone brushed me.- Buttons not positioned for left handers like me.- Scratches easily, get that screen cover immedietly.- No wifi.- Existing software does not support flicking and sliding motions like the Iphone, you have to press buttons or use scroll bars. Note - The opera mini browser i installed did support flick scrolling vs using scroll bar, showing that the phone itself is capable.- Not enough 3rd party signed applications out there, quite a few free games though.- The landscape mode is not supported for video playback, only for pictures ???.- I have heard it does not play non MP3 music formats and also does not play back video recorded in some other devices like your camera. (have not tried myself).- Bad sync software. Does not recognize the phone easily.Tips -- Reserch ATT converage frequency in your home\work area before buying.- Install opera mini java version.My Recommendation -If you are not keen on the Prada branding or your social group is not brand savvy, go for the feature rich and more advanced LG Vu made for the US with almost similar looks (slightly thicker). There are free phone deals out there with 2 year ATT contract without the data plan requirement via deals2buy \ wirefly. The Prada phone might be cheaper now at $300,  but you still need to decide if you are getting value for money at $300.
Okay, so, i've had this phone for a little less than a week now, but this is what i know alreadyThis phone is great, not too big, not too complicatedbut its not an iphone, if your looking for something with lots of apps and what not this is not itPersonally, i like it cause all i need to do is text and call, sometimes check email, but not much elseIts true the case does scratch the phone, i read that, but used the case anyway, i just got a little scratch on the back that you can only really see in the light, but i stopped using the case to prevent further damage, no big deal, i still use it too hold other thingsThe first phone i was sent didn't work at all, i read the instructions carefully before using it, followed everything they said, and it kept freezing at the start up, which elsewhere i've seen other people have the same problemno worry though, amazon just sent me a new one and i returned mine with little hassle of my ownbtw on a side note, make sure you do read the instructions carefully because i was surprised to see that this phone needs to be charged fully before initially turning it on, unlike with any other phone ive hadif you've never used an unlocked phone before make sure you call your service provider to get things set up once you have the phone, like picture mail, internet etc.alsoi kind of like the fact that its based around t9 and not a keyboard for textingit makes it easier to do without looking and everythingi got used to using this phone really quick and really couldn't imagine carrying around something as big as the iphoneplus, its cheaper..... i think?anywaygood phone, no problems with the second one sent to me,but no different in functions really from any other phone
I bought an LG Prada phone. I just want to say that this is one of the best cell phones on the market at this time. Its design is amazing I love it.The only bad thing is that the battery is not very strong but for these reasons people invented car chargers so enjoy :)
A great phone for a gift. Super stylish for a girl and has a really easy menu to use. The only thing is that it requires some time to get used to the touch screen as it is a bit less sensitive than the other touch screen phones e.g iphone
These phone is great. It has a touch-screen, very light, great reception, and easy to use. In addition, it has bluetooth stereo sound, which most phones lack - including the iPhone. This means that you can use it as an mp3 player with a pair of bluetooth speakers wirelessly anywhere. Its camera is also great despite its low pixel count - it has great lenses. However, this is not a smart phone: you cannot download or write productive software for it - just java-based games, and sync with your computer is a bit poor if you are not very tech savvy. You can find this unlocked phone for less than $250 in the net if you search patiently.
Great cell phone. Friendly use. No problems at all. I recommend! Just the video and photo quality are not so good, but I confess it may be my fault because it is new and I don't know how to use it so well.
...i absolutely love this phone! it was a little expensive and slightly outdated, but very impressive to use. the touch screen is really nice and doesn't require much effort to use unlike some touch screens out there, and the sleek design just adds to the glamor. it's also pretty awesome to be able to say, "yeah, it says prada."on the negative side, though... the lack of 3G on this phone kind of hurts a little, and because its unlocked i'm having a hard time getting network & mms settings out of AT&T.; i've also noticed a little lag while texting, or if it's been locked for a while.. it clears itself up pretty quickly though!all in all though, it's a very nice alternative to the Vu, and a VERY good eye-catcher. i can't wait for the prada 2 to hit the market!
While I applaud the condition of the product when received, two items were incorrectly sent, the charger was particularly slow and as such I had to order another, the memory card is incorrect and cannot be used.
Great idea teaming with PRADA, but your paying for the name. It had terrible reception - returned product.
Guys i have to say if you are thinkn to get a new phone this is it its what you might want to keep in mind for option #1 i very well recomend this phone besides the awsome pictures it take and the fm am radio uhhhhits just chevere....
I was in line for the iPhone for 12 hours only to be disappointed by Steve Jobs.  It turns out, there were plenty of iPhones' for all.  I liked it, but it was bulky and I never used the data plan.  True to form, I sold it and bought a Prada phone.  I hated the Prada phone at first, I didn't understand who on earth would compare it to the iPhone.  After a few weeks I realized it wasn't meant to compete with the iPhone (or any other smartphone) and I started to become a little more satisfied with it.Well, that was a long time ago and now I'm on my second Prada phone.  I broke the first one and had to buy a second.  Anyways, it you need a phone for calling and texting this one gets the job done.  If you want email and internet, you need to look elsewhere - seriously.Also, do NOT use the case that comes with it.  It will scratch the h*ll out of the phone.
i just bought this phone and love it. it does everything you want a phone to do and more and it is touch screen if you have the money i would buy this phone
This phone is gorgeous, I love it, BUT it has some terrible connection problems. I am thinking about getting rid of it because I can't have a phone that doesn't work
pictures taken with the phone are terrible , any blackberry is much more functionable ,useful ,and ,easier to work with , at the end i must say i was very disappointed with this purchasse.
I have used this phone for about 5 months now and overall I love it.  For basic features that I need it is very well laid out.  You can do your stuff with minimal key strokes.  It is extremely user friendly.  I like the touch screen after getting used to it.  The big screen is great for showing your photos to others.  The small size and light weight make this a great solution for me.Drawbacks: Number one, the screen brightness even with power saving mode off, is poor and makes the phone very difficult to use in sunlight.  Brightness is nothing like that of the Nokia phones.  If I could improve one spec this would be it.  Number two, the very beautiful case scratches the screen badly.  Took a couple months to notice.  If you don't believe just feel the inside of the case.  Number three, the camera has a fairly substantial lag between pushing the shutter and taking the pic, probably 2 seconds.
Great flashly, functional phone with limted range of features. If you DON'T want an all-in-one (organizer,ipod w/ video,internet,e-mail) this is the phone for you. However, I quickly bucked up and upgraded to a cingular iphone (had cingular customer buy one on his account) i then unlocked for t-mobile. Don't buy an unlocked iphone, largely for finacial purposes but also you want to learn how to upgrade your own unlocked iphone. Iphone is the only phone with an operating system constantly upgrading and improving so you want to give your self that ability and save $300+ at the same time. Hope this helps...
Worst thing i have ever bought, i bought it brand new and the screen was cracked internally, It was also a total pain texting on it it wasnt sensitive at ALL! I returned it the same night and my money isnt even back in my credit card i would never reccomend buying anything from amazon. Oh and they sent me a charger for a different country other then the USA Who does that? I wish i could rate it a negative star cause it sucked big time.
I was looking at everyone's reviews and they seemed to like this phone, so I WAS SO STOKED WHEN I GOT IT! When I opened it up and used it, i found it worthless. It feels like it's made of plastic. Feels cheap and most definitely does not meet my standards. The reception is VERY bad. I use the internet on my phone and that's another thing that didn't work. It looks really nice though. It also comes with everything you need for it so that was the plus on it.
The phone was excellent!  It was sleek and responsive, the only problem was that it is an international phone.  I have never used an unlocked phone, so I was not aware that the international phones may or may not support US service providers. So, while the phone worked for basic calls and text, it does not support multimedia or internet services. Too much money for such basic services.
Our tween daughter loves her new cell phone.  The music sounds great and are very easy to load plus no software required on our computer...much more convenient than our old music phone (unlocked Motorola V3i which has  iTunes).  For a cell phone, photos are good taken outdoor or where you don't need to use the flash.  Photos with flash haven't turned out well for her ... so far they seem like too much flash ... too washed out.  The phone feels right when you are taking photos ... more like you are using a camera not a cell phone to take photo.  Video is ok but captures good sound (we didn't remember to bring our camcorder and had to use this phone to record our kids' orchestra concert and we were sitting on the balcony far away from the orchestra).
really like the phone, the camera is great and the music player is even better
I finally decided to get rid of my Verizon cell phone (LG 8300) , freed myself from their contract and went with an unlocked GSM cell phone.  I did a lot of research on phones that offered what I wanted at a reasonable price yet maintaining at least a 4 out of 5 star rating.  If you want alot of the bells and whistles, then this phone is for you.  I'm Krazy about this phone.  The ergonomics is fabulous!The glitches that I've had were:a.  having to contact AT&T; since I couldn't get on the web and send/receive pictures.  Tech. support was able to rectify the problem within 1 1/2 hours.b.  they do not offer an extended battery for unlocked GSM cell phones.  Why Motorola?  It is good to have a spare battery just in case of an emergency.You may want to also purchase the body glove case for the phone.  If you do, you'll be quite pleased.With its large memory storage, removable memory card, camera, speakerphone, call clarity, mp3 player, and more ... I'll hold onto this phone for years to come.  Way to go Motorola!
Great phone, just like the razr just faster and smaller. Very sleek looking and has a good camera. Definetly glad I picked this one!
Overall, I have been very pleased with the KRZR.  It is sleek, user friendly, holds a charge well, etc.  I have noticed, however, two problems.  First, the clarity of calls (without speaker phone) isn't as good as the RAZR.  Second, the interface is kind of confusing and some options aren't where they should logically be.  Otherwise, as long as you are comfortable with the size of the buttons, I would certainly recommend this phone!
Love the phone. It has all the features I wanted. The only down side is being able to use the email function-blocked. Should have the software as pictures do not download. Otherwise, great phone.
I've had this phone for approx. 1.5 years and have been ready for a new one for the last few months. I use it only for the basics: texting, phone calls & syncing to my Outlook calendar.  It freezes up a lot & shuts down on a fully charged battery at least once a day. I can't imagine using this for emails and the web.  There isn't a way to delete alarms,if you decide to change the time, it will go off every time you've ever programmed. I had to turn the alarm sound to silent, which means I can't use it at all anymore. It stopped reading my memory card for no reason for months and then one day recognized it again.  I have T-mobile and they've been no help, but I guess you get what you pay for.
I've used my Nokia E61i for about 1/2 a year after having a Treo for the year before that.  I use this phone for- Exchange based Email and Calendaring-- with Good Email Messaging (3rd party sw)- Web browsing- Google maps: download the application--it works great and will give you directions and show your location based on the coordinates of the cell tower you are talking to (or you can add on true GPS).- Voice callsWhat I like:- Overall quality:  This phone is one of a few models that survived Cisco's rigorous tesing for a replacement for their corporate smartphones (previously treos).  They did a lot of QA on these devices and out of the few that survived (blackjack, moto Q, Nokia e61i), this phone has the best battery life.- Battery life: wow.  Only problem is that I tend to loose my charger now.- Moving from a treo to this phone took a little adjustment (have to quit trying to tap the screen).  This phone is much more solid (treo would crash frequently), faster, and the battery lasts about 3-4x as long as the treo ever did.- Email w/ Good Mobile Messaging software is very slick.  This is what my company uses.- Dimensions: this phone is very thin and light for how wide it is, and it is much more comfortable in the pocket than a treo.- Stability.  I can run my email and calendaring client (Good), the web browser (excellent by the way), and google maps at the same time without any crashes.  More programs than that and you will probably have to close something to get enough memory.  Switching between applications is easy, just hold down the app key and then select which app you want to switch to.- WiFi roaming:  I like having wifi available when I have a weak signal.  Web browsing is very quick on wifi.What I don't like:- You can't always copy and paste text as easily as you could on the Treo.  Mostly, the web browser doesn't allow me to copy text off a web page to use in another app.  This isn't a huge deal for me, since the click-to-call still works when I'm looking up phone numbers on Google Maps.
I have worked with a few smartphones before and let me tell you the Nokia E61i is one of the best ones.  If this phone had a mini USB port and a 3.5 headphone jack (or at least support bluetooth stereo), I think this would be the best smartphone out there.  That said, those are the two major flaws of the phone.  The rest of the features are pretty much great.  Here are my points:-- Phone/Voice - The sound quality on a voicecall is good.  The external speaker is loud.  You can record your phone conversations if you like.  No complaints here.-- Voicemail - There is an issue with my voicemail.  I use T-mobile and every time I turn on the phone, the phone tells me that I have a voicemail even though I don't.  So, I have to dial my voicemail to clear the voicemail indicator.  Thus far I haven't found out whether it's the phone's or carrier's fault.-- Keyboard - It's spacious and it has 4 extra keys than the typical smartphone keypad.  Here's something fantastic.  Some of the most used characters when typing a message like the period, comma, "?", "@", and "/", you do not have to press an option key like the Alt to get these characters; you just type away.  Unlike the Blackberry you have to press Alt + M to get the period.  So, in other words you can type up a message really fast.-- Wireless - You can group Wifi access appoints with GPRS connections so when checking email the phone automatically switches between the available connections.-- Battery - Lasts a long time.  I have email set up to check every 15 minutes accessing Wifi and GPRS connections and use bluetooth in the car from/to work and I only charge the phone every 3 days.-- Screen - It's big.  It's very pleasant to browse the Internet on this phone.-- PIM - Contacts, Calendar, notes, tasks are average.-- Bluetooth - Uses Bluetooth 1.2.  There is no support for stereo headsets.-- Memory - It only has ~60MB available to install apps.  However, the phone comes with a 2GB MicroSD card.-- Media - The digital camera is average.  You can play music and videos but you need an adapter if you are going to use headsets.All in all a great phone!
great phone. does everything. internet, chatting on any IM system, office editing etc. battery life is excellent. easy to use as a thetered modem. large screen bright and easy to read. good bang for the buck
I had never had a Treo, Palm, Blackberry or any traditional "Smart Phone" but I did get addicted to the full qwerty on my Motorola a630.  That is the main reason I got this phone, but there were many other things that impressed me as well:2 megapxl cameraupload to youtube right from phoneSymbian series 60 is reputed to be the best phone user interface and I cannot disagree with that--compared to Motorola's, this is light years ahead!Super ThinOther phones I considered to buy with my existing tmobile unlimited data plan:Tmobile DashLG Prada Silver (the one with the full on-screen qwerty)LG KU990 (Viewty)Motorola QSamsung Blackjak 2Nokia N76 (the only one of the bunch without a full qwerty)I had read and talked to alot of people that had bad things to say about WindowsMobile, so that ruled out the Motorola and Samsung.  LG's homegrown user interface didnt fare as well either--I tried one out and its simply atrocious (hard-to-use, frustrating)So I took the plunge and decided to try the Nokia E61i.  I was thoroughly delighted.  Not only was the Amazon price for it amazing ($329 unlocked new), but the phone just oozes quality.  The user interface in the software is super-easy to do all normal tasks, I can turn the beeps/ringer off with the touch of one button (the power button which is a rarity, in the upper right--you press and hold to turn on/off, but press normally to change the "profile" to silent and others).  Here is my main list of Pros and ConsPROS:very thin and fits well in your pocketwide screen and wide phone aids in holding it and not flipping sideways in your pocket"Own key" lets you set up whatever you want for it--gmail works great for mine!qwerty keypad is easy to type on (partially due to widness of device)buttons have great feel and dont accidentally get pressed in my pocket (they also have a keypad lockout feature but I dont even need to use it)Nokia carrier setup wizard automatically set up my device for tmobile network--you just go to their site, tell them your phone model and phone#, and they send you an SMS with a link to the tool.  It set up all data for me--wow!power charger is compact2 megapxl camera takes great photos outdoorsvideo camera is decentruns lots of great free java apps like gmail, google maps, yahoo go!stainless steel back gives it a quality feel--also its heavy and that helps the quality feel.excellent integration with the PC and Microsoft Outlook for syncing via bluetooth (I set it so that whenever it connects to my PC (when I first come within 30 ft) it syncs contacts, calendar, and notes)WiFi 802.11 network capable and its superfast when you can get itExcellent battery life!CONS: (these are very small issues in comparison with the pros and dont bother me much, but in case you are wondering)Some apps that are made for this device have fatal flaws in them that dont allow you to get past one of the intro screens (I am talking about you CellFire)Constantly asks me which network I want to connect to when nothing really has changed (but maybe some other WiFi network becomes available, or the GPRS signal is lost).  It should just auto switch to the strongest & fastest network available the way the iPhone does.No way to turn off the notifications on the phone when you synch with MS Outlook calendar.  You can turn off the sound, but still every appt I have it will flash the screen on and off, wasting my battery.  I just dont want to be bothered on the phone, but still need them on my desktop.Camera has no flashCamera has annoying tendency to make you think you are taking a picture at that instant when its really 2 seconds in the future (eg.  Aim and press center key, it plays the noise like a camera shutter and freezes the image---picture is taken, right?  Nope.  You must then hold your arm there and keep the camera as still as possible for 2 more seconds and the frozen image on screen is replaced by the REAL picture.  very weird and annoying)Cant take rapid-fire photos (both because of the above and because after each picture you have to hit Select > New > Image and then press the center key.  Why cant it just work like a good (ie Canon) digital point n shoot camera?Browsing web pages isnt as easy as with the iPhone (then again, this isnt  a touch screen so I didnt expect this)  You can view just about any webpage on this thing but if the people who wrote the website didnt do a separate layout for mobile, you are forced to scroll all over the screen and zoom in/out.No GPS onboard(but this isnt a big deal...yet) they want you to buy a $200 bluetooth GPS device.Proprietary connections for earpiece, charger, data (no standard mini-USB like the RAZR)OVERALL A GREAT DEVICE!!!!!
I purchased this phone from Amazon recently but ended up returning it.  Although it seemed like a cool phone, it did not have some of the features I wanted.  The main problems I had with the phone were:1.  Your only options for putting a repeating event in the calendar are daily, weekly, every two weeks, monthly and yearly.  If you have an event that you do the third saturday of every month or once every 90 days, you have to enter every event by hand.2.  From what I could see, the phone would only allow for .txt documents.I figured for the amount of money I was spending, I should at least have the option of doing a .doc out of the box and being able to put in a repeat event.I ended up purchasing the Nokia E71, however, I had the same problem with the calendar.  I finally decided on one of the new Palm phones, which has all of the features I want.  If you need to have the option to put in an event in the calendar at at times other than those listed above, be prepared to enter them all by hand.
I am really impressed with this phone, its so much nicer then the Blackberry pearl. My friend just bought a Pearl and then saw my phone and returned it. It just does not compare, this phone has so many more features, and a drastically nicer screen size.
Nice phone with good features. Handset sound quality is a bit low, but overall great quality.
This phone is great.Some Pros:SmallGreat call qualityAwesome FeaturesGreat CameraSD Slot on the sideEasy to use with computerBig ScreenGreat Battery StrengthSleek DesignSome Cons:Well....it's international so support is from the UKThat would be about it.I would recommend this phone to anyone wanting a nice slim phone with a decent camera attached.
I bought this phone as a gift for my mom, she just loved it!Before giving it to her, I did some setting on it, and found it very interesting as phone!It has a great looking and the design is just perfect!I insert photos of the whole family and people that my mom knows and whose pictures I have, so that whenever any of us/them calls, she can see the picture appearing. Not that it's magic, but it's just the way the picture appear on the screen, it looks so real and cool that you want people calling you all the time.It's a very nice and cute phone that can make some one very happy. My mom is in love with the phone, and I'm so glad that I made her happy!
I bought the phone because of the 2 megapixel camera and the walkman option on it.  The functionality of the walkman is limited and clicking through the songs to get to what you want to listen to can be a pain.The camera can take good pictures but it doesn't have a flash.  Instead, it has an option to turn on a light.  So you have this annoying bright light blinding people while you try to take the picture.The keys are so close together that it's hard to dial.  I've used plenty of modern cell phones with out a problem.  This one makes me feel like I have chronic 'fat finger syndrome'.Worst about this phone is the size.  They've made it as small as possible, but for an open faced phone, it's to small to hold up against the side of my head.  I have trouble keeping the tiny speaker centered on my ear.  As a result, if I want to speak to someone for any length of time, I use a blue tooth.I always had a flip phone before this one, and it's annoying to have the open face.  If you don't lock your phone, you're apt to bump it and accidently redial someone, go onto the internet, or start playing the last track of music your were listening to.This is a quality phone and haven't had any technical problems with it, but I expect that most people would prefer to look elsewhere.  You can find these options on plenty of other cellphones.
We never use cell phones, but thought we needed one for a long road trip.  With our last phone we were always irritated that the battery seemed to be dead every time we tried to use it.  Based on reviews, we chose this phone.  Battery life is great!  And the phone really does handle abuse very well.  My husband forgot it was in his shirt pocket.  The phone went through the washer and dryer and still works as well as ever!!  I'm not sure how it would work as an everyday phone, but for those who only need it occasionally I would highly recommend.  It will be there, charged and ready when you need it.
I've been using this phone for about three weeks, now, and it truly is a nice little phone.  It's small, light, and the keypad and screen really light up...you can actually see the screen in very bright sunlight! It does everything I want a phone to do.  The graphics on the web are really very good, although accessing the web is rather slow.  The keypad IS quite small,  and this could be a problem for most men, but it's perfect for me.  The only negative is that it doesn't have speaker phone capability.  The battery life is, as the others have said, amazing! As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on.  I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on.  It's a simple matter of pushing two keys to turn on the lock or to shut it off, and sure saves a lot of battery life.
this is a good little inexpensive phone - basic, but that's what I wanted!  Just a phone for my pay as you go plan!
It is just a basic phone and is an effective phone for people who do not need a lot of features.  The size is good.
I recommend this phone.It is everthing you'd want in most advanced cells. Extremely long battery life, plays movies, songs, even games. I use a sim card in my car sterio, this phone and my workout Ipod.This is a non-mainstream phone that beats out it's contemporaries. For computer geeks, the equivalent is athalon vs. pentium. Better product without the name jacking up the price.CON: This price is higher than I paid for mine - I bought a non-warranty model for about 50 [...] cheaper. Due to the great quality, I did not expect it to be an issue. But I ran it through the washing machine . . . it still works, but took some damage.I may go with the more costly warrantee'd version because I am sure I will buy this exact same model.
I love this phone.  Recently I joined T-Mobile and received a free violet Nokia 5300 and a Nokia 2610.  I kept the 5300 and gave the 2610 to my mother thinking that it would be an easier phone to use for an older person.  The 2610 was an awful phone and my mother was unable to figure it out.  To remedy this situation, I gave the Nokia 5300 to my mother and I took the 2610.  She was able to use the 5300 with no problem.  Of course, I had really liked the 5300, so I ordered this red one for myself.  I love the fact that the phone is very easy to use - that I can listen to music or audio books on it - and it feels so comfortable in my hand.  I'd have to say that it just fits.  It's thicker than most slider phones but I personally like that.  It's small enough to fit in my hand but not so small to be difficult to see or handle.  My only difficulty with this phone is that the volume seems low; however, it is better once I move my ear around and find the right spot for listening.  I have only had this new phone for a few days so far, so I need to adjust to it and also look in the book to see if the listening volume can be raised.  With the headphones on, the music and audio books sound great.  The speaker sounds pretty good with some static.  All in all, I love this phone.  This particular phone is an international phone, so just in case I do travel outside the country, I can use it.  Maybe I'll have to save some money and do that.
When I saw this phone I just had to have it.This phone is seriously overpriced but there are some places where you can get a good deal. This type of phone only works with T-Mobile & At&T; but be careful and check with At&t; before purchasing. I have T-mobile and the phone works great. The camera on this phone is pretty good and the phone is visually stunning. This phone besides its look is pretty basic though no bells & whistles, so if thats what your looking for this is not the phone for you but if your like me and just want something to talk,text on that looks cute this is it.
This product is great. I bought it because of the price and all the features it has. It does everything other phones do but under 200 bucks. 2 MP camera, mp3, radio, video and one of the most cool features newer phones don't have: the ability to listen to your mp3 music through your bluetooth headset device. Although you have to make sure your bluetooth headset is Stereo, Mono will not play the music.It worked fine with my SIM card, once I put it in, it recognized the signal with no problems. Reception is very good as well.Design is very sleek and compact. Very lightweight and stylish. The leather case protects it very nicely.I rated 4 because of several reasons:1) I could not figure out a way to configure the phone to send multimedia MMS. If you love to send pictures or video, unless you know how to configure it, this is not a phone for you.2) The speaker function is not loud enough.3) The provided earphones are not comfortable for me. ( if you are use to wearing earbuds, then these are fine).4) Spanish is not included on the languages list. Only English and Asian languages.Overall, this is a great phone. I love its design and features. Plus, no US cell phone carrier has it, so you can be sure none of your friends has it ;-).
Yes, Actually I bought a cellphone lg ke820...But a just found some problems the two next days.. In the box says memory car included wich didnt have any.. Besides the battery doesnta last the time it should be .. I feel kind of down.. because i m not in the united states and i bought the cellphone to give it to someone who lives inthe usa.. SO the warranty becomes in 0..  I had read tha other peopla have the same problem in other websites but i though i wasnot going to happen the same with me..
Ggggrrr! I am very dissapointed as well! Wish these reviews had been on here when I bought this piece of crap!! Not only does the internet, video messaging, downloading, etc. (anything that requires you to know your company's 12 digit IP address- can't figure out for the life of me!!) NOT work, but it also gets HORRIBLE!!! reception. In fact, just while typing this review I attempted to answer a call to not be able to hear the person AT all and had to restart my phone to get a service connection! oohhh the pain of ordering through the mail! It just looked so snazzy! It is very sleak and comes with a cool carrying case that makes it appear to be a flip-phone, but MY flip-phone is half leather!! hehe I love the smell! I also love the toggle button and cool sounds it makes (click for toggle and door knock for text message-people always say, someones at the door! its funny!), it has excellent sound quality as its meant for mp3 playing. I have yet to get around to downloading songs onto it. I also quite enjoy the plug n play feature. I can take photo or video and plug right into my laptop!i love the big widescreen (great for taking pictures!) And it's camera is well above most phone cameras. That was the reason I bought it. It has worked for the reasons I bought it for. It seems to have good hardware, just no reception, and alot of confusion over where I can find the codes I need to plug in to it to use all the capabilities. I doubt my cell phone provider will know what I'm even talking about. Anyways, hope all my rambling is helpful to SOMEONE out there! It doesn't do me much good, but some enjoy it. :-D
I rate it four because my company didn't have an option to connect this to the internet. It ok though since it's going to save me money in the end and avoid me from downloading stuff onto it.  It's a little heavy but it comes with a nice case and has some fun option it it.  I definitely recommend this item even though in retrospect seems a bit overpriced but it's unique so it balances out.
I bought this phone off of Amazon this past December, and I am actually very happy with the phone. Voice quality is way better than my last phone, a Nokia 6010, and people have never complained about my voice on the other side. The mp3 player on it is amazing, and it is really easy to transfer songs onto the phone, if they're mp3. It won't play WMV files or anything else, but mp3s work well. I especially like its ability to transfer files over Bluetooth, which is very quick and easy. My only minor concern with it, which is why I gave it four stars, is that there is just a little tiny wobble on the rising part when it is in the up position. Everything else is fantastic!
This Motorola RIZR Z3 is indeed NOT as the photos depict it. The keypad includes not only the English alphabet, but also Chinese characters. I uploaded a few customer images of the phone that I received. I also received a UK-style power cord along with a US adapter. This makes no difference to me as I charge the phone by plugging it into my computer via USB. As someone that travels a lot, I thought it was nice to get the free universal power adapter.The addition of Chinese character doesn't make a difference to me. If they weren't there the English letters couldn't be any bigger anyway. I think having the keys is more of a bonus than a detractor.Regarding other reviews claiming "some menus are in Chinese and can't be changed", this only applies the Games that come loaded on the phone. In fact the phone I received was all in English from the first power-on (other than said games). The games are not a permanent part of the phone, they're just preloaded. You can easily delete them entirely from the phone, and since you can plug this phone into your computer via USB or use Bluetooth, you can load games of any other language by downloading them and then sending them to your phone.This phone replaced a SLVR L9 (also unlocked) that I had only shortly before I lost it. I use an AT&T; GoPhone plan, whose SIM cards work perfectly in these phones. While traveling abroad I lost the SLVR, but fortunately had removed the SIM card. After receiving this phone I popped in my old SIM card and things worked just like my old phone.This phone is also handy to have while traveling. It supports both EDGE and G3 networks; using Bluetooth I can tether with my MacBook Pro and use as modem anywhere I get cell phone service (make sure your plan has unlimited data though). It can also sync address books and calendars through Bluetooth. Even though the RIZR isn't officially supported by Apple's iSync program, you can use the additional iSync plugins package provided by Nova Media ([...]) and iSync will work fine.All in all, this has been a great phone. If it hadn't been for my GoPhone plan and use unlocked phones, I really would've been devastated by the loss of my SLVR. But with the intercompatibility  of unlocked phones, switching over was a breeze.I also had a great experience with HassleFreeCell, they were quite responsive and helpful when I accidentally used my physical address instead of my PO Box (USPS does not have local service where I live). I contacted them via Amazon and they immediately sent out the phone again to the PO Box, no additional charge. Thanks guys!
Haven't had a chance to really use the phone yet however it is brand new and appears to work; I did also confirm that it's unlocked by using a friend's SIM card.  However note that what I received was not a US product with a US warranty.  This was actually the International version from Hong Kong which was shipped with a big bulky charger and a US adapter.  The keys are in English and also have Chinese letters and the games that are installed are in Chinese.  I went thru the menus to make sure that they were in English and they are.  The games are really no big deal for me, I wouldn't play them anyways and the keypad still has English lettering.  I would recommened that if not listed in the description, that you email the seller first on any unlocked phone to verify if you're a getting a US product with a warranty if that's what you want. As for the phone, I can't review it too much as I haven't had time to really use it but it's definitely a good looking phone and it has 3 features I was looking for: Quadband, Bluetooth, and USB.
PROS:  As I write this review, QuickTime Pro is in the background converting episodes of The Office to MPEG-4 to watch on my new RIZR (yes, it works beautifully).  I bought a 2Gb microSD card as well so I've got plenty of storage available.  I'm THRILLED that I didn't have to sign up for another 2 years with at&t.;  I own a Mac, and SallingClicker (Google it) works flawlessly as a remote control for the computer.CONS:  One thing that frustrated me at first is that you can't assign ringtones to people in your address book if you have them stored on your SIM card - but the phone allows you to select them all and move them to your phone (took about a minute to move 250+ contacts for me).  Reception isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but I think it's better than my last phone (a free phone from at&t;).  Menus take some getting used to, but I hear all Motorola's are that way.All in all, thank you for a great new phone!
I bought this phone to use on the AT&T; network, after talking with different representatives they told me that not all the features would work on their network, well I messed around with it for about 20 minutes & got EVERY feature to work like a charm, definitely recommend this phone, it's really cool, the camera & video are really nice, no complaints at all.  Awesome phone, plain & simple
love the look and feel of this rizr phone. nice features. seems like it will hold up over time, unlike the razr phones i've had in the past. i like that it has a flash and is a 2mp camera. although the pictures are still not that great. in a nutshell, it is everything i want in a cell phone. oh yeah, the sound and reception is the best i've had.:) robert
I was in the market for a new cell phone.I came across the new motorizr.I had bought a samsung slider phone but returned it back to the store.One thing I like about this phone is it large easy to use keypad.The rubber on the outside of the phone keeps it from slipping out of your hand when you are opening and closing it.It has a powerful 2.0 megapixel camera.The pictures comes out crisp and clear.And the LED light is also just as powerful.I just love the phone.The keypad glows nicely at night.It just don't light up.You will love it.
This phone is decent looking but that's about as far as the positives go. This is by far the most expensive phone I've ever purchased and it turned out to be the least sturdy. After no more than 2 months the glue on the buttons began to wear off and the circular navigation in the middle of the phone came off. The glue spread and stuck to other parts of the phone and will not come off.The speaker phone will work about 50% of the time, other times the vibration mode won't work or if I have the ringer set to "Loud" it will still function as if on "Silent".I contacted both the company I bought the product from (not Amazon by the way) and Motorola and neither would claim responsibility and offer any form of resolution. I had to reglue the pieces back on myself (twice now) and am dealing with the in and out efficiency of the ringer and speaker.EDIT: Since all of this the phone has continued to malfunction. The camera aspect ceases to work AT ALL. And occasionally the screen will become completely pixelated and unviewable until I turn the phone on and off.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE ... there are better looking and funcitioning phones similarly priced.
The phone is not as pictured.  It is shown to be with standard english keypad, it is NOT.  The information implies the phones come from Europe or Austrailia,  but the first and replacement I received were from Hong Kong.The keypad has chinese characters and while some displays can be altered to use english,  the games and some screens would continue to display chinese.I don't read chinese so sent them both back to what for motorola shop to begin selling the rizr unlocked.
I bought this phone from Amazon - it appeared later they transfered the order to their featured seller. I knew there might be problems with US warranty, so i called Amazon bebore purchase. The cell phone department agent assured me there is definitely 1 year manufacturer's warranty - I specified the product's ASIN. When I received the phone it appeared that there is no warranty (it was produced by Motorola for Hong Kong). Amazon admitted they made a mistake, but they were only sorry - I had to ship it back to the seller myself - on my own cost. After this experience I figured out: do not trust Amazon on warranty subject - they first cheat you and then say they are sorry. And do not hope unlocked phone would have warranty in US.
Well, I received this phone for Christmas, and I wish that I hadn't wasted a gift on this.The buttons are in Chinese.  Some words are spelled with 's' rather than 'z,' I assume because they haven't changed all the way to Standard American English, as it would have had it been purchased with T-mobile.The center piece?  It fell off.  Why? I do not know.  I pulled it out of my pocket, and it flew off into the wind.  I suppose because the glue job was mediocre.The dirt around the screen is almost impossible to clean.  The other buttons are also pealing off, little by little.Maybe it's just me?  Maybe I'm unlucky with products.  Or  maybe Motorola has a habit of making poorly made phones.This will have been the third Motorola phone that I've had that some of the buttons stopped working.  This is ridiculous.
This Motorola is really cool, has easy to use software, and the slide face is just great.My only complain, since I use Apple's iSync to handle my contacts, is that this phone is not compatible, whereas all the other Motorolas I previously had were.So, look out for that one!
Well i first got the phone it was awesome and worked way better than the one i had but the phone came with a charger from like Australia with an adapter for US plugs. i was like ok sounds like it will still power my phone and thats just not that important. then i start having problems with the battery life. out of the box i plug it in and get a full charge. i grab it after it tells me its fully charged and i head off to my classes. 2.5 hours later it starts beeping at me telling me my battery was dead. i was like WTF mate? figured it was a one time thing but it got worse and worse. ok they sold me a bad battery. but then it stops recognizing my micro SD card. every time i open my phone it tells me its removed. once again WTF? so i start calling amazon to try and find a number for digicell or whoever sold me the phone so i can get the warranty and send it off but that goes on for 4 hours of back and forth. then i go to Motorola and see if they will help me... another 3 hours later of calls from India and wherever they cant seem to help me cause the numbers under the battery of my phone dont match up with them. so in the end im sending it back to amazon under their money back (which one of the reps over the phone recommended by the way...) in the end im sure it would have been a great working phone and i would have loved it. just make sure you get a working one or the hassle is not worth it.
I bought this phone for my friend, he did not have a amazon account. the man loves phones, and this one was a great buy.
I bought this phone for my daughter's birthday and she loves it. She loves the camera and the fact that she can store her own music. She can also share music among her friends.
Excelente recepcion que era lo mas importante para mi solo le doy 4 estrella por que no tenia espanol (Spanish) dentro de las opciones de lenguaje solo ingles y chino.
Wicked phone great features and something for all y'all that like to use the PTT feature... this thing gots it!!! Overall great buy.
Una vez abierta la caja nos encontramos con una versión básica de presentación: teléfono, cargador y manual. Enciendes el teléfono y te encuentras que la "gran" variedad de idiomas disponibles son inglés y dos más que por los signos podrían ser asiáticos. Es comprensible que al ser comprado en Amazon el producto sea para el mercado EE. UU., pero en realidad además del idioma inglés se esperaría por lo menos un paquete de idiomas occidentales. Los menús como el de todo teléfono, dedícale tiempo hasta que los conozcas, unos son más intuitivos otros no, como en este caso. La recepción fue más baja que la de mi viejo Siemens MC60, cosa que no esperaba para un teléfono varios años más moderno, ahora no tengo señal donde antes tenía.En cuanto a buscar un paquete de idiomas occidentales para sustituir el que traía,no quedó otra alternativa que los foros alternos ya que el servicio y soporte de Motorola es muy comercial, esto último dicho de una manera educada.En resumen, antes de comprar este modelo, primero mejor evaluar otras alternativas, que consideren no solo las prestaciones del teléfono, sino también el soporte real que da el fabricante.
I've owned my Nokia 6288 for some 6 months now.  Software is, as it can be expected from a Nokia product, more than OK.  I have almost no negative comments about the telephone functionality in general, but I simply suggest to avoid this model at all costs, since it has a manufacturing/design defect that allows dust to enter the case and stick to the inside of the screen, which makes it impossible to see anything in daylight.Nokia takes no responsibility for it, stores won't clean it under Warranty and it's impossible to take it apart, thanks to the slide mechanism, which has some springs that one wouldn't be able to put together again.This confirms that Hygiene Factors can be proven once again more important than "nice-to-have" features.
Nice phone and, thus far, seems to work quite well. The operating manual, though, was in Italian and so I had to go online to look for a manual in English.
I bought my KRZR fro HasselFree and it came faster than i expected. The phone is English with an English manual. It works perfectly and the KRZR is a great phone putting music on a 2gb memory card i got for it is as simple as dragging and dropping.
This was purchased for my husband who doesn't want anything that's difficult to operate.  He likes it.  Good clarity of sound and easy to use.
the palm treo 680 is one of the best pda smart phone i have ever used.the only problem is the battery.its a superb smart phone.i am happy to have it.
I purchased a seriously defective Motorola razorphone, and it wasreplaced with another defective phone which I will return today.This one even had the "American Warranty".  But I am still out $30return shipping fees.
This phone sucks! I trusted Amazon and I regret it! Right away, the phone battery won't last a day with very limited talking. The Bluetooth doesn't work and the phone won't send or receive any photos either! I'm in the process of TRYING to return the phone!DON'T BUY!!
I am returning this phone! It was European and would not work on my cell phone provider.
I had this phone a while back. I had to return it. Everybody I called complained about the sound of my voice. I also thought they sounded funny too. I even switched back to my old phone to confirm that it wasn't the surrounding noise, my voice, their surrounding noise. It is also plastic case and very thin. I was concerned about breaking it in my pocket. Further, I found the operation full of options and not very clear. Every time I took a picture, it would try to send it to some website online (for which there is a charge). I didn't like it and returned it a week later.
I have been their customer for a while ( I should say almost 5 years). But since then their customer service has become hopeless. Recently I purchased this phone and found out some features that are standard to Windows Mobile is missing. I have sent them several e-mails for support and yet no response. Not even a single automated mail stating that they received it and assigned a case or doing something about it. They have just gone down hill.Regarding the product, it's fairly ok with many features. But the processor is slow. I have to reboot it atleast once a day. If you have the phone , wife and gps on , most time it hangs. Some phone features that are standard to Windows Mobile will be missing because these guys reprogrammed the ROM I guess. For e.g auto answer and setting # of rings etc. Not worth the price.
On the plus side, it's a very handy replacement for a PDA and a phone. The nav software works reasonably well in the northeast even with some quirks in the programming as noted by other posters. Windows Office documents transfer quite well to desktop, and full screen (touch) keyboard is easy to use even for someone with big fingers. Camera works quite well - for a phone camera (I won't be replacing my dSLR with it any time soon!). Unit is compact and manageable and screen is *very* easy to read, even in full daylight. Battery life quite good, except if you try and use GPS, phone, etc., simultaneously.On the negative side, the biggest problem is that the phone is not very loud. I find it very hard to hear in a car with window open, unlike my Motorola phone (have not tried bluetooth headset). I also was not expecting the lack of tactile feedback from on-screen 'keys' to be so awkward. (Entering phone numbers, for example, is not possible without looking at the phone. People considering an iPhone should keep this in mind...). Finally, nav software routed me some very strange ways on occasion, insisting I take a road parallel to the one I was on.
The PTL 600 is the biggest mistake that I have ever made in consumer electronic purchases!  While the GPS locks very fast, I find the Ostia maps to be outdated and lacking in detail.  If I would have taken every turn that this unit suggested, I probably wouldn't be here to write a review.  Even though the maps are poor, they still take up most of the memory on this device.  Unless you like to carry around extra microSD cards in your pocket, be prepared to be disappointed.  Also, I've had a lot of problems trying to charge the phone with the flimsy USB/charge cable included (the AC power adapter works fine).  Finally, the customer service is the worst that I've ever seen.  I sent my phone to them on an RMA for problems with the display in March (after hours of hold music and unreturned email), and I still haven't received it back.  If you are comparing devices in this price range, you might want to take a look at the HP iPAQ Travel Companion (rx5910/5915)-  I'm going to.  If your still interested in Pharos, watch for cheap used handhelds.  Mine is still under warranty, and I hope to sell it soon (if I ever get it back!)
It's a great phone, as it supports java you can add tons of apps, the built-in memory is small but you can add a 4GB card, yes, 4GB even though the manual says it only supports 2GB i'm using a 4GB Sandisk M2 and it works fine. The camera is pretty good, one of the best on a cell phone but still no match for a real digital camera.The only thing I don't like is that you can't have 3G on AT&T; with this phone, it just doesn't have the right frequency, you only get voice and messaging.
This phone is absolutely wonderful, everything works great, I have absolutely no qualms about it..ProsGreat battery lifeBright screenFast stable operating systemlots of cutting edge featuresConsNone
The phone simply died one night, and doesn't recharge or turn on.. careful with these international phones when it comes to warranty.. Sony asks for proof of purchase that includes additional information like the IMEI # of the phone, and an invoice that includes authorized dealers contact information.. I am now stuck between Sony and Amazon trying to sort it out, and am extremely frustrated!! Phone lasted 3 months!
i wanted a camera-phone that would enable me to take decent pictures,so i don't have to carry a camera.this phone's camera is awesome!!!in fact this is probably the best phone i've ever had, and i've had about 15 different ones.i wanted to find some drawbacks to post here, so i found a couple: 1.sony-ericsson's menu- not very intuitive (actually, not the menu itself, but the key setup- no dedicated "answer/call" or "hang up" key, it's all softkeys), takes some getting-used-to  2.if you text a lot you  won't like the tiny keys. i have good dexterity(being a guitar player :) and i still find them very small
I just have to say that this phone was just what I need. Reception is good. The camera is really useful and it takes really good pictures, menus are fine to use, simply it's a really great phone
this phone is awesome it is a smart phone with all the features of a windows mobile without the problems. The camera takes amazing photos. t would recommend this phone to anybody.
I would not recommend this. Don't be fooled by some of the cool features.The phone looks cool, the music part is awesome. BUT - the phone is extremely fragile and prone to unexpectedly dying out - forever.Three weeks after the first one I owned, it did just that - completely die. busted. wouldn't turn back on.So I called ATT and had them send me a new one (for a fee of $20!). Okay, fine, maybe I had a faulty phone, right? The second one is worse. The buttons fell off and I can no longer see the top half of my screen. Trying to place a call in the daylight is a joke - can't see anything when the sun reflects off the screen.You may be thinking 'well, he's reckless with the phone.' I'm not. Never dropped it, never washed it accidentally, never gave it to a small animal. It's literally falling apart in my hands.I don't even know what to recommend, but it's not this. The Walkman part is cool, but you'll need a memory card if you want to make it like an iPod. You'll also need to pay for the internet connection to use most of the features anyway.Before I bought this phone, I read all the reviews on here. I really wanted it to be a good phone. I already had a phone, but I wanted to get something nice. Trust me, this was not worth it.
I have had the w580i for 1 year, 2 months now and I have enjoyed using the phone and most of its features.  However, during that time I have experienced several quality issues.  One of them (the ear speaker died) was probably isolated to my unit.  But I also had my keypad crack twice. The cracked keypad seems to be a common issue with this model, just search online about it.  I had to send in the phone twice for warranty repairs. Now, the left soft keys (select/back) have stopped working. Another search revealed this to also be a common flaw also.  My warranty has run out, so Sony Ericsson will not fix this.  Fortunately, there is a workaround by pushing hard on the area between the navigation keys and the LCD screen (where there is either the 'W' logo or the at&t; logo), then the keys will work.The bottom line though is that this phone has some serious quality flaws and therefore I do not recommend purchasing this model anymore. I give it 2-stars since the phone is still a very nice slider design with excellent software/interface.
I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too. This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red "jewels" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.
I bought this cell phone from an authorized retailer.  I usually do not write reviews (this is my first), but I feel like I should let people know this is not a quality product.  In the first couple of months, the keys cracked on the phone.  When I called they told me I would have to pay for the warr. service.  I was told that this was a "known issue" with the phone.  I got the new phone, and the keys are cracking AGAIN.  It does random things like turn off by itself.  This was not a referb. and I would recommend staying away from this phone.  I am stuck in my service contract until 6/2009 and will have to baby this fragile phone until then!
For music listener the phone is great, the Walkman is amazing, but the material is really bad, the keys are broken easily, bad camera, the SIM slot is hide and hardly to put-in and take off. I think there are many cell phones much better than Sony W580i.
I bought this phone and it last just like 3 months it is very fragile, I was walking and i drop it taking it out of my pants pocket and it fell to the ground, that was the last time i saw it working.So I really dont recommend this phone to anyone, even when i am sony ericsson fan...
This is my second W580i and my third and last Sony phone I will ever own.Pros-Awesome design. It really looks smooth and sophisticated. I really dislike flip phones so this was a big selling point for me.-The battery lasts forever for its size.-Has a decent camera (albeit no flash)-Comes with lots of accessories like headphones, USB cable etc. I hate when you have to go buy all the extra stuff so it was nice that it is included. The memory card is not included, however.Cons-HORRIBLE reception. I've never had such a problem with reception in any phone. Ever. It doesn't work inside pretty much any building. It doesn't work at school. It doesn't work at the mall. It will even drop calls if I walk under a pedestrian bridge. My service is the same as with my old phone which worked flawlessly. I even sent the phone back and got a new one and spent an hour on the phone with ATT trying to figure out the problem to no avail. The phone simply has a terrible antenna. Unacceptable.-The card reader uses xD which is annoying as they cost twice as much as normal SD cards.-If you bump the phone or drop it a short distance the memory card will get dislodged and you will need to take the card out and reinsert it to get it to recognize. Sometimes that doesn't even work and randomly hitting the phone gets it to work again.-Keypad is flimsy. The numbers have all worn off after only 2 months of very light use. They feel like they are going to break off at any moment. It's also very easy to press the wrong key when texting or even dialing. Texting is almost useless which is sad since it is AIM equipped.-People complain that even when I have good reception (which is rare) they can barely hear me. I usually make a conscious effort to speak louder than usual to help this.I will be discarding this phone in the dumpster soon and buying a different brand.
I love this phone, but this product discrption is missing a few more key details. This phone supports bluetooth, and has an external memory slot under the battery for microSD cards. It looks cool, a good combination of silver and chrome effects. The display is huge and it utilizes a huge number of pixels. So far I have over 500 mp3's on my phone, and can listen to them on bluetooth headphones, over the internal speaker, or use the headphones it comes with, that when connected also pick up FM radio signals. Has built in 2.0 mp camera with zoom, and flash for still pictures and even records video. I highly recommend this phone, for value, quality, features, and its great looking!
I waited over a year to get a different pre-paid phone; one with a camera feature.[I had a nokia 1600 and it was a no frills phones, but it's reception was rather good, no matter where I took it. All across the USA, on trips and such.]The C261 takes about 1-2 minutes to:1. turn ON2. come up3. "Search-for-network"4. locate network, then be ready for talking.I understand it has a browser feature that my Nokia 1600 did not, butit's painful to wait on this thing to power up and become available for talking.I tried leaving the unit on, with powersaver functions all enabled.A couple days later I went to use it and it started up; then powered down  because it had run out of power.I notice that I have a lot more areas that have weak signals, or NO SIGNALS (the same areas the Nokia 1600 found adequate signals for phone service within).A very sorry phone.
The original phone at full charge would run out of juice on "standby" in around 3 days. I replaced the battery with a newly purchased one and still the same. Don't know what part of this phone sucks the juice up like that.And you would never want to turn off the phone to conserve battery, because when you actually want to use it you would have to wait 1-2 min just for it to turn on and "search for network."Camera works decently, but there's no direct way to transfer the pictures to your computer except by email/mms.The phone is only worth getting if it is free.
It's simple and very sleek and has a lit keyboard.All and all very nice. The battery life is good. Build quality is good.Get the $139 double mins for "Life of phone" you can get the phone "Free" and 800 mins which in theory stick around for a year if you are careful. Not so bad.  I really have no complaints. If you order it online you have to sign for it which is annoying... Lucky I was at home when it got here. I don't want to make a special trip to UPS or wherever.To get the $139 deal you may have to get it from Tracfone. Maybe amazon has it? Keep in mind I DO NOT use a cell phone a lot. There may be better deals out there for you.Also the reception will be different in whatever area you are at.OK, that's pretty normal.From what I am seen read and re-read their "deal". Sometimes you don't get what you pay for. This phone is pretty much what it says it is.
I had had all the sony ericsson P series, and this have been the most ewesome phone I ever had, it's amazing all the options you can have with this gadget.
Well, I find this phone is the best gadget I've ever bought. It comprises all the functions of my old Palm TX, and my W600 cell phone in just one item, but with more power, and I don't have to carry PDA and phone anymore !!! The only thing I don't like is that the screen is smaller than the TX's, but it is pretty readable. Battery life is  more than 48 hours with sporadic internet access (via WiFi and cell connection) and with frequent BT sync'ing with my laptop. The SE Desktop Suite for SmartPhones works perfectly, pictures from the 3.2MP camera are very good when shot with good enough light conditions, I access GMail and my corporate email server from the built in messaging application, manage multimedia, images, video, and sound (the built in recorder is awesome).The phone also gets the TrackID application, where you can record a clip from a song (approx 10 secs) and then the app connects to the internet and sends the clip and you get in return the name of the song, the artist and album. Pretty nice feature.On the first weeks I had it, it was freezing like once a week, typically when using the camera at the same time as I was using the BT interface. Then I decided to take the phone to my cell phone company, and they replaced firmware. The phone has never crashed again.Buy it with your eyes closed.
First, the bad. I purchased the Nokia 6555b from AT&T; Jan 8, 2008. Three weeks later the exterior mini-display was cracked and inoperable. I had worn it on my belt while driving and my seat belt buckle put enough pressure on the mini-display to crack it. VERY disappointing. All Nokia had to do was put a thicker, more rigid plastic cover over the display and it would be fine. Instead, I have a busted phone. Except for the broken mini-display and the inability to see the clock or caller ID, the phone still works, but that mini-display is a Bad Design.A lot of people complain about the battery. At first I experienced very short battery times as well. I even bought a second battery for $15 with some other accessories. I have never needed it. I believe the battery gets better with time. At first it was displaying low battery charge. Now it goes for a couple of days no problem. I charge it each night, though, just to be safe.I bought the 6555 because it works with the Acura Hands Free Link system via Bluetooth. (Not all Bluetooth phones do.) It also works with the Ford Sync system. Both work very well. It is indeed nice to place or receive calls without having to find the phone. No clumsy earphones. No looking away to dial or press buttons. No wires at all. My wife leaves hers in her purse, I leave my in my pocket (not wearing it on my belt anymore--I might break it again.) With Sync, the Bluetooth even allows the phone to become a media player. Very cool.Using the free downloadable Nokia software, you can edit the phonebook from your laptop via the special--and hard to find--micro USB cable that costs $15. But if your laptop has Bluetooth like mine--because I bought a Microsoft Bluetooth wireless laser mouse 8000 and its Bluetooth receiver also receives other Bluetooth devices like my phone--you can connect without having to buy the micro USB cable. The cable is handy to carry though, so you can connect the phone to other computers if necessary to download pictures and video if needed. Using this software, you can also make your own ring tones. My custom ringtone is Hillary Clinton cackling/laughing.The main display has a nice large font that is visible in broad daylight. Color combinations (themes) are adjustable and some are better than others, but it's nice to have options.The phone has a speaker phone built in if desired.It's easy to switch from ring to vibrate--just hold the # key for a few seconds.If you have MS Outlook as your emailer, you can sync your calendar.The 6555 comes with a host of useful tools including: a Stopwatch with split times; a Countdown Timer to remember to take the roast out on time; a full-function Calculator; an Alarm Clock; Notes; To-Do list; and a Calendar.It has some dumb games that are mostly demo only.It has a very mediocre still camera and an even more mediocre video camera.It can text, but I don't do that.It can be configured for Push-To-Talk, at extra cost, if you must have walkie talkie capability.I was worried about the tiny charging plug, but so far it's been durable, even though it did obsolete all my previous Nokia accessories.It does need a micro-mini plug for the headphones if you want to use it as a personal music player. Mine included a short Micro-to-Standard mini adapter so you can use your regular headphones.The Settings menu allows you to reconfigure what many of the buttons will do: if you need to get to some buried menu item like the calculator often, make the Right Selector button do it. One touch and you're in business. This is a very handy feature.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone. The audio quality is fine, it rarely drops calls and is small, thin and lightweight. The only real problem is how fragile the outer display is. Nokia should have shipped it with a protector or engineered it better from the get-go.
I got this phone as a replacement for my Motorola V557 that went kaput. These are a few of the things that have not made my life easier in the 2 weeks I've had the phone:1) The battery life IS a joke, but it improved once my husband turned off the internet browser, which apparently is on full time by default.2) The quality of the sound on calls is dismal, even though I've got it up to full volume.3) Reception is not good, even in town, and it drops calls, which my V557 never did.4) It loses my address book on a regular basis, requiring a restart (sometimes more than one).5) It also tells me my smart card isn't installed (it is), which again requires restarting.6) It won't save my ringer settings, no matter how many times I push the "save" button. It seems to be stuck on vibrate only.If there had been something else available at the store we trade with (such as another V557), I would have gotten it instead of the Nokia. As it is, I'm stuck for now. If I could have given this joke of a phone less than one star, I would!
I cannot walk and talk at the same time, let alone chew gum - but it's not my fault! If the phone is in a pants pocket more than 1 foot away from the bluetooth headset, I get lots of static while moving - it sounds like paper being crinkled up. Keeping phone in shirt pocket or holding it near my ear solves the problem, but kind of defeats the purpose! If I am not moving it is OK. I found it was even affected by standing next to a running stream of water from a faucet!Why do I think this is the phone's problem? Because I have tried two Jabra Jawbone, two Plantronics Voyager 520 and one Motorola 681 and all have exhibited the problem.I had AT&T; exchange the phone for another 6555 and the problem remained, but was noticeably worse with the second phone.Nokia can only say "we only test with our own bluetooth headsets, buy one of ours".I will also confirm the abyssmal battery life, even after changing "packet data" to "on demand" instead of "always on". If I ever had to make more than 2 hours of calls between charges, I don't think I could trust it.I have never owned anything other than Nokia (since I worked for them for 5 years), but this has got me seriously looking elsewhere.
The Backlight stays on for about 6 seconds without pushing any buttons.There is no setting to make it any longer.The battery was fully charged and the phone was off that first night I had it. That morning I turned it on and the battery showed one quarter  charge, I would have thought it would have held a full charge being off all night?  The reception is no better than any other phone.I took it back the next day. That is some ridiculous backlight problem to put up with. Cingular, AT&T; must be crazy even putting it on the shelf. This phone deserves no stars.
I got this phone yesterday and I returned it today.  I did my homework before going to the store and I had narrowed my decision to 2 phones (an LG and a different model Nokia).  However, when I got to the store, I let the salesman talk me into this phone, which he said was a better quality, though at a higher price.  I took it home and immediately had problems. The vibration function did not work, no matter how much I adjusted settings, and the manual was no help.  I went online and saw that almost every review for this phone was negative.  Just this afternoon, the vibration miraculously started working, though intermittently, which confirmed to me that I had a defective phone.  I also was having problems with it powering down by itself, or suddenly lighting up--which was very annoying because I use my phone as an alarm clock so all of a sudden I would be awaken by a bright light in my room.  Perhaps mine was a lemon, however based on the other reviews I read, lemons with this model seem to happen fairly often.I also found that the way the operating system on the phone was set up was not very intuitive.  Maybe I just didn't spend enough time getting used to it (though I did spend about 4 hours on it last night trying to figure it out).  I consider myself fairly tech savvy, but I just don't understand why they make simple tasks like setting an alarm for am or pm require an additional 3 button pushes.  I also didn't need any of the "sophisticated" features, I only needed a phone that worked well as a phone, and that could text with relative simplicity.  The sound quality and signal strength were fairly good, but that was dwarfed by the other problems I was having. Based on my experience thus far, and the reviews I saw online, I took it back today and got the phone I originally was going to get. I hear Nokia is a generally a good brand, but unfortunately I am a bit scarred after this experience.
After being bated my wife(moving from a Motorola L6) purchased this phone. Cool design,menus and features.The bad-- the battery life is a joke! I had better battery life from my 80's Motorola shoe phone. Phone gets very hot with little use. The battery life display moves faster than your minutes go by. On a full charge you might get 2 hours of normal use. And you will have to like charging it all the timeI have had good luck in the past with Nokia cell phones but they should be ashamed with this junk. I wish I had read other reviews here before letting my other half purchase this.Don't walk- but run (very fast) from this. I can guarantee you will not be happy.
I am a faithful NOKIA customer, so I didn't even look at other brands in the AT&T; store.  What a big mistake!  This phone has no battery life after 5 p.m. and actually gets hot in my hand when I make a call.  SOO frustrating since we have ditched our landlines for our cells--I told the salesman I needed a solid workhorse phone for calls and texts, nothing more.  This was his best shot?
If you have to buy a nokia , buy the 6126, it has a better screen, clearer and louder sound, is smaller and has a somewhat better battery , does not drop calls. But this one has 3G, the slowest( 3.6 MB is a lie its only applicable to blacberrys and other phones , these have 356kbps theoretical , which effectively comes out to 12-15 kbps max) . The 11 days standbay is a lie, its more 11 hours . The battery dies without warning, no beeps just dies. This phone is just not worth it, there are much better phones out there , so save yourself a lot of frustration and dont buy this phone.The battery is pathetic and it drops calls , the sound is pathetic...this is the truth. The people who say otherwise are a bunch of liars who mislead people and who probably work for the big companies.

I've had this phone for about 2 months and it provides basic multimedia (pix, camera, audio), reasonable contact functions and fairly good phone quality. I don't use my phone a lot so battery life is acceptable for me. It's not as big or as solid as a Razr, but the price was right -- free with a family plan.The speakerphone could be a little louder.  The menus are ok and are somewhat customizable, and I think better than my inexpensive Motorola.  Switching silent to ring profile is easy.  It also has a flight mode which shuts down the cell phone but allows you to use the multimedia and phone book etc.I got a plastic shell and a leather case that both work fine and protect it as it is a bit fragile.I ordered it from ATT with a handsfree mono earbud which works okay, but is uncomfortable and rubber earbud cushions seem next to impossible to find.  I also have not been able to find a stereo headset with mic.  I tried the Nokia HS-47, HS-42 and HS-40 with no luck.  You can get a 3.5 to 2.5 adaptor, but you won't have a mic.I had no luck with the 3rd party SIM card reader in backing up the address book, but the I did get a data cable that worked.  You have to put it "Nokia mode" for the data cable to work right, the data and music mode don't seem to work as well.  Bluetooth worked ok on my Mac, but I didn't try the "Nokia Suite" on the mac.  I have not found a video format that will work, but takes most audio files, although some it won't play.  MP3's seem fine.  I added a 1 GB microSD card without any problems.  It has both phone memory and a memory card with is a little confusing.  I can only sometimes get the voice recognition to work.
I got this phone a couple of months ago once my old nokia died, literally.  I've owned several nokias and I always feel very familiar with the menus.  Although the battery life isn't that wonderful, I don't mind charging it daily.  I love the look of it.  It's display is amazing.  The only thing I'm not really fond of is that when you take out the micro sd card to add anything to it, if you don't have the usb cable (which i couldn't find anywhere when i bought the phone), you have to reset all the pictures and ringtones that were linked to people.  Anyway, I love this phone.
I have owned this phone for approximately 3 months and have not had the battery troubles of many of the previous reviewers.  The phone has an excellent screen with vivid colors.  The features are numerous and at first, I thought I would not use them.  However, the internet capabilities are great.  I check my email with ease and look up sports scores quickly with the touch of a button.  The phone does get hot sometimes when I connect to the internet for a lengthy amount of time, but goes away just as quickly when I disconnect.  The battery discharges rapidly with use of applications, but not when using talk time or standby time.  If I do not use the applications, I do not need to charge my phone more than once or twice a week.  The memory is awesome, as well as the camera and video features.  The keys are small and close together, but it just takes getting used to.  I can text with ease.  If you are not a high tech type of person, you may want less of a phone, but for me, this is the best phone I have owned.  Very durable as well. I have dropped it on occasion and have done no damage.  I recommend this phone very highly!!
I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, and I can tell you that is awesome, my previus phone was a cingular 8125 (QTEK 9100) which is a very nice cellphone  too but not as cute as this one, the only thing that is missing in this unit is the Wi-Fi, everything else is fine, very fast, comes with Windows Mobile 6 Pro so you won't need an update, the camera is 1.3MP which is quite good too.Pros:-. Very small & light design-. Nice surface, very clean.-. Windows Mobile 6 Professional-. Voice Command enabled-. Do everything with one hand-. Includes vehicle & wall chargerCons:-. No Wi-Fi-. Comes without a case.I'm very happy with this phone and I would definitively recommend it.
This is the best phone that I've ever owned hands down. I originally had a Moto Q and returned it after 5 days for the palm. The palm allows me to gain access to 4 email accounts as well as my microsoft Outlook account with frequent email updated daily. It has amazing storage capabilities as well, and can hold tons of media files.I also keep my weekly calendar on this phone and have it synced with the calendar I use for my outlook account.This phone is perfect for any business professional. It's a real keeper.
Well, it does the job. It is a wonderful pda. As a phone, I have to say that it has a few things left to be desired. For instance, the clarity of the phone is just not that good. I have seen cheaper phones with great clarity.By now, I would have thought that the size would have decreased. It is still a bit large.The feature that I have not figured out is the hold button. When you are on the phone and have an incoming call, you switch over. But, when you switch back to the original caller, it still keeps the second caller on hold - even if you chose to hang up. All the while, you see the minutes adding up - go figure.What I do like is all those features. When there is something that I do not understand, I simply go and chat with someone at palm.com. They will usually walk you thru whatever issue you have.Because of so many features and having the ability to hot sync, I will certainly keep the phone - it is a small price to pay.
This is a wonderful tool for the business world.  I love having the email and internet access when I am out of my office.  The only complaint I have is that all the ringtones I have tried to download are not available for this particular phone.
I never imagined a cellphone like this one lets me work, play and call :)ProsLets you do almost everything and its easy to use.ConsSize, too big.
This phone is the single worst phone I have ever used. Honestly, this phone makes me miss my old Nokia 5190 brick just because of its simplicity. The Treo is a pretty decent PDA and good for making calendars, but the sync function (especially via Bluetooth) is pretty bad, and its cell phone capabilities are even worse.The most important function of a phone - picking up calls - simply DOESN'T WORK. If you are writing a text message or trying to call someone and receive an incoming call, the whole phone freezes for about 30 seconds and just sits there. I have missed more calls in the last 8 months than the last 8 years because of this phone. It just doesn't pick up! I personally blame Windows mobile for making the whole thing sluggish and unusable. Trying to do too many things means that it doesn't do anything well.If you want an organizer, great. But if you actually want a usable phone, don't even think about buying this slow, sluggish, non-responsive piece of junk.The best function of this phone was when I smashed it on my driveway. Very satisfying.
I needed a phone I can run SSH on and I found a palm application that worked so I have been bound to the palm series of phones.  I've used this phone on both Sprint and Verizon and I cannot stress enough how underpowered and unimpressive this phone is.  There are times when you will hit the keypad and it takes several seconds for the phone to register what you pressed.  You will hear the phone ring, press the button to answer, no response, press it again, and several seconds later the phone will answer and then hang up.  If you have call waiting, this phone will double your phone charges as it provides no way to hang up on one party and continue with another.  I do not have enough time in the day to outline in detail how profoundly unhappy I am with this phone.  I regretfully have to admit that Palm is dead.  After trying a half-dozen of their phones, I have totally lost faith that they are capable or producing a phone that can even provide reliable basic service, much less be a "smart" phone.  Don't waste your money.  Let there be at least some redeeming value to my suffering in using this crappy, badly-made product so that I might save one person from having to endure what I've endured.  Seriously.  It really is that bad.
I got this thinking it had WiFi, well it doesn't. I read the specs on it and it mentioned that it is great to surf the net...just only through the phone service. It is a nice phone for the ones that are looking for a pocket PC type. I am more the Palm OS, plus I find that it is easier with most of my collegues to exchange some of the programs that we have since most of us have palm OS stuff. Which it isnt compatible with this phone. It is hard to believe that even though it is made by Palm, they didnt make it so that you could transfer from a regular Palm OS to the PC operating system. I had the treo 650 and went to this one, the 750. Well good thing I kept the old one. I am back to using that one.
I bought this phone for my girlfriend and she has been very happy with it.
The Palm Treo 750 is the worst phone I have ever owned...I had the Treo 680 which I loved and assumed the 750 would be a step up...not so.1. You cannot personalize the desktop with icons, or I haven't figured it out yet.2.  I haven't been able to figure out how to get the call log on the desktop menu.3.  There seems to be buttons with no real purpose unless you program them.4.  It doesn't sync with the old operating system, so all the information, call logs, etc are lost.5.  I see no advantage over the Palm OS...windows for mobile doesn't load any faster, pick up email any faster.6.  The OS is larger, leaving less space on the HD and is prone to freezing.I would not recommend this device to anyone who likes the Palm OS...this system, device is awkward to use, not user friendly, is hard to dial..
Phone came as advertised and before scheduled--excellent. Only complaint is the same as with my previous Treo, that it wants to rename the smart media card every so often.  This means that the programs on the card are unavailable until I reload them.  The data is not lost.  Just not available until I reload the start instructions.  The seller did a great job.
This phone is both elegant and attractive. The Windows Mobile is sublime; the screen is beautiful, and I am yet to use any phone or smartphone that has as many shortcuts, very user-friendly.The buttons are a bit stiff and its a little narrower than the blackberry but way more gorgeous. Syncing with computer is superb too.A good buy anyday.
It's a great phone. Works good and gives you stile and connectivity. It would be very difficult for me to run my bussines without it since I have to be out of the office frequently. You should buy it if you need the same.
I found the TReo to be extremely user UNfriendly and clumsy to use. I have a Blackberry curve and while it does not have windows mobile all it's other features make up for it in spades. I imagine the TReo would be good for someone who really needs mobile computing and not phone services with add on's. The machine is quite bulky physically and I just could not get used to using it.. I was the first item that I've ever returned.
This is a great phone, a lot of fancy specs and great shipping time! Thanks!
This is the best phone I've had, It is really usefull, with an excelent camera, takes videos, voice recorder, etc.  But being unlocked is a nice feature, because I travel a lot and can use it with a US service or at central america, etc.  Good screen, lots of contacts, bluetooth and, of course, easy to use.  Very recomendable cell phone.....
I have used quite a few Pre-Paid phones before and i have to say that the i855 is the best for the price.This phone doesn't play Mp3's and it can't record or playback videos but it does take pictures.The i855 isn't jam packed with all the entertainment features of the more expensive phones but what it does,it does very well.The i855 has nation wide Boost Walkie Talkie which allows you to talk to any Boost Mobile or Nextel customers for only $1.00 a day.There is a web browser that loads pages pretty quickly and lets you view most mobile web content without any problems.This phones web browser is a bit better than earlier Boost Mobile phones.It also has Multimedia messaging which means you can send & receive Picture,Text and voice messages.This phone is Java enabled which lets you play the latest 3D games and use applications like Gps navigation.The call quality is very good and the external speaker is clear and loud so you can hear it even in a noisy area.The screen is a bit larger than older Boost Mobile phones and it's very bright,clear and colorful which makes it great for playing games.It has a clamshell desighn and also has an external blue LED display that lets you see who is calling before you answer it.There is a "Smart button" on the top of the phone that lets you connect to the last person you talked to quickly which works very well with the Walkie Talkie function.You don't even need to open the phone to use the Walkie Talkie,just press the "Smart Button" and you will see the persons name on the external display,then press the PTT button and you are instantly connected.Just talk into the external mic while holding the PTT button and you don't even need to open the phone!Very nice feature.I like the i855 very much but i have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 for one reason.When i first got the phone i noticed that all the Java apps didn't work at all.Even the Java download apps didn't work which meant i couldn't even download games or other applications over the air.I had to buy a USB cable,hook the phone up to my PC and re-install the Java download app.You can find this iDEN Download Apps Utility on the Motorola Website.I must say that if you are using Windows Vista you will need to run this app in Windows XP Service Pack 2 mode to get it to recognise your i855.Otherwise you will get an error message.After fixing the Java issue i couldn't be happier with this phone.If you are looking for a well made pay as you go cell phone that doesn't cost a ton of cash,get the Boost Mobile i855.
the phone was great for me. it did everything i needed it to. my signal wasnt always the greatest, i expected that anyway being any carrier's signal was terrible where i lived. the camera surprised me, most motorola phones dont take good pictures and this one was very surprisingly good but it doesnt take video(s), really not important to me anyway.
This review is not intended to review the phone listed here specifically but is rather focusing on the service that accompanies this phone.  Since the phone and service are both necessary to make this product functional I believe it is appropriate if I write a blanket review for every Nextel phone listed on Amazon.  After all, these reviews are meant to help the consumer make an informed purchase and this review will serve in that role.I had problems with my Nextel service almost from the beginning of my 2 year contract.  I would experience repeated dropped calls in my apartment.  Since I had no landline the use of my cell in my apartment was very essential to me.  Repeated calls to Sprint/Nextel failed to resolve the problem.  They would either tell me they would look into the problem or that there was sufficient coverage in my area.I pointed out that if there was sufficient coverage for my area that I would not be experiencing dropped calls so frequently.  Apparently my logic was lost on them.  They then told me that concrete building would interfere in the signal.  I informed them that my apartment was a wood structure and actually had quite good clearance from the sky.  I also asked why the Sprint/Nextel signal was experiencing so much trouble but my work cell (Verizon) seemed to work fine.  I have since switched carriers and as of yet have not experienced one dropped call.I eventually felt compelled to buy out my contract at $200 after one year.  I sent complaints to my State Attorney General as well as the Better Business Bureau.  Sprint/Nextel responded to both of these complaints with the standard line they had given me about adequate coverage for the area.My intent on filing these complaints was to compel Sprint/Nextel to make good on their failure to live up with their end of the agreement i.e. providing coverage to my cell.  They have decided that $200 is worth more than a reputation of standing behind their service.It is my opinion that Sprint/Nextel is the worst company I have had the misfortune of doing business with in at least the past 5 years.  In fact, never has a business in my experience done so little to try to make things right with a customer.I would encourage anyone considering doing business with Sprint/Nextel to talk with people they know in their area that has used the service.  Had I done so when I was initially looking into cell phones I would have steered far away from Sprint/Nextel.  Perhaps other people have had better experiences in other areas.Sprint/Nextel you had a chance to make right.  I am guessing that if just one or two people are persuaded by my reviews then it will cost you well in excess of $200.
I cannot use it with nextel MEXICO.it has been buying it in 79.99 for 10 days and already low to 59.99I feel swindled
Ive had the phone for 2 and half years....(more than most get out of cell phones these days). I did not find that it drained the battery too quick, ive never had to replace the battery all of this time. Its durable too, i take it to work with me and I am a builder so you can imagine the abuse it takes.  I didnt give it a 5 star raiting because I want to give Moto the insentive to make their phones even better. I like basic phones without cameras this is a practical phone for economic non advanced uses. best of luck to you all.
This is a nice inexpensive phone that the church mouse would love.  The ring volume is such that if in your pocket you are unlikely to hear anyone calling you.  Yes, all volume controls are set to max.  Another problem is you must keep your battery charger near at all times.  This unit can drain a battery faster than a con man can empty your wallet.  Sorry I bought this phone?  Silly question, Here's your sign. "STUPID"
I bought this to replace the RAZR that my two year old destroyed.  I like the slider because it feels sturdier.  The only problems I've had have been technical - I can't log on to the internet, thereby prohibiting downloads - ringtones, games, etc.  Of course, this might be user error.Also, the keypad is smaller, making texting a bit slower as I become accustomed to the difference.
This phone has a great look. But I don't like the software. For example, you can't even input multiple phones numbers for the same contact person. User Interface can be confusing at first. Overall, it is a decent phone.
I bought this to replace my wife's Sony slider.  She really loved her RAZR and never warmed up to the slider.  I did a ton of research and this phone has great reviews from everyone.  I initiall ordered it from Cellular Blowout.  What a nightmare.  The order was cancelled, thank God.  I wised up and ordered through Amazon.  Fast and dependable as always.The phone came in an impressive package.  We slid in the AT&T; sim card and it worked instantly.  Not all the contacts moved over, but not a big deal.  Paired with bluetooth effortlessly.  The call quality is top notch. A lot more bells and whistles but my wife will never use them.The bottom line.  Same great RAZR.  Much better built quality.  Improved sound.  2 giant screens.  You cannot go wrong with this phone.  You get what you paid for.
Well I'll keep it short and simple.. if you check out Motorola's website for this phone, you get a pretty good idea of the kind of phone you're getting.In my case I upgraded from a V3i to this V8. I can only say it's sturdier, has a way faster menu navigation, louder sound and a sleek design.It seems to me slightly bigger than the v3 and it's just slightly smaller and thinner than the trendy iPhone. However.. when opened up it's mermerizing.I don't want to spoil your customer experience, so I'll just say... you'll love it the minute you get it, even the original box and packing will impress you.If you like flip phones... you're gonna love this baby.
The phone arrived alot quicker than I expected so that was a bonus. I love the phone itself, however it is quite hard to keep clean...gets really greasy every time you use it. The other problem was that the operator manual was not in English at all...and the disk is not very user friendly. I'm having to learn things the hard way but am happy overall with the phone.
I was very excited today when i received this in the mail. When i first opened it, it was very cool, motorola designed the box of the phone to be at top with the phone. I popped in my at&t; sim card and everything worked fine! Calling and texting works, im still trying to get my internet settings figured out. This is a very nice phone, and i suggest it to anyone that is looking to buy. This phone looks and feel like a million bucks. One thing i was diappointed in was the fact it lacked external touch sensitive controls. They only work with the music player. But when you get a text you can view and reply to it without opening the phone but you have to use the side controls. Other than that its a nice phone.
I got my phone a few days ago and didn't read the previous reviews as i should was in a rush. But here it goes you don't get the 2gb which is not indicated by amazon but 419MB exactly. this really isn't an issue for me because i have an 80GB ipod and i wouldn't use the phone as a media player in most situations just for custom rings for some of my friends. If the average song you put on is 5MB u could out about 89 songs on it which is unlikely for me. and let alone if you gonna cut the songs for playing custom address contact rings anyhow it is enough. But it has surprised me i do get a better quality signal and physically a beautiful phone. Just hope amazon are more clear on some of their labels for items you would have a less customer dis-satisfaction ratio.If you tell the customer exactly what to expect then why would they be bothered sometimes amazon is too vague.But all in all a good phone and the no warranty sucks but that can't be helped it is from aboard
Not bad overall, but expected more from a motorola razr.Not exactly user friendly. Setting is not very convient. Needed a few too many clicks to get to where you would want or what you want to do. You can change the shortcut keys on the keypad, but very limited options.No noise reduction, unless I haven't find it yet, but it doesn't seems like it's there. It will pick up every sound from the back ground: wind, other people conversation...And its headphone is the special one that you have to hook up to its USB port which I can't easily hook up to my car or any other headphone. But the USB port headphone does come with the package.
I bought this off here about a week ago, the phone was brand new no problems so far except, the battery lasts maybe 8 hours at a time ( not on the phone but maybe 30 minutes of the 8 hours, and maybe 200 texts.) the phone seems to be working good and is just about like my old us cellular razor 2. the phone did come unlocked like described, i have both an att and t mobile sim cards and they both work no problems. there is also no memory card slot as described. ive looked this phone inside out top to bottom no memory card slot. took a good while on the phone with att to get my internet and mms settings set right in able for anything that uses data to work. it came pre-programed with like 30 cell phone company software..weird! but all in all good phone and good buy. you should change your product description.thanks,Carla HerbstSt. Louis
Beware!!It does not specify if its 2gb or 512mb, I bought thinking it is 2gb and got a 512mb, though I really don't care, some people do.
this is not amazon's fault it's your fault. amazon specifically mentions that it's 512Mb model, NOT A 2GB model. this is purely a wonderful phone, love it very much. getting rid of my sony because their build quality gets worse with every model. this is my first motorola phone.
Product is good, but battery seems to run out too early. Also manual came in some eastern european language! No english manual available which wasn't mentioned in product description.
This moto v8 is verry good phone.any one want to buy this, please buy us prodecut.don,t buy internationl.beacuse you have to buy us charger.overall moto v8 is the best.m.s.yaji
We have the unlocked version from Motorola in China, so of course no US warranty, but surprise surprise no Chinese repair or support service either, yet it's built here.It worked for two weeks.It doesn't work now.Motorola cannot fix it, even for a fee.Have money to burn?  Take a chance!Otherwise save your self a lot of money by checking other GSM/GPRS phones that do most everything else but browsing for a whole lot less.
The RAZR2 V8 Dark Pearl Grey is the wireless phone I have always wanted. It's that simple. Reception is very good, battery life is good, ring is audible, and quality of voice is very good.The best thing about this phone is the removable transflash card that can be used (up to 1gb) that can be used to store songs.The looks and feel of this phone are amazing too.
Before I start my review I did not buy my RAZR2 V8 Unlocked from [...], I bought it from the Online Mototola store... So why am I writing a review here, for fun and because the reviews other people posted are not accurate...  When I got my RAZR2 V8 early this morning I was OMFG excited but then for some reason I couldn't access the V8's features because it was asking me for a SIM card and I didn't have one...  I went to the mall and asked questions about SIM cards...  When asked if they sold SIM cards at At&t; they said yes and told me that appart from paying for the SIM card I would also have to pay for the activation of the SIM card and for the minutes too...  The people at AT&T; also told me that some of the features on my V8 wouldn't work because it wasn't designed for use with AT&T; service so I definately said NO to that!! So I went to TMobile bought a SIM card from them for ten dollars for ten minutes and I was happy...  BTW, when I bought my RAZR2 V8 Unlocked I made damn sure it has 2gb memory and it does!!! After getting rid of the SIM card problem I could finally enjoy the features of the V8...  The first thing I wanted to do was download all my Favorite music from my laptop to my V8 and I love it, all my favorite music sounds CRYSTAL clear!!!!  I always wondered if you could use a song as a ringer because I heared other peoples phones ring with their favorite music and I asked questions about this but my question was never answered...  So playing around with my V8 Unlocked I found out that you can apply a song to a Ringtone and whenever I recieve a call the song I applied the ringtone plays and thats just a another thing I love about my RAZR2 V8!!!!!  The camera and the video camera are ok but I'm interested my music more... Music synced from my laptop to my V8 was fast!!  I say it took three to five seconds for each song...
word of warning i did not buy my phone over the net, am just reviewing the phone....i recently moved to france and needed a cell phone, i heard that "orange" one of 3 phone coverage companies, was the best (most coverage).looking over the choices... and not liking the idea of a slider... i chose the v9, it is sleek, stylish and big. i am a small lady but do not like a cell that is so small i feel like it will slip through my fingers or make me look silly because of how tiny it is.this phone is best suited for a guy or a lady with large hands, it is easy to grip and the buttons are large enough that you can see AND hit them with out much effort or mistakes.the amount of options are fantastic, mp3, tv, video and a camera... very cool. picture quality is very good for a cell phone and i love that i can play around with the images, tints and such.the fact that i am in france but not a native speaker, it is great that i can change the language function back to english so i know that i am not hitting something by mistake ..oppps te heeethe only thing i dont like is the screen on the outside, i am having a hard time finding a case that alows the phone to flip open and not block the screen while still protecting it... te hee..have already dropped it and crack the screen. with a warranty plan i can get a replacement but still.over all it is a fantastic phone... oooo and the ring tones are not all cheese girly. i know i am a girl but omg not all chics are pink and frilly...ugg. i love that i can use fun ring tones or upload my own music as a ring tone... when i get the chance i will be uploading "cant be cool" from the anime ghost in the shell...yes i am a dork but a happy one lol
The product this one well though I have my doubts in certain matters, this model of cellular has memory(report) of 2 gb and the one that they me sent only has 512 mb and in addition they included since(as,like) all cellular others neither the cable of information nor the headphone estereo. I get disappointed
It's not fair this review says specifically that this phone comes with 2gb of internal memory i bought it because of that and i am really dissapointed because i recieived a 450 internal memory phoneIs there anything I can do to fix my problem ?If somebody knows please tell me
I've been less than satisfied with the RAZR2.Pros:- This is undoubtedly a very, very good looking phone. It's really thin, yet very sturdy. Mine hasn't attracted any scratches or dents, which is a testament to the good construction of the actual phone.- Good voice quality on both ends. I've been told I'm a little bit quiet, but background noise is minimal.- Camera is above average in image quality. Video is fine.Cons:- VERY sluggish interface. I have to wait 2 seconds after trying to go into Messaging, and about 3 for Contacts. This is unacceptable seeing as it has a powerful CPU underneath it.- Did NOT come with preset Internet and MMS settings for AT&T.; I had to search online for both of the settings and do everything myself to get both of them working. Motorola's site did not help at all either.- The keypad is usually fine, but sometimes I find myself accidentally pressing more than one key at once owing to the fact that there's no real way to judge where one key begins and another ends when you're texting fast.- The "space" for text messaging is in the most awkward place! Instead of on the bottom-right side like on every other phone I've ever seen, it's on the bottom-left side. It's really annoying to get used to and I can't really see why they'd do that.- In all the reviews and previews I read, it talks about the cool "touchscreen" aspect of the phone. I bought this phone because I thought it would be cool to have a phone with a touchscreen. A few months in and I've still yet to see any way I can use the touchscreen! When you get a text message, I'd love to just touch the screen and see the message, but instead you have to press a button on the side. My friend's Verizon RAZR2 also lets you take pictures with the front screen as a touch screen - this version of the phone doesn't have this which is disappointing. I think you're only able to use the touchscreen if you have music on the phone, which is impossible in this case because there was no data cable that came with the phone. All together I'd just have to label the touchscreen as a gimmick.- And finally, less than a day of using the RAZR2 the cover for the charger port fell off. That's just lame, and I probably won't be able to return it now because of that.All in all I wouldn't recommend this particular phone. Go buy one for your respective service - I'm sure they'll have lots of cool features you'd be missing out from on this phone and you won't have as much of a hassle setting it up.
I originally picked this design because i enjoy the ease in which you can navigate through the Sony Ericsson models. Being able to create your own shortcut keys is a nice feature. However, if you are a big text messager, like me, then you'll likely want to look elsewhere. They keypad is incredibly small for starters. Thumb cramps take no time to develop. Also the keys themselves have an overall tendency to crack with overuse. I had my phone for maybe 5 months before at least 3 of they numbers cracked in half. A big draw back for sure.
I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too.  This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red "jewels" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.
I've had this phone for about a year now and have had no major problems.  Had to bring it to an AT&T; dealer when I first got it because the sim card was not working, but other than that it has been great.  Very few calls dropped, crisp and clear phone calls, ring can be turned down really low or can be turned up very loud, the menus are all very easy to use and the battery life is fantastic.
I purchased the motorola a1200 in hopes to have hands on access to my everyday life. So far it has done everything that i know how to do with the phone. I must be honest, the features are difficult to use. I haven't been able to use hardly any of the features cause it doesn't really give full detail of how to use them.
The phone is ok, however I was sent the spanish version I cant read the manual its in spanish.
I've had this phone for a few months and I love it.  You will probably have to know someone who knows Chinese to put the phone in English.  You'll also have to go to your service provider's store so they can set the internet and multimedia messages to the correct network.  It's a really cool phone and everything works great.  The transparent screen is freaking awesome too.
The seller send me WITHOUT ANY SOFT (flash) the phone is good but without soft is nothing...
I love this phone I have had it two months now and have the say it is the best phone i have bought so far.  The best part is the unusual ever changing themes that always has me pleasantly surprised one color during the day and by eight o'clock another one, then you have butterflies, fire flies and sometimes it is raining, it will change as the month changes it is a really nice feature.  The photo and the video are of a good quality and it is easy to pull music to the phone from the computer.Great little phone I love it.
I have owned this phone for over a year now and got to know it very well.  Let's look at its pros and cons.Pros:1.  Design is great: its stylish and sleek design allows for easy placement in pants pocket and very attractive looking while using it as a phone.2. All of is features are pretty basic, as another reviewer pointed out, but gets the job done. After all this is a phone known as an MP3/camera phone only.3.  Graphics are are awesome!  The 3 different Themes available are great in their own individual way and satisfy people's taste for expressing they own style.4.  Both the MP3 player and camera are great tools.  Music quality is outstanding, as it should be expected from sony.  The camera takes great pictures and has its own photo editing feature...great for picture messaging.5.  Battery life is very good as I use it for music playback all the time while commuting to/from work.Cons: (My main complaints)1.  Music file transfer is annoying and not that user friendly. Trying to organize my music is a pain as the program does the job for me instead of allowing me to do so.2.  The shuffling of songs is HORRIBLE!  With a 4GB card I get about 1,000 songs, which is good, but when in shuffle mode I get songs that had been already played and others go without ever being played for days!  Manual search for the one song I want takes place.  Sony def. has to work on this one!!!3.  While listening to music and a call or TXT Msg comes in, the music stops for a sec. or two and then resumes.  I think Sony has to make it so when using the MP3 player and a call/txt msg comes in the music should continue and the phone should vibrate or play a light beep to announce such event has happened or at least provide the user with the options.Hope you find this helpful.  Please note that no feedback on keypad was offered as this is phone's feature is not for txt msging, that's if you do a lot of texting and web browsing.Cheers!
If you need a phone to be handle with one hand, if your short vision it is not too good, its great because of the bright display and good size letter and numbers, and the size and weight of the phone its excellent.
It is a good phone... I mean I have this for 5 days now and I like the design and features. The camera is decent enough for casual pictures. If some people complain about the small keyboard well I don't see it as a problem as I have average hands. The volume of the speaker is better than my previous Motorola KRZR K1... I love the screen and its resolution its beautiful cant wait for transferring awesome wallpapers it. The PC interface as far as I went is pretty simple and accurate, as so is the phone's menu.Oh and when your in a call, the other person sounds very clear as compared to my previous phone...Cons: well its not a Iphone :) (there are no real cons for me)
For people who do a lot of texting, this is not the phone for you. I bought this phone from my local phone provider and after 5 months of proper use, the number keys 1 to 9 on my keypad cracked in the middle. When i went to get the keys fixed, it was termed a "company default" and that "it happens".Also the prts with chrome paint on it, the paint starts flaking slowly after about a month of use..Please think twice when buying, especially if needed for TEXTING. If not texting .. then this might be a good choice.
I've had my S500i for a couple weeks now. So far it's the best phone I've ever bought. I got a 2GB memory card to go with it. But the lighting effects are a really nice touch, since your phone can double as a very flashy and fancy mp3 player. (The earbud headphones that ship with the phone are of pretty good quality.) Some of the side light colors, like purple, orange, and pink, don't really look like they should but the others do quite well.I had read a bunch of reviews before I bought the phone saying that the keys on the keypad broke fairly easily. But that problem existed on earlier versions of the phone. That problem has since been fixed and the keypad is very nice and easy to use.My only complaint with the S500i is that you can't customize the Everchanging and Day and Night themes and choose your own colors for everything.
After going through 2 defective Motorola V3s, I decided to look at other brands.  Sony Ericsson interests me the most because of its slick design and rich functionalities.  The Everchanging theme is awesome, which changes based on day and time, and the light effect is equally amazing.  The 2MP camera is OK since it does not have auto focus, but it is good for some spontaneous moments where you wish you have a camera on you.  BTW, you definitely want to get a M2 card to store more data, I recommend 2GB or larger.I have no complaint so far other than its expensive price tag, which seems to be the norm for SE phones anyway.  Some people reported cracked keypads on earlier manufactured phones after months of usage, I hope they have address that issue.Oh yeah, it is beautiful but it is also a grease magnet so if you want to keep that shine, get some cover on it.  ;)
This phone is absolutely one of the hottest phones I have seen or bought.  A lot of people have a problem with it saying that the buttons crack within a couple of weeks, but I have not encountered that issue.  I mean I am a serious texter and hardcore gamer (have over 30 games on phone) and the buttons are just fine.  The lighting system is very unique and so is the Themes for this phone.  The music part of the phone is also great....I just don't have no complaints with this phone.  Sony doesn't disappoint at all.  GREAT JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
I bought this phone November 2007, after 14 days the keys cracked. My carrier replaced it though it was passed the 14 days return policy.  After two weeks, the keys cracked again.  I sent it to the manufacturer hoping they would fix the problem.  After one week, the keys cracked again.  Since then, I have sent it in another two times, after one week of use.  I still don't have the phone back from the manufacturer.  I called my carrier, they sent me a third phone.  I've used this particular phone for 3 weeks and so far no cracked keys, yet.
The phone is neat and lightweight for a small compact handset. What I really like is the sturdy slide that it has and the keypads. It is very fast when loading applications and the speakers play very well. The phone is fun and entertaining, you won't regret buying it.
HI.Iam very happy with this product, work fine and look good.Exelente productohasta el momento funciona muy bien.
I love Sony Ericson and this phone is the second one. It has all functions what I need plus it has own mood - every few days it change pictures
I purchased this phone based on using it first.My girlfriend has the limited edition version (Flower design, Chapstick, and such), and I found the screen's resolution was amazing.Overall:- Great Screen ( --UPDATE: Great screen, but it smudges and scratches really easily, but I can deal. It's not horribly noticeable unless your looking for it when the screen is on)- Great Sound- Nice Usability- SexyOnly Con:- Slides up kinda difficult I think, could be a bit smoother.- On my girl's phone, when you slide the phone back down you still have to hit end call, but I am pretty sure there is an option to change this, I hope. My phone has not arrived yet.Overall I give this phone a 9.5/10
I bought this phone cuz it just looked sweet, and when i got it i realized it didnt just look sweet it was a hardcore phone.  High quality and durrable!
I bought this phone for my teenage son.  He loves the phone and all his friends think he has the coolest phone.  Phone works great.  This was the first unlocked phone we've had.  It was easy to set up, just had to take SIM card out of the T-Mobile phone, pop it into the Sony Ericsson, turn the phone on and it worked with all the settings.  I'd definitely buy again.
Guys this is a good buy. I did a ton of research before purchasing an unlocked phone, and for the price this was one of the better choices. Sony has a design that works well, it's simple and intuitive. Yes the buttons crack, but they don't break.Also, I have a data plan with it, and yes the phone can stream Youtube videos (albeit slow at times). I have also managed to use my Gmail and Opera Mini apps successfully, don't miss out on this phone.
great price, great service and timely shipping, who could ask for more on top of great product quality.
this is a great phone. has some good features.  make sure you get the warranty in the us because your carrier will not help you with any issues!!!
Muy buen celular... Sin duda liviano de peso, funcional y era todo lo q esperaba. No pude probar todas las funciones, pero se perfila como un celular que me durara un tiempo.Sobre todo la funcion de "Modo Normal" o "Modo avion" donde uno puede usarlo para escuchar mp3 en caso q el iPod se quede sin bateria, es muy buena.
I have been very pleased with this cell phone. The sound quality is good and it is easy to use. The only criticism is the ease of making inadvertant phone calls when the key board is not locked.
I purchased this product from amazon about 5 months ago. It shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition. I give this phone a 4 for the features. It's great being able to upload any of my favorite songs to use as ring tones and I love that it came with both head phones, the micro SD AND the appropriate usb hook up. The camera is also amazing, After uploading the photos you can hardly tell that they were taken with a cell phone.My only gripe (and reason for giving a 4 not a 5) is the craftsman ship. Internally the phone is sturdy. It has a great speaker awesome sound quality and user friendly software. It's jut the outside that can't stand wear and tear (especially if you tend to drop things). I've dropped it twice and on the second time it fell face down and the front slide bar cracked (and partially fell off). That feature of the phone still works but the aesthetic is damaged. I had a feeling that it would happen. Protruding parts on the front of phones always end up damaged sooner or later, I wish the company had considered that.
This phone is very sleek and has very cool applications although I haven't fully explored all its features.  It's the perfect phone for someone who wants a nice phone but is not overly fussy.
This thing is a waste of money. It drops calls like crazy. I'm even lucky to get any reception on it. Within the first week, the back cover started peeling. If you want a Motorola, stick with the RAZR.
I switched over from Tracfone to Boost Mobile thinking maybe I'd get a better deal and a nicer phone, but man was I ever mistaken. I paid $40 for the i425 phone and both the phone and Boost Mobile service are terrible! The phone is extremely slow and takes forever to start up when you power it on or when you use various functions. There is a big delay between when someone sends you a text message and when you receive it, and when you finally get a message it can take over 30 seconds to download it which is ridiculous. And sometimes when you send text messages to people they won't even receive them, but you still get charged for sending them!If you'd like to use this as an emergency phone, think again. Whereas tracfone displays how many minutes you have left directly on the phone display, with Boost Mobile you must call a special service number to check your minutes, which makes it difficult and inconvenient to keep track of how many minutes you have. The phone's battery life is also extremely short and lasts only a few hours. So if you get in a situation like I was in and become stranded somewhere and need to call someone for a ride but your phone runs out of minutes or the battery goes dead, you can thank Boost Mobile.
This review is not intended to review the phone listed here specifically but is rather focusing on the service that accompanies this phone.  Since the phone and service are both necessary to make this product functional I believe it is appropriate if I write a blanket review for every Nextel phone listed on Amazon.  After all, these reviews are meant to help the consumer make an informed purchase and this review will serve in that role.I had problems with my Nextel service almost from the beginning of my 2 year contract.  I would experience repeated dropped calls in my apartment.  Since I had no landline the use of my cell in my apartment was very essential to me.  Repeated calls to Sprint/Nextel failed to resolve the problem.  They would either tell me they would look into the problem or that there was sufficient coverage in my area.I pointed out that if there was sufficient coverage for my area that I would not be experiencing dropped calls so frequently.  Apparently my logic was lost on them.  They then told me that concrete building would interfere in the signal.  I informed them that my apartment was a wood structure and actually had quite good clearance from the sky.  I also asked why the Sprint/Nextel signal was experiencing so much trouble but my work cell (Verizon) seemed to work fine.  I have since switched carriers and as of yet have not experienced one dropped call.I eventually felt compelled to buy out my contract at $200 after one year.  I sent complaints to my State Attorney General as well as the Better Business Bureau.  Sprint/Nextel responded to both of these complaints with the standard line they had given me about adequate coverage for the area.My intent on filing these complaints was to compel Sprint/Nextel to make good on their failure to live up with their end of the agreement i.e. providing coverage to my cell.  They have decided that $200 is worth more than a reputation of standing behind their service.It is my opinion that Sprint/Nextel is the worst company I have had the misfortune of doing business with in at least the past 5 years.  In fact, never has a business in my experience done so little to try to make things right with a customer.I would encourage anyone considering doing business with Sprint/Nextel to talk with people they know in their area that has used the service.  Had I done so when I was initially looking into cell phones I would have steered far away from Sprint/Nextel.  Perhaps other people have had better experiences in other areas.Sprint/Nextel you had a chance to make right.  I am guessing that if just one or two people are persuaded by my reviews then it will cost you well in excess of $200.
WOW! It had others checking it out. It really had a built in mirror and it shines all over. Very nice color. You can hook it to the computer to get connected and get your contacts, or use your sim card copy. U can bluetooth music, pictures and email. The speaker is clear when you get calls and listen to your music. Well built phone. I really like the roll action on the keys to select your opt. Now this does not have the 850 band.
This is a really great phone, no complaints the texting is AMAZINGhowever mine did break, the screen cracked so I would advise you to BUY A CASE! as I will be doing as soon as I get a new one.
This is really a great phone and one that is very easy to use if you are used to the Microsoft Windows Operating System.The nice thing about this phone is that the screen can be operated either by touch (your finger on the screen), by the included stylus (pen you use to directly touch the screen), and with both a virtual and a real keyboard. The keyboard is under the screen and it slides open form underneath it. The keyboard is quite big and very easy to type on. My keyboard was the QWERTY type. The virtual keyboard is also easy to use with either finger or stylus tapping, with the latter much easier. As comparison, the virtual keyboard on the Apple iPhone is much better and easier to use.The color screen is large and very clear. I love the opening screen (or welcome screen) where you are greeted with the time and date, your email and SMS/MMS inbox, and the number of missed calls. On the lower screen you have your Windows Live and Windows Messenger command screen. At a glance you can see whether you are online or offline, and your online friends. Below that are your appointments. So at a glance, through only the initial screen, you have all the information you need.From the initial screen you also have direct access by either finger or stylus tapping to your speed dial (favorite numbers), the weather, the launcher (where you have different settings for your phone, like tilting the screen or changing its brightness), and ringer or vibration options.Setting up my email and SMS/MMS was really easy, with most of the steps automatically done. Syncing with your windows computer is also a snap.This is really a very user-friendly phone. Among some useful features are GPS, Bluetooth, and two cameras. The GPS is really easy to set up. I have Destinator 7 on my phone, and it works great! I used the GPS in my car and in between high buildings, and I was always able to receive a signal, giving me continuous GPS coverage. The GPS antenna on this phone is really powerful!The two cameras are used for video conferencing. The image is sharp, and it is very easy to switch between video call and a normal call. You can even put the caller on hold, or switch off the camera from your side.I did have some problems with the speakerphone, but I may have resolved this problem with software update.Overall this is a great phone, and I love it! I wouldn't switch to any other phone in the near future.
First things first, as stated by the guy who gave 3 stars, this phone arrived from Amazon configured for southeast Asia and not preconfigured to work with any North American carriers.However, after a long and tedious trudge through AT&T;'s online forums, I was able to find the instructions on how to manually enter the information to get this PDA online.Since then, it's been one amazing discovery after another. I haven't used the phone yet, though just poking around, there is a lot of different options if that's your thang, but to me, the bread and butter is in taking advantage of third party programs developed for the Windows Mobile OS.For example, I was incredibly impressed with the way google maps mobile is able to locate restaurants, hotels, post offices, the dmv, and even more obscure things like an Army Surplus store I was looking for. I even had the option to get driving directions using my current GPS location as the starting point. Google maps accurately gave me directions from the shoppette parking lot on Fort Hood to a store in Killeen.A friend of mine bought an AT&T; Tilt and comparing the two, the TyTN II is noticeably heavier, but she said the difference in speed between the two is stark. She would try to start a program and had to wait whereas my TyTN was quick.A word of note, the only included IM program on this phone is MSN Messenger, but there are third-party products available.I really have no structure to this review. Other than the difficulty in getting the phone connected in the beginning, this phone has done nothing but impress me over and over again. I just felt I had to say something.
I bought the tytnii a couple months ago and found the phone suffers from some major defects including poor speaker phone,bt implementation, as well as lack of proper video drivers.  I am unsure if the speakerphone issue is related to software or hardware design; but the problem remains unresolved.  Even the cheapest cell phone i have used in past, still had a decent speaker phone.With regard to the video problem, HTC has so far indicated that it will not release video drivers that allow for the full use of the cpu. If you are thinking about buying this phone do your research before making any decision otherwise you will be disapointed as the phone is so far plagued with problems; some of which htc will not be fixing.
I own the kaiser since November 2007.  It has almost everything one could desire from a smartphone:  The speaker sounds great, even being so small and  against a surface.  The cameras work fine. The GPS is awsome, can detect the satellites in seconds.  With the Garmin Mobile XT, it is unbelievable great.  The buttons are well distributed, you have a scroll wheel, very useful.  Even though the lack of the drivers to better performance, I use Core player TCPM, and can see movies perfectly, without any delay.  I use the kaiser for work and joy, and it is amazing.  Recommend it 100%.  See reviews all over the internet and decide for yourself.Danny K. Buenos Aires, Argentina
After a palm, two IPAQ's and a Dell x51v, I can properly judge a Pda, and this one is the best I have ever had in my hands. With the plus of a mobile phone included.I've installed all the programs I'm used to in my PDAs and it runs smoothly. The keyboard is so comfortable that I stopped taking the laptop to many of my meetings, I can manage with the HTC. Moreover, when I do take the laptop, and I don't have a wifi connection I use the HTC as a modem. Just great!!I highly recommend this product, it is money well invested !!!
Few words about HTC P4550 TYTN II PDA.I love it. Very fast, powerfull processor with tons of features.One thig that bothers me is that some of the carachters in the keyboard are in Korean as well some of the aplications that came with it. But that's easy to solve when you go to the internet and download from HTC website.Little bit expensive but worse of buying.Baggio
This is a great phone that's packed with features. I bought mine unlocked and I've been using it for about a month now with T-Mobile as my carrier. I simply moved the SIM from my old phone to the HTC and it worked beautifully. I particularly like that the phone has an internal GPS receiver which is very handy since with it you don't have to carry a GPS unit with you when you travel, you can just use the phone. The phone has excellent voice quality and works really well in fringe areas where other phones (like my Motorola) don't work well. The built in keyboard works nicely, even for someone like me who has pretty large hands. One negative is that the phone's video display is a little slow, so I wouldn't buy it if you want to watch videos, but overall it's an excellent phone!
I purchased this PDA based on rave reviews from other users but I've been sadly disappointed by its performance so far. To start with, the phone came with a sound defect so I couldn't set the ringer or use any of the sound functions. Then it constantly 'hangs' while using the email and Office functions making it quite frustrating to use. Its screen display is also not very inviting to use. I think I'm ready to go back to the Palm Treo.
I bought this HTC TYTN II in October. Had it shipped to Brazil, and once it got here there eas no sound coming out from the speaker phone or the ear phone. I took it to HTC here in Brazil and they changed the main board as it was with a problem. The repais cost me US$ 220.00! Now it's working fine.
Update (oct. 2011): Well, I have been working with this cell phone for 3 years !!!!. YES!  HTC: Congratulations.  This cell phone has passed the proof of time under really really tough conditions.  I have traveled around the country, it has been in airplanes, boats, cars, motorcycles ... I have dropped it at least 20 times; YES, it also has passed through splash (water, black coffe) tests ...... HTC ... Congratulations !!!  BUT ...  cell phones have become smaller, lighter, more interactive, and now I am Mac user and I am migrating to Apple, Yes Mr Steve Jobs (RIP) you were a genious.So, if you are thinking buying an HTC don't doubt it, this are guarantee of passing the toughtest tests.I Bought it in june 28th, so I have test it 4 months. I live outside U.S. (Colombia). This is now my #1 cel phone, but I also carry another one (Nokia 2630) as second cel phone.Great things:1. Signal: Superb, I have had many cel phones before, including Nokia which I thing it has a great signal, but HTC TYTN II has much better signal. This one sustains signal in elevators while my nokia can't.2. Works great as PDA, so I don't miss anymore my Palm Tungsten E2. Change from Palm OS to Windows Mobile was a little traumatic but it didn't take me long. It has been a little work to recover all my information but not impossible.3. Screen: Touch screen works really well. Tilting (40 degrees) screen is nice and comfortable to work with when you are writting over the table.4. Sliding QWERTY keyboard is the main reason to buy it for us who don't like front keyboards, this makes the phone a little bulky but is great.5. Plenty of buttons: Has plenty of buttons that make it easy to operate.  The 360 degree 3 way jog wheel paired with oK button (left side) is fantastic, great option to operate the phone while you are driving.6. Setting e-mail/sms accounts was really easy and fast.7. Bluetooth pairing with mobile headset Plantronics VOYAGER520 PLANTRONICS VOYAGER 520 BLUETOOTH HEADSET is absolutely great.Good things:1. Processor: 400 Mhz, works oK, it is not super-fast but certainly it is not slow.  Phone turns on fast (less than 1 minute to operate).2. Platform: Windows mobile 6 is good. Until date I have had to re-start the phone 3 or 4 times due to system fail (unable to detect end call), besides this it has worked well.3. Camera 3 mega-pixels:  Has good definition, works precisely.4. HTC Home screen is nice, very interactive. Weather update is unaccurate for me (I live in Bogotá but weather seems like Cartagena), but that is resource problem [...]Not so Good:1. Camera: Does not has flash, so don't expect to get good insides pictures.2. Battery: Weak point, don't expect your battery to last more than 24 hours, and much less if you use it heavily. Requires car charger, charge through USB.3. Speaker: It is not so loud.4. Stylus: a little bit small in comparison with stylus of palm tungsten, but it is oK. (Recommendation: I have over my table my old stylus, so I use it frequently instead).5. I bought a SanDisc 8GB memory and it works oK (phone comes with 1 GB)I have not problems with delivery, in the box I found:1. User manual in english. You can also find manuals in many languages at the HTC web page, which I think is really good.2. AC adapter: ok.3. USB Sync Cable: Very important!!!!, because not only synchronizes data BUT also let you charge the battery during day.4. Pouch: Fits perfect, it is nice. It is not leather material. It only has a slip-over belt clip on the rear, so if you are planning to secure your device (metro, bus, etc) I would advice you to buy a leather case with belt loop slot (I bought: Horizontal Leather Case with Belt Clip/Loop for the HTC TyTN II.
The product seems to be very capable and I am still learing what the phone can do.However, if you are not comfortable managing and troubleshooting devices, this is likely not the phone for you.  According to what I can find on the web, it has memory management issues.  It does just lock-up periodically where you have to maintain it like most Windows devices (reboot).  Sometimes this has required removing the battery.Also, the phone does not come with a complete set of software.  You get to roam the web to find other software (some free, some not) to make the phone truly capable.  Language support for Windows Mobile leaves a bit to be desired.  In other words, you are downloading 3rd party software to get it to handle non-standard languages (e.g. Asian languages).
This product is very good. However nowhere in the purchase steps you are told that you will receive all your manuals and CDs in Chinese. That`s true Chinese!!! I`ve already tried to cantact Amazon by e-mail in order to obtain the manuals and CDs in English, but unfortunately I was not even answered. Fortunatley HTC Brazil phone support was very good and told me how to fix things. I'm using it w/ Claro 3G data service in Rio de Janeiro and it works fine.
I would not recommend this phone to anyone. In an attempt to compete with the release of the iPhone, HTC (the maker of this phone) rushed this thing out the door without including proper hardware drivers. The result is poor touchscreen performance, poor refresh rates and video playback, sluggish UI, and excessive battery drainage. HTC has mentioned that while they advertised the hardware as part of their selling point, it is up to the consumer to discover whether or not the stated hardware will actually be used. It has no plans to include drivers in the future, but will do so in new models to come out that it will be happy to sell you. Buyer beware! This phone literally performs worse than its predecessor the 8525. [...]
I bought this product to be used in Venezuela (Digitel line). So far it has worked flawlessly. I have not use all of its functions (GPS for example) what I have been able to use WiFI and GPRS....So far so good.
Great PDA but unfortuatly ships with UK plug & converter  - works but cumbersome
I work for at&t; and we sell this phone, great features and awesome camera 3.0mp. This phone is better than the Iphone if you are a PC user. If you own a Mac then I would recommend the Iphone. However At&t; will not support customer care for any unlocked phones so buy at your own risk.
The phone arrived with manual in chines language, useless for me (although you must have such manual in order to operate such smartphone).In addition, The hardware keypad also had chines letters on it(beside english letters) which left no room for Hebrew letters I have intended to add.
I dón't write product reviews normally, however this phone is so acomplished, so I felt inclined to share my experience for those who are looking for a well balance smartphone with very good size without communications compromises. I have been using this phone since January this year. The best fetures are: Size and weight are just perfect when you are travelling while really working at the same time, it is wifi enabled so you can avoid expensive packed data fees while still check your email on the go at airports and cafes with wifi free spots, if you are in a hurry to check internet data you still can use 3g / 3.5g data connections, it is a blazing fast smartphone with true multitasking, coming from many years using palm os I became acustomed to not have multitasking at all, but let me tell you that symbian is a great mobile OS far better than the venerable palm OS, almost any application you might need is available at affordable prices or even for free, the interface is also very intuitive and very easy to understand. While it is a very good communicator, it is not a phone for all, because its multimedia capabilities are in the medium to low level, the camera is just for occasional pictures that do not require neither a flash nor a good focus and the included speaker is not stereo so you need a good headset with stereo output to listen to your tunes, radio has not RDS, these are the characteristics I like to improve, however probably that requires a larger and heavier body I would not like. If you need to synchronize your mobile with your desktop just named your preferred pim application: Outlook, Lotus Notes, Lotus Organizer all could be set up to be in sync with the E51, you could even sync with your corporate services under Microsoft Internet Server. Also if you like the blackberry the E51 could run the Nokia Blackberry Connect application, even when the Nokia site has not included this model as certified for the application, it could run it without issues. What else you could desire in a phone the same size of a regular not smart one at this price level. Bottom line the slimmest S60 smartphone available with wifi and full gsm and data connections set.
I have owned this phone for about a month now and I am very happy with the phone overall with some minor draw backs. I use this in Manhattan area with AT&T.;Pros:1. very good reception. Full bar inside some subway stations (including Times Square on the 1,9 line, 2 stories below ground)2. good battery life. batteries go up to 4 days without charging with ~30 min talk/day +some texting and web browsing.3. W Lan connection a breeze.4. works well with ATT internet by media net, relatively fast and reliable connection. (can't comment on 3G, haven't used it)5. Screen seems scratch resistant. probably has a glass cover. put the phone in my pocket with keys several times. not a scratch so far.cons:1. media player less than adequate2. no asian language support (apparently you have to go to nokia service center to get the hardware flashed in order to add extra language support)3. SD card gets stuck in the slot frequently, had to remove it using an pocket knife (ouch my new phone). may be an isolated case.
I was looking for a good cell phone, PDA(calendar, notes, voice memo), music player, communication(wi-fi, bluetooth, web, modem, sync), and the priority is in that exact order. For that and this price point, this phone is great, 5-star.I got this phone in May, and I put in a Sandisk 4Gb microSDHC card that's good for now. I saw report that it'd take a 16Gb if I need that later.Pros:-Good size, quality built, very well designed, good battery life.-Very good phone. Call quality very good with the factory headset. Slightly worse with a Plantronic 815 bluetooth headset (still good).-Good function in calendar, meeting, reminder, alarm etc. I also recorded hour long voice memo in meeting no problem.-Music player is good both function and sound. Radio is a bonus plus. On full charge, I played music 10 hours straight with headset. Speaker good for both phone and music (won't compare it to full size boom box).-Bluetooth, wifi, sync, web all function properly.-Control keys are very good. A lot of customization can be done. When set up properly, very convient.-Predictive texting is very good. I don't write full length email with it so it's just right for me. Good for any basic use.-Lots of additional features are just welcome bonus for me. (camera, video, gps, voice command, games, application download, music ringtone, VOIP etc etc)Cons:-Small screen. 2.2 or 2.4 inch and larger letters would be better. (I think the length of it is just right and can be a little bit wider)-If it comes with the new WH-700 stereo headset instead that'd be cool.-camera is so so.This phone is really good for what it is. If I want more texting or web/media viewing comfort, I'd probably go with the nokia E90 or HTC Touch Pro or Advantage x7500. And if I want to really use it as a computer I would consider the Azus Eee ultra portable... as of today that is. With the upcoming models, we'd keep changing the way we use these devices.Hope it helps. When I research products, I found it very helpful from some of the reviews. This's a great feature on the web and I hope that I'm doing my part contributing to it.cheers.By the way, I use t-mobile. And as others reviewed, it looks cool and the operating system is stable and fast.
First of all, Symbian OS is very stable and user friendly. Phone is super fast, and after installing 100s of applications it is still fast. Phone is great for both your business and for your entertainment. Its Exchange email support is great, and you can also use your phone with blackberry servers. Office support, PDF reader, ZIP support, and blue tooth printer support is just what you need for your business. Phone comes with Flash player, RealPlayer and Music player. You can even watch your favorite youtube videos.This phone doesn't have full keyboard nor GPS receiver. If you need full keyboard you should go with e61, or e62. If you need GPS so desperately then E series is not for you. You should consider buying N series phone. I hate people who rates this phone 1 just because they say phone doesn't have qwerty keyboard. it is in the specs, this phone has no qwerty keyboard nor gps.This phone is not supported by AT&T.; In my case 3G is not working. I know there are some people who can use their e51 with AT&T; 3G but it is very spotty and most of the times you only get edge. me on the other hand never seen my phone working with 3G.
The Nokia E-51 phone is a good business tool for those who need a compact, non-gizmo phone.  It makes calls just fine.  It has buttons you can map to common uses.  It accesses WiFi just fine (but the screen is small, a warning to those of mature eyesight). It goes to Europe just fine, with a second SIM and contract (avoid Virgin; Orange is better in the UK). There are plenty of applications, free or cheap, that use S60 platform. The battery life is neither better nor worse than other phones I've had.The E-51 does not play games or take high-resolution pictures, but if you need to photograph something urgently (such as a car accident), it can.  And then it'll download the pics to your laptop without paying again for phone data transmission.  It may well play music, but I've never tried. Nor does the E-51 have a QWERTY keyboard, but you should have figured that out from the specs, right?It's sleek and compact.  I use T-Mobile for a cheap plan and have no problems in Chicago and the East Coast.  All in all, a good phone for practical uses.
Pros: easy to use, good call quality (T-Mobile), great applications like Fring to allow the phone to use Skype over the WLAN.Cons: the power button is really annoying, it is difficult to turn the phone on and off.
Exellent phone. Light, funcitonal, fast, great design...one MAJOR flaw. You cannot advertise your device in America as a 3g phone if it does not support American 3g spectrum. This is NOT a 3g device if you want to use it in the states!!
I've tested my new Nokia E51 for 1 month and It's really good. The screen size it's good enough to dive into simple web pages. I use the nokia mail application with success via Wi-Fi without problems.The volumen buttons are a bit hard, but this is not a problem.I'm realy happy with my E51
Count on my words, forget the CAMERA, except that there's absolutely no way u can find a fault with this gem. Stainless steel body: even hard drops dont leave a smudge.. Extra fast processor: menu and applications are super-quick. Great sound clarity, lightweight and slim design, truly a great performer. S60 3rd ed platform: supports every application on the market, Amazing range of connectivity options: HSPDA, EDGE, Wifi, Infrared, all TOP class and HIGH speed. Phone memory is 135 MB!, 46 MB RAM, ~356 Mhz processor, upto 4 GB expandable..... the list is endless, great ergonomics and looks... ONE OF THE BEST MOBILES NOKIA'S EVER MADE.So customize it the way you like, YES you can upload whatever you wish: music, pictures, maps, calculators, word, excell, pdf...BUT dont get me wrong it has its FLAWS. Enjoy
I had this phone for a couple of weeks before returning. It was great while I used it, but the screen was smaller than I expected and to be truthful it was a little more of a phone than I needed. I got it for the Wi-Fi and used it a few times. But, I was not aware of the higher internet access cost of using a phone like this. If I was willing to pay for the higher PDA type account I might have kept the phone.
The list price is NOT [...].  If you head over to Nokia[...], you'll see that the list price is actually [...], so you're not really saving much.  Other than that, this is a great all around phone, especially if you've got a standard VoIP line (Broadvoice, TeleSIP, etc...NOT Vonage).  My son bought this and won't stop raving about it.  The fire and ambulance stations where he works have WLAN, so he saves cell minutes by using his unlimited VoIP minutes from his phone to make calls.  If this phone were compatible with Sprint, I'd get it for myself.
i have gone through this phone from a to z . it does what its supposed to and the reception is also very good, i replace nokia N75 with this and both on ATT network. for some reason with this phone i get better signal at every location. love the WIFI feature not to mention VOIP, loaded Fring software on it, which lets me talk to anyone who has the same software on thier phone with a wifi connection for free no matter where in the world they might be,  the battery had good life unless i have the bluetooth and wifi tuned on, they both are gas guzzlers, some fonts are too small where they could have been larger, . i will get the same phone in a couple of years if they still make them.
It was gifted to me by my husband. A sleek and functional equipment. I needed something light weight and slim that would fit my clutch bag that I use at work. Even though I have to say that it has too many features for a technology naive person like me, it is highly recommeded for people who are more hands on with cell phones and want multiple features in their cell phones. I do love it still.
I love this phone! It is not too small or too big. It has several office applications that I like, I sent my work schedule to it. I also really like how the profiles can be set so they only allow certain users to get through.  I won't have to get a new phone for a long time now.
Phone works well (I use AT&T;) and has a great feel. It's very well made, the only comment is that the keys are a bit small but OK given the small size of the phone itself.
The E51 is a great business phone with seamless PC integration to MS Office and Lotus Notes. This 3G smartphone includes the ability to place VoiP calls over WLAN which means you should never be out of touch. The E51 packs a lot of capabilities into a small candy-bar form factor topped off with a clear display, precise key pad and great battery life.
The phone is fine. But the problem i notice is the battery. it drains very fast. it does not hold for more than a day even for a vey normal useage. It is very unlike of a nokia battery. I have been using nokia phones for almost 10 years. Used most of the nokia models. but this is the one i am not satisfied with the battery.Browing is not very comfortable, I think it should be accommodated considering the size.If some one likes to use a nokia phone then they will definetly like this phone except for the battery.
As soon as I unpack the box, I was very impressed with how the phone felt in my hand.  Top notch quality, stainless steel, perfect size with WiFi, bluetooth, IrDa.Size: I remember my old Nokia 8890.  I thought I would like to have a similar sized but with newer technology in it.  The E51 fits my ideal phone.Interface: very user friendly!  I can easily find the menu that I needed.Battery life: mediocre, it only lasts a day an a half and thats not even using the phone as much.  90% of the time, I use it for text messaging.Just a few days later, it started to freeze.  I had to restart everytime.  I might send this back to have it looked at, or not.Cool: The text to speech is nice.  It rings and then says the name of the caller. (must be in your contacts)
So far I really like this phone.  The simple shape and size are perfect and the buttons are large enough to dial a number easily.  I bought this unlocked phone to use in Europe and New Zealand.  As of today I have not been overseas so I can't recommend it for that use.  I did buy an ATT SIM card in an ATT store and put it in the camera. ATT and T-mobile are the only carriers I am aware of that use GSM, which is the universal (everywhere but the USA) cellphone technology.  So far it has worked good in the USA.  I was also able to take my long standing ATT phone number SIM card, that I've have for several years and use it in this Nokia E51 phone.  I tried my Tracfone SIM card but it would not accept the Tracfone SIM.  I don't know if Tracfone uses GSM.  I plan on purchasing a SIM card for the country I visiting IF I plan on making lots of calls, locally.  For the occasional call back to home I will turn on International roaming with ATT and anyone can reach me on my regular USA phone number.  Problem is the cost is about $2.00 per minute.  OK if you can't be bothered with an overseas phone number and only need to talk to home a couple times, briefly.  I want the ease of being able to be reached from my regular cell phone number and be able to switch the SIM card to use the phone locally but cheaply.  I also like the built in MP3 Player, FM radio and bluetooth of the Nokia. I only gave 4 stars for now since I have not proven its ability to works overseas.  If you just want an unlocked phone and GoPhone prices from ATT this is better than any of the locked phones ATT offers with their GoPhone plans.
I bought this Nokia thinking it has a great feature set and I will admit that on paper it does, however when you get to using it that the problems start.Screen... I have a Blackberry for work and had a SonyEricsson for personal use; they have been banging around in my pockets along with my keys for close to a year now without a single problem or scratch.  After half a day in that same pocket with the blackberry and keys the Nokia's screen is already scratched.  This of course means they skimped another $1 on the coating for the screen and we all know the result.Features...I chose this phone because I thought I'd be able to use it with Skype anywhere I had a wifi connection and sometimes I can, but for the most part the reception is shaky at best when and only when it connects correctly and doesn't kick me off the network.  I also had my SE connected to my car (Audi A4) via Bluetooth with a great function that let me read my phonebook from my car nav screen.  The Nokia can't do it!! This really upset me so I did some research and discovered that Nokia did not include the complete Bluetooth stack in the phone and will not update this in the future.  One would think that adding another small bit of software to create a better product would be a good investment, but apparently Nokia thinks differently.Battery Life...The battery lasts for ages and I will admit they did a great job with it.  There is one thing about charging the phone that I do have a gripe with.  This phone cannot be charged via USB.  It has the connector for mini USB, but its only for data, a separate plug is needed to charge the phone.  This of course means carrying around more cables. yay.Camera...The SE w810i I had also had a 2megapixel camera, but it had things like Macro and Autofocus so even though this phone has a 2 megapixel camera good luck using it without any kind of options or functions.  I tried taking a picture of text as I often did with the SE to save some time and the hassle of pen and paper, now I can't even do that because this phone can't focus.Reception...The reception is great BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT 3G!!!!!!!  Yes it is 3G in EUROPE, but ATT uses the 1900 UMTS frequency in the USA for 3G so it will not work with 3G in the USA.  Goodbye blazing fast speeds when there is no WIFI.I had a Nokia a Long time ago and though it might be time to give it another try, but I think I'll wait another 5 years to try them again.
* You can set the keypad to automatically lock after some period of time, but it wont automatically lock unless you are at the HOME screen.* Can not get WLAN to work. Tried multiple Wifis, at home and free public ones. Simply does not work.* Bluetooth doesnt work. I have a brand new Plantronics earpiece, and I wasted an hour trying to get this phone to use it. No dice.* The soft key on the upper right can only be used to access the camera; something I rarely (never) use. Moreover this soft key cannot be remapped to something more useful, like your SMS inbox.* LCD screen is not firmly bonded to the inside of the trim bezel, so pressing the soft keys causes the screen to displace inward, making creaking sounds; This gives rise the phones cheap construction.* For the money I spent, worst phone I've ever had. I had it for two days, then returned it.
This phone is just great. You can use to make international call using VOIP, and you can read MS Word and Excel Attachements. The most important is the warranty.
I bought the nokia E65 2 weeks ago and so far I'm very satisfied with this cellphone and very happy that we purchased it. It has pretty much of everything i wanted in a cellphone.  I'm still getting used to it though, but everyday this phone surprises me as I'm learning and working on its features and stuffs.Recommend this phone????  Well, i would definitely encourage everybody to try this phone. THIS IS A ONE COOL GADGET!!!
I traded in my Nokia E62 for the N65, and sold that for the smaller form-factor of the E51. This phone has outstanding reception, routinely pulling in a full bar or more than my previous phones.The updated Symbian S60 3rd Edition with the recent service pack has eliminated the lag time between button pushes and screen response. Now you just press the key and the screen responds like a blazing desktop PC (or Mac for you fanboys).The screen is sparkling clear. The buttons have just the right feedback and are perfectly spaced. Since email and texting are secondary to me, they work just as well as in my previous phones.This puppy shines as a PHONE, and doubles as an FM radio/mp3 player.Perfect weight. Great graphics. Excellent tactile feel. This is the best phone yet, regardless of manufacturer.
Just got one for my wife, so far I love this phone, the screen is crisp, bright, and a good size  for a phone (look elsewhere if you want a pda obviously).The software runs fast/flawlessly.Note: that to run apple isync a plugin is needed from the nokia website.The phone looks great (in black) and feels solid.  It's a great grown up phone that's very intuitive.  I love the conversions application, which has alot of basic science conversions (joules-hp-watts,atm-hg-pascals,knots-km/h-mph, etc)Reception, so far so good.  I'll update if that changes!FM,IR,WiFi (really easy to get on a network), I'm pleased with the camera too.Overall, It's very "swiss-army-knife" like.I'd buy another one for myself, but I want something with a bigger screen for pda's.
I've had this phone for about a month now and it's pretty awesome.  I've dropped it a couple times like most of my phones and it's held up great.  My husband and I are stationed in Europe with the military and needed a new phone after my old one ended up in the washer.  We had a friend in the states mail this to us and I'm very glad I took the time to do that.  The Wifi is great, I wanted this phone particularly because of it.  Now we can go to any wifi hotspot in the world and I can use my Vonage account to make free phone calls to the US. (Big Plus for military!)  The MP3 player is great.  I use this in place of a regular mp3 players or my runs and it sounds great, the speaker is pretty loud and sounds good too and you could literally use this as a juke box (if you can't wear headphones on base).  I haven't tried the GPS, I'm sure it would be great if you were a cyclist, but you have to buy a seperate receiver for it and I really don't want to run with something that heavy.This also has a cell phone version of microsoft office and Adobe Acrobat.  It seems pretty handy, but I haven't found a reason to use it yet.  Maybe if I had to look up a random regulation while not on a computer. . . not likely.  Over all a great phone and I've been extremely happy with it!  If you want a phone that has it all, this is it!
I use this on AT&T; and it works great.  I love the ease of use and flexibility of the phone.  Great phone!!
I'm the sort of person that takes 6 months to research something and make excuses not to buy it.. Fortunately though this phone was well worth it and will hopefully last a few years (5 if I'm lucky).I hate the idea of having to upgrade a phone that cost a lot a only a year later it seems pointless just because its not the latest look...I've tried most phones over the years and this one does everything, can be a little fiddly but thats more getting use to it then anything else.wifi is not bad, have installed skype beta and all is working ok this was the main reason for buying it, that and the fact I can use it all over the world.If you're looking at a phone that pretty much does everything then this will probably be the one for you....It's slim and compact and doesnt have the feel of it breaking in you hand if you knock it which is good.Great phone, solid build, does everything, but is a little fiddly initially...Use the PC software it comes with to make your life a lot easier...Good luck!
The E51 is sleek, built for style and productivity...a rare combination that means popularity with true merit. So I'm quite puzzled that this phone isn't being pushed as much as the N95.It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode.It's real cool that the 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts and Email have different modes.Short press starts the app (Calendar, Contacts, Email).Long press starts a new record within the app (new calendar entry, new contact, new message).I've re-assigned the 1-press key for Email to start the Messaging app, and long press starts the CryptoGraf Messaging app to encrypt my messages.There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser.  The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs.The screen is crystal clear and good for viewing video and images. BTW, I thought it gets scratched quite easily, but that's just the plastic screen protector. I removed the screen protector and the screen stays scratch free even after I put the phone in my trouser pocket along with my keys.Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small.Voice call quality is quite good. The speakers are also quite good but they're awkwardly located on the back.The volume controls on the side of the phone are not easy to use...it's quite confusing that the 'cursor key' acts as a volume control for the media player, but the voice call volume control is on the side of the phone.The CPU is very fast at 350MHz, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Mini USB 2.0, 2.5 mm A/V connector. The BP-6MT 1050mAh battery gives me great talk time and standy time even with liberal use of bluetooth and WLAN.
After owning the device for a month now, here's my quick rundown of the positive and negative aspects of the phone.Pros (in order of importance):+ Excelent feature vs. price ratio. You'll be hard pressed to find another mobile device offering the same feature set, smartphone capabilities, and strong community following, for the same price. This is arguably the best bang for your buck smartphone on the market right now. After researching for quite a while before purchasing, this was a big deal-maker for me.+ Slim, stylish, classic candybar design and quality construction. The phone feels sturdy and the noticeable weight provides confidence it's not going to break if you happen to drop it accidentally (I can personally attest to this).+ High-quality screen. Sure, it's a bit on the small size compared to other Nokia offerings, but the QVGA resolution and 16M color display more than make up for it. You'll have a hard time watching full-length movies on it because of the size, but the pictures really look great and the UI is a pleasure to look at, especially with your choice of 3rd-party themes.+ Excelent performance. Plenty of CPU power and RAM to run several resource intensive games and application, at the same time.+ Symbian OS 9.2. This is a tried and tested smartphone OS. You just can't beat the huge application library available on the platform. Coupled with the performance bit above, the OS just flies through anything you run. Very responsive and stable.Now, onto to the negatives.Cons (in order of annoyance):- Weak battery. If you plan on using any of the features aside plain voice calls, get used to carrying the charger with you at all times. The battery is seriously underpowered, and a few hours worth of WiFi (for VoIP calls and light web browsing) on a full charge will last you--at most--24 hours. And don't even think about turning on Bluetooth for your wireless headset, since it will drain a full charged battery in about 5 hours--no joke. This is really a shame and it's one of the most frustrating aspects of the phone.- Application certificate: mandatory. The S60 3rd Edition Symbian OS makes a requisite that all installed applications must be signed with a proper certificate. This reduces the amount of software you can install on the phone by a large amount, since most freeware or small apps you might run into are usually unsigned. The only way I have found to remove this "feature" is to effectively hack your phone, with the risk of corrupting your system. Thankfully, all went well and I'm able to install all I want now, but this security measure is simply too restrictive for the end user. If you want to take advantage of the best aspect Symbian has going for it, get ready to perform this procedure.- Bugs in the current firmware. Although Nokia regularly updates the firmware of most of its lineup, it has recently set all their efforts on their flagship N series devices. The latest E51 firmware (200.34.36) was released on April 24, 2008, and has some major issues with the SIP client and browser, yet no update is in near sight.=== Added on 2008-12-26 ===- I forgot to mention the very annoying case of the side buttons (volume, mute, power, PTT). They're EXTREMELY hard to press. You literally have to hold the phone firmly with one hand, while you push forcefully on a button with your other hand. It also helps if you have long nails to dig into the buttons. Not sure why Nokia decided to have them so difficult to press.======- The following are not so much of an annoyance, as me nitpicking. The only feature missing from the phone that's not a gimmick (touchscreen, accelerometer, etc.) and would come in handy, especially in business oriented devices like the E series, is A-GPS. But since this would certainly drive the price way up, I think it compensates quite well despite not having this feature. The other feature gripes, like no flash or autofocus on camera, would really be pushing it, since this is not a camera phone, but it's still worth mentioning. One other small thing, is that the phone gets considerably warm during prolonged usage (15min+), be it WiFi, voice calls, video playback, etc. You can still hold it in your hand just fine, but I got worried the first time I noticed it. It's no big deal, really, once you get used to it.In summary, the one thing that soures up the experience of using this phone is the battery. For that fact, I'll have to give it 4/5 stars, but I'm completely satisfied with my purchase, and will surely consider another Nokia smartphone in the future.
Most of the cameras today are aimed either for kids (like the chocolate), fashion conscious adults (the big hit razr), or business people (the bulky blackberry or treo).What if i want a phone that is sleek but also loaded with all the important business tools?  well the E51 was a Godsend.This sleek phone comes with high speed 3G internet and WiFi connection.  Gone are the days paying $15 to connect to the internet at airports and hotels.  Simply use the mini usb cable or download a symbian based modem application and you can use your phone as your modem.The camera is decent (2mb) and since micro sd cards are so cheap nowadays (i bought a 4gb Kingston one at Amazon for $14) you can use this phone also as a portable mp3 player (stereo ear phones included).The best part of all though; it runs on Symbian.  Download Opera mini and Google Maps (with a neat 'show current location function) and you have the capability to browse html pages and use the phone as a water down gps device.
You are either going to love this phone or hate this phone. I love mine. But I am going to write this review with an eye towards scaring away people who will hate this phone.This phone's feature set is balanced differently than most other phones in its price class. Other phones in this price class emphasize megapixels, music, video, and fashion. This phone emphasizes productivity and connectivity. If you want productivity and connectivity, here is your phone. If not, there are plenty of others to choose from here on Amazon and elsewhere.Let's start with what this phone does well -This phone remotely synchronizes with Microsoft Exchange. If your company uses Exchange, you will have one phone book, one appointment calendar, and one e-mail inbox equally available on your computer and your phone. Updates in either place show up in the other. The Nokia implementation even handles contacts that have a company name but no first-name or last-name fields. My Motorola RARZ2 V8 failed this test.The phone has Wi-Fi. I didn't know how much I would use Wi-Fi on my phone until I had it.The phone can display word, excel, and PDF documents. It runs Google Maps very well, but without a GPS chip, you can only locate your position within about 900 to 5000 meters.The phone has a real message waiting light. Why is this feature disappearing from modern phones?The phone supports high speed 3.5G data on two bands. This is a lot for a European phone, especially one that came to market last year. Sadly, high speed data service is pretty much nonexistent here in the United States, and much of what does exist is on a band this phone can't handle. But will you get EDGE data (and voice) nearly everywhere in the United States and abroad. Indeed, reception in fringe areas is significantly better than my wife's Nokia 6086. I have connected to ATT's HSPDA network in Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Madison, and Minneapolis. I can't connect in Chicago because the network runs on an incompatible frequency there (1900Mhz).Battery life is outstanding, especially for a thin phone.Now lets move on to this phone's weak points -The camera is only 2 megapixels. And it is fixed focus at that. And it doesn't work well in the dark. And there is only one of them [most phones capable of sending video have two - one facing outward and one facing you]. The camera is good enough for me, but I would never put shots from it in the family album.The music player doesn't display album art. No flashy light show either. And you are limited to the built-in speaker or a 2.5mm audio jack (I think it helps 'em keep the phone thin - forget about it and use A2DP if you want headphones). I must admit, however, that I really miss gapless playback. Music loads into the phone very slowly on account of the older 1.5 megabyte per second USB limit.The phone will record video. I have not been able to record video at Nokia's claimed quality (15 fps QVGA). I think I have been lied to. I think Nokia means either 15 FPS or QVGA, but not both at the same time.The phone will play video, even from YouTube, but not at high bitrates.Be prepared for plenty of British spelling in the menus and applications.This phone's idea of fashion is understated basic black. I like it, but then again I am this phones target audience.
I had been following the E50 & E51 phones and I am quite happy with this phone. A smart phone has to be a good phone first. This one come pretty close. Small form factor, does not feel heavy in pocket, decent battery life, quad band, speaker phone, 3G, and wifi. I love the small light that blinks to let you know of a missed call.Cons:1) Speaker volume is low, compared to other Nokias I have had.2) If you are a heavy user of the Wifi you might find the screen size small3) Does not charge by USB cable.I thought hard about buying the E51 or the iPhone. I think the iPhone wins overall, but I will never buy it so long as Apple arm-twists me into signing a contract with AT&T; or any one phone company.
I've owned the Nokia E51 since January, and I can easily attest to the convenience, power, and versatility of this all-in-one powerhouse.  I was initially attracted to it due to its relatively high amount of on-board memory and slim form factor, both of which are hard to come by in the world of Symbian S60 operating system phones.  It's a very responsive device and very easy to carry in one's pockets.  The built-in WiFi capability allows for Gizmo5 VOIP calling (calls on the cheap) whenever you are near a WiFi hotspot.  I've also used the A2DP stereo music player with my bluetooth headphones on many occasions as a fill-in for my iPod.  And the amount of freeware S60 applications that are available as well as the powerful PIM capabilities of the phone add to the incredible usefulness of the phone.  The battery life is more than adequate, with ample on-screen and audible warnings before it becomes exhausted. The only serious negative for the E51 is the quality of the internal 2Mp camera, which is relatively poor.  Otherwise, the E51 is everything you want in a phone, minus the gimmicks.
The nature of my work makes me move and stay to different countries for months at a time so i needed an unlocked phone. I found that's not something easy to get in US. Phone stores would even sell you a locked phone at a full prize if you don't buy a contract, that's ridiculous. I've been to he Nokia store in NYC and I would have paid 100USD more than on Amazon for the same product. I'm very happy with my purchase, the phone came in perfect condition in a sealed box. The Symbian program allows you to synchronize documents with your computer, it's a great tool. I would recommend buying a protection for the screen, gets scratched easily (Invisible Shield is great)
No need to comment on the Amazon transaction - everything went smooth and as expected.The phone is great! Compact and yet has all the features which I need. One thing which could be improved is the battery life - compared to my old Nokia phone, the battery on this one lasts only about half, but still gets me through 3-4 days between charges. I travel between USA and Europe and can use the phone everywhere. The 3G connection is usable at this point only in Europe but perhaps some day it may be useful in the USA. The Wi-Fi in that aspect is a great fallback. I even installed Skype on the phone and am making cheap/free calls whenever am in a Wi-Fi hotspot. I stuffed a 4GB MicroSD card and now have a very convenient portable flash drive which is always handy - transferring the files over the USB or Bluetooth is a breeze. From time to time I even use the radio and it works beautifully. The built-in MP3/Video player is also quite good but is useful only if you add a good size MicroSD card for the filestorge.I have used the phone for more than 3 months now and have dropped it a few times - no problems, just works! The Nokia contacts management utility which ships with the phone could be improved a bit (it is a program which you install on your computer to help you with the management tasks of your contacts) - it does help though entering all the contact details on a normal keyboard instead of trying to thumb them on the phone. The necessary USB cable ships with the phone but any standard mini USB cable will do too.Some of the office-type apps pre-installed on the phone are not that great - for example, the Adobe PDF reader does not allow you to flip the screen horizontally, but there are tons of third-party apps available for that OS which you can download and install. Many good games are available too - I installed Backgammon.Overall, I am very happy with the phone and recommend it.
I bought this phone only a few days back and I couldn't have made a better choice.It has all the features I was looking for but I love the fact that its design it's not too flashy.WiFi works great, I spent hours yesterday watching YouTube videos on it.Great choice for those who want functionality, not stylish design.
Ive bought this last April and the phone is serving me well as a second phone for personal (non-business) number.This is not a perfect phone, but it desrves five stars for price over functionality, capability, and performance.--Responsive enough. No long annoying lags.--Given the big screen and tactile keys, viable as a websurfing device, also because...--Wi-Fi chip gets good connection everytime (unlike other phones or laptops that just disconnect suddenly although youre in a good wifi zone).--four special buttons for calendar, messages, and contacts are really useful. (Dont forget to setup the long-press option, so you have extra 3 functions programmed in shortcut key)--the long "portrait" screen serves the to do notes and layout of messages well. you see many text in one shot.--leather case included is very good (unlike the one included in e71).--the calendar is very usable for tasks. In one push of a button, the entire month is displayed nicely with mark on days with impt appointments and to-do's. The week count is also indicated--useful for us in manufacturing, who counts workweeks.--the steel is the body and thin contruction is truly attractive and durable (so far). The thin-ness makes it perfect fit even in tight jeans, so helps you prevent losing this phone. No excuse to your boss for not carrying it everytime as well. If I am an IT director, I would be issuing this phone rather than the N95 that I see with our plant managers.I might be partial to the 'enterprise'/for_business series of Nokia, but Ive owned an N70 and 72, with the same or higher price that this E51, and E51 beats them both hands down.There are negatives of course (two major gripes: short battery life, hangs sometime at menu button), but again, it's 5 stars considering price/functionality. Id be willing to buy it's next incarnation even if only the hangs/bugs (firmware update is useless) and some hardware (processor, battery) are improved, and everything else stays, incl price, the same.
this is pretty much exactly what i wanted. it does what's advertised well. the only three gripes i have are that it has a problem with some large pdf files; it crashed on me twice, i don't know why and it's been several weeks between each crash, hopefully an update will fix; and third is that you need to have headphones connected to listen to the radio.i had two more gripes with the internet browsing and the music player, but i downloaded a new browser and new music player, it's all good now.
I wanted a phone that does its main job well and all the secondary things were less important to me. This phone provides good call quality and at the same time has decent enough features. It provides 2 MP camera, WIFI connection can be made if need be, you can play music if you want to, you can make video calls or push to talk (but US networks do not suppport video calls yet). User interface is good also. Only con I found is that power on key has to be pressed at a certain angle and one has to apply force.
A good, fast phone for business. You can use the wireless function to browse the net wherever you are. The HSDPA modem is very fast, so that you can be always be connected to your mail.
Guys,I'm completely satified with phone and with dealer. So thanks to you all.Nokia made a good smart phone and Amazon shipped it to me in a vary nice manner - fast and safe.Thanks.
Great piece of hardware haven't gotten to use all the features yet but from what I have used so far I am impressed. Delivery was prompt and in good condition.Reccommend this product to all.
I bought this Nokia thinking it has a great feature set and I will admit that on paper it does, however when you get to using it that the problems start.Screen... I have a Blackberry for work and had a SonyEricsson for personal use; they have been banging around in my pockets along with my keys for close to a year now without a single problem or scratch.  After half a day in that same pocket with the blackberry and keys the Nokia's screen is already scratched.  This of course means they skimped another $1 on the coating for the screen and we all know the result.Features...I chose this phone because I thought I'd be able to use it with Skype anywhere I had a wifi connection and sometimes I can, but for the most part the reception is shaky at best when and only when it connects correctly and doesn't kick me off the network.  I also had my SE connected to my car (Audi A4) via Bluetooth with a great function that let me read my phonebook from my car nav screen.  The Nokia can't do it!! This really upset me so I did some research and discovered that Nokia did not include the complete Bluetooth stack in the phone and will not update this in the future.  One would think that adding another small bit of software to create a better product would be a good investment, but apparently Nokia thinks differently.Battery Life...The battery lasts for ages and I will admit they did a great job with it.  There is one thing about charging the phone that I do have a gripe with.  This phone cannot be charged via USB.  It has the connector for mini USB, but its only for data, a separate plug is needed to charge the phone.  This of course means carrying around more cables. yay.Camera...The SE w810i I had also had a 2megapixel camera, but it had things like Macro and Autofocus so even though this phone has a 2 megapixel camera good luck using it without any kind of options or functions.  I tried taking a picture of text as I often did with the SE to save some time and the hassle of pen and paper, now I can't even do that because this phone can't focus.Reception...The reception is great BUT THIS PHONE IS NOT 3G!!!!!!!  Yes it is 3G in EUROPE, but ATT uses the 1900 UMTS frequency in the USA for 3G so it will not work with 3G in the USA.  Goodbye blazing fast speeds when there is no WIFI.I had a Nokia a Long time ago and though it might be time to give it another try, but I think I'll wait another 5 years to try them again.
This is just the right phone for the low budget business person. At a price less than $250, its packed with audio, video, internet, office and loads of functionalities with useful quicklaunch buttons (though qhute tiny. Battery life on this phone isn't quite impressive as I have to charge mine everyday. But in all, it's a good phone and fits well into my pockets.
Good quality phone.  Fast, good battery time. PDA features are great.  Camera okay. Nice size. Reception is great. WiFi is worth it.Would reccommend this phone.
This is a great phone! Usable, attractive and open to all sorts of enhancements.Battery life is great.Very usable, responsive and fun to use.Great OS, stable and usable.Minor problems are: You can't change the writing language easily, and it gets hot rather fast...Great buy, anyway.
I can not recall any recent experience that came even close to the one I recently had. Having bought two Nokia E51 cell phones, one had a problem (a key fell off) after 4 days from the purchase date and Amazon response to my inquiry was very professional and flawless. Nokia, which I contacted first wanted me to ship them the phone, take a look at it, and decide whether they will repair it under warranty or not!!??Amazon shipped me a new one, provided a return label for the problematic phone and that was it. Loved it!!!!The phone is great, has everything I missed having after switching to a different brand a couple of years ago. Then there is the S60 operating system and wifi capabilities, plus a lot of available software out there.
Awesome Phone.  Slim, easy to use, and light.  The E51 is lighter than the Motorola KRZR I used to carry.  Text messaging is a snap, even with the traditional layout, and synching email is no problem.  The phone walks you through everything as you go through setup, no frustration trying to figure out how to make it work.  All in All a great phone at a great price.
Just wanted to point out that this phone will connect to wi-fi and will work just over wi-fi (if desired) for browsing, IM, mail sync, exchange mail sync and voip calls..
I've had the phone 1 month and I could not be happier with my choice. The battery life is outstanding, I've only had to recharge it 4 times in the last month. If you are looking for a phone that is packed with features, easily slips into your pocket and has great call quality this is the phone.
I really like this phone, it does everything I need it to do and more.
Purchased this phone from Amazon based mostly on excellent reviews.But, to my big supprise this phone turned out to be quite a disappointment. Here is why: my sim card contacts (I have T-Mobile)were not recognized by this phone. My other phones Sony Erricsson, Motorolas, even my son's Nokia 9300 never had this problem. What am I suppose to do now? Reenter my entire list of all contacts and I mean at least 40 entries. But, this not all, I tried to make few calls and quality of voice reception is much worse than with my old Sony Ericsson. The voice of another person is difficult to hear because it's immersed into some kind of background sound.Lastly, if you have little bigger than small hands to operate this phone would be very uncomfortable. The buttons are vey small and quite cramped. I am sending this phone  back to Amazon and for now sticking with my old Sony Ericsson. I will probably buy newer Sony Ericsson or Samsung, but not Nokia.
I have done more research than the Apollo mission on the moon.  This is the biggest bang for your buck GSM phone.  I had to return the first one as the screen had some defects/flicker.  Features are amazing, quality looks good.  Screen is on the small side, but capable. Key are small, but it is a compromise on phone size.
Its functional, wireless works well, and phone layout is good. It looks cheap.
The battery life is amazing, the functionality is amazing, the connect-ability and speed, coverage and sound quality are all amazing! The build quality is also amazing. I'll still be using this phone 10 years from now.
early, cheap, easy, insurance.i am very happy with this buy.i dont have best price that amazon price.
I purchased the phone in large part due to the exchange mail feature (wireless sync).  I received it yesterday and couldn't get mail set up due to certificate errors.  I called Nokia support this morning and found out our IT guys need to provide a different type of certificate.This needs to be made more clear up front.  If you state your product will due EAS out of the box then that's what it should do, not require additional work from IT.Aside from that, I thought it was an awesome phone. Great form factor, loads of features.  If you're looking for a feature rich phone in a small form factor, and don't need exchange mail sync, this is it.If you think you're going to just cruise through the mail set up you might receive an unpleasant surprise.
Also this phone from Nokia allows dust to enter in the screen. Just after a few weeks you have visible grains of dust in the lower part of the screen. Now, after months, it looks horrible. My previous phone, Nokia 6021, had the same problem. Stupid me to choose Nokia again.
There is another user who posted a review on here that says the phone is not 3G.  The specs for the phone, both documented and on the box, show that this phone should connect at 3G in the USA.  I live in Manhattan and have toured this phone all over the island and it has never connected at 3G, only Edge.  Then I went to AT&T;'s site to find out what the 3G coverage was for Manhattan & it was 100%... so I don't know what's up with that.There is also a problem with the firmware, having had 2 of these phones - the phone will reboot randomly.  If you use a wired headset with the phone, be aware that you must buy a particular headset, the "HS-40" by nokia.
AntOnline does not deliver after you place your order.  They may have some of the cheapest prices listed but their customer service is lousy.
Este teléfono es una belleza. El único "defecto" que le encuentro es que no tiene teclado qwerty. Por lo demás, supera con creces a muchos aparatos que son más caros.
It's a good, solid phone with a lot of features in there. I would say - price/content ratio is very good. But... It's already a second brand new Nokia phone I am returning  (Before it was Nokia N95) for the same reason. The quality of sound during a conversation is very, very poor - a some sort of static noise, the voice itself is not clear at all - I had to ask to repeat last sentence several times during a conversation. Very frustrating. Second thing - volume control buttons and speech activation button located on the right side are very hard to click - especially taking into account that this phone is very slim - actually, I had to hold it with 2 hands to increase the volume or activate a voice calling feature. I was a huge fan of Nokia until two recent purchases of new Nokia phones - I am afraid this company went on a wrong path by chasing the longer list of additional cool features in a phone and lost the phone itself.
I have only used this phone for about a week.  I haven't really gotten any real use out of the phone.  But what I have to say about it is, is it is a super design!  It is sleek.  The bluetooth works like a charm--easy to use.  The phone came with a 2 year old battery--bummer, but I bought a new one and now it is humming right along!
I bought this used through Amazon but the phone has many problems! Half the time you can't hear the person calling you and you're forced to call them back. Also, it is a model that doesn't have the "Favorite Five" display, so you are forced to call customer service to set up and/or change your favorite five. Also, when using blue tooth earpiece and then you remove the earpiece from the phone, the phone then stops working (you can't hear anything or call anyone) unless the blue tooth is constantly plugged in. Not the greatest choice of phone!
After hearing all of the horror stories about why not to purchase this product, I have been very happy with it.The display is large enough for me to see.  It's very user friendly, and all of the function keys are conveniently placed on the handset.I have nothing but positive praise for this phone.
Really nice phone! At first there were some problems initializing the phone to communicate with Nokia PC Suite on the Vista platform but that was eventually sorted out and other than that it was a really good buy. Great camera and web browsing with mouse key capabilities and lots of other features.
I've used the N75 phone on Cingy/AT&T; for about a year and this phone uses the same Symbian 3rd ed OS. So I still have the same gripes about that but..The differences that I like on this phone:-Awesome camera resolution. Really digital camera-like. Even the indoor night pictures w/ flash came out great! Most people think it's a camera because of the way it looks and they give you that weird look when you ask them to take a picture of you ... and you hand them a phone!-Better battery life than the N75-I thought I'd have a problem with the smaller keypad area but I can actually text quicker on this because the keys are closer together and more responsive.-the keypad and phone itself (except for the screen) doesn't attract fingerprints as much as the N75-speakers sound fuller and not teeny-more themes and ringtones than my branded N75-lighter than the N75-easier sim card accessThe Cons:-I've gotten used to the flip style so having the screen exposed made me think twice about shoving it into my pockets.-joystick not as easy to get used to.In other words, an awesome awesome phone.A little pricey but well worth it! Get it!
This phone will not let you down! The reception is full bars always(like most Nokia phones). The pictures blow away your friends phones. The music options are cool! Just put like 8 hours of music on the phone and it did not even dent the memory! This phone is worth every penny!!
the phone has amazing video/picture abilities. i can add text to the beginning of videos i have taken. on pictures i can add clip art and text in the same image! sound quality for ringtones/speaker phone is loud and clear! using video on the phone is awesome, picture is clear and easy to see what happens when you record, unlike the crappy resolution on other cell phones.i had the phone in two days and put my sim card in the phone and no worries! this phone is worth IT and you arent locked into any kind of contract. enjoy!
I love this phone, i bought it with overnight shipping and i had it in my residential door the next day.
love the phone, except i was suppoosed to get the music edition but the just sent a black n73, which came wit a 512 memory card compared to the music edition thats supposed to come wit a 2gb card
Damnn....i got this phone yesterdayand I thought this phone is real !!but it's not at allthis all COPY !!!!!!it's a COPY phone..!! not realcause I had used this phone last yearbut I bought from my coutryIt's so DIFFERNT !!!!!!!!!1DONT TRUST THIS SELLER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I HAD A PROMLEM WITH THIS CELL PHONE WHEN I GOT IT E-MAIL WOULDNT WORK AND I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SOFTWARE WOULDNT STAY ON WOULD CRASH
This is not a Music Edition phone as described. Instead it is just the Black edition of Regular N73. Absolutely disappointed with the purchase. Will send back the product for refund.Issues with Regular N73:1) Slow and unresponsive UI2) Need to purchase additional miniSD card. It comes with only 512 mb, whereas N73 ME comes with 2 Gb3) Need to purchase additional 3.5 mm audio adaptor.[EDIT]I'm glad that Amazon has changed the product description to N73 Black and not ME!!
Firstly let me start with the biggest plus of the N95 - its opennness and unlocked nature.Everyone now seems to compare every phone with the iPhone ...so here goesN95 is unlocked - free unbridled unlocked goodness  - (for people like me who often travel abroad this is a huge plus for not having to beg your service provider to please unlock your phone that you paid money for.N95 has a replaceable battery - means additional life for your phone and you won't have to discard a high-end device when your low-end battery inside dies - compare that to the iphone.N95 is a open development platform - for techy users and everyone else also - this means more apps developed free for this platform (S60) rather than other closed and locked down platforms.N95 supports bluetooth tethering to laptops and PDA's. I use my Nokia N810 Internet tablet to connect wirelessly by tethering over Bluetooth to my N95 high speed HSDPA data connection. This means I get fast internet connectivity everywhere - everywhere there is a cell tower at least.For those less in the know iPhone doesnt support tethering.N95 has support for A2DP Bluettoth profile - which means you can listen to Stereo music over a bluetooth headphone (like the Motorola S9). This is apart from support bluetooth headset for talking.For iPhone users , in todays wireless day, you still have to use a wired headphone to listen to music - pretty messy.N95's 5 MP camera is one of the best of breed in any cellphone - quality wise of photos.N95-3 has one of the fastest 3G HSDPA data connection support in the US. (iphone 3g does have this too)Also the Wifi and GPS in the N95 come is handy when you need those features instantly.As a in-car GPS it certainly does not fit the bill, but when walking in the streets of NY, and you suddenly need to get some info or directions - GPS and the Wifi come in most useful.For me having a good quality camera for instant shots (instead of caring a dedicated camera always) and the USA 3G HSDPA is what convinced me to go for the Nokia N95 over other similar featured phones (iPhone is definitely not similar featured - its a different class for me).On a comparatove note the Nokia N78, E71, N82 and Samsung G series are comparable devices depending on which feature set you lay more importance on.And for those who find the camera slow - please update the software with the latest N95 firmware that Nokia released recently - it speeds up the camera a lot and also some other features.The battery on my new Nokia N95-3 lasts 1 1/2 day with HSDPA 3,5G usage in NY/NJ area and I use it daily to tether to my N810 device (which gives me touchscreen internet).
This phone packs everything you would ever need in a smart-phone and then some. You will be able to watch video,movies and listen to your favorite music with the built in media support. You can find your way with the built in GPS. Surf the web with the full HTML browsesr and stay up to date with your inbox on the go.When initially looking into purchasing the N95 I was planning on replacing a blackberry that I have been carrying around for years. I have been a blackberry user for some time and thought I would never find a better solution. I was wrong. This device does everything my blackberry did and then some. Granted the push email is a plus and the N95 does not support push out of the box (Checks at intervals) but there are some third party applications that add this. The beauty of the S60 platform is that you have the freedom to do what you want with pretty much anything on the device.The N95 seems thick at first but its actually very small and extremely easy to carry in  your pocket. I have actually learned to like the fill of the thickness more because it fits my hands perfectly. I have been using the qwerty keyboard on my blackberry for some time and can type very well on it so I was skeptical about going back to a phone keypad. While I am not as fast as I was on a blackberry the prediction is very good on this device and allows you to easily type short emails and text messages with no trouble.Nokia states that this device is a multimedia computer and I have to agree its very powerful once you learn how to use it. Will it replace my iPod? Possibly but its not quit as a good as a standalone audio device. The music player is very easy to use and with the media transfer plugin (available for mac)  you can use iTunes to sync your music just like you would an iPod. I was able to sync my address-books, contacts and music and videos in no time with the software available for download on Nokia's USA website.My favorite feature of the N95 is the fact that I can take pictures/video (5MP camera) and post them to the web (flickr, OVI) all from the device. Being a family man this is a wonderful thing to have because I have have a great moment in our life up on the web with comments in a matter of minutes without ever needing a computer. The camera is very impressive for a phone. It takes a while to get used to getting good pictures with it but with a little practice you can take great shots with ease. I can't wait to see what Nokia comes up with next. The N series devices are the best hands done.
I have the N95-3 (RM-160), which is this version that is sold by Amazon for the North America market and I am having serious issues getting GPS lock. I opened the phone slider, point the phone upward to clear sky from 20th floor rooftop and I get GPS lock AFTER 20 minutes. I tried this on different location and the same thing.I reset the phone, upgraded to the latest firmware, uses Assisted GPS and still the problem persist.Google "N95 GPS lock" and you will see hundreds of people having the same problem. Many send it back to Nokia and got it work, some are not so lucky and Nokia just send them a refurbished phone that have the same problem. It seems that some phones have DEFECTIVE GPS chip.Please be warned of these.
Great phone it is as advertised a n95-3 black. I have had the phone for about a month now and I love it! The camera is great and so is the video. the are tons of third party apps for this phone so you customize it with everything from motion sensing programs to a infared tv remote this phone has it all. The only things you might want to consider before buying this phone is battery life, the slide becomes loose after awhile and I'm not sure what causes this but after I updated the firmare (thru nokia) my phone stops and reboots itself without warning which is aggravating after spending $520
I made my homework before choosing this phone and let me say I am glad. Windows based phones have a lot of programs and functions, but are very slow and the management of memory is a mess. Also some times are too bulky that I rather carry my notebook instead.Basic nokias, sony-ericssons and motorolas are that, basic.So, I wanted a smart phone, with lots of features, easy of use and that could let me stop carrying many other devices. The nokia did that for me!Pilot, no longer need it. Ipod, no longer need it. Cannon camera, no longer need it. Garming gps, no longer need it. FM Radio, no longer need it; voice recorder, calculator and games no longer need them, also universal remote, skype phone, etc... Don't get me wrong on this. But... the N95 does all that and well done! I do not miss any of the mentioned.Is like a swiss knife, every body has one but very few carry it on! With the N95 you can carry all of those devices on. (I am one of those who carries the n95 and the Sw Army)Why the n95? Came down to blackberry 8310 or 8320, iphone and the n95 to me. But I found the nokia camera a lot better; lens, resolution and also the others do not take movies. Also I found the GPS faster on nokias an can use it out of the box. Wi-fi is marvelous (blackberry made me choose between gps or wi-fi, depending on model I wanted both features), the size, etc.. The touch is firm, well built, nice grab, the size is to me perfect. Is very simple and fast to use, and finally a phone that my ol'man can use with out going to college.Also I rather this version since the 8 gigas version is more expensive and the memory has a limit. Here I can get the HD-SD for a few bucks in Amazon with... infinite capacity.If you are a corporate person, or a chat fan, then probably you are stuck with the berry. Which is a great option too. The iphone... well trendy people will love it. I made my choice and think is the best bet!Thanks for reading!
I purchased my new N-95 to replace another Nokia model cell phone.  Nokia seems to have the best product I have used after 10 years of cell service.  Signal strength is the only major drawback I have found, so far with the N-95.  I live in a rural area and this weakness is still superior to other cell phone mfgrs I have tried out.  The slide mechanism is a little loosey-goosey for a pouch-type holder and I have had some adjustments to make on how I hold the phone while talking in order not to push camera buttons.  But that aside the phone rates highly for me.  The camera (5mpx) is wonderful- I have mine on automatic focus and flash and it works well.  Somewhat slower shutter release than my Nikon DSLR D-80- but IT'S A PHONE!  The image quality is great!  Very easy to operate and program, if you have used earlier Nokia models- or glance over the user manual-Don't like a button's function?  Easily changed to shortcuts to fuctions you use more.  Loads of pre-loaded ringtones and 'stuff'.  Transfer of contacts and other data was a breeze.  Connects to my computer easily with the included software.  Initially, I didn't plan on keeping the phone- but it's got me sold on it's features and function.  So...it's here to stay and use!
Nothing else to add, to what have already been said and announced on the description.In my personal opinion, it is a great phone and would have 5 stars if it had little and small software and physical upgrades like the n73. For example, the main camera, i agree it wont beat your PnS but i do not care about this 'cuz am a professional photographer, but come on for the amount of money we are paying for this phone should have a cover on the back to protect it (if you are buying the US version at least it doesnt has), and on the software area, i really miss the sleep mode from the n73, it could be annoying for some people but for me, i like it cuz it saves a little more battery.On this subject, i do not know why people complains so much, if you dont have WiFi, GPS, GPRS and pretend to get rid of your iPod with this, of course the battery wont last at all. Since i own this phone has last me playing with all its functions for 3 days, and withouth playing with it almost 6 whole days. So, it's up to you.I havent had any gps lock problems, wifi and gprs both work fine, google applications works fine too. Native web browser works good too (you can add another one if you like but the main one does its job). mp3 player and video quality are good.the one i bought comes with software version 11.0 something, be sure to upgraded to 20.0 something as soon as you received it before makin any setups or contacts so you dont have to do backups or anything like that so you dont get bored wasting time.the micro sd it came with was 1gb, i quickly change it for a 4gb and works good enough.i do recommend using your phone as soon as you receive it because the battery comes with some charge already, so use that charge while you start to know your phone, once you are done i also recommend charging it for the first time switched off and for around 5 hours, its a lie you need 12 hours to charge it and even more a myth you need 24 hours.other than that just have fun with your new phone
I purchased this phone as it really seems to be a phone first (actual numeric key pad and good call quality), with a really good data feature set too. The phone is great! Call quality is good and it is nice to just be able to start hitting numbers and that is what you are getting. Everyone raves about the features on this phone and for good reason. There is far more here on the phone than I will ever use. Free GPS is a great perk of this phone. And if you use it frequently, it negates some of the cost as you save yourself the monthly fee from AT&T.; The camera takes good pictures, but is far too slow to effectively replace your point and shooter.Everyone complains about the battery life, and not without reason. If you are using 3G, it will not make it through the day, even with minimal usage. Running on Edge, and only using 3G when connecting to the internet allows you to make it through the day in most cases though.My biggest complaint with the phone is that it does not maintain a connection with my mailboxes as consistently as I would expect. I use Mail for Exchange (a Nokia app) for my business account and use what came on the phone for two other accounts. Almost daily, at least one of my accounts will lose connection and I will have to restart the phone, sometime multiple times, and then go to the settings to reset the retrieval settings. I have not seen that this is a widespread problem, but it is very frustrating and not something I ever experienced with BlackBerry or HTC.When all is said and done, this is still one of the best phones on the market today. If you have the money to spend and want a lot of features, you won't be disappointed. But if you are a serious email user I think I would look around a little bit. (Any tips on the email issues mentioned above would be welcomed.)
I upgraded from a Nokia N75 and there is no comparison.  Battery life is much better, it's smoother to operate and have had zero complaints.  The music player is excellent it's easy to download music to.  Great Nokia product.
The Nokia N95-3 is definitely worth buying.  There are so many features in this phone that will satisfy the most hard to please buyers.  Despite the many features, I find it so easy to use.  The 8 GB micro SD card that I installed worked flawlessly giving me enough memory for music, video and data. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
Before getting this phone I had a Sony W600 that I loved, it lasted me three years and I was reluctant to change it until my wife got me the Nokia N95.This was indeed a great choice and the best phone I've ever had!In the box besides the usual items (headphones, CD with software, etc) this one includes a car charger and a Bluetooth auricular, so you don't have to pay extra for those!The screen size is perfect and great when you navigate on the web, you can rotate the screen to what's best for you. Wi-fi is great and very fast (I can now buy from Amazon or get movie tickets from my cell phone!), you can install applications to it (like MSN) The sound from the speakers is also a great thing to notice, while speakers seem small the sound this phone has will blow you away! The software is user friendly, very easy to get used to it and its features.Another important thing to note is the camera resolution, the videos I've taken with this look great on my 50" HDTV, the resolution is simply astonishing, I like taking pictures and I used to carry my cyber-shot with me all the time but that's changed since I got this phone.I have owned several phones and most of them were Nokias, they never disappoint.Great choice of a phone, I would definitely recommend this.
This is an awesome phone!!!! Got the n series...love the camera...5mp is as good as a real camera....wifi is fast and super convenient...the sound is great....the screen is awesome...I love nokias ...they are absolutely user friendly... a lil on the bigger...heavier side...but...nonetheless...I love it!!!!
Pros:- Excelent MP3 player, thanks to the volume and playlist control in the earphone cable;- Excelent for Voip with Fring and Nimmbuzz (works with my Skype account!)- Good for watching some quick videos once in a while;Cons:- GPS works only sometimes: when I really need it, it doesn't.
This is really good, Most of the features in one hand set, Now I do not carry  my camera with me anymore, Wi-Fi and GPS features are very convenient.
I will tell you first I am a Nokia person.  This will be my fourth Nokia phone.  Even though I tried to leave for the Quickfire I was back in three days :)  Being a Nokia person their phones just keep getting better.  Wi Fi nice addition. I cancelled my data plan now I can sip on a coffee at starbucks and access the internet free of charge.  The GPS is great too.  I was in the car with my girlfriend who doesn't own a GPS we got lost and my phone got us back on track.  5 mega pixel camera I could go on and on.  Don't be scared buy this phone!
Amazingly, although I bought this phone neither here nor at NewEgg, there are only 2 reviews on NewEgg for it, and I wrote one of them. It follows:Pros: Relatively small, fits in a pocket albeit cases are tough to find (see Cons), has Wi-Fi, has built-in GPS (and A-GPS), has US 3G (not Euro 3G like a lot of "unlocked" cell phones), has a huge software development community, comes with everything you need (including a 1GB microSD card), plays video at 30fps, supports a SlingMedia client, supports voice recognition, has a great bluetooth implementation, has TWO cameras (one with 5MP on the back with a flash and a lesser one on the front for Skype-type use), is stable with the latest firmware release, supports innumerable tools for file management and software installation, has excellent battery life considering everything it has (which can be increased by turning off Bluetooth, lowering the Wi-Fi transmit level, etc.), has great voice call quality, has an FM radio, voice recorder, supports apps that allow editing of Office documents, comes with its own (admittedly almost useless) GPS app which you can easily replace, and is now a LOT more affordable. Makes an iPhone look like a Fisher-Price toy. Oh, and has a microSDHC slot that will take an 8GB chip (and larger, hopefully).Cons: There's really only one case out there--a horizontal leather fold-over flap job with a magnetic latch. PnP-driven media players for which it's allegedly a client are hard to make work. Real player is the built-in video app, which is fine for MP4 but lacks support that comes with Core Player (which you can get, but which is also hard to integrate). The stock web browser is good, but doesn't support MS IE-based apps (but a Beta version of Skyfire does, so you can play Sirius' internet stream--seeya, Stiletto). Doesn't come with anti-virus or firewall SW, but Kapersky makes a good one. The only GPS app worth using that supports voiced turns is AmazeGPS which is FREE (the latest version of Google Maps works splendidly, if silently). Users used to a simple bar phone won't like the complexity, although my wife has done OK moving from a somple 6030 to it. No QWERTY keyboard, but also no 2-handed head-down operation to send a message (OK, it's still a 1-handed head-down operation).Other Thoughts: There's the original N95 (a.k.a. -1), the -2 (with European 3G--forget high-speed Internet access), and the -3 (a.k.a. the NAM model), with US 3G that's only superseded by the N95-8G and now the N96. Interestingly, my understanding is they left out the hardware-based video processor from some succeeding models so the N95-3 supports video and games better. The -8G model, like the iPhone, has 8GB on-board but no microSDHC slot, although the N96 has 16GB internal (and I believe the slot came back). But BOTH cost a LOT more than the N95-3 (try as high as TWICE AS MUCH). I like Nokia's small-tip charger system, so the car charger works with the N95 AND their Bluetooth headsets and headphones. There's more, but space is limiting. I am convinced that there's no better cell phone available--it's basically future-proof. Don't download Nokia's Maps 2.0--it loads the voice library which you have to subscribe to in order to use ($$$!). Oh, it has lots of RAM and a standard 3.5mm headset jack. A USB charger is extra (a LOT extra), but useful. BE CAREFUL about ordering accessories--almost everything advertised for it is really for the original N95 and WILL NOT FIT the N95-3 because of its larger battery and consequently deeper case size.
This Phone is the most excellente phone that it being in the market for a while! I had it last year only for 10 days (beacuse I lost it) and this year i Bought it agaian, I won't change anything from it, Just Love it and use a lot and every function that comes with it is perfect for me!
Great Phone Very Funcional For Everything From Multimedia to GPS Great Signal (ATT) Great Camara Very Recomended
The phone is great, except ... bluetooth connectivity is incompatible with many devices. Car kits are a problem, and my phone will not connect with my Pioneer Premiere car receiver. I've read of problems with BMW factory car kits as well. Nokia acknowledges the incompatibility with Pioneer and says "tough toenails, we don't support third party enhancements." Automatic connection with a Jabra BT8040 earpiece won't work either, although manual connections seem to work OK. So if bluetooth connectivity is an issue, buy something else.
The choice was between this and the iphone. I'm glad i went with the N95. Great quality screen, sounds great, good volume. The menu system takes a couple days to get accustomed to but once you get into it the configurability is good.GPS works fine for me. (Trinidad & Tobago W.Indies)Battery life two full days from new.I use 8Gig cards. My ipods packed away now.movies run smoooothly.Great pictures. A bit slow but bearable for me.Fits comfortably in jeans pocket.Lots of third party apps availabe.The two cons that make the rating a 4 are : -lack of touch screen. This phone surfs well, but navigation can be a bit slow when entering forms. -A larger screen ( the ipod wins on this). because of the smaller screen you'll be scrolling around quite a bit when zoomed in to read pages or data files. This coupled with lack of touch screen makes use of the office package tedious.Have'nt found a sliding case i like yet.Does'nt charge from usb port. Have seen a usb adaptor that would fit the charging port will get one and try.This phone has lots of usefull features,in a sophisticated style.
So I used an iPhone for about 8 months and was pretty happy wikth it, but when I decided the try a new device, I was much happier after I found the Nokia N95. It has a better camera that takes amazing pictures, it has 3G, it has voicde guided navigation that works better then my Garmin Nuvi 650, it has a nice file system, MP3 player, A2DP, Speakers, Nice Layout, and its Unlocked. Its an all-around great device for people that don't want to carry around a camera, phone, pda, and nav system. The only things I would prefer this device had would be a touch screen and a better included word processing program.
what else can be said about the nokia n95 little i guess for me almost perfect phone a lot of extras and with a lot of programs to choose the maps are a little limited but overall great phone
If you're looking for a true alternative of the iPhone or a blackberry, this is it. It even tops it's competitiors in several aspects: 5 MP camera with flash, microSD card slot (supports microsSDHC, 8GB card works like a charm!), battery is easy accessible and much more. Movies look great, sound is fairly good for it's small speakers and the WLAN access is just awesome.cons: The phone's software is slow compared to other mobile OS.
I was well satisfied with everything about this cellphone. Its been my first real expensive personal gadget and overall its please me. It's worth to buy this expensive unit as it give you everything from cellphone, music player and tiny PC on the moved. Very impressive the way OS of this tiny PC to respond on any of your command. With the multiple availability to connect, its all you need for person on the go. It's not perfect but well satisfied you with all its capabilities.
This N95 -3 is good.My wife is using thisonly the COns are :the phone hangs up some time.SO i need to restart.so overall rating is good.and amazon products are always good.
I tried it for a few days (more like a weekend) and I had to return it.  Although it has everything underneath the sun in terms of technology it was still below my standards due to- The phone shut down by itself on Saturday so I didn't get my 8AM alarm to wake.  At least the iphone will try to reboot when it crashes- The phone drained it's battery completely on Sunday when it was fully charged the night before.  I was left w/o any phone to use Sunday morning.- The OS is quite slow and laggy at times- T9 input still isn't my cup of tea- iTunes sync allowed me to only sync one playlist and with no way rate songs and sync it back to iTunes- The web browser was faster in 3G but still seemed slow overall in rendering webpages- When connecting it would sometimes ask me whether I wanted to use the 3G or wifi.  This should be automatic- Even though A2DP was supported the sound from the blue tooth headset was muffled compared to my wired headphones.  I'm not sure if this is due to A2DP or the Bluetooth headset.  Maybe this is why iPhone didn't support A2DP?- Obviously there's also the user interface which took quite a few more clicks to get to another place- Video recording felt like the lens was made of water and the 5MB pictures are substandard even in very brightly lit environments.- Installing 3rd party apps was a pain if it wasn't signed with a certificate.
Like others have posted.  The iPhone are form factor and trend appeal...and teeny boppers.  If you want a real device with function and sustenance, look no further than the N95.  And this version (N95-3) is made with North America 3G to use with AT&T;'s 3G data plan.  This may not be the best looking or smallest phone, but it's best phone ever.
I expected better from Nokia. Although the 5MP built in camera gets you high quality pictures, the battery life on the other hand is very disappointing. Especially when other phones from Nokia are doing so well with respect to battery life. Also, what I did not like was the 'cheapy-plastic' feel of the casing. Not exactly what I would expect from such an expensive phone.Response time is also very slow. It might be true that by downloading updates from Nokia it will get a little faster, but I don't think I'm the one who needs to upgrade my phone that I just bought last week.I don't recommend this phone and wished I bought another phone.
I researched the capabilities of smart phones in the market and those about to be launched and decided to buy this one over the 3G iPhone. Unfortunately my phone shuts off by itself every few days even with a full battery. I sent it to Nokia for repair and it died again 48 hrs after getting it back from them. I then found several forums on-line where people are having similar issues with N95s, and others where people complain about the hapless service from Nokia repair. That iPhone is looking really good right now.
I had to return this phone after 2 days, It would reboot itself and or just lockup. I read about this before. It did have the latest firmware.  The price was $517 when I ordered, it dropped to $488 now. The nokia n95 8g  was 639 and that day I returned Nokia has it for $579 for like a day.  However, the drawback with the phone.  I use a treo and a blackberry. The lack of a keyboard is hard to deal with.  I really wanted to like the device it does allot.  The camera features are nice,  the 8g version seems to be the better way to go in terms of os since I think it has more operating memory.  Nokia is releasing the N96 soon, then the Nokia Tube, hence the price drops.  But it did work ok on att 3g, wifi worked,  the lock ups and freezing was not acceptable for a phone that cost $500.
Subject - iphone killer? Let's seeMy previous phone was a W810i. That phone had a host of features and amazing interface, great camera, great earphones and an overall excellent value for money. I was sold to Sony Ericsson then and thought no Nokia for me again. I even picked this phone over the Iphone. I have always been the guy who goes for the mid-expensive phones because I lead a mid-expensive life and I know that doesn't make sense so I'll cut it but some of you might get the picture. But something changed and I wanted a phone which would knock dead the usual. I didn't go for the iphone because it's just too popular and everyone in the world is soon going to have it. After 40 days of poking around, I decided to go with my gut instinct and got this little fellow. The W960i stands out because noone has the phone. Not many people know about it and there are little or no advertising. The only place I could find sufficient info on this was C_net and U_tube.Features -1. Touch screen enabled device2. WLAN (upto 384 kbps)3. 8GB inbuilt hard drive4. Supposedly adequate RAM or memory for the phone5. Bundled earphones, various schemes for playlists such as moods, most played, highest rated,etc.6. Outstanding record/log of calls made in the last 50 days7. Unlimited number of messages8. Decent keypad with good text prediction/well tuned software9. PDF/Card Reader Scanner/Mediocre flashPros1. The touch screen doesn't take much time to get used to. It took me roughly five days to major it and now everytime I hold a non-touchscreen phone or cordless phone, I feel a little strange.2. Impressive call-logging data. The phone actually managed to maintain records of the last fifty days worth of entry. However it does get difficult to store phone numbers from new callers because that's when the 960i shows it's moodswings3. Very good sound when listening to it without earphones. Just aptly loud even though the interface is generally sluggish.4. There is 1 + 1 stylus that come with the phone. Don't play too much hockey with the stylus though. After a while your fingers will be just right to move around and you won't need the stylus except when you're using complex playlist options.5. trackid is an amazing feature. If you're in a pub and want to know what track is playing, trackid (software name) will record a 6 second sample and send it to the universal server and you will get to know the name of the track,artist and album within a minute (at the most) This is amazing and my friends think this is the sole reason I got the W960i and that is only because they find it so uber cool.6. Tactile feel and very good build quality though the touchscreen gets ruined without the not included plastic cover/sticker. Exceptionally good build quality.7. While the 3.2 megapixel camera is quite a disappointment, the zoom no longer ruins the photograph as much. Improved zoom.8. Wireless works even though the browser is corrupt and buggy.9. Big fonts when typing a message10. Ear volume is satisfactory and the phone catches signals well. It is also light to carry.11. trackid - This phone has trackid. If a song is playing around you and you wish to know the name, trackid allows you to record a sample, within a few seconds of the sample being sent, you will get the name of the song. It all takes much less than a minute.Cons1. Most lacklusture ensemble of menu, shortcuts and files2. Doesn't come with mp4 playback software which means no videos. It still records in gp3 and though the videos were of good quality, video playback software (divx) was very buggy on this phone and never worked for me.3. Where is the torch? I miss it.4. Battery life has dismal written all over it. Try talking 3hours and 20 mins on a single charge and you'll remember Jesus of Nazareth. I had to keep reducing the brightness to 19% and what not. 65% is default brightness.5. The general feel of the menu gets worse every month and it becomes more and more prone to mistakes. To navigate there is a little joystick like navigation button on the left which is annoying and cheap. I don't even use it enough because my friend said his broke for his w950i and his girlfriend's did the same. You can't help but feel cheated because the menu is nowhere near as good as the Iphone.6. The bundled earphones are same as the ones you get with the other walkman series and there is nothing different. This is annoying because SE are trying to save money and develop a standard and at the same time expect six hundred dollars for this phone7. The camera is inferior to W810i and there are simply too many shades and blindspots when viewed on my computer. I have to photoshop photographs which are shot in dark light and personally increase contrast. Don't even think of comparing the Nokia N95 camera to this. The iphone camera likes to make images look a little brighter and livelier unlike this nincompoop.8. The ringtone needs to be better tuned because the phone likes to do a little 8-10 second jig before it starts playing the mp3 you have selected as your ring tone.9. The card scanner hardly works and the buttons for the walkman (touchscreen) are annoying.If by this time you are wondering if I'm easy to annoy, then well I am if I feel I am robbed of my money. This phone is clearly the worst disaster and misuse I have made of my dad's hard earned funds.10 ***BIG FLAW*** If you were to use the earphones on this phone, you will find that the output of the volume is about 35% as loud as the W810i. I simply cannot believe this nor accept it. This major flaw aggrevates me. I have tried different earphones and headphones but they have actually reduced the output volume and they have the nerve to call this a walkman phone. I used an N-Series phone the other day and I am not kidding but it was five times as loud with earphones. Terrible effects if I were to someday take this phone to gym as a stand-alone mp3 player.11. A free carry case was provided but it is of such cheap quality that i wouldn't use it. The manual was bad.12. Software for transferring files to the phone is bad if you are a media junkie like me with over 1TB of data. It will take hours to transfer 4gb worth of music to your phone even though individual transfer is high. The software is so buggy and slow though it promises a lot and is achingly confusing. I use good old Disc2phone.13. You cannot view a message and go to the next without pressing back and scrolling to the message. When you press back it completely refreshes the previous window and you have to scroll all the way to the message you were looking at again.The W960i has many other flaws but I have spoken about it's major features. It is not a good camera phone. It is not a good mp3 player, a no good one infact. I even tried to attach music systems to this with the 960 being the source and the sound reproduction was just so low, it was no good. You cannot even choose custom-equaliser settings.Conclusion - Do not buy this phone. The camera is ordinary, there is no torch, the touchscreen is buggy, inbox becomes slow with time, takes a long time to restart, decent voice quality, the walkman sounds nice when on loud speaker but abysmal when left to play on earphones. The keypad is ok, there is no mp4 or avi playback, there is a lag when opening any application which makes it simply unworthy of being given a shot. The battery life is a day's worth and talk time is around 3-4 hours at max. Sony Ericsson is not what it used to be. Definitely not worth buying.I haven't used the iphone or an n-series nokia or the viewty but if a phone has this many flaws despite the number of features, i just don't want it.
If you like listening to music get this Phone.  It is one of the loudest phones on the market with plenty to listen to with 8 gigs of built in Flash memory.  CD's load on to this phone really quick, less then 2 minutes to load a 80 minute CD in the highest of the MP3 options.
Ok I've been a Sony fan for about 5 years now, my previous phone was the Sony K850i and before that was the W800i. The decision to buy the W960 was torn between it and the Nokia N95 8gb.  I was definitely attracted to this phone since it was touchscreen and looked a lot more feminine than the N95. The impress 8gb which is comparable to the N95 helped in my decision to get it.  We wound up getting both, W960 for me and the N95 to my husband.Comparison:The music player is not as loud as the N95's and applications and screens take longer to load.The W960 is a bit easier to use than the N95, the N95 has a lot more applications and you need to go through more screens to change settings.Camera on the N95 hands down is the best 5.0MP vs. 3.2MP for the Sony.So why do I give the W960i you ask?Here's the thing...I am VERY careful with my phones..never drop them...have screen protectors and even the ugly silicone case.  4 months into using the W960 the screen was acting funny so I had to restart the phone every now and then to get it working right...after 3 weeks of that the touch sensing function of the screen completely died on me.  This phone relies on the screen for everything...dead screen= useless phone.  I've done some research and discovered that the W960 has a manufacturer defect that results in the screen sensor to get loose.  So I called the warranty number included in the box and explained my situation.  Sony told me that they will not fix it because the phone is not sold in the U.S.  I was quite upset about that because my W800i broke before and they fixed it and that phone was never released in the U.S either.  So in general I will have to say that I have wasted almost $[...] bucks on this phone...even being super careful with all my stuff it broke..whose to say how long this phone will last for people that are a little accident prone.If you are considering this phone over the Iphone or the N95 I will choose the later.
My previous phone was a W810i. That phone had a host of features and amazing interface, great camera, great earphones and an overall excellent value for money. I was sold to Sony Ericsson then and thought no Nokia for me again. I even picked this phone over the Iphone. I have always been the guy who goes for the mid-expensive phones because I lead a mid-expensive life and I know that doesn't make sense so I'll cut it but some of you might get the picture. But something changed and I wanted a phone which would knock dead the usual. I didn't go for the iphone because it's just too popular and everyone in the world is soon going to have it. After 40 days of poking around, I decided to go with my gut instinct and got this little fellow. The W960i stands out because noone has the phone. Not many people know about it and there are little or no advertising. The only place I could find sufficient info on this was C_net and U_tube.Features -1. Touch screen enabled device2. WLAN (upto 384 kbps)3. 8GB inbuilt hard drive4. Supposedly adequate RAM or memory for the phone5. Bundled earphones, various schemes for playlists such as moods, most played, highest rated,etc.6. Outstanding record/log of calls made in the last 50 days7. Unlimited number of messages8. Decent keypad with good text prediction/well tuned software9. PDF/Card Reader Scanner/Mediocre flashPros1. The touch screen doesn't take much time to get used to. It took me roughly five days to major it and now everytime I hold a non-touchscreen phone or cordless phone, I feel a little strange.2. Impressive call-logging data. The phone actually managed to maintain records of the last fifty days worth of entry. However it does get difficult to store phone numbers from new callers because that's when the 960i shows it's moodswings3. Very good sound when listening to it without earphones. Just aptly loud even though the interface is generally sluggish.4. There is 1 + 1 stylus that come with the phone. Don't play too much hockey with the stylus though. After a while your fingers will be just right to move around and you won't need the stylus except when you're using complex playlist options.5. trackid is an amazing feature. If you're in a pub and want to know what track is playing, trackid (software name) will record a 6 second sample and send it to the universal server and you will get to know the name of the track,artist and album within a minute (at the most) This is amazing and my friends think this is the sole reason I got the W960i and that is only because they find it so uber cool.6. Tactile feel and very good build quality though the touchscreen gets ruined without the not included plastic cover/sticker. Exceptionally good build quality.7. While the 3.2 megapixel camera is quite a disappointment, the zoom no longer ruins the photograph as much. Improved zoom.8. Wireless works even though the browser is corrupt and buggy.9. Big fonts when typing a message10. Ear volume is satisfactory and the phone catches signals well. It is also light to carry.11. trackid - This phone has trackid. If a song is playing around you and you wish to know the name, trackid allows you to record a sample, within a few seconds of the sample being sent, you will get the name of the song. It all takes much less than a minute.Cons1. Most lacklusture ensemble of menu, shortcuts and files2. Doesn't come with mp4 playback software which means no videos. It still records in gp3 and though the videos were of good quality, video playback software (divx) was very buggy on this phone and never worked for me.3. Where is the torch? I miss it.4. Battery life has dismal written all over it. Try talking 3hours and 20 mins on a single charge and you'll remember Jesus of Nazareth. I had to keep reducing the brightness to 19% and what not. 65% is default brightness.5. The general feel of the menu gets worse every month and it becomes more and more prone to mistakes. To navigate there is a little joystick like navigation button on the left which is annoying and cheap. I don't even use it enough because my friend said his broke for his w950i and his girlfriend's did the same. You can't help but feel cheated because the menu is nowhere near as good as the Iphone.6. The bundled earphones are same as the ones you get with the other walkman series and there is nothing different. This is annoying because SE are trying to save money and develop a standard and at the same time expect six hundred dollars for this phone7. The camera is inferior to W810i and there are simply too many shades and blindspots when viewed on my computer. I have to photoshop photographs which are shot in dark light and personally increase contrast. Don't even think of comparing the Nokia N95 camera to this. The iphone camera likes to make images look a little brighter and livelier unlike this nincompoop.8. The ringtone needs to be better tuned because the phone likes to do a little 8-10 second jig before it starts playing the mp3 you have selected as your ring tone.9. The card scanner hardly works and the buttons for the walkman (touchscreen) are annoying.If by this time you are wondering if I'm easy to annoy, then well I am if I feel I am robbed of my money. This phone is clearly the worst disaster and misuse I have made of my dad's hard earned funds.10 ***BIG FLAW*** If you were to use the earphones on this phone, you will find that the output of the volume is about 35% as loud as the W810i. I simply cannot believe this nor accept it. This major flaw aggrevates me. I have tried different earphones and headphones but they have actually reduced the output volume and they have the nerve to call this a walkman phone. I used an N-Series phone the other day and I am not kidding but it was five times as loud with earphones. Terrible effects if I were to someday take this phone to gym as a stand-alone mp3 player.11. A free carry case was provided but it is of such cheap quality that i wouldn't use it. The manual was bad.12. Software for transferring files to the phone is bad if you are a media junkie like me with over 1TB of data. It will take hours to transfer 4gb worth of music to your phone even though individual transfer is high. The software is so buggy and slow though it promises a lot and is achingly confusing. I use good old Disc2phone.13. You cannot view a message and go to the next without pressing back and scrolling to the message. When you press back it completely refreshes the previous window and you have to scroll all the way to the message you were looking at again.The W960i has many other flaws but I have spoken about it's major features. It is not a good camera phone. It is not a good mp3 player, a no good one infact.

The Sony Ericsson W960 is an excellent phone!  But even better it was shipped when it was promised.  I had to cancel two other company orders because they had placed the item on backorder - but had never notified me!
too expensive for the features it offers.  obsolete technology.  save your money and buy a better device.
I've had this phone since last December and so far it hasn't failed me. I don't know why others are having a hard time when this is the most basic and straightforward phone you'll ever get hold of.Talk time is ridiculously long (even on loudspeaker). On standby, it's ridiculously long times two. Come on, what cellular phone do you know of that can go for two and a half weeks without charge?Another nice thing about this phone is that there are filters for both incoming calls and text messages. Filtered calls don't ever bug you, filtered messages go to a screened messages menu. You don't have to open the messages to delete them (receiving a message doesn't deduct from your airtime.. opening it does). If you screened them and you know you don't want them, there's a delete all screened messages option.The airtime display poses a problem with the phone's time function, though. If it's off, you can see a clock on the lower right of the screen, but you can't see your remaining airtime. If it's on, you can't see the time on the screen. There's a clock screensaver you can set to pop out at a predetermined number of seconds/minutes... but that deactivates as soon as you press any key... and it's not lit. To me it's not much of a problem... my wristwatch keeps me informed of the time.What some people miss is that this phone can "tell" you the time. When it's unlocked, press and hold the * key and it will tell you that "The time is..."I'm not afraid of giving this one 5 stars. The purpose why I bought this phone is just so that I could call and send text messages, and vise versa. And it's been living up to its purpose. 10c/min to local numbers, and 5c/text message.... no gimmicks, no BS. I even send international messages and it's still 5c/message sent and received (opened).I'm not much of a technophile, but when I buy gadgets, I don't buy a single swiss-army knife gadget that has everything and the kitchen sink in it. Phones are phones, cameras are cameras, mp3 players are mp3 players, etc. For (just) a cellular phone (emphasis on phone), this one stands out for me.It's also durable. Great if you want to give your kid a phone but think that those other "neat" but fragile phones will just be a waste if your kid breaks them. Get them from WalMart for $19.99....
I dont know why people are having trouble with these phones. I have bought 4 until now in different stores. Never had any problems with them EXCEPT that I could'nt use this as an alarm clock. Tried setting alarms on all of these- they all have the same defect- the alarm goes off at any random time! Overall well worth the price. Never had any keypad trouble with any of these. Addressing the reviewer who was looking for the volume control - you need to hit the < or > buttons while in a call. To the person looking for the clock - the clock does show up on the screen - you have to go to the display settings and enable it. To the person claiming that these are not good for bad eyes - the fonts are quite HUGE on these and you cannot reduce them. Why would they be bad for the eyes?
The Nokia 1600 is a no frills cell phone. It is affordable and dependable with a long battery life, I can go about 2 weeks on a full charge. I live in Thailand and use this phone exclusively to make calls to the U.S. as well as domestic calling in and around Thailand. I have owned this phone for about a year now and have never had a problem with it. All of the functions on my phone work just fine. After reading other reviews it appears that some people might have bought defective phones from Wall Mart, not uncommon for any electronic device. A bad batch is a bad batch.I personally look for phones for one function and that is to make phone calls! I already own a 10 megapixal camera and an I-pod so I have no need to have these functions on my phone since these needless options are merely marketing gimmics of inferior quality that zap your phones battery life. My wife owns a "state of the art" Motorola razor with every gimmic imaginable and needs to charge her phone every 2-3 days, not because she over uses it, but the internal memory even when not in use consumes a lot of power thus depleting her battery. I have heard of some high quality camera, mp3 phones on the market (if you want to pay an exorbitant amount of money) but to my knowledge these phones are only available in Japan at this time of writing.It should also be addressed that some consumers who gave this phone a bad review had problems not with the phone but with there service provider (apples and oranges).If you are looking for a phone for the purpose of making phone calls the Nokia 1600 is not a bad choice.
This is an inexpensive phone, I paid $19.99 for it on sale, and it came with $30 worth of minutes with Net10.  Couldn't beat the deal, and I had read fairly good reviews about the call clarity and battery life which were my main concerns, so I bought it.  I am not UNhappy with it, but will probably upgrade when I see a good deal on a better phone.PRO:- Great reception- Great call clarity- GREAT battery life- Easy to useCON:- Keys are small- Keys are so sensitive I inadvertenly dial a call just by putting the phone in my purse. Must make it a habit to lock keys EVERY time I'm done, which is a pain.- Ear piece is actually at the top of the phone, so you have to hold it slightly below your ear to hear.  Works OK, just a little awkward to get used to.I do like Net10 service.  I am not a heavy phone user, perhaps 30 min/week, I do not want to 'surf' from my phone, or take pics.  So the Nokia 1600 with Net10 is perfect and cheap for a basic user like me.Their customer service leaves something to be desired, but only because it takes time to clearly understand each other and get the issue resolved.  They put you on hold to talk to their 'manager', repeat things, etc.  But they are courteous and DO get the job done ... just allow a little extra time and only call when you are feeling calm and patient.
This is a great little phone.  The deal is that it is only 10 cents a minute, no matter what.  If you roam, it's 10c.  Texting is half a minute each way, so messages are 5c to send and 5c to read. Much cheaper than even contract phones.  Service is great in my area, and there are no defects in the phone itself.  It has tons of great ringers built in, and all of them can be used for alarms.  The battery is very long lasting.  I don't use it that much, so I only have to charge it every 5 or 6 days.The bottom line is that this is an excellent phone for the money, and is highly recommended.
I bought this phone to replace an old "pay as you go" phone that had broken. This is a decent phone, it does all the necessary functions like calling and text messaging and all that stuff you may need to use. There's a couple of things that annoy me about this phone though. The first thing I noticed was that it doesn't show a clock on the main screen. I'm one of those people that uses their phone as a clock since I don't have a wristwatch. It is possible to set up the screen saver to show the time, however, so it's not too bad. The second thing that really gets to me is that it randomly lights up, even when I don't touch any buttons. If I'm near any speakers when it lights up (within 15 feet) the speakers emit an obnoxious feedback. This is really bad at night, when I'm sleeping and it lights up and my stereo goes nuts.Otherwise, it's a decent phone, it's a little big but I don't mind that much. There's definitely better phones you could get in the same price range.
I bought this phone for 19.99 on sale at Walmart.  Had to return it immediately because many keys (buttons) didn't work right.  Exchanged it for one of the same make and model.It was very carefully put together, charged, activated, and filled with minutes as per instructions.  I did nothing wrong, and the charger was plugged into a surge/spike protection strip which was working perfectly.  It was carried in a proper case, and protected at all times from static electricity, magnetism, etc.The first problem I noticed with this new phone was that the 'recieve calls' button didn't work.  Neither will any other button work for the purpose of answering a phone call, which means I cannot answer calls to this phone.  There is no other way to answer a call on this phone except by pushing the appropriate (working) button.  So, I have to wait for a while, and call the person back, because I can't answer the phone.Then maybe the 2nd day, the other buttons started malfunctioning.  You see, there are two numbers to each button on the keypad.  Push the top, and you get the top number.  Push the bottom, and you get the bottom number (refer to picture).  Well, the 7,8, and 9 buttons worked only intermittently, making it extremely difficult to make a call.  Then a few days later, they stopped working altogether.  This meant that I could usually only call people whose numbers had already been put into the phone.Summary: Purchased a nokia 1600 (net 10).  Keyboard was malfunctioning, so I exchanged it for another of the same make and model.  Keyboard malfunctioned on it as well, making the phone worthless.Don't waste your money.  You can get a much better meat and potatoes phone for just 10 bux more. I gave this phone one star, but that is because there isn't a 1/4 star option. Net 10 is a great deal, but the Nokia 1600 should be avoided, unless you're a masochist.
Did not even get to activate the phone (Nokia phone seemed to work fine).Tried to activate on the NET10 website...Serial Number Error.Called the 1-866 number to activate, was hung up on 4 times after entering information such as serial number etc..."A customer agent will assist you" then nothing. Called "tech support" complete JOKE! First line agent inept. Kept repeating back to me whatever I said then would just tell me that the phone was inactive...hello that is why we are on the phone here...to "activate" the phone. Trish the supervisor it took 3 attempts to reach, told me to fax all of my information including the phone papers and my receipt from purchase...U have got to be kidding! 24-48 hours for a response and I haven't even activated a phone? Not a chance. Lucky for me Wal Mart graciously gave all my money back. I will stick with Verizon, they have spoiled me with their AWESOME customer service.
I purchased 1000 minutes for my phone on July 11.  I have called them 10 times exactly, each time it was escalated and repeated to me the phone would be active within 24 to 48 minutes.  Each time they said they would call me.  No call.  Issue still not resolved and today is July 21, 2008.  2 people called me after I told them repeatedly I would be in on weekend to call on Monday.  I called the center back and was told they have no report that anyone called me.  It will be *resolved* within 24 to 48 hours.  Have filed FCC and BBB complaints.  Avoid this phone and telephone service.  Avoid it all costs!
My Net10 Nokia 1600 was unable to receive text messages from a Sprint Palm Centro.  I contacted Net10 tech support, who insisted that the problem was on Sprint's end.  Net10 tech support couldn't understand that a one-way conversation via text messaging isn't very useful, whether it's Sprint's problem or not.  (I have never had any problems sending messages from the Centro to any other phone.)  I was hoping Net10 would at least try to figure out what was wrong.  Maybe it was the admittedly old 1600; maybe it was network incompatibility; maybe it was Sprint's fault.  I'll never know because tech support simply refused to help me, saying that my messaging was "working properly."
My parents have this phone with another pay as you go provider, and both my brother and I have spent hours searching for the volume control, to no avail. This phone is a piece of junk. My parents are hard of hearing, and have trouble with this phone. I am not, and I can barely hear anyone on the other end. I goggled the manual, and it appears, there is NO volume control. Order another phone with your service.
I have this phone with a different service, so I'm reviewing the phone itself, not the service.The pros:* The phone is a good size, small enough to comfortably fit in your pocket, but large enough to see what you're doing with it.* Battery life is good - I've had it last through an hour-long phone call then a few hours of instant messaging.* It's sturdy - after almost two years or abuse, there is not a scratch or a crack on it.The cons:* The volume does not go up high enough.  I have good hearing, but I cannot hear the ringer on maximum volume unless I am somewhere fairly quiet. I also frequently cannot hear what people are saying to me during phone calls. The volume does not adjust based on external noise levels.* It doesn't have bluetooth. (I don't know why Amazon lists bluetooth headsets as accessories.)* It doesn't have a place to enter physical addresses or birthdays for your contacts.* Finally, LG has an issue where buttons get "stuck" in one position. (For example, if you were pushing the left arrow it will sometimes continue going left after you stop pressing the button.) I do not think it is a physical issue with the buttons, but maybe an electrical or software issue.  I have had this problem with this phone and also with a LG television.  It doesn't happen very often, mostly when playing games.Overall, I would say that this is a tolerable phone, but not one that I would recommend, due to the low volume.  If you live/work in a very quiet area, have good hearing, and simply want a sturdy phone with a good battery, this may work for you.
Okay, first off, I'll talk about the phone.First, it's a pretty good entry level flip phone. The quad-GSM does come in handy, so you can get service just about anywhere. The pictures are okay, and the screen could be a little bigger. And real-tones are a nice touch also. However, Tracfone is notorious for locking features. The web-browser will only work on their website, and it will still charge you if you try to get to another site. You cannot get different ringtones unless you email yourself a MIDI ringtone, or get the tones from their site. And the reception is great, but note it will either run on AT&T;'s network, or T-Mobile's network; Tracfone doesn't have a network of it's own.Now to customer service. It flat out SUCKS. I recently upgraded my phone to the new Motorola w376 with Bluetooth, I found out they disabled all the good features on this phone. Anyway, I tried to transfer my number and minutes over to the new phone over the website. They said it would 24-48 hours, and it's been about a week now. I called CS, they said the reason the number porting was taking so long was because one phone was a GSM phone while the other was CDMA. Total BS, both phones run off of GSM; it just sounds like they don't know what they're doing.Overall, if you can handle the CS, by all means get a Tracfone. However, if that's one of the big selling points for you, stay away from Tracfone.
I've used TracFone since 2003 when I was pregnant with my first child. I've never had any problems with their service and even got clear signal on vacation 400 miles away! It has been a wonderful service for us and very inexpensive since we mostly use it for emergencies or short phone conversations.***You can buy bundles of minutes (which must be used within a set time limit of 90 to 365 days) from the Tracfone web site on your home PC or directly from your phone's web browser.***The above sentence is NOT true. There are no limits on your minutes only your airtime. Every 90 days I buy a 90 minute card for about $20 and all of my previous minutes roll over with it. I've even switched phones and they will swap your airtime & minutes from one phone to another.I've found the service very easy and convenient. The few times I've had to call customer service (to switch to a new phone) they have always been thorough, informative & courtious.I have no plans to switch service from TracFone anytime in the near future and am very pleased with their service & products.
LG TracFone Prepaid Cell Phone - 225The LG-225 is a compact flip phone with features aplenty.  I purchased this prepaid model with Tracfone's "Ultimate Bundle" - a year of service, a 400 minute airtime card and the well-designed phone unit that includes double minutes for the life of the phone, a camera, programmable ringtones and much more.A handy feature is the clock and caller id that shows through the top of the case without having to open to flip top, and visible minutes remaining on the service.A great little phone for limited or emergency use.
Excellent phone for a person that uses a phone for emergency purposes or doesn't spend hours talking hours about nothing. The phone itself has excellent battery life, very good coverage in the area I live in, good sound quality, and the small outside screen is a nice feature. I deducted one star because the ring tones are awful in my opinion. However, in all fairness it is possible to download better ringtones from the Tracfone website but, I'm too cheap to do so.  Overall the LG225 phone and Tracfone is a great product for those people wanting an inexpensive cell phone. I have owned the phone for about 8 months.
Small, clear video, great audio quality. Phone doubles all Tracfone purchased minutes and bonus minutes will be added to that (i.e. purchase a one year 400 minutes card with a 200 minutes promotional code, and you'll have 1000 minutes to use within one year - longer if additional time/minutes are purchased). Easy to add phone book - can store multiple phone numbers under one contact name. Easy to take pictures, but have to use the web to email the pictures to store on your own computer - no direct connect to a computer. Battery was properly charged and drained several times, but even in standby drains fast, only having 2-3 days standby time. My replaced Kyocera (provided free by Verizon) provided strong standby power for more than a week; You have to use a Tracfone phone with Tracfone. Activate phone with Tracfone online and receive 20 initial minutes. My minutes were not applied automatically, as expected when  activating online, but I had to call tech support. Tech support was called several times, for both pre-sale and after purchase support; there was never a wait time and the personnel were excellent. I had 1st ordered the phone direct from Tracfone and then found that Amazon gave a better price. I called Tracfone to cancel the order, and although it had shipped, they gave full credit - all I had to do was refuse the phone when delivered by FedEx. Once upon a time I made good use of my Verizon plan, but for a long time had little and seldom need for monthly use. For several years I paid Verizon $30 a month for a few minutes used over a year's time, and incurred roaming charges. With Tracfone, I purchase minutes per year (1000 for $99), no roaming charges, and none of those phone charge taxes that can increase your bill 20% or more. An assortment of cards for various minutes/time are available. Tracfone buys minutes from all the major cell phone networks like Alltel, Verizon, AT&T; and T-Mobile, so I expect to be able to use my card while on vacation in Anchorage without incurring roaming charges. This is a single rate phone: This means that roaming, long distance, and even International Long distance is the same rate, one unit per minute. Tracfone seamlessly  managed the cancellation of my Verizon plan and retention of my cell phone number. The phone is full featured - free caller id, mailbox, minutes available. I'm only disappointed with the short battery life. As I don't use the phone frequently, I only know that that standby time is short, and do not have experience on how long the battery performs during talk time. The phone advertises talk time over 2.5 hours and standby time up to 250 hours. I need to check the warranty for battery replacement. You'll find more information about TracFone at [...]
I also purchased the 'Ultimate Bundle'. Awesome deal - except the charger.I was really SAD to see the old motorolla type of charger on it: you push a button on each side of the charging plug, insert the plug into your phone where it is connected and charges by 2 tiny metal pieces.Problem: I've had 2 other phones with this type of plug.BOTH began to malfunction and were ultimately useless because of the charger. Apparently the 'connection' would deteriorate over time, meaing you would need to 'jiggle the plug' to get it connected, until in the end the connection/charging failed to function at all.-----------------------------sigh-----------------------------I decided to keep the phone, HOPE & PRAY the charger doesn't give out on it... and wait for a charger to come along that will charge the batteries OUTSIDE of the phone itself.Be Blessed! Buy one. Give one away. :)
I bought one of these Tracfone packages a couple years ago because I wanted a cell phone in the car when driving in case I ran into any problems.  I did not previously use a cell phone and I researched what was the best-bang-for-the-buck for me and my usage.  So I paid a few bucks for the LG200 DMFL phone bundle w/charge, car charger and case.  For I got a "120 minute" card which upon activating becomes 240 minutes and I found a 60 minute bonus code on the internet so for under 50 bucks I had a cell phone and 300 minutes to burn.  I spend about 10 cents per minute for air time and thats good for the USA.  Each month your unused minutes rollover so I don't lose any.  Now every 3 months you have to buy new mintes in order for the phone to stay active and for your minutes to rollover.  What I love about the phone is no monthly bills, no extra charges, no gouging, unused mintes rollover and you pay for exactly what you use.I only use it for a phone and don't text or anything else.  After using it for a few months I dumped my landline phone because I didn't see the need to blow the money each year on it when the tracfone works just fine for my usage.  Now I am not a heavy talker so I may only use 60 or 100 minutes per month so on an average month I am paying 8 bucks a month for the cell phone.  One month I think I talked about 120 minutes and it cost me 12 bucks for that month.  The major providers are not even in the ballpark. A plan with 400 minutes I just don't need.  Most of my friends spend alotta bucks a month for their cell bills and I'm very happy at 8 bucks or so.This is a very inexpensive phone but not everyone is going to like it.  The volume is pretty low and the speakphone is quite low too.  I don't like the old Motorola charger plug.  It functions as a basic cell phone which for me was all I needed.  Before you buy this cell or Tracfone you should first consider what your usage needs are.If you need 400 or more minutes per month or need mobile internet this is not the phone for you.  But if you want inexpensive basic cell phone for calling and receiving capability, check it out.  The math is pretty simple.  Also, Tracfone has been strong and clear everywhere I have been, they don't own the towers they lease time off the majors.
The standard shipping was over 10 days but arrived intact. The phone is great. The features on the phone are easy to use. Set up was a little dicey. I had to call the Tracfone customer service, but this was very easy.
This is a review of Tracfone's service, not this particular phone.  I purchased a new Tracfone in 2007 and used it for months no problem, adding minutes and time via their web site whenever I needed them. That same year, when my family and I were vacationing in Florida, my daughter was burned in an accident and spent three weeks in a Florida hospital. All of the calls I had to make during this time ate up my minutes (roaming), even though I still had tons of airtime left before my next "due date." I went online to buy more minutes, but instead of adding them, somehow the code I entered cancelled my phone number. I called customer service, and was put on hold for at least 10-20 minutes each time while I was shifted from "supervisor" to "supervisor," each of whom offered a different explanation for my problem. All of the explanations were wrong: I was told I had let my airtime expire (nope). I was told I had requested a new phone number online (nope). I was told that my type of phone had never been registered with Tracfone (nope). I was told that my phone was too old to use with Tracfone, and that they had tried to contact me months before to get me to buy a new phone (nope). I told each "supervisor" that I was in an emergency situation with my daughter, and that I needed my phone service restored immediately, but all they would do was offer fictitious reasons that the malfunction was my fault. NO ONE HELPED ME. When I said that if they wouldn't help me, they needed to refund my money, they told me they couldn't give refunds on prepaid minutes. Finally, after over an hour of this nonsense, I lost it and screamed at the call center person. I demanded that they give me the phone number of their headquarters. Their response? They gave me the exact same number of the call center I was already dealing with! As soon as we were settled back in Maryland, I Googled Tracfone to find an address for their headquarters and sent a letter detailing everything that had happened. I also copied the body of the letter into an email and sent it to their customer service contact online. For over a month, I heard nothing. Then I got an email from customer service, asking if anyone had contacted me yet. I replied that they had not. I never heard from them again. THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS: NEVER, NEVER USE TRACFONE! IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU!!!!  Read online comments--there are hundreds of Tracfone customers out there who have had horrible experiences with the service!Damage Resulting:$85--never refunded. An hour plus on the phone trying to resolve the situation, another hour spent writing letters and emails that got ignored. Frustration levels through the roof with a company that could have cared less.
I would have given this no stars if Amazon provided that option! I can't say enough bad things about Tracfone and its terrible customer service. I purchased a Tracfone online and tried to carry over my old cell number. It was a nightmare; the phone itself was ok, but activation was impossible. I can't even remember how many hours I spent on hold to India trying to work things out (note: the customer service reps did their best despite language issues, clearly they are not equipped to solve customer problems and are probably directed to just string customers along or inspire them to give up). After a month, I gave up, lost my old cell number, and had no phone for weeks. I had to work hard to get a refund, they really make it impossible for you if you have any problems. Spend a few more bucks and get one of the other pay as you go plans, Tracfone is not worth the headache.
The connection is good only at home. 20 miles away from home, you get connection only by LUCK. Do NOT depend on it.To add airtime from Tracfone is extremely painful:If add it from their website (most of time it ends up ERROR and ask you to call the service representative), the webpage asks a lot of unnecessary information, then sends hundreds digits you have to key in to your cell phone.If add it thru calling their service representative, the representative will try to STEAL YOUR IDENTITY by ask you all unrelated information. Besides credit card and your cell phone ID, they ask:* Name* Address* Other cell phone numbers* Social Security Number!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Birthday?????????????????If you refuse to answer the question, they will argue that 'Our System Requires It'. Who cares about their system? I do care about my own IDENTITY SAFETY.However, if you still want to jump into the trap, there is a way to beat their stealing:*****  Besides credit number and you cell phone ID, give them all FAKE information.  ****I tried the strategy, and it works
I'm not really a fan of cell phones because of the silly and discourteous ways they're used by so many. But there are times they come in handy, even for me.I make three or four business trips a year, plus an out-of-town vacation or two, and the cell phone is really a major convenience on those occasions. But the absence of one has never bothered me enough to make me commit to an expensive phone, much less a long-term contract.I noticed some prepaid phones at a supermarket a few months ago, and did a little research. I was able to get the Aloha for $19.99, bought a $20 card for Virgin Mobile service, and was up and running for only $40.So far, I've used the phone in Cleveland, Denver and Phoenix with good results. No dropped calls, and pretty good call quality. The phone is easy enough to use that you won't forget how if you put it away for a few days, and the storage of contacts, plus the scheduler make the phone worth the money and then some.If you're a cell phone buff, or want to impress your friends, this isn't the phone for you. No camera or outside display. Volume could be a little louder, and you've got to position the phone just right for best results. But at this price, it's a great phone for the light user, or as a temporary phone, or for someone who does not have good credit or prefers not to give out a credit card number.If you fall into these categories, the Aloha is an excellent choice.
After reading the reviews, I was wary, but I'd already bought the phone.  So when I got it I instead tested it to see if it did what one reviewer said.  The phone DID NOT stay on after I closed it.  It cut the call off just like it should.  I don't know what that person did to his/her phone, but mine works perfectly.
I am amazed that people slam this phone.  I purchased one for $14.99 at a national chain store.  What an amazing piece of technology for a mere 15 dollars. It's not perfect, but come on, if you want perfection go spend a couple of hundred dollars.  Or, go and commit to a two year contract before you have even tried the service. My hat is off to Sir Branson and Virgin Mobile.  I don't want a contract.  I don't use the phone much but I like having it available for the occassional use.  What a great convenience at an affordable price.  Virgin Mobile and the LG Aloha have delivered in spades.
This is a great little phone for people who are not addicted to their cell phone.  In other words, if I want to call someone, it works.  If someone wants to call me, it works. The occasional text message, no problem.  Good display, decent keypad.  Easy to understand, I mean, it's a phone for criminy sakes.  The price, fantastic.  I paid 15 bucks for it, and it works EXACTLY as advertised. I love Virgin Mobile!  No BS, no tricks, no hidden fees, just great service at a very fair price.  Well done.
I love my phone!!! It has everything I need and it's small so for me it's perfect! I was even able to download a ringtone from my favorite band(30STM)And at this price it's a steal!!!All you have to do is purchase a $20 topup card every 3 months and its so easy to add more airtime.
I am a person who is tired of expensive contract phones.  I tried Virgin Mobile as I heard that they have the best prepaid phones on the market.  I got the Aloha on sale for $10.00.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It has great call quality.  It's very simple to use, especially for texting.  it doesn't have alot of bells & whistles, but it's a great basic phone.  It has 2 calculators.  i would recommend it for teenagers and for budget-conscious adults.  You can check your balance with the press of a button.  the only thing I wish they would improve on it, is the volume.  it could be a little louder.  For a mobile phone that costs under $20.oo, it's terrific.  Also a great phone for someone who wants a spare, back-up phone.
THIS PHONE WORKS GOOD I HAD NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER WITH IT . ITS GOT GOOD SINGLE STRENGH AND CLEAR RECEPTION. IT IS A GOOD PHONE FOR THE PRICE!
What a waste of money! One came out of the box and Virgin Mobile said it hadn't been scanned/unlocked and so we couldn't activate it. I was past 30 days so I couldn't return either. Do Not Buy! The ones we got to work had terrible reception and the minutes usage on the cards is highly misrepresented. Never Again!
No problems at all with either the prepaid component or the cellphone itself. It's great to have a full QUERTY keyboard to make texting simple and fast.
PAY as you go phone review...Virginmobile is trying to get your money! be careful! you get a 1000 minutes card for 50$ thinking that you will have these minutes by entering the pin number but NOOOO! there is another step you need to follow. you have to pick voice minute package which is not among any of the instructions. if you do not pick that plan, you are paying 20 cents a minute. You call them and they do NOTHING about it. The customer service people are extremely rude and they even hang up on me! they also threaten you by saying that your call is monitored?!?! Never ever use their services for especially pay as you go phones... I would give them 0 or negative starts if I could...
The phone is ok simple just what I expected, what really disapointed me was that from what I understood the cost was a total of $16.92 of airtime service which I never received either through amazon or virgin mobile, amazon was giving the phone for "free" and the fee would be towards airtime but like I said I have yet to receive $16.99 worth or airtime...maybe Im wrong.
Bought it couple weeks ago. Easy to use, simple menu can be change for individual taste. Easy to connect to PC and install games and applications. The only problem- doesn't play simbian applications only java, so beware.Had some problems with contact list when I got it, but it updated itself through PC and fixed the problem itself, which was nice.Fell once, still works not a scratch. So far I am happy with it.
I was the last of my friends to move up to any high tech phone.  My last phone was monochrome and had no camera.  Then I was told I qualified for an upgrade that included the Q.It has been an incredible investment and well worth the money.  I use it for everything.  I search the Internet, check e-mail, listen to music and watch movies.  It is infinitely customizable.  While my friends download stupid ring-tones, I downloaded some mobile software that allowed me to use Microsoft Office files on it.  I word process, fill out spreadsheets and craft presentations. It is a great mobile tool that augments my computer.  That is really what it has become, a mobile computer.I wish it offered Wi-Fi, as well as some other functions, but mine is the first generation.  For someone who still doesn't understand the depth of possibilities a mobile device like the Q offers, this is a great starting platform.  It has revolutionized the way I do business.  When it comes time to upgrade my phone again, I will be looking for that device that reaches the next level in smartphone technology with a price that doesn't break my budget.  It will be hard to top my Q.
A GREAT CELL PHONE BUT HERE IN THE PHILIPPINES THE CELL PROVIDERS ARE NOT UP TO THE CELL COMPANY STANDARDS IN THE STATES AND THE PHONES CAPABILITIES ARE LIMITED.  I CAN USE IT AS A BASIC CELL PHONE BUT CANNOT USE THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES THAT THE PHONE HAS.  I WILL WAIT UNTIL THE STANDARDS HERE CATCH UP!!!  STILL A GREAT TOOL!!!
I've had this phone for a while now and have been very pleased.  It seems to be much more durable than the two Moto Razr's I had previously.  I like the improved alarms.  I have my M-F alarm which lets me sleep in on weekends, reminders for my weekly and monthly appointments, and more.  My favorite feature is being able to use any music file as a ring tone or alarm.  I was unable to do this with both the Moto Razr's I had.  I can transfer any of my MP3s to my phone over USB.  The 1 GB storage is more than enough for me, but you can easily add more with the MicroSD card.  This phone has actually replaced my iPod now!  It doesn't have GPS and I can't watch TV, but I also didn't want to spend the extra money for the iPhone.  I don't see any reason not to recommend this phone to anyone, it is very durable (I'm an avid rock climber) and its battery lasts about a week per charge depending on use (I talk about 3k minutes per month).  I'm very satisfied with my Nokia Xpress Music.
The Nokia 5310, aka "The Music Xpress", is one nifty little phone! Sure, it's no iPhone, but if you want something that got just about as many bells and whistles for a little less money, you want this phone.The 5130 is available in purple, orange, red and blue (I own the purple). It's very thin and small, but fits easily in the palm of your hand and doesn't give the impression it's going to fall apart if you look at it cross-eyed.The buttons are raised up just a bit. The display is bright and vibrant. If you have T-Mobile service with this phone, you'll find it can handle the My Favorites plan just fine, with nice little icons and customizable options fo each person.The phone has several nifty features, including a 2 megapixel camera that takes good-to-very-good quality pictures. It can also function as a video camera, doing both sound and image. There's no flash or self-portrait mirror, but you can make do. The screen acts as a view finder, of course. There's also four different levels of zoom and several different video effects (like black and white, negative, false color, etc). There's a nifty little mini-USB port you can use to move your files to a computer (assuming you have a cable. Thankfully the phone comes with one).There's also the usual selection of programs, like a calculator, alarm clock, organizer, etc. The system also comes with a few game demos, none of which are particularly memorable.Ah, but you want to know about the biggie, right? You want to know all about the music capability!Well, this phone doesn't disapoint. There's external music controls and an external volume control. You can turn it up loud enough to annoy the people next door if you really try. There's also a headphone jack that, thankfully, allows for normal headphones to be used. I have a neat little set I got on a Delta flight, and they work just fine.When I bought the phone it came with the USB cable I mentioned earlier, as well as a stereo hands-free headset with a detachable mic, and, joy of joys, a 1 gigabyte memory card! That's a really nice thing to have! I've got quite a bit of music on mine and it isn't even close to being filled. Tiny card, too. About the size of a fingernail.Overall there's no real reason not to recommend this phone. It's sleek and stylish, has a great price point, comes with plenty of goodies and plays music very, very well. It's worth every penny I paid for it, and that's not something I can often say!
I strongly advise you guys not to buy this phone without warranty! Since i got this phone my battery was getting worse and worse utill it wouldnt hold power for even whole day! I never had problems with cell phones so i thought warranty is no big deal but it is. I paid almost $300 for garbage even new battery didnt help.As for the phone alone, nokia made sweet I loved it, its worth the money but be very careful!
its very good, but it has one problem, is not good with the signal service
I like everything in this phone except the amount of internal memory, only 25 MB.  The extra 8 GB is good for music, media files, etc.I use this phone primarily for work because we push email, calendar, contacts from work email to the phone via a mobile solution.  The problem is that the phone has only 25 MB of primary storage so I cannot keep more than 3 days of email on the phone; otherwise memory will be low and you can't do anything with it when it runs out of primary storage.If you are buying this phone for entertainment uses, it is great choice.  If you are buying it for professional related use such as work email, it is not due to the 25 MB of primary storage.  You need to ge a phone with at least 64 - 128 MB of primary storage in order to store some decent amount of email on your phone.
Got immediately going with this phone.. WiFi capability is awesome.. easy setup.. quick connection...pop3 email support is easy to configure.. still loading up the 8GB memory with songs and softwares.. its like having a hand held computer... bought this phone over blackberry Pearl and a hacked-iphone. Totally worth it.. Graphics are too good and 3-D sound quality is awesome. There is some lag in starting applications (eg: Yahoo Go!) but it is not significant given the size of certain applications. Fun to play Fifa on it... visit n81 blogs for more... dont pay extra for brown color.. it is hardly visible.. the black face plate is stunning...battery life is good too.. needs charging after 3-4 days of use...
I was amazed when I learned that I could buy this jewel at such a low price! So I immediately ordered it, and I was very satisfied at how fast it got here. The phone itself is amazing: the wifi is a huge plus, and the Symbian operating system is something that I wouldn't be able to live without.A few pros:- WIFI!!- quad-band, so you can basically use it anywhere in the world (needs SIM card)- amazing set of features for a low price- great battery life - up to 3 days if I talk for approximately an hour, use the wifi a little bit and play the game boy advance emulator for a couple of hours.- very cool design- nicely built, the sliding mechanism seems solid- the music quality - simply extraordinary!! (this should have been the first one in the list, the music part of this phone is incredible. The speakers are very loud for a handheld device)- the hands-free is really good- 8GB of memory. Why would you ever need more?!- the screen is perfect, very big and good enough even for watching videos on it. Web pages are easily read, even if there is a lot of text.- the gaming aspect - it's very convenient to have those gaming buttons on top of the screen. They are comfortable and do not seem prone to damage.- The operating system - you can install anything you want on this phone! To list a few, you can have Google maps, Youtube, Skype, and a whole bunch of emulators (Game boy, Game boy advance, NES, SNES... whatever you can think of :)- the SIP option - you can call for free over a WLAN network. I am listing this one here because it is a big plus, although you will also find it in "cons" because I could not set it up.- the speed at which it does everything. You don't have to wait for anything, you simply click on it and it opens. I previously had a Symbian 7 phone, and it was painfully slow compared to this one.- the ability to synchronize all your contacts and text messages, etc, from your old phone to this one. There is a pre-installed app on the phone that does it all for you, in a flash.- the second camera for video calls, although I don't know when I'll actually get to use that one.- the N-gage games! How could I forget this one :) They are pretty good, and there's a whole bunch of new games coming up, so if you are a gamer you will enjoy that.Cons:- I had trouble synchronizing my Windows Media Player playlists with the phone. Either I could put my songs in a folder on the memory card, but without transferring the playlist file (so I only had a huge number of songs, but not arranged in any order), or I would have the playlist file, but all the songs would go directly into the root of the memory card, which would probably slow down the phone eventually.- the buttons are not very convenient for typing text (compared to my old 6600); also, I keep pressing the "play" button accidentally, which is annoying because it starts to play music loud all of a sudden and startles everyone around.- the camera is quite bad. This is not a problem for me, since I don't use it anyway, but if you want a nice camera then do not buy this phone. It really takes crappy pictures, with bad colours (kind of greenish), and quite flaky. I even feel like the front camera for video calls takes better pictures, even though the one on the back has a higher resolution. The flash is useless, too. The videos it makes are pretty good though, with a nice framerate and not choppy at all.- as I already mentioned, I could not set up the internet calling. It always says "registration failed", while everything works fine on my PC. However, you need to have a wifi network in range to be able to use SIP, so it's not useful for everyone - so probably it won't matter to you that much. It is nice to use it at home or in the office - you could save quite a lot of money by calling over the net.
This is a nice product, a very nice phone (or should I say "very nice ALL-IN-ONE PHONE"?), I gotta tell you, it worth every penny, first days I was a little upset because I didn't get into it, but now... seems to be a nice solution for a lot of things, what I have installed in my AIO PHONE:1. Skype2. MSN3. Office Viewer4. Lots of games (metal gear solid acid for mobiles, fifa, etc)5. Internet using WiFi corporate network (you can specify the type of encryption, open/shared, IPV4 y IPV6, sutnet, gateways and DNSs)6. Yahoo Chat7. Google Talk8. Bluetooth connectivity is really awesome9. Opera Mini and the built-in brower (both are good)10. PDF Reader (this is nice if you need to open/read something while you're traveling)11. You can synchronize it with Windows Media Player what is nice too, because is easy to find WMP already installed in your computer (against the ipod/iphone-itunes, you have to download it and is a little tricky)12. ETC.Of course, not everything is PINK, and has some cons:1. Is just a bit bigger and heavier than the w810, but if you think you're getting WiFi, you forget that.2. I guess... is easier to use a sony ericsson, but every feature included in the N81 worth to learn something new.3. The storage (8gb) is built-in, and it has not any slot to expand the capacity, but again, I guess 8gb is enough space for applications, games and music.4. Since I'm an IT guy, I like to keep my gadgets UP-TO-DATE, but the Software updater is not available for Windows Vista, so, I gotta wait  the release, of course, it does not means the phone does not work, but sometimes when you update your software, some enhancements in performance and new features are included, the updater is only supported by Windows XP.5. The realplayer is the player included with the phone, and only plays mp4 and 3gp, the resolution on the screen is nice, but, sometimes, when you're trying to watch videos from YouTube.com (yes, you can watch streaming video too) the player get fuzzy... and you should close and open again the video in order to get a better display.That's my experience with the N81 8GB, I hope it will be useful for you. BR
I wanted an all-in-one gadget and after researching a bit this one looked like the best price to feature ratio.It's probably not as cool as an iPhone, but I have a personal bias against Apple products and I hate being tied down to a long contract with AT&T; with an expensive data plan. The unlocked phone was the best option for me.The WiFi connection is huge for me. I'm able to get away without a data plan from my provider and just leech off WiFi hotspots.The MP3 player is awesome, Camera is adequate, web browser is fast (although navigating full web pages can be a hassle- full pages don't scale down very well.- .mobi sites are fine.)One frustration I found was the video playback. I found out that it only comes with the ability to play videos in Real Player format out of the box- which is terrible. Luckily I soon discovered you can download a mobile version of the Divx player from Divx and now it will play .avi files fine so you can rip and encode movies from DVD for it fairly easily.Also, text input via the phone keypad is tedious. If you're doing anything like blogging or email you may want to get a bluetooth keyboard. I have an ThinkOutside Stowaway that works great.Another plus is the availability of applications for the Symbian s60 OS.Overall it's a very good quality full featured phone.
I have just bought my N81 GB a feew weeks ago and I really have to say it has exceded my expectations. What a wonderfull gadget!Every single minute I'm learning more how to exploit it the most.From the design to the look and feel of the interface. Everything is almost perfect.Before buying this product I was evaluating other possibilities, as an HTC Touch. But the requirement of having to use stylus to type SMS decided me to go for this one. The overall build is quite robust, considering it is a device that needs to be handled appropiately.Will resume some CONS and PROS:CONS (most of them S60 related)-Music Player always running on background (since it is always sensing the multimedia keys - can be solved by using an external task manager app for Symbian)-Alarm Snooze time: the default is 5 minutes and was not able to find how to change it. Nokia 6131 on the other hand has this feature)Sure, you can get another Alarm application for Symbian.-Music Files: When you upload them, no matter what specific folders you enter them, Music PLayer will show the entire list (this would include MP3 ringtones and funny sounds you might have uploaded!), unless you create specific Playlists or rely on the ID3 MP3 tags.-Contacts Syncronization: Default Nokia PC Suite for N-Series will only syncronize with any contact management application in place (Outlook / Outlook express / etc) but will not give the chance to use a Nokia one. This can be solved anyway by using the standard Nokia PC Suite.PROS:-Design-Features-Cost/Benefit ratio-Gaming Platform-Sound quality (built in stereo speakers)-OS (Symbian) and all related Custom Apps-Divx Playing-Most of the CONS can be overcameIn conclusion, this little gadget has everything a phone with the same characteristics should have and even more, with a great potential of expansion due to the Operative System type. I really recommend it.I suggest for a Nice review (which helped me a lot) to take a look at the Nokia N81 8GB Review by Nokiaduck on Youtube.
I bought this phone for one reason to replace my damaged Nokia 6682. So far i'm very pleased with the phone. Everything works well. There are a couple of things that i don't like about it though. The back of the phone once opened didn't fit back perfectly and therefore feels inferior. The navi wheel doesn't work with alot of function and when it use sometimes gets in the way. I'll say its a very good phone for the price and the features it have. it multitasks well. not locking at all so far. camera could be better thought.
The phone looks cool but the back cover of the phone keeps popping out on one side, with the battery in. It is annoying when dialing out or punching digits.  Notified Amazon for return and replacement; looks like Amazon is out of stock with the cocoa-brown model and promise to ship me a replacement in a MONTH!!!!!!! In the meantime, they had the UPS guys show up and ask for the item to be shipped back.. Thie is the first defective supply I have received from Amazon. If, as others have stated, the item is not covered by US warranty, Amazon may be making false claims that are not backed up by facts on the ground.  Need to investigate further and will keep you posted.
This is a great phone.  I don't regret its purchase.  Battery is better than I've expected, it lasts for two days and I'm using the phone practically nonstop.  Recharging takes about hour and a half which is also a plesant surprise.  This is a great phone for its price.
Very nice phone.As a Mac user, I was almost buying Iphone. But I'm a little bit clumsy too, so I opted for this model that looks like it's a little more resistent to clumsyness.I realy can't say about Iphone because I don't have one. Until now, N81 resisted some falls to the ground.One more thing. For Mac users, you can Isync just by dowloading a driver that you will find at nseries website in the workshop area.
I got this phone in April 2008, after using a Palm TX and a IR Nokia phone. I wanted to unify the two items in one single device, but if you read my review, you will find why is that I did not stay with Palm OS.One thing to say also is that I bought it for business although it is not advertised as that, I took the chance and I am very happy with it.Pros:There are many features I would like to review but among my favorites are:- Outstanding battery life even when you connect to the internet via WiFi- 8GB internal HDD- Easy to open keys, lock-unlock button at the top as well.- Screen and Menus completely customizable, so you can decide if you want the calendar in the root menu or in a Agenda folder, for instance.- The center key has 4 quick access ways, so left takes you to Messages, right takes you to Calendar, up takes you to Modes like Silence -meeting etc., down takes you to Clock -international times and alarms.- WiFi is great and fairly easy to set-up.- Bluetooth is great, I can synchronize my calendar and contacts, anniversaries, tasks, meetings, with Microsoft Outlook, and share info with friends, also I use a Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset, which works great with.- Synchronyzing with the usb cable allows you to back up your pictures, music, videos- You can use the phone as an external HDD to carry info, PowerPoint presentations, etc.- You can have your POP3 mail, save as many as you want, decide whether you keep them in the "phone" memory or the HardDrive memory.- You can open attachments with the included QuickOffice and also PDF files.- You media manager is great, photos in albums, music playlists and you don't need special software like itunes to manipulate them, (have you tried to retrieve your music from and IPOD to your computer? You can't)Cons- Buttons to music in the front are to tight and hard to manipulate.- It can be tricky to save some access points in WiFi, but you can learn how configure them.- Bad quality camera, not because it has 2megapixels, but because they are 2mp terrible sensor, but not important to me.- It is not as slim as other phones, but non of them with internal 8GB HDD- Gizmo, my wife and I have same phone, we tried to configure the VoIP and it seems that if we are under the same IP- (same house connection) it rejects one of the users, which is awkward since Skype does not give you this issue.- Not compatible with Skype yet (coming soon they say)Overall, the Cons I have had so far are livable with, but the Pros are great and easy to use. It makes my calendar activities easy to keep up with, keeps me in touch via email and I can use it as an external HDD.
I bought this phone for less than the current price, but i think its still worth the price. I upgraded to this after using a moto L7 for a while. This phone gets average reception, it works well as a phone and great as a music player.The N81 has stereo speakers which are louder and sound better than my laptop's. You can also plug in any headphones. You can easily and quickly add music on the phones 8gb internal memory. Has great web browsing, wifi AND gaming capabilities. It has a nice big screen but easy to get scratches on it. I have dropped mine twice and it got scratched easily. The only thing i felt the phone was missing is a qwerty key board, for quicker emailing/ texting. Also the camera was not the best.The bottom line, you should probably buy this phone if you are looking to upgrade and can afford it.
Hi, This is my second phone buyed on amazon and for the two I have excellent response in the delivery.My old phone was the N80, and I liked it very much because of all the functions it has, but a little slow when I navigate on internet via wifi, and it has constantly out of memory.Let me tell you that the N81 8GB it's much better, I can browse almost any web page I want, just a problem with sites with flash 8, not supported, but I espect It could be included in a firmware release. Excelent Photos, A lot of memory, I have 2243 songs compressed using about 3.7GB and the quality is very good. The phone has a very good game console (Ngage) so, what else do you want.So the overall of the phone is Excellent phone for a very good price.
This is a great phone packed with many features for the price.A few issues I experience(d) witht he phone however are:- the jog dial is quite flimsy and even started chipping away on its own during the first month that I owned the phone even though the phone was kept in a protective case and was never dropped.- The "C" drive on the phone has very little space allocated to it.  Considering the fact that the phone registry resides in that portion of memory, I would have preferred having more memory allocated there to prevent memory full errors.- Playing games with sound on this phone is absolutely horrible.  I recommend turning off sound to prevent glitchy gameplay.  It seems like the sound is off-sync from the video anywhere between .5 to 2 seconds during games.- The digital camera is nothing special, but that what I expected from a 2MP.- not compatible with high-speed USB 2- no expansion memory card slot on the 8GB edition of the phone- the music player is always in memoryThere are also many pro's to counter the above cons for this phone, such as:- huge, bright, sharp, and brilliant high-resolution screen- really loud and amazing built-in stero speakers (this is an amazing music phone and it's ringers are very loud)- massive 8GB of space- really cool landscape gaming controls- convenient key lock switch at the top of the phone.- sleek and stylish slider design- wireless-g/b wifi connectivity is very good on this phone compared to many others int he same areas such as the iPhone- really good battery life for this type of smartphone- out-of0the-box, the phone is packed with tons of features and there are literally millions of software applicationa nd game titles that are compatible with this phone
hello.so what means us version,can i use that in Europe for example ?thank you
This is a really cool phone... And the price was great... I received it really quick, I actually wasn't expecting to get it that fast!
Magnificent phone, quad-band spectacular WI-FI and bluetooth. Adding FRING (and SKYPE) to it bring an extraordinary value. Music features and quality are really super...super.Totally worth the money. Few things that  can be improved: GPS software is to be deleted (can not compete even 5% with real GPS devices), the headset is big and heavy, internet phone is only between friends, its quality is poor. I recommand it 100%.
This phone hass all the features especially the storage space anyone will need in a phone.It just works wonderful.
This is one of the best cell phone I ever had. Rich in content, easy to use and very stylish. I bought it for 374 USD and I am really happy with my phone.
the item is cool, however slide is no too strong to hold. it is shaking when slides open like need support. seems like a gab.back light stays lit all the time when engaged in a phone call. real player music if played fro my galary goes to sleep as soon as the back light goes off. you need to hit any button on the phone to resume playing. max. light back 90 secound. so every 90 secound you need to hit something on the phone to wake it up to be able to continue playing the music if it is realplayer. if it is mp3 not a problem.
The phone is great, very awesome features. great price and super fast shipping. AMAZON ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
Very good phone.  Even thought at the begining I had a problem with my phone, I returned and they send me a new phone so quickly.  Thanks
Everything seemed to be OK when I first opened the box. However, when I put the battery and sim in, I cannot close the back cap. I feel so unhappy for spending lots of money to receive a bad quality. Then I called Nokia service and found out that this is not a U.S version, it was made outside the U.S, which means this phone cannot have a one-year warranty. (While Amazon advertises that this phone is U.S Version, Full Warranty!). So disappointed!
I had so many problems with this phone. First is the back cover. It can hardly attatch to the body, even it is when you make a call, it makes stupid noises. The keys are sloppy! My biggest problem is the signal. You cannot hold it or even touch it when you want to get the best of signal reception. When I hold it like what we do when we make a phone call, the singal bars drops dramatically usually from full 6 bars down to ZERO. Even I know the area I am living has relatively poor singals, but this has nver happened to my other phones used. I changed the carrier, it gets no better. Last but not the least, NOKIA's customer service sucks!!! Their guys are ice cold!!! They were truly a bounch of idiots!!! All they want to do is ask you to ship your troulbled phone back for 7-10 business days for an evaluation! I had just enough!!!!
He leido multiples reviews de este celular, en todos se indica que es un mal celular.  Yo he tenido muchos equipos y les puedo indicar que este es uno de los mejores... creanme he tenido muchos y de muchas marcas.Ventajas:- 8GB integrado.  No hay que preocuparse por espacio.- Compacto, es un poco pesado pero comparado con otros de las mismas caracteristicas es ligero.- WLan.  Puedo bajar aplicaciones, temas, ring tones sin preocuparme que mi compañia de celular me cargue costos en exceso por navegación.- Todo en un toque.  Se puede tener las caracteristicas principales sin deslizar la cubierta.- Audio. Tiene bocinas estereo, aunque el audio no es de la mejor calidadDesventajas_- Las teclas no son suaves al tacto, parecen trabarse al tocarlas.- La cubierta de la bateria y del slider no son muy firmes, se siente un poco flojas
i don't know if you guys noticed or not, this N81 model selling on Amazon is made in China(take out your battery, you'll see it on the back of the phone). I'm a chinese myself and i know for sure that, in china, fake Nokia's are being sold everywhere, they made things look 99% identical but the chip and processor might be different, so on the outside you wouldn't tell any difference at all, some people may be using it for years and still don't know that they've been using a fake phone. by the way, the fake phone is way cheaper than the real ones, for example, the fake nokia n81 is only worth $120 in china. i'm pretty disappointed finding out that my phone is made in china and called Amazon cellphone specialist, but they have no idea where it's supposed to be made.some may argue that some of real phones, such as sonyericsson, are made in china,too. but while i was viewing a chinese forum, a guy posted a thread asking people where their phones are made, 99% said it's made in Finland. Weird enough? Chinese guys' N81's are made in Finland, but here in the States, we're buying phones that are made in China, i seriously doubt if we've been fooled... please prove me wrong cos i haven't called nokia help center yet
Its an ok phone that would be my starting title!why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone.This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac.com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application.Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw  i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama.This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you.This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc!Overall ill give this phone a three stars just because i came from a Ferrari to a Toyota and i think ill stick with my hacked iphone meanwhile nokia comes with a better phone that actual competes against apple's iPhone.Cheers, Lads!
I want to make this quick and to the point. This phone is awesome and worth every penny. I actually cannot stop looking and playing around with it. A couple of great things about this phone, you can hear it when it rings also the speaker quality is above and beyond. The camera is excellent! I can actually take photos at night and see them. You will love this phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too.  This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feel like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red "jewels" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.
This is an amazing phone, it comes with  FM radio tunner and is very usefull and it has a lot of extra features !!!
I have had this phone for a little over a year now. It has been a great device. The web browser is fast. The video and audio playback is great. Stereo bluetooth should be a must for any phone nowadays.
I really might give it three and a half stars.The thing is my preference is not slider phones,I like clamshells.But I got such a great deal on this phone from my provider that I thought that it was worth a go. (Plus the clamshell version of this phone -the u300 had no Fm radio which is kind of a deal breaker for me).Anyway it is a super sleek, super sexy phone and I never thought of calling a phone sexy before this one). It reall has a nice design. Also I never used Samsung phone. I am a die hard ericsson fan, and was actually gonna get one till like I said I had a great offer.I found that it was very easy to navigate, I was able to find things easily, I LOVE the -ugo- wallpaper. (It does this cool thing of changing depending on the country or city- I think- you are in.) That is totally cool and cute. Camera is pretty good, just battery life is advertised as like 3 30 H of talk time. But I work all-nighters sometimes and I had this baby running for like a 30 hour stint (with intermittent calls) and the battery only complained after that. So I guess it depends.Nice slider action.Now the problem with it the MAJOR problem, 'touch sensitive keys'. Wow! A potentially cool idea but recipe for disaster. I had been warned online about it dialing numbers accidentally so I was wary. It does it mostly when the phone is opened (and therfore unlocked) and if you re fiddling around with other stuff it may just dial out and if you don't realise majorly embarrasing.And there is no haptic feedback which lets you know that you pressed the button so you gotta be careful. That is why I did not keep mine, re-sold it exactly a week after purchase cause I realised that the samsung d900i is like exactly the same phone with out the touch sensitive keys....(it is slightly wider by less than 2mmand slightly fatter by 2mm) but there is less chance of accidental dialing and it still looks slim, trim, ultra sexy and cool.So yes it is a pretty great phone BUT if you think those keys are gonna nag you or make ya regret them go for the d900i OR if you want a better upgrade the g600 which is also the same style but with a 5MP camera (slightly wider phone too).So good luck
I was minutes away from ordering this phone on Amazon.  It looks amazing.  Trouble is, it does not have the proper 3G antennas for United States 3G (AT&T;).  So you will only get EDGE speeds unless you are out of the US (Europe, etc).  Everything else on the phone will work just fine, but 3G will not.Just a heads up if you missed the mention of no USA 3G in the description.  I just got the N95-4 instead so I could have 3G.  The camera on the N82 is much better, but I can't stand EDGE data.  Too slow.  If you are on T-Mobile in the states, or don't care about 3G, the N82 is the phone to get!
I bought the Nokia N82 for the 5MP camera, the full motion 30fps video and the symbian OS. It replaced a SE K790a. The above mentioned features work well and I've never been able to fill my installed 8GB SD micro SDHC card. Initially I was concerned when it turns out some of my favorite programming is transmitted over the internet using the Microsoft WMA format which symbian doesn't support, however, I was able to work around this using my home Sling Player AV and installing Sling Player Mobile on my Nokia N82. Now through T-Mobile internet I listen to and watch a variety of cable programming worldwide which is coming off my home's Verizon FIOS box. I also get Shoutcast internet audio programming directly off internet websites through T-Mobile internet and this, of course, works flawlessly and most efficiently. It would be nice if more internet broadcasters adopted this format. Overall its hard to beat this phone. Battery life is very good considering how I use the phone and it recharges quickly.
I'm a big fan of this phone (5 stars easy!); just wanted to warn others that the screen scratches really easily, so be sure to get a screen protector.
My previous Nokia products include the 7610, 6103, 5300, N90, N91, N73, N95 8GB, and the 770 Internet Tablet.  This is by far the best one for me.  The biggest difference between the N95 8GB and the N82 is that mine(N82) is equipped with the Xenon Flash, while the N95 8GB has LED, which is far dimmer, but can be used at night for video, which my bulb can't.  To keep it short, if you won't let go of your Navigation device in your car or your iPod, or would rather use many devices instead of one, then this product is not for you.  Here is a short list of what I HAVE ACTUALLY DONE WITH THIS PHONE.1. Free Nokia Maps App with A-GPS (radio towers and GPS to lock on location within 10 seconds, tops)2. Superb music and video app, standard size headset jack, my iPod headset sounds great on this phone3. Best pictures ever, best video(30fps), and TV-OUT!  Watch movies, recorded clips on my big screen!4. N-Gage gaming platform!  I have been playing various games against other people across the globe.5. Battery lasts two days with heavy use, right now it's playing Newsweek Podcast downloaded over WiFi.6. Youtube in the browser, not on a separate app like the iPhone.  This is a Real Browser!7. Post directly to Flickr.  No special address to send to, just take the pic, choose post to web, select Flickr.8. It geo-tags for me, when the pic is taken.Best phone for me, but not for everyone else.  I did a lot of research before buying.  Go to Flickr, type in N82, and check out the best camera phone hands down!
Hi guys, I'm Jeremy Cai from Singapore and I just got this phone yesterday. It was part of a contract deal so I got it for alot cheaper than the ones here at Amazon.com. It came in a very cool box and the package includes an USB cable, an AV output cable (to be able to watch your self made phone videos on a TV screen is just amazing, and the image quality was great during my test runs), a pair of earphones, a 2 GB micro-SD card, an adapter for the SD card, a charger, a DVD containing Nokia's own PC suite, the manual and, of course, the phone itself. There are two colors for this phone as far as I know, silver and black, and I got the black one. It looks really sleek and cool, much like the Iphone, and I love how it feels in my hands.It's got great software, great multimedia capabilities and a great camera too. Nokia designed this phone to be a great photography phone and it shows. The five megapixel camera has a state of the art Xenon flash and Carl Xeiss lenses. It's practically unheard of in the mobile world. This phone has camera features that are second to none.And the amazing thing is that it has almost all of N95's features (save maybe the extensive video playback capabilities and a few others), making this phone one of the best smartphones out there now. I'm already loving how I'm able to do video presentations using my AV output cable (I'm studying Mass Communication). It's small things like that that make N82 such a great package.But it isn't without it's faults though. Sometimes I wish everything were a little more accessible; the camera controls are great and the camera is easily accessible, but access to features like music playback is cumbersome and tedious. I had to press upwards of about five buttons to play the songs I wanted. A letdown. Also, there's no touch screen or QWERTY keyboard, it's pretty much a conventional mobile phone even with the sleek feel, so if you're jonesing for a touch screen or a Blackberry style keypad you might want to look for something else.But, it isn't anything to shout about. If you're looking for a smartphone to replace your bug riddled Iphone, look no farther, the N82 will satisfy your tech hunger; everything about the phone screams next-gen.
I bought this phone because of camera knowing that is not US 3G and I dont plan to surf the net as much but using wifi is fast. Camera is better than 3.2 megapix point and shoot even at night, that's what I expected it(5 stars). GPS with garmin xt(5 stars)locks to satellite fast about 5 seconds and turn by turn is awesome. RF, Sound volume and quality (5starts) both internal and external speaker. Display brightness is not as bright but good enough (4 stars). I wanted to give 5 stars but because of display bright and not US 3G I give 4.5 stars.
I have nokia n82 for 3 month. This phone is an all-in-one feature phone.1.The basic recieving and talking functions are good. I have used many Nokia phones. They all have good recieving ability.2.Build-in GPS is a nice feature. When I travel by car, n82 becomes a navigator (I installed Route 66). One thing mentioned by other reviewers is that the small screen issue. So I mainly listen to the sound instructions and just take a glance on screen when navigating. It works well for me this way. Also, I use Nokia Map as an electronic map, the map is free, good in details and can be updated.3.The camera and vedio is great. The lens is a Carl Zeiss authorized lens. The photograph has well balanced color, sharp and nice contrast. The N82 white balance is accurate which I think a good camera should have. The Xenon flashlight is great for dim environment, much better than LED flashlight like my previous 6682. I have Canon DSLR but still love to use n82 as a carry-on camera.4.The multimedia is nice. I listen music a lot--MP3 and radio. The sound of n82 is equal to iriver mp3 player when I use Sennheiser CX300 earphones. Besides, you can adjust EQ of N82. The podcast is the other good stuff. I can download podcast episodes via wi-fi and listen whenever I want. Its sound may not as good as N81, but impress me as a smartphone does.5. Bluetooth function is important to me because I use bluetooth headset. It pairs well with plantronics 510 and nokia BH-211. No dropping happen until now. I am satisfied with it.All in all, N82 is a good smartphone with many functions. I am very satisfied with it.
There few main drawbacks that really should not be there:1. the battery is really weak: the phone runs out of charge in less than 48 hours withvery moderate usage (no internet, no camera, etc, only talk 15-20 min a day)2. there are very obvious bugs: Gallery application doesn't work at times (just displays 'no images or videos found'). It seems to have problems reading directories with images or videos both in phone memory and on the memory card.3. GPS application (Nokia maps) seems to have problems locating/finding maps, as a result I would have no maps displayed when I need them the most (i.e. when travel and no Internet)4. Automatic screen rotation really leaves much to be desired, and one would think this function should have been solid by this time.Now, I used Nokia smarphone (Nokia 7610) since 2004, that phone had great battery (7-10 days! with same usage pattern), gallery was working without any problems, and no noticeable bugs, always worked really sharp. When I got this new Nokia N82 I expected same level of quality (seeing that standby/talk time have increased according to the specifications). I really have to say that the N82 battery is really not up to theexpectations. I used to not even carry the charger for my old Nokia 7610 even when I  went for 4-5 day trips, as the battery was awesome. Basically, I am very disappointed with Nokia N82 as it does not get up to quality that you would expect from $400 phone. With short battery life and key functions not working sharp (like Gallery), this phone is a downgrade for me, not an improvement compared to my old, but sharp Nokia 7610.Having said all that, phone has lots of functions (Wi-Fi, 5MP camera, GPS, etc), but unfortunately you will not enjoy them much as the battery runs out really quick, or they simply sometimes not function right (eg. Gallery or GPS).Another thing (may be minor) is that Nokia Maps seem to require PC with Nokia Map Loader (and Windows!) application to get maps for your GPS, as a result the maps cannot be obtained using your phone alone; I must say this is just outright wrong, one would think there will support for LINUX users, as this is Symbian, not Windows Mobile.
The only minus is that it does not work with 3G.  But, that means that you can use the $15 data plan from AT&T.;Make sure you get the updates from Nokia's site, so that you can geo-tag your photos and use the most up-to-date version of the Maps program (it was updated late August of '08).This phone will replace your point-and-shoot camera, GPS, media player and your old phone.
This is the best camera phone I have used. The wifi features are awesome which makes internet calling using Fring and Truphone so easily.I can even make a sip call with [...].It is a highly recommended buy.Thanks.
I purchased this phone primarily because of the camera: 5 Megapixels, and with a real-camera xenon flash (most phones have inferior LCD 'flash').  In that respect I'm not disappointed.  Still, a few details about that camera: in order to turn on the camera, you have to slide open the protective lens cover (a few times I've been frustrated at my inability to launch the camera app - until I remember that protective cover!). Next, the camera is a bit slow to start up. Count on 3 seconds from the flick of the cover switch until you're ready to shoot.When you start the camera app, it's in picture mode. To switch into video mode, you need to find the right icon in the little vertical toolbar on the right side of the screen, and press OK.  That toolbar has more elements than can be seen on the screen at one time, and if you have at one point in the past scrolled down that list (perhaps inadvertently) you may end up wondering why your picture/video icon has disappeared; simply scroll back up.After taking a picture (using the dedicated shutter button) on the right side of the phone, in order to take a second picture (if you are in single-picture mode) you will have to press the right soft key (below the word 'Back' on your screen). If you instead mistakenly press the dedicate multimedia key immediately below that, you'll end up launching the Gallery application instead, and you'll have to press the right soft key again to exit that app and return to the camera app.If you leave the camera app for any reason, there are two ways to start it again. Either close and reopen the lens cover while on your home screen, or else press and hold the camera shutter.Once captured, pictures and videos can be saved to albums, or uploaded over the air to Nokia's Ovi on-line application, or to Flickr or Vox. I really like this feature! Take a pic while you are out and about, and immediately it's online for your friends to see.Turning to other features...The GPS is fairly useful and does a good job of recording a tracklog using the free Nokia SportsTracker application (see [...] One gripe: you can only upload tracklogs to the SportsTracker app using a cellular data connection, not WiFi.The WiFi works well also, and you can define named access points, which, when you are trying to connect to the internet, will only appear in your list when you are in range of them (you can delete them in Tools if you want).  You can set the phone to always prompt you and ask if you wish to connect via WiFi or cellular data. Save some money on data usage!The built-in browser is acceptable, and *way* better than the Microsoft Pocket Internet Explorer that's provided on Windows Mobile devices, but if you are a demanding user you will prefer to download and install Opera Mini. Speaking of downloading, you can download many apps and install them over the air - no pesky desktop synchronization required.The built-in messaging client is acceptable, and can handle multiple accounts.  One quirk is that it wants to define one account as being active, and all outgoing mail will try to go through that account (you can change active accounts with the "Connect" menu item) unless you change it in Sending Options before pressing Send.  Make sure you are properly communicating with your mail server before composing a big message however, since Messaging will simply delete your outgoing message if it cannot connect to the server.Others can talk about music and video playing as I don't use those features much.Gripes:- This phone is billed as 'US Version' but the UMTS (3G connection) is on 2100 MHz whereas most N. American cellular providers are on 1900 MHz. So, you may only be getting EDGE speed for your data transfers. (about 150 kilobytes/sec).- intensive texting is a bit of a pain given the very small keys. You can substantially improve your accuracy, speed and overall pleasure of text input by installing Adaptxt, which provides predictive word completion for a reasonable fee; you can try the app for 90 days from adaptxt.com before you buy.  On the plus side, you can pair a bluetooth keyboard (like the iGo, or Apple's wireless keyboard) to the N82 and type away with a real keyboard. I love this capability.- unlike Windows Mobile phones, there's no office suite included with the phone. But if you have a good data plan, you could just use Google Docs instead and do all your work on-line.
I take a lot of pictures with my phone as it's always on me.  This phone has a camera and flash that are better than anything else out there.I text a lot and the predictive text is the best I've seen from the factory.  Is there a program I can download so it will "learn" words I use a lot that it doesn't recognize?Keys are small but feel is just right. Much easier to text than on an iphone.When it was over $670 I held off.  At under $400 I jumped.  Got an 8GB memory card for $23.  Great setup.Love this thing.
This is a great phone. I love it. I love that i can take very good quality pictures, most of the time, with it's 5MP camera without having to take another device.I bought it to take it with me in a trip to South America. I was traveling light and the Nokia N82 was perfect partner. I used it for my music, to surf the internet at the Hotel via WIFI and using Skype installed in the phone, i could stay in touch with friends and family for cheap. Since the quality of the picture was very good i used it in many cases my N82 instead of a regular camera. Another thing is that with a free software that can be downloaded to your computer from the internet, linking your ITUNES music playlist to your nokia phone is no problem.OK, the cons: The Battery is week and only last for a couple of hours when using WIFI conection and music. The phone is not that slim and it's a little bulky. The keys are small but i find it easier to use than the keys of my previous SLVR by Motorola. It has UMTS connectivity but i cannot use it in USA but i bought this phone knowing that.*pardon my grammar.Thanks
Although 3G data networks have rapidly advanced in the United States, most notably in the past few years, it may still be considered a beta mode type of product. I say this not just by reviewing data, but through extensive use of many devices and services. Without getting into a big story, I switched from an iphone to an iPhone 3G, to this, the N82. I have never been so satisfied in the pure performance, ease of use, and specifications. I don't mean for this to sound the wrong way, but I spend a lot of money on mobile devices. In doing so, I obviously get a good first hand feel of them. This phone is the best if you want: amazing picture quality (even at night), the clearest sounding signal, and an easy and bug free interface which is universal in compatibility, this is it. The iPhone 3G got too buggy for me. I hate dropped calls and inconsistencies. Now I have an iPhone 3G which is basically used as an iPod, and this, my new favorite gadget. The only complaint, which is not anything to worry about is- the sim card door is made of very thin aluminum and is fragile. Be careful when you put the sim card in.
Previously owned a Sony Ericsson P1i phone for a few months and the Nokia N82 has the Sony beat.  The Media player on the Nokia N82 a lot better than the Sony. The Sony music player is really slow. Also, with Sony you have to buy their memory stick and other proprietary items, a real downer. The Nokia display, video and picture quality are excellent.  You don't need to bring a separate digital camera on trips. I'm a map freak and GPS on this device is really good. A definite aid when I was out of town trying locate a place to eat.  It just a downer that you have to pay extra for the voice service for the GPS.  The Sony Ericsson P1i does not come with a GPS however Sony does has a touch screen but that is no big deal with me. Sony has infrared & bluetooth connections but the Nokia N82 has only bluetooth but again no big deal.  I wish the Nokia had a the Track ID service. The Sony Ericsson has it. A definite plus when you are listening to FM radio and you want to find out the song listening to.  Overall, the Nokia N82 is a winner and I would recommend this phone to anyone.
I agree with most of what's been written already here and I'd like to add my 2 cents as I have owned the n95-8GB too and I can tell you categorically, the N82 is a much better phone.Despite of the fact that it doesn't have 3G, I've decided to buy it and the reason is that I don't really need the 3G most of the times. Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy.N95 had a lot of bugs and very annoying lags in the camera when shooting (see my n95 review). Worst was a few seconds (literally) from the moment the shutter was pressed to the moment the picture was taken, processed and have the camera ready for the next one. An absolute no go... Slider is so flimsy on the N95 that I was really afraid the screen part is going to crack and dislocate.The N82's camera is a great improvement on that part. It has a Xenon flash and a much faster response time. I personally prefer the lens slide as a camera activator because it prevents accidental camera mode when in the holster, something I have experienced with the N95 quite a lot.Very useful function (especially for travelers): The modem function works great either via the USB modem driver or the Bluetooth, with download speeds that could put some so-called `broadband' speeds to shame. This is great in places where you have no Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi for your laptop (like in Airport terminals, etc).The phone also syncs with the PC (outlook) using the same connections (through the USB or via Bluetooth)MicroSD: The N82's spec doesn't state support for HC MicroSD memory, but I took the chance and bought an 8GB one and it works flawlessly...Screen: Auto rotation is somewhat annoying but it can be disabled.Media player: Sometimes it freezes with other applications running to the point when it freezes and restarts the phone. It happens rarely but it does (with the latest FW version). Sound quality is reasonable although on my phone I hear clicks and pops on the over tones which is weird because I only transferred the songs as MP3 without additional compression to MP4 which is available through the Media Manager.A-GPS: Well this is a debatable function and whether useful or not it is up to how much really one needs a GPS. I find it to be a nice toy to have but I don't consider it as a serious GPS. In fact the Nokia maps are not so great for this service. The Voice guidance is free for only 3-days after which the navigation is disabled and when used, it redirects to purchase options which are so ridiculously expensive. I downloaded Google maps for the phone which work much better overall.Battery life: Much better than the N95, though it is not even close to what's in the spec. I don't know why Nokia doesn't think about that. The battery should be at least 1300mAh to give a decent battery life between charges.Overall it's a good phone for the price I paid (I don't see why one would pay more than a $150) for the black one as priced on Amazon, or even more for the N95 which doesn't give you more for the money.
I recently had the pleasure of trying out a Nokia n82 for about 2 weeks give or take a day. The phone was all pluses with the exception of two negatives that I found, poor charger port location and length of handset. Everything else was a hit from the speed to the battery life it was great.I know a lot of people will think almost 500.00 is a crazy amount of money for a phone but its worht every penny.
This is really a great phone.  The one Amazon sells is the US Warranty version and mine does not suffer from any of the plagues people mention online.  I believe the Asian versions are the ones with the problems.  I would have given the phone a perfect rating if it somehow incorporated a QWERTY keypad.  Maybe by tilting it over and sliding it up.  Otherwise, the camera/video recorder is where this phone really shines.  The built-in Xenon flash and auto-focus assist really makes the difference in your pictures.
Normally when a 3G-capable Nokia is advertised by Amazon as being the U.S. version, that means it is designed to operate on the North American 3G networks. Sadly that is not the case with this phone. It is not 3G-capable in North America. The only thing U.S.-oriented about it is the warranty and the charger. I was hoping that the "Asia/Europe 3G compatibility" in the description was a leftover from the non-U.S.-model description, but after receiving one I can verify that that statement is accurate.Very disappointing.Come on, Nokia, where is our real U.S. model?
I bought this phone to replace an Ericsson 810i that didn't like to swim in a pool with me. The Ericsson was great except it didn't have WiFi. I wanted a phone with these features: unlocked, 4-band GSM, FM Radio, high quality camera, WiFi, digital audio, syncable calendar/contacts, games, and USB connectivity. This phone has all these plus a whole bunch of extras. Some I can't use because my existing prepaid T-Mobile cell service doesn't support them. I don't normally chat or text very much so the $100/year prepaid service is just fine. The size (slightly larger than my old phones, but light weight) and very clear screen are wonderful. Keys are on the small side, but I find using fingernails work ok. The Nokia N82 is a great phone!Amazon was the cheapest by far, delivery was fast and free and the 3% kickback by using my Amazon Credit Card made it even more affordable.
This phone is great!  I and my wife are loving them coz I purchased the black version for my wife about 2 weeks later.  Voice quality is great, wi-fi is awesome, camera is still one of the best out there.  I think I got my money's worth!
I bought the N82 when we moved to Hong Kong about a year ago.  It is a solid candybar phone and it takes excellent photos and can upload them to flickr in a snap.  BUT... it is horrible for texting and email and if I don't lock it before putting it in my pocket it calls the first person in my contacts about half the time. (I put a bogus entry in my contacts called "a" with a bogus number so at least I don keep calling Ambra from my pocket.).  The buttons are very small the shiny faceplate makes seeing the letters on the keypad all but impossible on with any sort of glare. And there is always glare unless you are somewhere darkish and the backlighting shows. Unless you know by heart the numeric keypad to letters conversion it is very frustrating to type a message. Except for the 5MP camera and easy upload to flickr I would not recommend this phone for the money.
Great camera resolution, xenon flash, great video quality, good music quality, tv connection, wifi, voip, gps and a great looks...easy to use, easy to update, simple interface... great device.
All my expections were met.  Description about the camera and the phone are very accurate and actually more features are available when you get to know the phone more. Now I did not need to buy a digicam anymore and I don't have to carry two gadgets in my bag if I need a camera. Very nice.  An invisible shield is a must though.
Probably the best phone around. Has everything you need. WiFi makes it even better. 5 MP camera is good enough for most of my needs. have not have any major problems till now. though the phone hangs a few times. This is after i loaded a 8gb card in it.
it's the perfect phone, maybe the only con is that since its a symbian it may be kinda slow for some apps, but great, 10 out of 10.
So far I really enjoy it ,I've been dying to have this phone but I couldn't find a good deal, thanks to Amazon.com
There is an obvious leak between front panel and side, I think it probably  caused by cost-down fabrication. Plus, I just turned from windows mobile phone, so I couldn't get used to it at beginning. Otherwise, this NOKIA phone is well-function and smooth.
I have purchased this item from Amazon about 2 months ago. Was promptly delivered.I had SE K850i prior to N82. Camera experience: SE loses big time. I finally have no need for my point and shoot camera and am currently selling it. N82: Great photos, nice design, very nice audio quality: both from external speakers and using headphones. Wi-fi works flawlessly. So far it's working perfectly. No restarts or glitches whatsoever. Great phone! Thank you Amazon!
Its just a great phone. All features work as expected. The reason i'm not giving a 5 star review is because there is a little problem with my device:If you open and close, very often, the camera protector, OS get blocked. A restart is needed. Also, some times when I switch from picture mode to video mode, no video screen appears. Again, only a restart is needed.This is not a constant issue, so I can live with it and enjoy the rest of features like WIFI, GPS, and its great pictures.
The N82 is a great smartphone, GPS, 5mp camera, Wifi. The screen and the shape of this phone is great. I compared this to my friends N95 8gig, it has all the bells and whistles that it's older brother has. Highly recommend a screen protector. [...]
I have had this phone since it came out, and must say that I am very pleased with it's functionalities and features.I am impressed with the camera, and so far it is the best camera phone I have ever had, I also like the video function even though it can't compare with any video cameras, and must be seen as just a gimick for fun short takes.The GPS is one of two things I think is on the downside along with its buttons that I think is way to small, writing text messages is a challenge everytime.But all in all this is a phone that is well recommended.Go and buy it nowNokia N82 Unlocked Smartphone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)
Cons: Sluggish. Hangs every now and then. Video (movies) does not play for more than 10-15 min after that the sound comes but the screen freeze. Even after Xenon flash indoor shoots are hazy. The hands free is weird, it has a button to disconnect but it does not redial the last number. Also the disconnect button location inadvertently disconnects the call in the middle of conversation.Pros: Almost everything in a phone. GPS works fine, only time to first connect is long but after that it quickly links and works fine. WLAN  connects faster. Camera for all cell phone standard is extremely good, I used it on a trip and I am happy with the results. Speakers are good qualityOverall I would recommend this phone but keep in mind that it won't do things as fast as you would like it to perform. Forget about watching video as they play only for 10-15 min. To browse web, you wold need to update the flash player and I don't know how to update only the flash player, I updated the software from the Nokia website but haven't tried internet after that.
Lo recomiendo uno de los mejores celulares que existen hasta ahora, similar al n95 8gb producto 100% recomendado llegò sin ningun inconveniente y seguro, era lo que esperaba, muchas gracias
The phone is great!5mp camera with carl zeiss lens,integrated GPS, mp3 player with great speakers and great headphones quality, 16million colors and freaking WIFI!!!the phone is just amazing!!The price is just wonderful, unbelieveble!!fast shipping,great job by Amazon.com!!Highly recommended!! thank you amazon.com!
This is a great phone. It's essentially an N95 in a candy bar form, and considerable cheaper. The camera is great, the GPS is ok, the rest of the features are amazing. This being a S60 phone, there's lots of third party app support for it as well. In terms of features you can't beat it.I did have an issue in the beginning with this phone. Actually, I originally bought the N81 from NewEgg, that phone had a faulty battery and had to be returned. I then opted for the N82 from Amazon since the N81 was out of stock on NewEgg. When I got the N82, it lasted me about a week before it started having issues with its SD card. It would refuse to boot up with the SD card inserted and after a little while would not boot up at all. I returned the N82 and Amazon overnighted me another one. I was without a phone for a whole of 18 hours.So given my experience with the N81 and N82, I'm giving this phone 4 stars. A+ to Amazon for customer service though.
I bought this one about a month ago through amazon and its the most amazing phone I ever had. Its an IPOD, Digital Camera, GPS, PSP, Phone and much more all in one.
I'll probably not need anything more than what the phone currently offers, the shape and dimensions of the phone can be improved. I was looking to get an Iphone, but, the Camera on this is definitely a decisive factor.Compared to the Iphone, I would say internet browsing is still a plus for the IPhone (touch screen that is bigger), However, you can get what you want from this phone when it comes to browsing the net. The Camera on the Iphone can not match this camera.It seemed strange to me why the black version was 50-$100 more expensive (and popular) than the silver one, which raises the question, why make the silver version?
I have this phone and this phone is the best camera phone ever! 5 megapixel camera with xenon flash.! quality super good! recommend to all!
i just want to know if this phone is made in Finland , cause there is a lot of these nokia phones are made in china and they are not good.
Problems that i found on this phone:-No calls restriction to specific group or name. That sucks. On my Sony Ericsson K810 and later 850 i could do that.-No flash light-No intuitive name search in a stand-by mode, by pressing buttons, SE could do that.-No Forward-reverse function for MP3 player in a stand-by mode like SE.-Two silver buttons in the fron show wear instantly, literally in no time! I can`t believe my eyes. Video sometimes show distortion, as if you watch it through water.-GPS requires that i install voice-guidance for money before i can use navigation. That i would call a deception-SO PEOPLE, BE AWARE.I think i can live with all that, considering good points in the phone. I love camera and Wi-Fi. But dissapointment package is greater that i expected. Thank you.
On paper, this phone has superior hardware and technical specifications compared to most other phones.  It also has a current price that's much more than the iPhone and many other phones or pocket PCs.  Unfortunately, with this phone, the software provided doesn't come close to taking full advantage of the hardware.The video and other processing performance is sub-par and worse than earlier models of HTC phones.  Though they supplied the hardware, HTC didn't include the driver software necessary to take advantage of this phones high-end processor potential.  Primary processing speed is slower than many other phones (even when compared to phones with slower and cheaper CPU's) because of the driver issues and the fact that the new iPhone type user interface (called TouchFlo), is first-generation-clunky.  If you aren't particularly interested in watching a lot of video on your phone, the video driver problem is of no consequence.  However, the slower TouchFlo interface may be an irritant (four taps on the icon to open a program instead of one). For such an expensive product with a relatively fast processor, it should outperform every other phone on the market . . . but it doesn't come close.Initially, HTC wouldn't commit to providing updated software to solve the performance problems. Very recently an HTC executive noted that HTC had changed its mind and will eventually provide "video acceleration software," as an alternative to providing better video drivers, and software as an update for the Touch Cruise.  Unfortunately, when I called, HTC would not provide an estimated release date for the updates.I'm not a big Apple fan, but with the iPhone 3G due out in July of 2008,I think most that are interested in this phone should wait a little longer to spend so much money.
Excellent phone.  I did a lot of research looking for a smart phone.  I narrowed it down to the Moto Q, Samsung Blackjack, and the Cruise and am very happy with my choice.  Before this, I had an HP 6515 - my favorite features were the reset button and it's heft - you could use it to settle a dispute or prevent a car from rolling down the hills of Portland.** The Cruise has been a very stable phone.  It fits in my pocket, I can turn the LCD sideways (soft key) to get a landscape view.  A Resco keyboard makes data entry simple and straightforward (although a wee bit less accurate than a hard keyboard).** My biggest concern was compatibility with my carrier (as this is an unlocked phone).  I was amazed that it worked out of the box with T-Mobile.  Phone service works fine.  EDGE (T-Mobile) in US is ok.  But, best of all, this phone works very well in both Japan and Korea where they have proprietary protocols (PHS, PDC, Docomo 3G, and CDMA) - so this is truly a world phone.** It gets better.  Last week, I used Google map to walk around Shinjuku, Japan and Chaechon City, Korea.  Got right to my location.  Built-in TomTom GPS works great (one free city, others cost).  I live in Portland and use this feature extensively.  WiFi, Bluetooth (mono and stereo), FM radio, etc. all work just fine.  Battery life is ok, but needs to be managed.  The interface is a bit clunky, but can be programmed, so there are work arounds.** Overall, I rate this phone very high - it beats the iPhone, Moto Q, Blackjack, Blackberry and other smart phones by a mile (my personal opinion).  I am very happy with this product.
I bought this smartphone to replace a lot of devices I used to carry on my backpack, guess what... I did it.I have everything in just one device, cell phone, contacts, emails, web browser, etc.The sync works well so I can receive and reply emais even when out-of-office. The TouchFlo interface is amazing, very intuitive.The cameras has great image and a lot of options and has a built-in GPS, believe me, that works.Windows Mobile 6 was incredible improved.
This devices graphics performance is terrible.Scrolling through city maps displayed by GPS navigation software is very slow, but I wouldn't call in unusable.Scrolling through web-pages is so slow that I don't consider web-browsing a usable feature. If you exclusively access websites that are optimized for handheld devices (i.e. don't require extensive scrolling) then it is bearable.You can play video's, but at framerates that are so low that I can't imagine anyone actually watching a video with this device.Playing 3D games is impossible.According to the specifications I feel this device should be a lot faster. As it is I feel I've spent a lot of money on something only half usable. If I ever buy a HTC product again, I will take a lot closer look at it then I did this time.
Simply . . . it's a full device for me. all what i can say . . . it's better than iPhone alot.
It's very complete phone with a lot of application but it's too slow and teh quality of the product is not the best.
I have owned this phone for about a week now. I like the device a lot, but it does have some limitations of which the buyer should be aware. Basically, these can be summed up as fairly small ROM / RAM size, POSSIBLE problems with high density MicroSD cards, possible WiFi connection issues, and the GPS application being on a separate storage card.In the box:The phone.Battery.Storage case (NOT a belt pouch).Wired headset (also used as the FM antenna).2 Gb MicroSD card that contains the Igo navigation software. It is pre-loaded with maps of all North America. The software is IGo 2006+.Map CD for the navigation software, including a small "quick start" guide for the IGo software.Manuals and CDs.Windshield car mount.Mains electric charger.Mini USB cable to connect to the computer.Description:The screen is a bit small at 2.6 inches, but it is 65K colors and 320 X 240, which is QVA resolution. It has good clarity and is very bright.A small mesh grill hides the speaker and the multi-function light that indicates Charging, GSM, Wi-Fi, GPS, and BT activity.The SIM card is mounted behind the 1300 ma battery.The camera lens is on the rear of the phone, behind a clear cover.Control buttons: The phone has built in buttons that perform the following tasks:Left Side:- A jog wheel on the left side that moves up/down, and can select with a push.- A "back" button below the jog wheel, which backs out of the current application.Right side:- A slider switch that locks the device and dims the screen. I really prefer this to the standard PDA phone method of having a single button bring the phone out of standby. The slider switch is a great idea.- A small hole to perform a soft reset.- A button to activate the 2 Mega pixel camera.- The slot for the microSD storage card, which is spring mounted and has no cover.Top:- A power button.Bottom.- A 2.5mm wired headset jack.- A mini-USB port on the bottom.- The stylus pulls out from the bottom right of the unit, which is a bit non standard.- The microphone.- Two mysterious holes. I have no idea what they are for, and the user manual has no mention of them.Buttons on the front (surrounding the keypad)Left side:- A button that runs the ASUS Location Courier.- A button that brings up the ASUS Travelog.- A button that activates the FM radio.- A button that activates an ASUS button which either switches between running tasks, or has a list of 4 programs that you can run.Right side:- A "C" button that clears the last entry when you are putting information into a dialog.- A Bluetooth Off/On toggle button.- A button that activates windows Messaging.- A button that activates Voice Commander.Over the keypad:- The normal buttons for a WM 6 phone: Phone answer and End.- Two rocker-style buttons that have dual functions: one has the left soft key and the WINDOWS button; the other has the right soft key and the "OK" button.- A nifty joystick that has left, right, up, down, and enter functions.---------------------------------------------------------Pros:- Size and weight. The phone is very small for a device that has a GSM phone, GPS, WiFi, BT, and Windows Mobile 2006 built in.- Power is supplied by standard mini-USB plug, which means that it will be easy to find a car charger or spare wall charger.- Design: The phone is VERY attractive. It is made of plastic, but looks like aluminum. It is reasonably sturdy, though the battery cover does "creak" sometimes.- Keypad: It is very nice to have the hardware keys as opposed to having to use the soft keys when the phone is active. For those used to text messaging from a standard cell phone, the keypad will be very useful. Personally I use the software keyboard built into WM6.- The joystick is an interesting feature in a PDA phone. I find that I don't actually use this a lot, maybe because I'm more used to a jog wheel and the stylus.- The dedicated function keys are very nice, especially the button to turn on/off the Bluetooth radio.- Reasonable battery life, due to minimum RAM and ROM for WM 6. I have found that there are freeware utilities that will put the phone in standby, which has resulted in longer battery life. From what I can tell the phone will work for about 2 - 3 days with occasional GPRS and WiFi usage. If you have heavy WiFi and BT, expect it to require recharging every night.- Excellent voice quality for phone conversations. BT hands free quality is good.- Built in support for EDGE over GPRS.- Quad band, so it can be used in the US or worldwide.- Built in software for Voice Commander. This can be used either over wired or BT headsets, or from the phone microphone. It can control both dialing and many other programs, though I have only used it with BT to dial hands free. The voice recognition software is very good.- Having a dedicated hardware key for backspace is actually quite useful when using the "soft" keyboard, since if the SHIFT key is pressed there is no back arrow on the keyboard.- Built in software that allows one to use the "X" key to actually close programs, to minimize programs, or to have a "long tap" to close, normal tap to minimize. The WM 6 default behavior is to minimize programs, which means that one can have a whole bunch of programs running at once. The WM standard way to manage memory is to bring up the memory application and manually close each program; the ASUS built-in capability is very nice, though one can find this enhancement in after-market utilities.- Built in software to show the system status. This is an icon that stays in the icon tray; when clicked it shows USB status, screen status, memory status, storage card status, and battery status, all in a nice bar chart format. Clicking a status brings up either the application or the file commander for that function.- The USB can be set to either Turbo activesync, normal activesync, or "Mass Storage Device" (which is supposed to make the phone act like a standard USB card reader). I had to update my Windows Vista drivers to get this "card reader" to work, but XP recognized the drive immediately. I have no idea what "turbo activesync" is; either activesync setting appear to work fine with my desktop computer and MS Outlook.- Built in "Location Courier" software to automatically send an SMS to people based on your GPS location. I haven't tried this one yet. I'm not sure I see the point. I don't know why one would want to SMS people to let them know your Lat/Long, unless you were trekking in the wilderness - but then where would you get GSM phone reception in the wilderness? Anyway, it is an interesting application.- Built in "Travel Log" software that allows you to annotate a route you have taken. You can set routes and points of interest. This data can then be exported and displayed on a Google map. I have not tried out this software other than to see that it loaded and connects to the GPS.- Included navigation software for the GPS. Maps for all North America are included. The software has voice prompts and seems to work well.- Built in "GPS Catcher" software. This goes out to the Internet every three days and updates the position files so that the GPS acquires the satellites faster. In practice the satellites acquire within 30 seconds or so here in Los Angeles.- Built in application launcher software. This is started when the system is booted, and has icons on the screen that divide the software into categories like "GPS", "OFFICE", "FILES", "GAMES", etc. You can add programs to the various folders, and re-arrange the order of the programs. Closing this application brings up the normal WM6 "Today" screen.- Built in application to backup data to the storage card.- Support for synchronization with Exchange Server.- Built in custom software to block incoming callers by phone number. I haven't used this one either.- Built in news reader software (I haven't used this one yet).- Built in "ASUS Switcher" program. This program will either switch between active programs, or bring up a small dialog listing four programs to run. You can put up to four of your favorite applications on this button; the available programs are apparently tied to the Asus Launcher "Applications" folder. Thus if you setup the Launcher to have your custom programs in "Applications", you will be able to select them on the "Switcher" program. This is apparently not documented at all. You can also select from various pre-configured programs to assign.- Special "Today" screen plug-in modules for Wireless settings, Windows Live, and profiles.- Microsoft Compact Net Framework is pre-loaded into the memory. So the user should be aware that there is no need to install the CF NET - applications that require this support software will run. This saves a couple of Mb of room on the storage drive. I'm not sure if this is a WM 6 norm or specific to the P527, but it is a good feature.- The device has profiles built in; these will change the volume and ring levels based on "normal", "meeting", "silent", and "automatic". The automatic setting reads the outlook calendar and sets the "silent" profile based on the appointments. However, one cannot add profiles, and the profiles cannot be cusomized other than to set the volume levels to be used with each built-in profile.- Built in software to automatically setup either T-Mobile, AT&T;, or Rogers (Canada) GPRS settings. This worked like a charm for T-Mobile.- 2 Mega pixel camera with autofocus. It takes pretty good quality pictures with good light, and cycles fairly quickly (about 1 second to store to an SD card). I can store about 4000 pictures per Gb of MicroSD card. Taking a picture is a two stage affair; press once to focus and then press again to take the picture.- Built in FM. I have not used this one yet. The radio will not work unless the wired headset in plugged in (it functions as an antenna).- Built in icon on the "Today" lower status bar to change toggle landscape mode. Note that this only goes clockwise (and back), so the screen cannot be rotated in all directions unless after market software is loaded.---------------------------------------------Cons:- The device has the minimum CPU requirement for WM6, which is a 200 MHz processor. This helps with battery life, but the screens sometimes take a half second to a second to appear, and occasionally longer. The device takes a long time to boot up as well. While everything works fine, it is not a speed demon. Videos will display fine, however (I have only tested video from the storage card, not streaming video from the Internet).- The device also has the minimum WM6 ROM/RAM: 128 Mb / 64 Mb. All of that nice "pre-installed" software I listed above is residing in that ROM memory. The bottom line for the user is that a completely clean factory default will give approximately 28 Mb of ROM storage and 26 Mb of RAM available. I was forced to place as many programs as possible on my MicroSD card instead of internal memory. Once I had installed all the programs I usually want, plus a few ring tones & etc., I was left with 11 Mb of internal ROM and about 21 Mb of RAM. So basically this device can run only a couple of applications at one time. I recommend using the built in utility that changes the "X" button to actually close programs; otherwise the user will run out of RAM very quickly. The IGO software takes 12 Mb of RAM to run, and generally needed to be run by itself (though I don't have any idea why one would run other software at the same time). To keep ROM memory available, I changed the system registry to load the temporary internet files on the SD card, but the Outlook data files and messaging files are stored in main ROM. I don't use the built in messaging, having a freeware email program which resides and stores files on the MicroSD card, but be aware that the default WM6 applications will need ROM to store the ".vol" files for the calendar and messaging. If you are into downloading, I recommend that you get a utility that will allow you to change the download location; Pocket Internet Explorer downloads to main ROM. The small amount of RAM helps with battery life, but it is a pretty severe limitation.- No "3G" support. In my case T-Mobile does not have third generation (3G) data capabilities, so the EDGE function is all I would have used anyway. The phone supports GPRS (about 40 bps, equivalent to dial-up speeds), or EDGE (140 bps). Web browsing is slow unless you are visiting mobile sites, which is about all I do on my phone anyway. If you are looking for fast 3G connections, this is not the phone for you!- It is POSSIBLE, not confirmed, that there MAY be an issue with high density microSD (HDSD) cards. I bought a Kingston 4 Gb card for use with the device, but within a day the phone was having problems recognizing the card unless it was pulled and re-inserted. Eventually the card was simply not recognized, and I had to format it. The Asus support website has a small software update file to help support high capacity HDSD cards. I installed this software the moment I got my phone, but it did not appear to help. I subsequently did a factory reset on the device, and the same issue happened with or without the software patch. In the end I got a 2 Gb MicroSD Sandisk card, which has functioned fine. I got this card because it is the brand and size used by the IGO GPS navigation software, which comes on a separate MicroSD card. I cannot confirm that it wasn't just the brand of card; 2 Gb is plenty of storage for me (I don't use the phone to listen to music), so I didn't pursue the topic. Maybe other brands or sizes of cards would work.- The GPS software will only run on the supplied 2Gb MicroSD card, and the software is tied to that card. Since the maps are also on the card, one is left with about 300Mb of storage, which isn't much. Since there is so little internal ROM storage, I am forced to use a separate MicroSD card to store my programs, and then when I want to do GPS navigation I have to swap cards. This is a hassle - the GPS software should be either transferable or come on a larger card.- I don't know if it is the battery or the phone, but the device is supposed to present a green LED when the phone is charged. It doesn't work; the LED will stay red until the cows come home. The battery will charge to 100%, but no light. I have ordered a new battery and will report back on this issue.UPDATE: I purchased a 1600 Ma Battery and this one does show the green light when fully charged. I don't know if this means the original battery is a bit defective, or if the phone is somehow calibrated to the larger battery!- I am having trouble with the WiFi connection to the internet on my home wireless router. I don't subscribe to the T-Mobile Hotspots, so I don't know if this issue is with my router, WM6, or the phone itself. Basically, the phone will connect to the router, but after a minute Internet Explorer will no longer be able to get to web pages. I have seen this issue on many blogs as relating to WM6, but the solutions they suggest do not appear to work on the P527 (evidently many WM6 phones have a "connection manager" that includes power settings for the WiFi - this phone has a "Wireless Manager" instead). I have reported this to Asus tech support, and we'll see what happens. However, the GPRS EDGE connection is very stable and rock solid.- Some people might prefer a higher resolution camera. 2 mega pixels is a bit low these days. Also, there is no flash capability, so low light pictures are not of exceptional quality.- The Jog wheel is not actually a wheel; it is wheel shaped, but actually is more of a slider that also has a press to activate function. I found that it was somewhat difficult to use the "up/down" without also pressing the button. I suppose the spring is a bit lighter than the jog wheels I have used in the past.--------------------------------------------------Summary: With all the compromises listed above, I still like the phone.I think it represents a good balance of battery life and performance. I do not generally keep a lot of applications open at once in any case, so the lack of RAM is not as big an issue as it might be for some. Still, I think that 256 Mb ROM / 128 Mb RAM might have been a superior design, even at the cost of lower battery life.------------------UPDATE: There is a firmware upgrade for this phone on the Asus website support section. Be sure to go there, register your phone, and install the update. They have supposedly fixed the issues with HDSD microSD cards. They also modified the automatic setup for GPRS; the T-Mobile now has options for either WAP (T-Zones, included with all T-Mobile phones) or Internet (which requires a data plan). The version number is a lot higher than the version that came with my phone; the new version is V4.1.23-WWE, dated 30 Jan 2008.---------------UPDATE: The new firmware does not appear to fix the issue with my 4Gb Kingston microSD card.---------------One Month Later:There are a couple of things I REALLY like about this device:1. The sliding phone lock is GREAT. I can be in an application and simply lock the phone, then come back to the same screen by sliding the button to unlock. This is much better than simple buttons or software switches.2. The Bluetooth ON/OFF hardware switch is invaluable. It makes it simple to activate the BT for my vehicle handsfree, then shut it off when I leave the car.Other notes:1. The NAV software turns out to be very good in practical use. I have had an issue where I have to tell the software to search for the GPS device, but it works after that.2. Plan on charging the battery every day if you use any Wi-Fi or extensive GPRS at all.3. The phone is slow to initially bring up a program, but then it functions well.
This phone is absolutely ideal for an all purpose yet compact unit. The music player feature is fantastic and supports up to 2gbs of music (it came with a 1gb SD micro card), the built in speaker is loud and easy to share music with or enjoy it on your own. The Bluetooth playback over stereo headphones is fantastic quality and easy to use!Many of the features on the phone are well design and incredibly easy to use, controls that first seemed somewhat bulky and obnoxious to get a hang of were easy to learn and the functions even more powerful and customizable then what I was used too before hand. The battery life is absolutely excellent and will last many, many hours in playback mode.All in all, a fantastic phone. You can still get it as a free upgrade for the 2 year renewal and with a new T-Mobile account and its worth it. The phone design is so nice and compact and it alleviates the need to carry a cellphone and an extra mp3 player in one sleek, sexy package.I can't recommend it enough, fantastic phone!
It works great. Loud speakers, Quadbands meant can be used anywhere in the world with GSM network.
This is one awesome little phone. First of all the screen is the brightest and most detailed I have found on any phone. In the store it is so bright it just screams at you. I have found that reducing the brightness to 70% is more than adequate. If you have trouble reading a phone in direct sunlight, fear no more. As for features, there are just too many to mention. I first learned about it from the Toyota website as I just bought a Prius. It is one of the VERY few phones that will integrate seamlessly with the car. It can even upload its phone book via Bluetooth to the car. Most phones (except smart phones/PDA's) will not. They are also 3 times the price. It has a great sounding MP3 player. It is stereo Bluetooth, FM radio...I could go on and on. There are some great themes free online so you can customize away. If there was one gripe it would be that it doesn't come with an M2 memory card which it needs if you are going to load up on music and photos. I can't complain though as this phone is very affordable. Some complaints I have heard are that the number keys are too small. Well, I'm 6'2" and about 280lbs. (not a small guy) and I don't have any problem getting my fingers to work the buttons. The other complaint I have heard about is battery life. Well I have talked and talked and played with this thing for 3 days now, and the battery is still more than half. I'm not sure what people think is good, but after my RAZR...pffft...this thing is great. My techie coworkers were amazed by the display and all agreed that it was unbelievably bright. I would recommend this jewel to anyone who wants a great phone that has a lot of cool features. It blows away the Samsung SCH-a737 and the LG Shine. Go to a local AT&T; store and play with one. Then buy one at whatever outlet suits you.
I have now been using this phone for almost seven months and I am pretty happy with it (AT&T; Pay as you Go service). Some observations ...Pros:- Very comfortable and small. It feels good in hand. Nothing about the device looks cheap.- Awesome voice quality and no dropped calls.- The screen display is very bright and colorful - the best I've seen of any device so far.- Decent bluetooth integration, though I do experience some dropouts. Bluetooth MP3 functionality (fast forward, next track, etc) is acceptable, but not great.- Sports functions (like a pedometer) which work fairly well.- Well designed menu structure and lots of functions to tweak.- Good quality radio with RDS.- Very good speaker quality.- Great organizer functions, with a well designed Alarm.- Nicely customizable themes and startup/shutdown animations (yea this is important to me!).- Good internet browser.Cons:- Proprietary USB and Headphone jacks. I just don't get it! And naturally in this case you cannot listen to music and charge the phone at the same time.- Proprietary memory stick expansion slot. MS is slow and expensive - total waste of money - but no choice on this phone.- Firmware bugs ... too many to mention here, and no hope of getting them fixed.- No way to organize contacts into folders.- For an 'mp3' player, actual mp3 function is very basic. Depending on the firmware you get, you may not even be able to listen to an album in track order! There is no gap-less playback either.- Horrible battery life. With BT turned off, and not using the phone AT all, the battery drains within 5-7 days.- SE's sync software. That software barely works, especially via Bluetooth. I pretty much gave up on it.Useless features:- The 'shake' feature which uses internal accelerometer to switch or shuffle tracks is cute for a little while - but there is really no point to it.- The cool colored lights on the side. They would actually be handy, but a recent firmware bug reverts them to a puke-green color upon use of the Walkman - useless.Bottom line is that for its primary function, this is an excellent phone, with basic MP3 and digital camera support (do not expect anything amazing here), and I have really enjoyed using it. I however had to de-brand it from AT&T; to enjoy full benefits of the device.
I have had the w580i for 1 year, 2 months now and I have enjoyed using the phone and most of its features.  However, during that time I have experienced several quality issues.  One of them (the ear speaker died) was probably isolated to my unit.  But I also had my keypad crack twice. The cracked keypad seems to be a common issue with this model, just search online about it.  I had to send in the phone twice for warranty repairs. Now, the left soft keys (select/back) have stopped working. Another search revealed this to also be a common flaw also.  My warranty has run out, so Sony Ericsson will not fix this.  Fortunately, there is a workaround by pushing hard on the area between the navigation keys and the LCD screen (where there is either the 'W' logo or the at&t; logo), then the keys will work.The bottom line though is that this phone has some serious quality flaws and therefore I do not recommend purchasing this model anymore. I give it 2-stars since the phone is still a very nice slider design with excellent software/interface.
I bought this phone because it had Walkman FM radio, too. This phone is pretty (I got the PINK one), lightweight, has lots of whiz-bang menu selections, but doesn't wow or impress me as much as the Samsung A737 or Samsung A747 models which I bought for my children. I listen to the radio a lot, more than MP3s and really thought this feature would be cool.  If you like effects, it has 16 settings for flashing light patterns customized for every caller.  It takes a day to find out how to set the patterns in all the menus....The keypad is a bit on the small side, and feels like dry plastic.  It's OK for me because I have small hands, but I don't think a man would enjoy using the small, non-descript keys. The letters on the keys are hard to see being so small.  When I enter text, I still have to look--er, squint--at the keypad.  I don't pay for texting service, so it's not a huge hassle, but if you text, I can't imagine it would be much fun.When I enter an phone number in the address book, it doesn't put hyphens between the area code, prefix, and last four digits.  That's not fatal, but a pet peeve, and makes it difficult for me to figure out the numbers as they come up.The M2 Memory Stick is not common, but Sony Ericsson uses it.  They supply a 512MB one.  Buying one with more memory will not be cheap.  The access slot is on the top.  It took me a while to figure out how to open the little, flat plastic door.  Which side to open? It doesn't have a flap, can't open with a fingernail, so I use an unfolded paper clip or other similar-sized object to pry it open.You need the wired earphones to have FM service.  If you like radio, it's just one more thing to carry around.  The sound quality is EXCELLENT on this wire unit and the ear buds very comfy. It also works as "handsfree" phone device if you don't want to do Bluetooth.The display, although narrow, is bright and sharp. The sound is good, and it interfaces well with my Bluetooth earpiece and Palm device. The phone is very lightweight and slim.  I dropped it a few times but the case didn't scratch or crack.  The pink IS pretty, and has little red "jewels" between the number keys (other color models have different color jewels).  The speaker phone option works well and is clear to hear. The slider is a little unusual to work at first, but works very nicely. Sony Ericsson phone support is SUPER, too.
I recently sold my iPhone and bought the Sony Ericsson W580i. This cell phone is amazing. It is by far the loudest cell phone I have ever owned. Ringtones sound very nice and clear, and so does the music.
This is my first foray into pre-paid telephone plans in the US. After using my mobile phone as my only phone for the past few years, I found that my new house has absolutely no signal coverage. So it was time to abandon the monthly plan for something less expensive and Virgin Mobile seemed to have the best deals available in my area. I grabbed a Flare and a $90 topup card and was ready to go.On-line activation was a snap (and offers some bonuses that aren't available if you call the service center to activate) and my phone was on the network within 2 hours of activation. The $90 topup card provided a year's worth of service (meaning I'll never have to top up again in the next 12 months to keep my phone active) as well as approximately 1500 minutes when all bonuses were applied.  All things considered, it wasn't a bad deal--I was paying more than $40 a month for 300 anytime minutes and free nights and weekends on my old phone. (Virgin does offer a similar plan with daily and monthly fees if you want to go that way--I didn't since my usage pattern is definitely going to change now.)As for the phone itself, well, it makes phone calls.  I don't download much stuff on my phone--the occasional ringtone and wallpaper--and I don't surf or text much either (even when I had unlimited surfing and texting) so my chief concern is how well a phone works as a phone and how easy it is to get my phone directory into it. I have to say I was very pleased on both counts.  Calls sound fine and signal strength is good.  The volume is easy to adjust and the phone is quite loud when turned all the way up (I hate phones that are too quiet).My only quibble is with the keypad.  The keys are rectangular, but the buttons under them are round, which creates deadspots on the keys, so as I type I have to feel for the little bump to make sure my button press will register. (I have large fingers and use the edge of the tip of my thumb ... the keypad might work well for smaller hands.) However, the bright screen and color contrast make it very easy to read what I'm typing, which in my book overcomes the weaknesses in the keypad.This isn't the best mobile phone I've ever owned, but it's a sub-$30 phone and to compare it to a phone costing 10X as much would be unfair. On a per-dollar basis, I am very pleased with the LG Flare.Pros--Inexpensive to buy (and replace, if necessary)External LCD screenScreens are bright and easy-to-readOne-touch account balance, call log, messaging, set up, and vibrate/silent modeVoice-activated dialing and volume control on outer edgeBluetooth compatibleVirgin Mobile plans allow a meager $60 upfront topup to activate for an entire year (the $90 card I purchased is not necessary)Customizable ringtones can be set for each person in directoryMultiple phone numbers per person in directoryIntuitive menu systemCons--Cheap feel to housing and keypadNot much variety in pre-loaded ringtonesMediocre stand-by battery life
If you live your entire life in your phone, expect it to be your back office, photo album, secretary, and mother, perhaps you need to look further.  But as a phone, the LG Flare's great!It's small, sleek, clear, and has enough features for you to communicate easily in today's world.  I hate cellphones, and carry one only because of my job. This Flare is the least onerous of any phone I have encountered.  Works well as a speakerphone, has an outer screen, holds a charge well, was easy to set up, and doesn't bulge in my clothing.  And no pain-in-the-butt photos of the kiddies to cart about! Great phone!Virgin Mobile is not bad, either.
Well, I was so anxious for a bluetooth phone, I bought the Flare. I couldn't beat the price for something with that technology, and the only reason I want bluetooth is for to use wireless headsets at last! For this I deactivate my perfectly good MTV Edition V5 Slider, and after an afternoon of entering my address book on a new phone, I already miss having a Kyocera.Right now, Life's not so Good. Before, with my V5, all I had to do was push the up button for my balance, and the right button to set the phone to vibrate, along with the usual on/off buttons. With the LG Flare, I have to push a menu button, find the "my account" button, wait for it to launch a browser, which is scary because I have no intention of paying for web content. Then, once the balance shows, without warning like my Kyocera did, you hit the red phone to get out of it, and the web browser icon remains on the phone. I hate that! You go through just about the same rigmarole to set the phone to vibrate. The owner's manual doesn't even mention vibrate in the index, so I'm better off downloading the PDF from Virgin Mobile's website so that I can keyword search the document! I've managed to turn down the funky ringtone volume (I miss my Kyocera ringtones, too - I don't want rap music on my phone!) Entering text is a headache no matter what phone you have, so re-entering my contact list is once again a chore. I learned my lesson from my first VM phone, though, and I only put the important people in! It's a lot to get used to, and a downside to phones with no SIM card. But I don't need complicated phones! I need 'em to make and take calls, and that's it.So why did I buy it in the first place? As mentioned before, the opportunity for a wireless headset which my beloved Kyoceras don't have. Also, the phone is a handsome little thing! It's about the same size as my slider when closed, but it not as thick. When the clamshell is opened, it gives the impression of being a much bigger phone, which I like. I've set the backlighting to dim, but when an incoming call comes in, a window lights up on the outside of the clamshell where the time is.One thing I did notice is the time it takes to get going when it's been turned on. It says "HELLO" in big letters, almost like my JVC XV-N40BK Progressive-Scan Slim DVD Player (Black) did, and when you turn it off, it says "BYE" in big letters that show up on both the inside and the outside screen. It's gimmicky stuff that I think is actually kind of neat.After two days I don't yet know if I'll keep it - almost as soon as I bought this I heard of a new slider phone coming for Virgin Mobile made by Samsung! Maybe one day Kyocera will make a bluetooth slider for Virgin Mobile - BESIDES the Slider Sonic - that doesn't cost too much that I can love. I'll never pay $100 for a phone, whether it's landline or wireless. I loved my cheap little slider - and sliders in general. But, after three phones with Virgin Mobile, first the sturdy K9 Royale, then my trusty V5 slider, this is my first non-Kyocera phone I've had in the four years I've been with Virgin Mobile. Maybe I'll learn to like it more as I live with it. I'm willing to give it a chance in the meantime. I've heard good things about LG, so we'll see.  One thing about Virgin Mobile phones - if I don't like it, it won't cost me a two-year contract or an arm and a leg to change it!
I originally purchased Virgin Mobile's $20 phone, the Kyocera TNT.  Although the phone was cute, the screen resolution was VERY poor and the sound quality was tinny.  In order to hear your phone messages through the speaker phone, you had to turn the phone backwards because the outbound sound was emitted from a speaker faced to the outside of the phone.Sound quality is much improved with this LG Flare. For only $10 more, this phone has a M4 audio quality which is the highest that you can get. The screen is also clearer and brighter.  After a week of use, there are only two things that I would change:  skip the little door that covers the port for the battery recharger and update the look of the exterior to mimic the TNT (snazzy color, rubberized exterior, etc.)
If you don't want to be bothered with service contracts, roaming charges, and spotty coverage, this is the service for you. Granted, I'm not a heavy cell phone user, so the convenience of this plan is great. I've had previous services where I spent more on monthly fees and roaming charges and had less coverage than I do with Virgin.Virgin's plan is a common sense approach to cell phone service.
I wanted a blue tooth phone but did not want to pay a lot since I am trying to be economical and this is a good deal for the price.  I have no problem with the phone whatsoever.  You get what you paid for and I have received a good deal for the price of the phone.  If you are looking for an economical solution to blue tooth this is it.
yet another charger i need to buy? UGGH - nice and cheap - limited ring tones
activated m little virgin mobile phone made things very good for me and the price was great!
So far I like my new  cell phone.  I have had quite a few compliments on it.  I did't need anything fancy, because I do not use a cell phone alot.  It is still new to me so I need to give it a month or so to  really know if I will keep the service.
I purchased this phone for the price and having it be my first bluetooth!I was deciding on keeping Tracfone..my Kyocera K126C is great...or switching to Virgin. After 2 days of trying to download a Virgin website ringtone on my new Flare..kept getting message on phone and website stating.."log-in failed". Virgin has been trying to fix this for over 2 weeks now. If they can't remedy the problem very soon. Im sticking with Tracfone. I have the dbl min for life on my phone and I believe it IS cheaper than Virgin when push comes to shove..Oh the Flare phone?..its okay..nothin' to write home mom about!
LG Flare does the job. I didn't try blue tooth. Good rate at $20=200min. phone card.
THIS IS JUST A GREAT LITTLE TELEPHONE! IT HAS ALL THE FEATURES I NEED AND IT'S THIN AND COMPACT AND IT FITS IN THE SMALLEST POCKET ON MY RUNNING SHORTS. I ALSO LIKE THE GRAPHICS AND STORAGE CAPABILITIES. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BE WITH YOU.Canon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Silver)
its a pretty decent basic phone the blue tooth is cool but it doesnt work with the lg data cable i bought
When I bought this phone back in Sep. 08, I expected great results from the phone.  After all, I figured, 'It's an LG'.  Little did I know, months later, that I would run into all sorts of problems like not being able to dial overseas and constantly running out of minutes (which always felt more than $0.20 a minute).  These turned out to be my pet peeves because I bought the phone for those main uses but when they didn't work out as planned, I kept thinking that I should have kept my regular Sprint phone plan, rather than to buy this nearly useless phone.  I found that since Sep., when I first bought the phone, I've "topped up" or filled up my prepaid phone minutes ($20 for 200 minutes, $30 for 400 minutes, $50 for 1,000 minutes) more than I wanted to or even expected to- 5 or 6 times, rather than just 3 or 4 times.Don't get me wrong.  The phone's got some good features like easy text messaging, some limited internet access, and up to 3.5 hours of talk time which would temp any new buyer.  Unfortunately, the phone does not use cell phone minutes wisely.  It eats them away like those cheap, overrated calling cards.  If you're a big talker who likes to keep in touch with friends all the time, your best bet is to get a monthly plan, maybe with a company other than Virgin Mobile.  Buy this phone only if you're more of a clam and use the phone rarely like asking about the occasional bill or calling 911 for something.  Maybe then, you can make those cell phone minutes worth every overrated penny of what they're worth.  In fact, if I know then what I know now, I think I would've strictly gotten a phone card.  Think twice before buying this phone!
The LG Viewty is a very expensive phone. But I will not get into that, I think, judging by its offerings, its worth the money.The phone is very well designed, and I guarantee you'll be astonished at its relatively thin design and screen size. The full thing was much smaller than I had expected. I like the looks of the chrome outlining around the phone, but it would've been nice to have the bottom buttons off the screen in chrome too, like the Prada. BUT this chrome outlining is actually just a little thick and does chip over time.The camera lens inconveniently DOESN'T have a lens cover, a rather strange move. The glossy front and matte back are nice and the chrome buttons on the side only compliment the phone. There is only one side of the phone with buttons, while the other only has a jack for the USB cable/Headphone adapter/Charger. But it has a sliding cover, much better than those rubber things usually.The phone looks great, but the microSd card is located under the battery. Its both good and bad. Another slot on the phone wouldn't look great, but then again, removing the battery is irritating.Turning the phone on, your greeted with an LG icon, as you wait around 30 seconds for the phone to start up. Luckily, there is no initial lag after start up.The menu's are VERY simple and easy to use. You are immediately prompted to activate your Sd card, and export your contact list on your SIM to the phone. Worked fast and efficiently.The menu is slightly similar to the iphone. There are 4 main icons  on the main screen. THey are always there, either horizontally or vertically on the screen. Within each is a different shortcut. The first one takes you to the apps page, like on blackberry's.  The second one allows you to call.  THe 3rd is a mail shaped icon that takes you to texting and emailing, conveniently located in the same shortcut. The 4th one is your contacts list. The original menu is black and white, but there are plenty of themes, user made or not, that can be installed, some mimicking the iphone, others the blackberry, etc. The screen is originally decorated with the 4 shortcut buttons, a clock, and the bar strength/battery life/profile settings, but can be littered with a full calander, blu tooth/music settings, and a digital or normal clock and even a Fish to move around the screen.Call quality is amazing on this phone, better than my high quality home phone! Even at 1 bar, people sound crisp and clear and several times people have wondered, during a conversation, how I sound so clear on my cell. Even with the included headphone adapter for music, which has a mic in it, I sound clear and loud.Texting is very easy, but takes some learning and getting used to. You need to understand how the QWERTY board is different from normal ones, but it works, very well actually, once you fully grasp a hold of it.The 3.0" screen is beautiful and colorful, with nice contrasts and brightness.  But the touch screen is just touch and not thermal like the itouch/iphone. It works well, very well, better than the Nintendo DS or Prada. But not quite as touch screen sensitivity defining as the iphone.Video is amazing. Simply put. Depending on the video, if you put in a good quality video you'll love the results. DivX, h.263/4, MP4, WMV, and MPG,Music quality is great, and the music is organized exactly as it would be on a normal iPod. There is no lag, and it shows album art, features fowarding/rewinding, and music minimizing so you can use other apps while listening to your music, key features no other phone, even music based phones offer, other than the iPhone.But this is no music phone, its a camera phone. Besides the awesome game support (full 3d graphics, guitar hero works!) , great music support, awesome video player, etc.Its AMAZING. I've never owned a phone with a camera this beautiful and sophisticated. It actually has a really, really, really, good lens. You could take 1MP photo's, and they'd appear better than some 2.0 MP compact camera's!A plentiful variety of options await you as you turn on the camera. The camera part of the phone is almost entirely separate. As soon as you click the camera button or enter it via menu, the phone options, music, its all gone, and it seems like a camera and only a camera. The xenon flash works fantastic and in horribly lit situations, the phone performs reasonably well, although it isn't the greatest. But some ISO level tweaking, and white balancing working helps a bunch. Initially, although I was impressed, I expected better from the renowned lens developer. But I realized that by default the phones camera is not set as optimally as you'd want it.The video camera is even better, probably the best I've used, period. For the price, of course. It reaches resolutions of up to 640x480 or normal screen size of 320x240.It can also record at 120fps, which is very fun to play with. See a balloon pop, things dropping, cars driving by, etc.Originally it records at a stable 30FPS.The phone is absolutely great.It has some other faults though. there are other toys, like a voice recorder, FM Radio, a great HDSPA browser, etc.But no wifi, no quad band (tri band), no thermal screen, no lens cover, etc.I still definitely recommend the phone to anyone. Especially those in European/Asian areas. In America it works fine, but I live up in the mountains and around here, while the 850 band is present, 1900, which is all this phone supports in America, is not as profound. Around big cities/high ways/mostly everywhere except suburban/rural areas, it works great. And even at 1 bar it works fine.Definitely recommend it. And get a different screen protector and a case, the thing scratches a little easily.
This is a review for the newer version of the KU990 (also known as the VIEWTY), the KU990R. I live in the USA, so this phone is pretty rare, and it's expensive to buy, but it's worth the price.The difference between the KU990 and the KU990R is that the "R" version has a proper lens cover for the camera, while the 990 didn't. Also, some of the bugs have been worked out of the user interface and the scrolling functions. Other than that, it's the same animal as the KU990.Like the KE850 Prada phone, this thing is a work of art; it's got an attractive brushed aluminum battery door, aluminum buttons for the camera and image stabilizer/unlock key, and chrome accents. The case is also well-constructed and the fit and finish is very good. It's not that compact, but for what it is, it's reasonably small, about the same size and thickness as an HTC Touch, TYTAN, Tilt, LG VU, or T-Mobile Wing.Aside from being good-looking, the handset is functional. It's got a lot of useful features, and none of the complicated and superfluous bells and whistles of the Windows Mobile of Symbian smartphones (the VIEWTY isn't classified as a smartphone). It's got a 3 inch touch screen, so you can use a finger to navigate (LG includes a stylus that looks like a mascara tube, the stylus pops out when you pull off the cap) so you don't need a stylus. There's a multimedia player that handles several file formats, organizer, calender, planners, a virtual (landscape oriented) QWERTY keypad, T9 keypad, predictive text input, handwriting recognition, and photo/video editing utilities.There's also an awesome camera. This phone was built around the camera. It's a 5MP digital camera, and like the Prada, has Schneider Kreuznauch-certified optics. For those who don't know about Schneider's optics, think Swarovski, Leica, Minox, Steiner, and Carl Zeiss, and you get an idea of the quality. the pictures came out great, and the video recording is some of the best I've seen for a camera phone, besting even some camcorders! Some have said the camera isn't that great compared to Sony Ericsson's or Nokia's N95, and if you don't know how to use it, it's not, but there's a lot of adjustments you can make to it to improve picture quality.Calls came in loud and clear (on T-Mobile), and the touch screen works great (with haptic feedback). The loudspeaker isn't as loud as my Motorola ROKR E6's, but it's good enough.Overall, a unique departure from the mundane world of cellular gadgetry.I love it and I've only had it 3 days! Awesome handset in form, function, and design.
LG Viewty is a solid phone for anything from calls to photos and video shots, however it is completely stupid in a way how it handles network/internet access.LG Viewty asks you multiple times and round and round again if you will allow the program to access the network. Instead of just asking once and for all. Don't buy if you need solid internet phone. LG Support knows about this problem, but denies it as a bug and says it's a security feature !! haha. schmocks.
I have this phone it's amazing phone,exellent phone.Extraordinary,awesome.design,functionality like next generation phones.Buy it dont wait and dont waste your time, this is revolution.....exellent
Great phone, love it. Faster shipping than expected, will definetly purchase fromt his seller again.
We live in China where all cell phones are unlocked.  We purchased this phone when problems with a two week old V8 surfaced.  The V3i has been rock solid.We upgraded the memory card to store more tunes on the phone.  Installation of the upgrade worked first try.  Loading tunes was easy using Motorola's software.On a personal note, the buttons are large enough it's difficult to "fat finger" a number.All in all a great value.
I bought this on a whim. My dad's cell phone has a big crack in the screen so I figured I would upgrade him into something new. He's not a big gadget guy so there was no need for features like a camera or bluetooth or even a color screen for that matter.When I received the box I was a little shocked. First thing I noticed is the manual was in Spanish. This wasn't a big deal to me. I searched the web and found an English manual to download. This could really annoy others expecting a better out of box experience. The next thing that caught me off guard was the default language; it was also Spanish. Again, no biggie because the phone "speaks" to you when you power it up and asks you what language you want to select. Pressing "3" sets the language to English and you're set.Once powered on you can choose to keep the phone in "Voice Guidance" mode. This is actually a really user-friendly feature. After you push the Menu button (located to the left of the navigation pad) you can navigate through menu items with the pad and the voice tells you what menu item you are on. This totally makes up for the B/W screen and lackluster icons.Overall this is a great entry-level or emergency phone. The call quality rivals any phone I've used. Volume was loud and clarity was near-perfect.Pros:- Great signal strength- Crystal clear calling- Solid battery life- Slim profile looks more sophisticated than it really is- Speakerphone (press Menu button twice when on a call)- Voice guidanceCons:- Spanish manual and default language- Low-res, monochrome LCD screen (See customer images)- No modern bells or whistles- Kinda plasticky feeling- Not for TextersFor the price (Sub-$40) this can't be beat. Just make sure you know what you are getting into before you buy it.Only 4-stars due to the whole Spanish manual/language thing.
All I wanted was a simple phone that worked well and didn't cost a lot of money.  That is exactly what I got with the Motofone F3.  The phone I received was originally intended for use in Mexico and the box had been opened, but the phone was in new condition.  I inserted my AT&T; SIM card, powered the phone up and was greeted by a voice prompt instructing me to press 1 for English.  After setting the time and date the phone was ready to use.I was pleased that the Motofone F3 got better reception in my signal-challenged house than my old Samsung phone.  My phone is my watch, so I appreciate that the time is clearly visible on the electronic ink display.  A quick internet search will provide a list of configuration codes that can be used to modify phone settings.Motorola developed this phone for use in emerging markets, so the simple menu system is based on icons and optional voice prompts assist navigation.  I haven't disassembled the phone, but it feels like the internal electronics are shock-mounted.  The phone fits in my hand well and is solidly built.  I like its ease of use, good call quality, speakerphone and long battery life.  The one feature I do wish it had is mute.  This phone is capable of text messaging, but I don't consider it suitable for anything but occasional use.If you like camera phones, phones as fasion accessories or do a lot of texting this phone is not for you.  But if you need a simple, low-cost phone, this one is worth considering.
First, Ignore the comments from people complaining about the lack of features - that is EXACTLY what makes this phone different.  If you wanted a phone with a camera [that takes bad pictures], an MP3 player [with bad quality sound], a PDA [with crippled keyboard/software] or a GPS receiver [that takes forever to lock and eats batteries], then you should have known this isn't for you.  You would ignore anyone that would buy a minivan and then complain that it isn't a race car and you should also ignore anyone that buys this phone and then complains about what is missing.And almost everything IS missing.  It's a phone - a very good phone. An unpretentious device to make/receive calls and it does this better than probably 99% of the phones you can buy today.  It has great sound quality, a very large and easy to read display, and remarkable battery life.  If you need to send/receive text messages, it can do that, but the large display makes this a capability for occasional use only.For those of us accustomed to nested menus and linked feature lists, operating the phone  is almost too simple and most people trip themselves up in the beginning because they expect it be more complicated than it is.It will make a phone connection when other phones can't find the signal and it will hold on to the signal much better than any of the 'full featured' phones I've owned.  You can read it at night and in the noon day sun.  You can hear it in a car with the windows down.  You use it for a week without needing a recharger.(4 and a half hours of talk time and nearly two weeks of standby time).For what it is - you can't find a better value.  If you want a cell phone that will do everything but wipe your, uh, nose [but do it poorly], then you really shouldn't expect to get that from a phone that costs $33 outright without contract (and you know it...)The English Manual is available online and it is small because there isn't much to explain.To get it to ring (louder), simply push the UP button on the large, round rocker switch in the middle.  To ring quieter, or go into vibrate mode, simply pus the Down button until it vibrates.It IS a great device and a great value for making voice calls.
Pros:  I had one of these while in the UK and it had great reception in areas that others didn't...RAZR.  I am buying another one to use here in the USA.  It is hard to find just a "phone."  If you want a camera or music player, then it's not for you.  If you want a phone that works great as a phone, then this is the one.  The keys are similar to the SLVR or RAZR.  The display is large for those of us who need larger font.  Reception and battery indicators easy to read.  Several different ring tones.  Extremely LOUD and vibrate options.  Automatic key lock option.  Cons:  Dual band.  Hard to find head set accessories.
I am really impressed with this little phone. After taking my Ericsson W300i for a swim, I figured I didn't deserve a phone that cost more than, say, $34, so I took a deep breath and ordered the Motofone. Its everything I hoped it would be. Very simple, straightforward, and elegant even. Yes, the screen is weird, and reading or composing text messages takes some learning, but for the money its hard to complain.Though this phone is not feature-packed, it covers the basics and does everything very intuitively. Want to turn the volume down? Press the down button on the dial. Need a number from the address book? Press the address book symbol and then press the number key that corresponds to the first letter of the entry. You can't do text messages to multiple recipients or make fancy characters with the keypad, but it sounds great, is lightweight, has a vibrate mode, keypad lock, and long battery life. My wife paid $80 for a used unlocked RAZR and we both agree the Motofone is a much better bet.
*update a few months in*I was quite impressed to find that this phone survived a trip through the washing machine (and a call to it while it was in there).  I opened the back casing--you'll need a tiny torx screwdriver--and left it under a lamp for ~18 hours to dry it out, and it worked just fine afterward.  A pleasant surprise!**I did my research and knew what I was getting--a GSM phone designed for making calls and not for texting or anything else.  It's not clear to me whether I got lucky or whether Amazon has changed their sourcing, but I received a new, English-language, well-packaged box.The pluses, which I was expecting:  it's light, feels relatively sturdy, has easy-to-read screen, good audio and reception quality, and the default vibrate, then graduated ring loudness is very thoughtful.  At least with AT&T; in Atlanta, it also seems to auto-set the time and date when you power it on.  And popping my SIM from my old phone to this unlocked one without involving AT&T; whatsoever was very satisfying.The less good:  battery life is a bit less than I expected, reasonable or not (~5-7 days between charges with <5 minutes of talk per day); same optimistic reception bars (5 bars that magically go to 2 when a call drops) as most other phones; the phone book is pretty hard to navigate, especially when you have a lot of people (say, family) with the same first 7 characters in the phone book, or people with multiple numbers (no way to tag what's office and what's cell, for example).The annoying, because it could easily be different:  the default screen--in contrast with the image that Amazon uses--does not show the date, just the time.  There's no reason it couldn't, there's just nothing there, and no apparent setting to change that.  I didn't realize how often I checked the date using my phone until I couldn't do it.  Ack!For $30-$40, I think it's a pretty decent buy for an unlocked phone without much competition in its segment.
Was kind of nervous ordering this phone.  After reading some negative reviews about it, and the positive ones, I decided to go for it.  Glad I did.  My inital response to this phone was how sturdy it was.  I dont feel like i'm going to break it when I drop it.  Secondly, everyone is complaining about the interface, really, its not that hard.  I'm not the most tech savvy out there, but I do understand quite a bit about electronics, and it took about 20 min to become aquainted with the Moto F3's interface.  Its battery life and signal reception is superb compared to my previous samsung flip phone.  Lastly, the reviews about how cheap it was created, or the lack of the "options" this phone provides are really annoying to me now.  This phone is just that.  A PHONE.  You make calls, you recieve calls, and can do text messaging on a mid level scale, about 200-300 a month easily.All in all, if your after a main phone with out all the bling, this is it, or if your after a tank that you'll not break after dropping it once or twice this is your phone.
The problem with this phone is not with the phone itself, but with the definition of the word "phone". The word phone is now synonymous with "hand-held multimedia device", and though the two are vastly separate, the respective qualities of one are usually judged on its abilities as the other.Let's get this out of the way first: if you send more SMS texts then you have phone conversations, if you want streaming video, satellite radio, web-browsing, an MP3 player, and a flashlight... this is not the phone for you. You're not looking for a phone, you're looking for a multimedia device. Adjust your search accordingly.If, however, you are looking for a well-engineered device that performs the functions of a phone (with some extra trappings) without the clog of nested menus and useless features, this is the device for you.Call quality and reception are excellent. I receive multiple bars where previously I had none. Voices are crisp, and there is no static on either side of the call. The speakerphone is loud, and the mic sensitive enough that callers can't tell when I switch to the speaker.This devices still retains the most useful of phone extras:-phone book-SMS texts-date/time-alarm-speakerphonePhone operation is rewritten from the ground up. There are no shortcut keys, because actions by default are not difficult to access. Every feature is available immediately. Dealing with texts is even simpler. The phone displays each text in the order received, and at the end of each message you have the option to delete it. No complex memory management requiring nested menus to navigate. There are dedicated speakerphone and phone book buttons, and even a voice-prompt for those learning the new display. The only requirement regarding the interface is that the user unlearn what they previously knew about operating a phone.I would highly recommend this phone to anybody seeking a low-cost, high-performance phone. I would also recommend this phone to the elderly or tech-deficient, due to the ease of use and easily readable display.
I just received this phone yesterday, and I am very happy with it so far. The phone is actually better than I expected for the price. The important thing to remember is that it is a phone, and a very cool phone at that. It is extremely thin and definately has a "wow" factor. My phone arrived with english as the default language, and an english manual. I have read that many people received this phone with spanish manuals. The phone did look like it was repacked, but no damage at all. I use AT&T; in the New York area, and phone picked up the time and all my contacts when the sim was inserted after a few seconds. The message indicators work fine when I get a text message or voicemail, though there is no message tone, only an icon on screen. The ringers and speakerphone are loud and clear, and call quality so far is great. I really like the screen. In standby mode the time is so easy to see in any light. I think the important thing is to realize it is a phone. It is not for texting or internet.
I've had the Motorola F3 for about a month now, and I cannot imagine a more perfect phone for me. It does all the things a phone should do, and it does them very well: (1.) Strong Signal (2.) Long battery life (under my "normal" use, ie about five short calls per day, a single charge lasted me seven days--AMAZING!) (3.) Small and light, I hardly notice it's in my hip pocket (4.) Sturdy and durable, solid as a rock (5.) Easy to use and read: the e-ink display is as easy to read as ink on paper, even in direct sunlight.In the US, make sure you get the GSM 850/1900 version, which will work with AT&T;/Cingular and with T-Mobile. I have AT&T.; I transferred my contacts onto my SIM card on my old phone, put the SIM into the F3, and it worked instantly. The only drawback with AT&T; is that the cell towers don't correctly notify the phone that you have a voicemail waiting, so you don't get an icon to warn you about voice-mails. It does correctly alert you if you missed a call, though. I hope AT&T; adds official "support" for this phone in the future so that my voicemail icon will work properly. Otherwise works flawlessly.This is a minimalist phone. It can text-message if you need to, but it's a bit difficult to read and type text. It has a loud ringer, a vibrate mode, a loud speaker phone, an address book, and it works well for making phone calls.  That's it. No internet, no camera, no images, no music, no downloaded ringtones. This is the most inexpensive unlocked phone available anywhere, and thank you Motorola for making it such a high-quality product.
Motorola MOTOFONE F3 Black Phone (Unlocked, Intl. Version) no U.S. WarrantyI bought this phone because I wanted "just a phone".  This is as basic a phone as they come.  Complaints: battery life isn't as long as I had expected (a week in standby mode, max.); also, buttons are pushed too easily when it is bouncing around in my coat pocket.
This phone is a simple basic phone.  No features just a phone.  It does let you store phone numbers and does text message but the display shows some characters upper case and some lower case - you can't specify.  It's not simple to read.  The display shows up good and the more ambient light the better it looks (bright sunlight fantastic - not like most phones which you can't see in bright sunlight)  If you need just a basic phone this is the one for you.  Battery life is great.
This is an excellent phone if it is what you are expecting.  It has no camera, which is a plus for me; a highly readable display; good battery life; a solid keypad; good durability, and it has survived several accidents; and a decent interface.The only two things that I see as straight up disadvantages are the lack of Bluetooth (which is to be expected), and hard to find accessories such as a headset.  Other than that it is really like a phone from long ago.  It has a few menu items, but most of the settings that you do not change that often are hidden away under keyed in codes.At first you may think this is bad, but how often do you change the language or time format of your phone? I highly recommend this as an anti-iPhone.
It does phone calls and text messages. Nothing else.Great battery life and the most readable screen I have ever used. The only thing that took some getting used to is the single line display of text messages. I actually prefer it now.I'm using it with T-Mobile prepaid in the US. No problems of any kind.Highly recommended.
No camera, no web, no MP3, but great battery life, and fits easily in your pocket.  I take this phone when I can leave the BlackBerry at home.  Plus I didn't give the boss the number...
After putting my camera phone thru the wash (LG - it still works but no camera, and it hangs up now and then), I purchased this one.  I absolutely love it.  The battery life is phenomonal, the screen is very readable, the one touch speaker option is great, not to mention the size and weight of the phone.  It fits easily into pockets of jeans, jackets etc.  If you are looking for a sleek, easy to use phone (once you get the English manual on-line)this is a great choice.
I got this after my wife washed her RAZR in the laundry. I use Unicel in Maine and it was as simple as putting in the SIM card and charging it. A good cheap reliable no frills phone for the money. Very small and light, even thinner than my Motorola L6.
This is good phone. It is a phone, not an operating control for the space shuttle.the phone arrived in the appropriate cannister, but it seemed that it had been tampered with.  at least it appeared to have been glued together.  after one month of use the phone has come apart.  I believe this is a recycled phone and so I would not recommend that you buy from this company.finally, the phone is quite flimsy, if you put in in your pocket it will crack, if you drop it, it will break.  love the epaper, disappointed with the fragility of the thing.  imagine you are in the thirld world (the phone is designed to sell in poor asian and african markets), you put together a month worth of savings to buy this phone.  then while carrying out your daily labors the phone cracks, which is very easy to do...can you imagine the heartbreak.I will not rebuy this phone model, although I love MOTOROLA.
I got this phone because I wanted something smaller and lighter than my current phone, which had started having problems with voice clarity.  Since I only rarely used the extra features (mp3, text messages, camera) on my old phone, I wanted something which was focused on just being a phone.  The Motorola MOTOFONE F3 is almost exactly what I wanted.  It's small (almost as thin as an iPod Touch), light, and the quality of voice calls has been very good so far.  The menu system is very different than other cell phones, primarily because of the eInk screen, which has only two lines for text, and a row of icons for the menu.  It can take a little getting used to, but since there are not very many functions, I don't find that to be too big of a deal.  I imagine that reading/writing text messages would be difficult, but that's not what this phone is for... it's just a phone, best used just for voice.  And for that, it works very well.UPDATE:  Since getting this phone, I have started talking on the phone more, and wanted to get a headset for this phone.  I couldn't find one.  The packaging/manual makes it sound like one is available, but I couldn't find out how to get one.  So I upgraded to a recent Samsung... which is good since I am texting more now, too, and using the camera on the Samsung... which is impossible with this phone.  I'm keeping this as a backup, though.
It is a phone and it does work. Has the habit of losing contact with the SIM card, which will require you to remove battery and go thru the time and language set-up all over again. Besides that it works well and does what you expect.
Hi!!  Just wanted to add my opinion regarding this phone.  Don't buy it!I read ALL the reviews prior to purchase and was completely prepared for a barebone phone, no bells, no whistles...PERFECT.  What I received was a phone that was not unlocked.  It was branded TIGO thus requireing a pin subscription to access AND did not recognize my AT&T;/Cingulair Sims card.  After hours on line, a useless Motorola rep and AT&T; and no solution in sight...the phone is being returned.  If Motorola can't even figure out how to address the start up issues....and it's their phone....that's beyond ridiculous!  They recommended that I mail my NEW phone to them so that they can reset the system to one that I could use.  Thanks but no thanks!  I'm returning the phone and going to BestBuy to grab me an inexpensive disposable phone until my contract expires.Just hope I can save someone else all this hassle!If you order this phone there are no guarantees that it will be an UNLOCKED phone that you can use in the United States.Buyer BEWARE!!!
Amazon sent me a phone with a subsidy lock to TIGO.  I exchanged it for another.  It was replaced with a phone that had a subsidy lock to TIGO.  This isn't funny.
This phone is a complete waste of money, I read all the reviews and saw many complaints but most of them were about the features.  i just needed a simple phone for international use, features were not important.I purchased 3 of these phone and not one of them is still working.  They each died about 3-6 weeks after opening the product.
This phone is perfet for those who only make phone calls, and nothing else.  It is slim, and ultra-pocketable, the number buttons are large, but not too large.It seems to me that this phone does not exaggerate bars, meaning one signal bar is enough to make a reasonably clear call, although one signal bar is a rare circumstance for this phone, as it gets excellent reception compared with my two older phones (LG 1130, and a Motorola V3 RAZR).  Also, the battery status indicator seems to accurately portray how much time is left before charging is required (I ran it on 1 out of 5 bars out of the box for about 30 hours before deciding I should charge up).The screen is one of the easiest to read.  Daylight does not make this phone harder to read; in fact, more daylight increases the screen's readability.  Call quality is excellent with the exception of speakerphone mode, which is a little on the quiet side.Although this phone has a great share of positive features, primarily its affordable price-tag, it is guaranteedly not for everyone.  The main problem I have experienced so far is that the phone has no means of deleting phonebook entries.  Other problems are that the screen lacks the ability and complexity to display text similar to printed-text, and looks more like the readout of a calculator, with pre-set icons to indicate menu selection.  Because of this, letters (such as names) on the phone are displayed with CERTAIN CoMbINATIoNS oF CAPITAL ANd LoWERCASE LETTERS, regardless of which letters should actually be capitalized.Another issue I've had with this phone is that its more advanced settings require the use of certain button combinations to access. i.e. turning off the keypad sounds requires you to press the following combination ***250*^ and these combinations are only available in the phone's manual.  The other major issue is that this phone has no network update for date and time, which means that you'll have to enter the date and time when you start up and from that point forward it slowly becomes inaccurate over the course of several months, until you decide to re-enter the date and time.Overall, for someone who is looking for a no-frills way of making calls on a GSM network, this is an excellent phone, but for those who are more used to things such as a traditional color screen, and the option to do things other than text messaging and calling, this is definitely something to steer clear of.
If you want a plain telephone, without any extras, this is the ticket.  It is light and sturdy, has good battery life and a highly readable screen, good sensitivity and an excellent speakerphone.  I use my phone only occasionally and only for calls.  I have a T-Mobile prepaid account, and have been spending less than $5 per month over the last three years.  My original phone died, but I simply moved the SIM card over to the F3 the T-Mobile service started right up, calling list and all.  If you want to use your phone for text messages or browsing the internet, this is not for you, but if you want a cheap, easy to use and very serviceable GSM phone, I doubt if there is anything better available.One proviso:  Amazon lists this as an international version, and I guess this is true because I presume it can be used in Canada where I have used my T-Mobile service occasionally.  It may also be useful in Mexico and other countries in this hemisphere.  However if you want to use it in Europe you will be out of luck.  This phone runs on 850/1900 bands and in Europe  you will need 900/1800.
Do not buy this.  I ordered one - was locked.  Had amazon send me a replacement - also locked.  These phones are useless.  Don't waste your money.  The advertising is not deceptive - it's simply false.
Like others who've posted, I just bought one and it was sent completely and totally intact with a subsidy lock from some company called 'Tigo.'  Basically, amazon is advertising an unlocked phone and sending out phones that are completely useless unless you have a Tigo SIM card!  DON'T BUY THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON!
To anyone living or stationed in Afghanistan and possible IRAQ, dont buy this phone. It does not work with the Roshan SIMM. The vender has offered to take the phone back. But with the mail service here, it may be a while before I get a chance to send it back.  So just dont buy it.
This phone is good for what it is - a very basic, simple phone. It isn't mean to compete with the average fast-paced on-the-go businessman. I got it when it was first available, even though I could afford an expensive PDA phone. I'd give it a 5, but there are some issues with it -flickery refresh issues (due to e-ink technology)6x2-line displaymixed case textsI think if Motorola had spent a bit more time developing the character display to be a bit more flexible (ie, use pixels rather than segments), I'd give it a 5. It displays characters in mixed case because it cannot display some characters in upper or lower case.I like how it rings - when set to audible ring, it *slowly* ramps up to full volume, giving one plenty of time to answer before it makes itself known to others around you.It is ridiculously thin. I believe there are thinner phones out there... but for the price it is worth it.Finally, it just looks cool, and is very unique. It is one of the few products that uses e-ink, and for that it gets an A in my book.
I guess that i am rough on cell phones (6+ in the last 2 yrs) so I got this one as a disposable and thats what it is. It is obviously no frills and the "frills" it does have are pretty glitchy. It shuts down for no apparent reason and when it does, the time and date have to be reset. Not very often, but still a hassle. The menu is difficult to navigate as is the phone book. The battery does not last nearly as long as advertised and I must charge at least every other night.  on the other hand, it does have decent reception and call quality. the sleek design fits nicely in a pocket but is cheaply executed. over all, I probably won't buy another on when this one dies..
This phone is exactly what I have been looking for:  A simple phone without the bells and whistles. Namely, it makes phone calls and has an alarm. It also has text messaging but I would not recommend it if you're a major text-fiend as the interface is awkward.The Kindle-like E-Ink screen is easy on the eyes, plus the phone is supposedly very durable.  If you search You-Tube you'll probably find videos of people throwing this phone off of 3-story buildings and running it over with vehicles to still find it functioning.Despite being the OLPC of phones designed for 3rd-world conditions I did not find the battery life all that efficient.  This could be from the fact that I made this purchased with the understanding that it was new--it's wasn't!  IT WAS REFURBISHED and was originally set to Claro, a network available in South America.  Furthermore, I found the phone's box opened.  Upon inspecting the housing I noticed that there were subtle blemishes. The spot where the the SIM card went looked like it was broken and re-soldered.  This is why I did not give this review  five stars.  So be warned it may say new, but it isn't!In summary:  Great phone, but be suspicious of sellers.
My wife put her razor through the washer after we just started a 2 year contract with at&t.;  I gave her my razor (also new contract) and bought this one.  This was the cheapest unlocked phone I could find to replace it and I love it. I am a guy that does not need to text or take pictures and this is perfect.  Long battery life, big buttons, very easy to use.  Plus I travel internationally so this phone is a great deal for 30 bucks since it has gsm.  No complaints, I will never buy another phone again.  This is a great option for getting a new phone that works great without getting stuck in a contract.  Cell phone companies have an oligarchical vice hold on the market.....this cheap unlocked phone is a small way we can fight back.
I can't compare this next to any other phone because it's not like any other phones.  It is what it is.The fact is, if you are looking for a cheap replacement or a second phone it's the perfect item.  It's basically for making calls, although it can text.  Like someone stated earlier texting is a pain to deal with, but it works.  The major drawback is the voicemail feature.  Either it doesn't have one or I can't figure out how to work it on this phone.  If someone knows the answer post it please.The only thing I'm having a hard time dealing with is having the "OK" button as the left soft key.  Guess I'm just used to it being in the center of the D-pad.
This a perfect phone for me it has everything I need. It's perfect if you don't need a camera and all that stuff and just want something to call and receive calls and send text messages. It's nice small,light and thin. Good choice for me!
This is a good phone for anyone looking for basic services in their phone. Anyone whose fancy newphone is broken/not working this is the best phone you will find at this rate. Highly recommended.
This isn't an unlocked phone.  It costs money to unlock it.  If I had known, I would't have bought it.After I paid to unlock it I still wasn't satisfied.  It couldn't import all the numbers from my old card correctly.  I tried to type in my address book manually but that didn't work correctly either.  The phone looks really nice.  I wish it wasn't buggy and that it had been advertised correctly.
Wherever these things are coming from they are NOT unlocked.  Really stupid for Amazon to sell this thing...  Do NOT bother getting this as long as the current seller is pushing these things at these prices.I encountered the same problem where the Tigo phone system has locked "bloqueado" these phones.
Basic phone..not really good for txtng if you like to txt..Ive used it for like 2 months now and the battery is starting to give up, only take 3-4days for a full charge even if i dnt use it..used to be 5-8days bfor i charge it again..so that's the only problem i got so far..
Wanted a simple phone without all the extras to eat up battery life. With a display that I could read in all light conditions without the need for reading glasses. This phone is exactly what I was looking for. Opened the box put in my sim card charged the battery and voila! Highly recommended if you have the same needs I did and want a phone and not a multimedia/web device.Want to add that after reading some of the reviews mentioning the receiving of unlocked phones and resolution problems such as "seller not available" (many products available through amazon.com are offered by multiple sellers), I called amazon.com and they assured me the Motofone F3's they shipped were unlocked and that they purchased them directly from Motorola. So to eliminate any problems I made sure to purchase the phone offered by amazon.com _as the seller_, it wasn't the lowest price but I received what I ordered and there would have been no snags if I had needed to return it. Caveat emptor.
I purchased this on another website for a friend of mine who needed a cell phone without a camera, and without bluetooth due to corporate policy... The phone is not bad, except it does not do predictive text, and the menus aren't the most intuitive.. only has to charge the phone twice a week. Realize this phone was designed for some abuse and in places where electricity avalibility and tempratures/climate may be a problem (it does not use LiON or LiPoly due to the heat hazard (correction some versions of this model DO use a Li based battery). Sometimes it doesn't see incoming voice mails as avalible but other than that its a solid little no-frills well built calling device for GSM.. also the manual is avalible on Moto's website in english.. (its more of an instruction sheet)...
I really like this phone for its price, sound quality, style, battery life, clear display and signal strength.The only drawback for me is the limited text display. Reading contact info and text messages takes a lot of scrolling, it has a one-line display, sometimes showing only six characters at a time.Skip it if you do a lot of text messaging.Can you give your contacts short names, like "JohnSM" instead of "John Smith"? If you can live with that limitation, this is a real bargain.This is a really great phone. It is not a web browser, not an iPhone, camera or Blackberry. It's a phone.
I'm totally satisfied with my purchase, the phone arrived in a few days, andin a very good condition.I've just slided my T-mobile sim card and I was ready to go.The microphone and speaker of this phone are very good quality.I have an old Ericsson purchased in 2002,for $140, and the voice and speaker quality of the F3 are much better than the Erisson's phone.I am very satisfied with the phone and the price I paid.The only inconvenience of this phone are the letter and number formats which are sometimes hard to read.
I purchased this phone because it was $25 plush shipping and handling so I could save up enough money to buy a bells-and-whistles phone.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, this phone does auto-sync the time with a certain pink-themed carrier, and the phone book and messages stored on the sim card are of an adequate capacity for my needs.My only complaint is the alarm.  I haven't found a way to change the alarm ring, and it is REALLY loud after about a second of ramp-up from whisper quiet.  I also haven't heard the message tone ring once, but I've only had it for two days, so maybe sometime soon.Otherwise, great phone does what I need and actually looks pretty good.  Also, I don't know why they did it, but the picture isn't what you get, there is no date display and I haven't found how to activate one XOThere is one weird thing, there seems to be a rigid piece of metal suspended inside the phone, I guess it's the antenna.  It's not annoying, but interesting, like in the sense that you toss it up in the air like and inch and then catch it, it makes a little sproing feeling in your hand when you catch it.  Kinda fun.
This phone is great for when I am heading out to the bar or somewhere. I dont have to lug my company Blackberry around that I cant fit in my pocket. The call quality is the best I have heard on a phone and the signal strength is great (better than my Blackberry). No dropped calls yet! Dont expect to text much or listen to music on this phone but it functions great for what I need it for. Theres not many characters that can fit on the screen so you have to scroll over a lot to read a full text message. Its the thinnest phone made I think though and forget I even have it in my pocket when I am out and about. Great phone for a backup too!
This is not good. I bought this cause I like simple things, but to my surprise. I can't even use it. It says bloq ad0 not to mention talking to me in Spanish. So I guess it is not really unlocked as what its supposed to be, stated in the title. Not working for my at&t; sim and an international sim.I should not even gave it a single star because I haven't got to use it at all.
I got this phone a few weeks ago to replace my broken Sony Ericsson temporarily until I can afford a better cell phone.  For that purpose, it's an ok phone, but I'd never buy it just to have it.First I'll point out the good things. The call quality and volume are really good, and it looks pretty amazing, I'll give it that.  And I got lucky and both phone and manual are English. But really, that's about it.I think this phone's interface was probably made for the use of older generations or new cellphone users.  It has voice prompts and large numbers and words. The voice prompts are nice.  Without them you would probably never know what you were doing, because the menu is horrible. It is very limited, you can't do much at all, and there are no words, just a few little pictures that, without the voice or manual, you probably wouldn't know what they indicate. When there are words, say you are reading a text or in your phone book, they are so big they rarely even fit on the screen.  You have to pan over the right one word at a time. It's frustrating, to say the least. Sending texts is also a problem, for the same reason that the words are so big, and that the keys are not very responsive to fast clicks.  You have to type relatively slowly or you will end up mistyping.Over all it's ok if you need a cheap cell phone, don't understand or like the more complex ones, or need a quick replacement or backup like me. Other than that, don't buy it. I'll be getting rid of mine the second I get a new one.
I purchased Motorola Motofone F3 for my brother after his nokia N75 break down. The Phone is smaller and lighter than the Nokia N75.Its is very simple phone and menu systen not difficult to use, good to replace the phone. The Motorola Motofone F3 fits in my hand and I like its ease to use. Good call quality, speakerphone and long bettery life. I will buy one if my nokia N95 break down.
Ideal phone for someone who just wants a phone.Pros:* Great battery life* Large display* Solid call quality* Great reception* CheapCons:* Letters have only one case (no capital / lower-case)* Text-messaging is difficult (only one line of text displayed at a time, no character counter)* Can't delete individual items from call history* Can't change speed-dial numbersI personally like this phone a lot.  If you can get past the simple user interface, it's simple, sturdy and has good battery life.
I wanted to love this phone but it was not to be. First of all, the phone is pretty much as advertised. It is very basic, easy to use and physically small. It looks to be rugged and will most likely stand up to hard use. All the features (not many, I realize) are easily accessible. The sound quality and speaker phone are excellent. In summary, it's a no-nonsense phone for people who only want to make/receive calls and send/receive the occasional text message.Now the bad. In 2.5 months of use, the phone dropped many calls. Sometimes, the phone does not ring during incoming calls and the caller is sent straight to the voice mailbox. In those cases, due to a glitch with AT&T;, there is nothing displayed on the phone to signify that a call was missed or a voice mail is waiting for you. You have no clue unless you call your voice mail so you must do this quite regularly to check for missed voice mails. I realize this may be a glitch with AT&T; and may not apply to other carriers.Sometimes, calling the phone returns a message that service is temporarily unavailable in that area. I have no idea if this is the phone's fault but since the phone returns zero bars from time to time and drops calls, I have to assume the problems may be related.One may claim that some of these problems aren't the phone's fault. I can only respond that I have had a Nokia 6061 for years and under the same conditions, it has never dropped a call or exhibited any of these problems, so no matter what is causing the problems, the result is that the Motofone is not as useful or reliable as the Nokia.You may ask, with all these problems, why give it 2 stars? Simply because the design of the phone is unique and a breath of fresh air as compared to other cell phones. I'd gladly buy another such phone if the problems were cleared up and I hope they will be in time.
I have used this phone for about a month now and it is still going strong.  It is probably the most durable phone I have ever owned and I have owned quite a few.  It is a standard phone makes calls recieves calls and texts.  Texting is a little hard at first but once you get it it is better.  It took me a week to understand how to use all the different options but for the price you pay its just your standard phone.  Beware instructions are in spanish but there are online manuals for it.
This is the cel phone I always wanted: long battery life, rugged, simple to use, great sound quality, surprisingly good speaker phone, and very compact with out being difficult to hold or delicate.This is not a phone for people who text. It is not a phone for people who want to watch YouBoob videos. It is not a phone to send e-mail or do taxes on. It is not for people who like down-loadable games or ring-tones.If you like simple, rugged, reliable design, this is the best phone that I know of.I am using the phone with T-mobile pre-paid in the US, and have not had any problems. For the sake of comparison, I could not make or receive calls in my house with my Sony-Ericsson phone, but with the F3 I have no problems. It generally seems to hold the signal better than my old phone in all my "trouble spots" around town.If you do buy this phone, you can download the English-language manual from the Motorola site. Pressing "3" at the first prompt will set the language to English on most versions of this phone. If you want an F3 that is already configured in English as the primary language, buy from J&R; Motorola Motofone F3 Dual Bandor Motorola. But you'll pay $15 more for not having to press the "3" key one time.
It is not really unlocked. At least for my order. I brought this one to T-mobil, ATT and Sprint storys, the sales said this one is not unlocked at all.Can not find the seller and any contact information.Too bad, waste $40.Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Cell Phone--International Version with No Warranty (Black)
holy wow. this phone came in a can. the manual was in spanish. my first thought was that this was some sort of boot leg toy made in china and sold to vulnerable mexicans. then smuggled to the US via some NAFTA loophole. I was sad. This was my 5th phone in 3 years.I've lost phones and broken phones and was sick of throwing away the money.So i made the thirty dollar investment. After averaging it out, I am saving a decent amount of money:5 phones over 3 years = A new phone about every seven months2 free phones plus three purchased phones = almost $7005 phones over 3 years = $260 per yearif this phone lasts me seven months (which is my average thus far), I will have to buy another one before the year is up. But that has me spending $60, which is $200 less than I was spending.So what has this $200 per year savings resulted in? Well, a lot of sacrifices.For one, this phone is just about as advanced as an alarm clock. And looks like an alarm clock. no camera, no fancy ringtones, no games... just a basic digital display. It's thin and light weight, but they make toy phones filled with candy more sturdy feeling than this guy.So far, it's worked quite well, honestly. The limited display can't differentiate between capital and lower case letters, and it may take you a little bit to figure the whole thing out (spanish-only manual)... but if you are as tough on phones as i am, it might be a good choice.  I looked up extra durable phones before settling on this one, and realized thriftiness is my best option. considering i broke several, but also lost some, i would be especially cranky if i invested money in a phone that could withstand a 500 mph crash into cement, only to forget it in a bathroom stall.this phone is great or horrible, depending on what you're looking for. if you like novelty, it can make a great conversation starter. if you have standards, you might be disappointed. but if you have standards, you should want to spend more than $35
Hello,  Actually, I couldn't benefit from that device and I was not satisfied with your service. The device is locked where as it was written in the website that it is un-locked.
The phone came with one page of copied usage instructions.  No manual.The phone I received was a LOCKED cell phone.  I took it to two different AT&T; locations to try to get my SIM card to work, but they could not do it.  Both said the phone was locked.It is an incorrectly labeled product and completely useless.

 Length:: 1:35 MinsI ordered this phone as a emergency phone when I lost my previous phone and did not want to renew a contract. It did the job very well to serve as a backup phone until I did indeed find my old phone, the screen space is very limited, HORRIBLE FOR TEXTERS (no predicative text[t9] and read text messages one word at a time). I think for the price it is kind of cheaply made, but it can certainly make phone calls and work as a backup phone.
Very bad product. It was not unlocked and was in spanish. Only good thing was I got my money back from Amazon. This product needs to be taken off the website to save others money and hopes. I did buy a Nokia 6010 for about the same money and it has been awesome!
I have no doubt that this is a capable phone.  IT is very simple and does what a phone should do.  That would be all great but I can't even make a call on mine because amazon sold me a locked phone for the TIGO network.  That is from South America.  My ATT sim card does not work in it and it just asks me for a pin number that is at least 8 digits long. To make matters worse it is speaking in spanish.Shame on you Amazon.Mine is getting returned like others on here.
I was very disappointed, and returned the product.My F3 was delivered locked to TIGO, and set in the Spanish interface mode.It was not unlocked, as claimed in the description.I tried it with two different known good SIMs that worked in other Motorola phones, from ATT and GO.Despite the best efforts of Amazon online cell phone people, Radio Shack cell techs, and online Motorola cell phone people, we could not figure out how to do a master reset, or to unlock it, or even to reset the interface language to English.Totally a bad experience and a waste of time.
Not unlocked. I tried to load my SIM card, but I got a screen full of asterisks wanting a code. Turns out it wants a subscriber code - the phone was not, in fact, unlocked.
This is a very slim cheap phone with a fixed LCD display. It cannot display photos.  Text is very large so text message will require alot of scrolling.I bought this to replace a stolen motorola RAZR which I very much liked.  I needed a cheap one until I could determine if I wanted an iphone or google phone.Note there is a tone every minute during a call so you know how long your call is.  If you are on a plan with very limited minutes, this can be handy.  Otherwise you will want to google around to find the code to shut that off.You will also want to find the documentation on how to lock the keypad.  Otherwise keys will be pressed which will turn on the backlight and use up the battery while it is in your pocket.The connector for the charger is proprietary, not the handy mini-USB that we've all grown to love.Summary: if you need cheap with no contract, this will do just fine.  If you want other features, try motorola's website (or any other vendor) for no contract phones.
well i orderd this phone for my girlfriend its a nice phone but it doesnt have all the bells and whistles but overall an ok phone the thing i didnt like is that they sent me a defaulty phone first on accident but then they sent me another so im not to worried anymore
This phone lacks 1 major thing. And that according me is a easy to read text display. Surely they can work on that feature.The another important thing, phone battery runs out fast.
I bought this so my wife would have something to put her iPhone 3G SIM card in when she didn't want to have the iPhone with her. It fills that need pretty well.Audio quality is ok. Battery life is pretty good, but the standby was nowhere like what's claimed. Texting works, but at 6 characters per screen full it can take some time to read each one. The display is just plain cool. I think I think half the reason I bought it was just to have an E-ink display. It's very thin and light for a phone, but it's a good density so it doesn't feel cheap. It has no features to speak of, but that's why it's so inexpensive.This phone has a couple of minor annoyances: One is that it won't set the time from the network. Other GSM phones I've used lately have done that. You have to set it each time you turn it on. Also, the charger is unlike any other Motorola charger tip I've ever seen. I just assumed it was a mini-USB or the older style Motorola with the clip and push-button, but it's not. You'll always have to carry a charger  when you plan to be away longer than the battery should last. Finally, the headset jack is shared with the charger, and is therefore completely proprietary. That seems odd in 2008 in the age of Bluetooth and 2.5mm mini jack standards. But, then Motorola seems to be on a proprietary-everything bender the last few years. Ok, so the iPhone has a proprietary jack (4 connector stereo 3.5mm) but it's excusable since it's a music player, includes the head set, headsets are readily available and supports Bluetooth.
I had tried the Motorola Motofone F3 and found out it is a phone for other country not for USA.  Trust me do not buy or try.Just to make sure, I tried the second time with the same conclusion.Save your time and try other cell phone.John
It's refurbished, as far as I can tell. The phone I received has one side bowed out. I tried glue but it's still a little messed up. The battery appeared to be new. According to the manual it is the kind you have to charge for 8+ hours before you try using the phone..It works OK so far. Volume is good, easy to read, etc.
BEWARE! I received and returned three of these phones, none of which worked. All were obviously used and returned previously. It seems that the sellers just re-send out returned phones without checking to see if they work. Luckily with amazon's excellent return policy I am not out anything but a little effort and time, but I would not recommend that anyone try their luck against these odds.
It is what I expected..a practical no nonsense type of instrument perfect for what I need on my overseas travel.  Thank you for not advertising something else.
Ordered the phone, received heavily used unit, scratches all over the place, back cover was cracked. Amazon should be more specific about "international version". Mexico is very different from, say, UK.
When i bought this phone i did not expect much except a phone that would answer calls and could make them.  I found out that this was not a good phone for that.  I was replacing a some what broken 2nd Gen Razr by Moto.  That phone even somewhat broken got better service then this phone so i have already switched back to the Razr, I used the phone for about 2 weeks before i gave up because i was droping calls which never happened with my razr.  The calls were being made in the same areas so i expected the same signal strength but i have not gotten that.
The phone works, but it's hard to hear and people complain about the audio quality.
Very cheap, very cheap-looking basic phone. The one I received had cracks in the case. Amazon advertising is misleading on this phone: International version doesn't mean it will work overseas, it means it is not in English.Overall, this is another Motorola flop. Spend your money on something else.
This phone seems well made and the sound quality is good, but there is no headphone in the box and it does not appear that one is available as an accessory.This is a very simple phone without distracting bells and whistles (like Bluetooth). I have read that it was designed for the price sensitive "third world" market (The default language is Spanish).However, as of July 1, 2008 the law in California will require headphone use while driving. I wish I had known of the lack of headset before buying the phone.
Got this phone from Amazon, put in the SIM card and power it up. Behold it started but did not pick up any GSM sinal bars from TMobile. What a waste of time, went on line and see if there is a solution to solve this. apparently it is like Russian Roulette depending on which Dual-GSM band it was set up for, it may on may not work in US. I returned it the next day and got a refund.
this is the worst phone I've ever had.It cannot receive any calls now, and I can hardly call other people.Very very bad signal! and something wrong with the phone book.the screen blacks out frequently. like suddenly dies.horrible!I wanna return it back.I wanna rate it with no star~~
This phone was a waste of money. All the directions were in Spanish. If you need something that will dial out, this phone can work for you. But, if you occasionally text, would like to see names clearly and have an ease of use: then this phone is NOT for you. Keep your money and get something you would like that has a more user friendly version.
Not a very "easy to use" design for the display, very awkward to display contacts and text messages.  (Font is too big on screen and can not be changed)...  Everything else in the phone it self works fine.  Given the display issues, I would not recommend to purchase.
THIS IS THE WORST PHONE THAT I HAVE EVER BROUGHT.  I had it for less then 10 minutes before going online to fill out the return forms. When you receive text messages you can only see one word at a time.  Horrible, Horrible, save yourself the trouble.
we did resive this phone early and it is a good looking phone but no were does it say the phone has no english on the phone or in the directions, we took it to our phone company and she couldnt understand how to activate the phone. This phone is perfect for some one who does peak spanish!!!
I bought this phone for my daughter who was leaving for Poland for 6 weeks. I apparently did not do ALL my homework because we discovered after she was already there that it will not work in Europe but only in the Americas. I really think that fact should be stated on the description and do believe it is intentionally left out. Unnfortunately she won't be home before the 30 day refund window closes.
I had this phone while I was abroad in London and boy did I run into problems. Almost everyone in my group went and got this 'wonderful little phone' but it turned out to not be worth it in the long run. It would shut off at a whim, the time couldn't be controlled no matter how many times I'd reset it. Sometimes it would tell me I missed a call when the phone didn't even ring!! Frankly I think that anyone buying this phone in the States is being grossly overcharged.
bought 2 of these; 1 won't charge and the other will not program.Tiger direct won't exchange and motorola offers no US warranty.Complete junk!
These phones are locked! Bought for Germany. Whet to several phone stores, and could not get to work. Found out phones were locked. Had to buy another phone. Worked right away with the same sim card. I hate it when you buy in good faith and get lied to. Glad i bought from amazon. They are giving me a refund
the order arrived on time and within the expected delivery time frame however the phone was not what i expected. i finally got an OK to send the phone back for a refund but i have been having trouble doing so. When i initially sent the phone back the first time i put return to sender on the package but the pkg came back to me since then i have tried to get in contact with customer service for the return shipping materials but haven't been able to reach anyone by phone or email.
Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Cell Phone--International Version with No Warranty (Black)this phone works good as alarm clock, this is about it, i have purcheased this phone as International Version but is it not, please change the name it is only US version and for me it is no good.
Not at all what I was expecting, however that was due to my lack of research. I was looking for simple but this was an exaggeration of simple. I researched it after purchasing only to find out that it was initially created for use in developing countries. It was built to withstand exposure to water and dust coupled with a sturdy exterior. The fact that it does not have an LCD display adds to its sturdiness, however it reminds me too much of a calculator. I refuse to use this for daily use. I will keep it however for traveling abroad.
I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for my previous phone which died in anticipation for the g3 iPhone releasing in June 08.I urge people to spend a little more for a better phone and to pass on this piece of garbage.Upon first glance, the phone is sleek, sexy, and simple.  It's also very thin.  However, after getting my hands on it, the user interactions on the phone is awkward and frustrating.  The menu can be confusing and take a while of getting used to.  Also annoying is that the display can only show 6 numbers or characters at a time.  Checking your call history is a pain and not worth the effort.Because of how awkward the navigation is and limitations of the display, I carry a small notebook with all of my contacts in it.  It is much faster to look up and dial number from my contact book than it is to try and navigate and use the contact list in the phone.Also, for a simple phone, the battery life is horrible. I have to charge the phone every 3 days.  I had a Nokia N-Gage QD that could last a week on a full charge.Another thing that is annoying is that when I receive a call, the first 3 rings are at very low volume and barely audible and does not ring at full volume until the 4th ring.  I basically have 2 "audible" rings to answer before it kicks the caller to voicemail.About the only thing this phone is good for is to dial phone calls and maybe keep 2 or 3 emergency numbers stored.  Save yourself the grief and frustration and spend a little more with a more intuitive interface and better display.
Mine lasted 4 days before the screen quit.  There is a reason these are sold with no warranty!  I wasted $40 on one.
This phone is hard to use. There are only two lines on the display and letters are of this weird shape - so forget about using text messaging. Also, when somebody is calling oyu - you can only see first five letters of the name. Second, the address book interface is quite hard to navigate.So don't think this is a simple to uuse basic phone. This is a basic phone whish is a pain in the *** to use. Especially don't buy it for somebody not sophisticated with technology (like elderly parents) becuase it is much harder to use than a regular phone.
I paid a higher price for the new phone and received a used phone instead. The package seal was broken, phone not in a protective bag and banging around loose inside the box. The back plate was not on the phone but in a bag. The battery was stuck between the folds of the plastic bag for the plug. Phone button to navigate was dirty. The plastic film protecting the display was creased and faded like someone had taken it off and then put it back on. Keypad was dirty. I requested 2-day shipping because I really needed the phone so I can return the one I am borrowing. Now they say there isn't any in stock and may have to wait a couple of weeks. Hopefully the replacement will be a new phone. Extremely disappointed.
This phone is something else. It does not have a menu. I had to return it.
not even worth the $30 it cost! it is so cheap looking and feeling, no text... it was awful, i returned it right away!
Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Cell Phone--International Version with No Warranty (Black)I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PHONE AND HAVE ALREADY REPLACED IT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE RECEIVED A CALL AND IS SO VERY BASIC THAT CALLS FALL BY THE WAY SIDE. IT IS NOT EASY TO USE AND ALTHOUGH I DO NOT NEED A PHONE WITH LOTS OF BELLS AND WHISTLES, THIS PHONE IS RETRO TO THE POINT OF TRUE FRUSTRATION. GET SOMETHING ELSE !!!
Do not by it. It does not work well. It is difficult to operate it. There are much better phones to buy at a low price.
I am really sorry i ordered this phone. It does not have the specifications I need to make a cellular call in Israel. I believe that Amazon should market it with this comment. i want to return it and please send me the return information.i went through a lot of trouble to travel to Jerusalem to a Talk and Save, a company that sells sim cards only to be told that it is not a good cell phone for Israel. I had called your technical service and they had told me that the Motorola Motofone would be fine, but this was not true!
The phone works good but the problem is that it did not work with the sim card I used overseas but overall the customer service was great.
I bought this phone thinking I would not mind the simplicity, seeing as all I ever use my phone for is calls, texting, and an alarm....However, after the first 10 mins of trying to set it up I was so annoyed that I decided to buy another phone.The display of the characters is so large, scrolling through your phonebook and text messaging/reading is impossibly annoying. Added to this, the navigation is extremely cumbersome due to it's primitive screen. Waste of money for me. This phone makes calls. Do not expect it to be very useful for anything else.
The phone looks beutyfull, and expensive. None the less there is basicly no features, you only have time, date, a horrible version of an adress book and alarm ( with a horrible sound that sounds like a choaking chiken, as does the ringtones). This is not an unlocked cellphone. It is set for a mexican cellphone company. It is hard to send text messages, and you need to enter the number, you can't choose someone from your adress book. On the bright side great reach, nice voice guidance ( in spanish) and very thin. If i could i wind time back up i would defenetly not buy it.
This phone would not work in the United States or Verizon.  I tried to get my money back.  The company said no refund if the original seal was broken.  Well that is how it came to me!Very very upset and disapointed.
The service and delivery was good but the product lacked quality. The call phone is unrecognizable by modern cell phone standards. I would not encourage anyone to buy this phone. The phone lacks features that important to everyday usage.
i bought this phone and return it right away. This phone is like the kids toy cellphone that you can find at the toy store or the dollar store.the materials that they use on this cell phone is cheap.of course what can you expect if the product is made in china? (hope theres no melamine or lead). Don't buy this item. For sure you gonna have buyer remorse.
From what I understand it gets very good reception, but it didn't have enough applications, no calendar and what not. I didn't realize it was a very basic phone.  I have returned it.
useless cheap phone. too basic. not worth the price. Don't be fooled by it's look. It's a piece of gabbage.
This Motorola cellphone looks good but made of cheap materials. Beware of buying this product and  doesn't offer the product warranty. Do no buy this product.
Like the phone and the price, but it did not come with instructions in English and still cannot get it to ring.
Purchased new, arrived open. Would not charge or turn on. Had to return. Total waste.
I was so embarassed to use this phone.  Don't buy!!!  Screen is actually made of paper.  Worse phone on the market.  Avoid at all costs.
I was very disappointed with this Motorola product. I did know this international phone did not come with a US warranty but I did expect the instruction paperwork would NOT include English instructions. This lack of instructions resulted in my damaging the old phone's SIM card resulting in both phones being useless.Although Amazon honored its satisfaction gaurantee it does not help with the loss of an operable phone.
Hi,this product is not compatible with the system and the SIM card that is provided by my service provider. The phone may not work with any carriers in US.
I don't think this is an original motorola product. I think it is a fake manufactured locally in somewhere in China.
looking to replace an older candybar phone, i ordered this because is was 1) cheap, 2) cool looking, and 3) unlocked. BIG MISTAKE. it's super cheap, plastic, with a badly designed display (though cool e-ink technology). in short, if you're used to a designer phone, this isn't for you. plus: plastic edge scratches your ear.
this phone was not what we expected. very hard to understand how features work. ring tone very weird always going to voice mail and couldn't figure out how to get the message. text hard to read.
worst cell phone I have seen!!  worst.  It is failed that I bought it. It is worth $10 rather than $40.
Ok, I live in an English speaking country, bought the phone from an website written in English, the item description was in English, but the phone and the manual were in a foreign language.  I turned the phone on, and it started talking to me, but I couldn't understand a single word.  I was not able to find a way to change it to English.  If the phone is in some other language, at the very least the description should be in that language.
The phone just arrived. I charged it overnight, and cannot figure out how to turn it on. I went to the Motorola "how to" site and that pertinent fact does not appear. So so far it is useless. Extremely annoying.
This is the worst phone i have ever had, and I have had quite a few phones.Its design is made for a robot, with text messaging their is one word per page, and it is very hard to figure out to set everything up on the phone. The only easy thing is dialing calls and recieving, THATS ALL- I myself prefer a nice color screen and more options to my phone. Its awful please dont buy it!
I bought this phone for one of my teenage sons.  He loves the phone.  I was worried that the slide mechanism might be fragile but it has been very robust.  He goes on very long hikes and his phone bounces around in his pocket along with his keys, sand, and other debris.  The outside of the phone is scratced so much that most of the paint is gone to reveal the metal underneath.  The screen is badly scratched and looks terrible when the phone is turned off HOWEVER, when the phone is on, the screen is so bright that the scratches disappear! This phone has been severely abused about 10 months and yet it still functions perfectly!I bought a 4GB micro SD card that works great in the phone and I expected him to use it for music but he mostly uses it for photos and video.After seeing how durable this phone was for my older son, I bought one for my younger son who adores it!  He doesn't abuse it quite as much and his phone still has all of the paint and no scratches on the screen. He really enjoys being able to have music on his phone. It's a very reasonably priced phone that's small and fun to use, perfect for teens.  Personally, I'm using a Sony Ericsson slider that has a few more features that I love (also very reasonably priced).
It very dependable, robust. I have been using this reggularly all 5 years. I never found any model as robust. It very simple to operate.
So... I waited for the iPhone to go 3G.  I was even willing to pay for a data plan I did not need, then I found out it's going to cost even more.  I bought this unlocked Nokia instead and kept my cheap voice plan only.  So far I'm very happy with my decision.This phone had built-in GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth; but it does not have 3G coverage in the US.  Being a smart phone it has robust calendar and contact applications.  It also has a great 5-mega-pixel camera with auto focus and a powerful Xenon flash that really does light up your subject.  The pictures are comparable to an average compact point and shoot camera.  Moreover, it geo-tags your photos so you can see where you took the photo on a map.  You can also upload your photos to the web, although I have not used that feature.  The music player is robust as well and since the phone has a 3.5mm headset jack on the top it's easy to use your favorite headphones.  Lastly, it is very attractive in black, and feels, for the most part, solid and well constructed but also lightweight.I have not used the software that came with the phone since it is not for MACs.  Nokia has a plug-in you can download on their website to use the phone with a MAC's iSync software and it works seamlessly.  The phone also works well with the HandsFreeLink Bluetooth in my Acura.  You can download MSN Messenger and Hotmail for the phone, as well as check your POP-3 based e-mail.  The web browser works well and most pages display fine, if a little slowly (even over Wi-Fi).  The map program is accurate as well, although you have to subscribe to a service for voice guided turn-by-turn directions.  If you don't pay for that you just get the directions displayed on the screen all at once.Battery life and call quality are great.  The phone lasts me about 4 days before it needs to be recharged.  I am by no means a power-user though.The negatives I have is that the keys are way to small for the phone.  I am an average sized male and my hands are not huge, but I have some issues with hitting the wrong keys.  Additionally, the keyboard area of the phone is very creaky; when you press the keys it makes creaking sounds.  The phone can be slow with some operations, specifically zooming into pictures and opening the picture gallery.  Lastly, the built-in accelerometer is finicky and often the screen will switch from portrait to landscape when you do not want it to, but NOT when you actually want it to.All in all, it's a great phone with lots of features (and a phenomenal camera) and well worth the asking price.  Sorry for the long review, but it's got a lot of features to discuss.8/1/08:  Two more things: I downloaded Opera Mini and it is far superior and faster then the built-in web browser.  Secondly, you can take the phone off the cell network and just use Wi-Fi, which is great when I am home because the cell signal is weak in my house.
I just got this phone and it is awesome. The camera takes good pictures especially at night or dark places. Although the picture quality is not as good as stand alone cameras, the quality surpasses any camera phone in the market right now. The lens cover really helps in protection. The OS is fairly fast too, at least faster than the OS in my old T-mobile Dash.There is one drawback: I can't text as fast without a full QWERTY pad. I hope Nokia will make a high megapixel phone with full optical zoom and flash and full QWERTY pad. Maybe in a year?  :)
This is the best phone I've had. The camara is just awesome. It's has it all... GPS, Video Call, Good storage... I just can say AWESOME. It is also very light. It's not heavy at all. The screen is big and the image quality is incredible. 5 stars for this gadget!!!
El nokia N82 es uno de los mejores ejemplares de la serie N. Su cámara de 5 MP su acceso a WLAN y su GPS integrados y su sitema cuatribanda y desbloqueado para usarse con cualquier chip del mundo lo hacen un teléfono móvil envidiable para otras compañías celulares. Comparándolo con el N78 y el N95 su presentación clásica como el N78 aunque su cámara es de 5 megapixeles en comparacación con los 3.2 del N78, y su memoria es expandible hasta los 4GB como el N95. Es una buena elección si buscas almacenar música con cualquier tipo de formato y fotografías con nitidez y alto pixelaje y pasar horas y horas navegando en el internet inalámbrico.¡¡Muy recomendable!!
Beware that this is lengthy!  I figure that if you consider spending several hundred dollars on a phone, the more information the better. :)The first thing to get straight about this phone is that it is not about form, but function.  It is not the slimmest or sexiest phone out there, nor does it have the most awe-inspiring user interface compared to the likes of the iPhone.  On the other hand, it has every capability that you will find on any phone these days:* A 5MP camera with autofocus, LED flash, and VGA video recording, Carl Zeiss lens, and a 1/2.5" CCD (same as in most compact digital cameras).  Various shooting modes (macro, night, night portrait, sports, etc...), ISO control, flash control w/red-eye reduction.  Immediately send pictures via bluetooth, email, MMS, etc.* GPS with Nokia Maps application and optional voice navigation.  Various third party applications (e.g. Google Maps for S60) support its built-in GPS as well.* 3.5G (HSDPA) connectivity (see note about models below), This gives clearer voice and much faster data downloads (theoretically up to 3.5 Mbps; in practice I have seen from 900 Kbps to about 2.2 Mbps, depending on location and time of day).* WiFi (802.11g) with WEP, WPA/WPA2, and EAP/802.1x authentication (for corporate environments)* Support for nearly every Bluetooh profile in existence: A2DP for stereo audio, DUN for tethering the phone's internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use), OBEX to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer.* 3.5mm headset jack, infrared port w/send/receive utility, FM tuner.* "Dual slider" design: Slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (Play/Pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).  Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to "geotag" pictures with your location as you use the camera).* Built-in applictions include QuickOffice to read Microsoft Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS), Adobe Acrobat Lite reader (PDF), RealPlayer (most media files/streams), home screen "Search" applet to search the Internet and local content, various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms, phonebook with unlimited entries, calendar w/unlimited meetings, todos, memos, reminders..), calculator, unit converter -- you get the picture.  Notably absent, though, is a Timer/Stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (e.g. from Smartphoneware).* Other S60-specific applications include Nokia's Internet Radio to stream live radio streams, "RotateMe" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation, "Fring" mobile Skype/AIM/MSN/Google Talk/etc.. client, Google Maps with GPS support, Google home screen search applet, Mobile Weather app, "ExtGPS" to share the internal GPS information over bluetooth (e.g. to the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet), YouTube player, emTube (also for YouTube access), etc.* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages "as they were meant to be".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.  Plus, you are of course free to download and use other browsers, such as the excellent, super-fast and bandwidth-saving Opera Mini (operamini.com).* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. "push mail"; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).* Mac OS X users: Although the phone does not come with bundled software for Mac OS X, you can download "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" (to synchronize photos and music with iPhoto and iTunes) and an iSync plugin (to synchronize the address book, calendar, todo etc) with your Mac - both from Nokia's web site.  Also, setting up your Mac to access the Internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan, e.g. the $15/month "MEdia Net Unlimited" from AT&T;) is super-easy: When you first pair with the phone, the needed WAP/APN information is pulled automatically from your Phone's SIM card.  (Ironically, this works for nearly every phone, except Apple's own iPhone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack, and does also not support tethering).  UPDATE: I've learned that such tethering violates AT&T;'s Terms of Service.  Moreover, there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from AT&T; that specifically allow tethering.  If you do so anyway, stay under the radar, and don't abuse it - e.g. by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service.MODELS:=======There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:* The original N95 (a.k.a. N95-1, a.k.a. RM-159) targeted mainly the European and Asian markets; while it had quad-band GSM (2G) support for use in nearly every country, including the USA, it had support only for the international W-CDMA (UMTS/HSDPA, a.k.a. 3G/3.5G) frequency (commonly referred to as UMTS-2100).  Nonetheless, this phone was later made available for retail in the USA as well, through Nokia's flagship stores, online site, and 3rd party retailers.  It had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera), 64MB of runtime/dynamic memory (RAM), and a 900 mAh battery.  Common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open, and that the battery life was too short.* The N95-2 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6" to 2.8" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the µSDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T; Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.* The N95-3 (a.k.a. "N95 NAM", RM-160) is the first model targeted for North America.  Most of the exterior design is similar to the N95-1 (Silver faceplate, 2.6" screen, µSDHC slot), but like the N95-2, it has 128MB of RAM, a 1200 mAh battery, and no manual slider for the camera shutter.  The main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original UMTS-2100 (WCDMA) frequency for UMTS-850 and UMTS-1900, so that it would work with AT&T; Wireless's 3G/3.5G network.  Until just a few days/weeks ago, this would have been the "best" choice for US customers.* The N95-4 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB NAM", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of "n95 8gb" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.* The N95-5 is for Japan; it is a stripped-down version of the N95-1 (e.g. no WiFi). UPDATE: As someone commented below, it is actually for China.COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:==========================N95 vs. iPhone==============This is almost an irrational comparison, given how different these devices are:* The iPhone is almost entirely about "sex appeal": Polished, slim, with a large screen for viewing content, multi-touch user interface (we've all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches, do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts, etc).  As such, it is very big on "usability".  The N95 is not even a touch-screen device.  (Personally I actually prefer "hard" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based Motorola A1200 MING in the past.  Touch screens are not very good for, for example, dialing a number without looking at the screen).* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a "WYSIWYG" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year old Motorola A1200 MING, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).* The iPhone is only available with a 2-year contract from AT&T; the N95 is only available SIM-free (unlocked).In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.N95 vs. Sony Ericsson K850i===========================These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a "US" vs. "International" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.Most comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (e.g. PhoneArena.com, GSMArena.com, and Mobile-Review.Com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two).  In summary: As far as camera phones go, these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras.  The k850i has an advantage indoors, because it has a real Xenon flash in addition to the LED autofocus assist beam.  However, in general, it has more "washed out" color reproduction than the more vivid N95; and it only supports video recording in QVGA (320x240) resolution compared to the N95 VGA (640x480).The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a "My Location" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)On the other hand, the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the N95: A flashlight application (uses the LED autofocus beam), mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (e.g. for presentation), and a stopwatch/timer app.One last thing to note about the K850i:  Although it uniquely supports both U.S. and International 3G frequencies, its use on the AT&T; wireless network is sub-optimal.  That's because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the MEdiaNet configuration - so streaming internet videos (e.g. from YouTube) does not work.  This was the single most important reason why I ended up returning my k850i to the local store where I bought it, after having had it for about 2 weeks.N95 vs. the Samsung G810========================The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a "tri-band" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.Other than that, for better or worse the G810 has a 3x optical zoom. "Worse" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same, so that must mean that the CCD sensor is smaller - meaning more noise).  On the upside, it does have Xenon flash and a protective lens cap.Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.For now, anther Samsung, the G600, although not available for sale in the US, seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the N95 and k850i), as well as quad-band GSM support.  (It is otherwise a low-end phone though, without e.g. 3G).UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones==========================Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).UPDATE Dec 1, 2008: The N95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: The N85 and the N96.  Personally, I'll stick to the N95 8GB though (see my N85 review to see why).
I am a Nokia user ever since I started using mobile phones and I also have Nokia N800. After in hyper excitement mode ordering Nokia N95, I am quite disappointed.1) The browsing in N95 is not quite friendly at all.2) It doesn't 'just works' So many user tweaks needed on the phone to use its functionalities.3) After using a iPod Touch and seeing a iPhone, iPhone trumps N95 on ease of use, looks, screen. While N95 is the king in specifications and features,  for me I think I would go with iphone as ease of use is one of my main reason.4) For Techies can put so much into technical settings and installing and finding various applications and N95 is the best choice! (I learnt a bad lesson by buying Nokia N800 which is not 'General User Friendly' at all compared to IPod Touch.I am not a apple fanboy but after using both Apple Products and Nokia Products, I feel that If I go with Apple I will always have stuff that 'just works' and so intuitive and friendly to use!I am returning the same and will be going for a iphone!Update : 3 days after N95 8GB1) I am feeling that my right side slider has become bit loose. The left side remains perfect while the right one becomes wobbly.2) An annoying bug in which memory card has to be reformatted as my video recording pauses every 10-15 seconds and continues again. Not able to get continuous recording.For a 640$ device (which say in mobiles is a very significant investment) these bugs are really annoying and completely unsatisfactory.Update : One week after N95Hmm tough one.. There are some items which takes time to get used to it.. kind of 'acquired taste'. I would put N95 into that category. Though it may not 'wow' me like iPhone whenever I touch the phone, the versatility is amazing. The kind of apps available and freedom to used bluetooth keyboard, easy tethering with N800,nice applications to use makes this device a swiss army knife. I have decided to keep it with me albeit tolerating some minor annoyances ("acquired taste" / "undocumented 'features' " ).**** Update 2 weeks later!I am liking the phone! Like the feel when pressing the keys! Got used to the phone... Things going pretty smooth. Installed lots of applications without much trouble. Camera quality is pretty good for a mobile phone camera. Volume from music player is great. Though Video player (real player) doesnt support too many formats. Need thirdparty applications.**** 2 Months Later *****The Gallery is slow!! Believe me it takes atleast 45 seconds to 2 minutes to load the gallery after you have taken a picture to see a thumbnail of the picture if you have even a modest number say 75 pictures totally!! Completely unacceptable in a 600$ gadget! When I have to show my pictures to someone its like taking whole age just to get a thumbnail while everyone just open their stuff to show the pic!Sometimes the phone becomes sluggish and needs restart couple of times a week...There are a lot of nice applications and one can choose as per their needs... The s60 browser sucks a bit and I would recommend opera mini over s60 browser any day!Overall I am still having some positive view over the phone but the gallery load time alone will make me to think twice before buying the phone again...as I got this as mainly for my mobile camera usage and i cant even see the pictures in my mobile easily without waiting for 2 mintues or so....There are no other phones with similar tech specifications in terms of hardware... but if i have to go over the process again... i may go with iphone 3g for the ease of use and the usablity unless nokia fixes these issues my next purchase wouldnt be a nokia device!5 Months Later...The phone is utterly annoying... and unbelievably slow.... just load 50 odd photos and it takes for ever to open the gallery... frequent reboots.... slow hang-ups... I have wasted my money.... I am giving this phone to my dad.. I just want to get rid of this phone....
I ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. Coincidentally the day before my N95-4 arrived, Nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing I did was update the software on my N95-4 to the latest version.During the update process I noticed the USB port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. After the update was done I began to use the phone and I ended up returning it to Amazon the next day! You've seen all the positive reviews, so I won't rehash that, but here are why I returned it:- The USB port on my N95-4 was extremely loose or broken. You had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. It was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the PC. I tried several USB cables, computers/ports with no success.- The USB transfer speed is HORRIFIC for a device that comes with 8GB. It took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4GB of music to the device using Windows Media Player. Using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses USB 2.0 Full-Speed (old spec) not USB 2.0 High-Speed (common today). No matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don't transfer stuff much.- The slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever I pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that I don't expect from a $600 phone. It did not feel solid at all, at least not my N95-4- The overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket.- Even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just "wake up" all of a sudden it was bizarre.- Does not charge via USB. Not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a USB cable and Nokia charger plugged in.I ended up getting a Nokia N78 (US 3G) that was just recently released and I'm extremely happy with it. It addresses most if not all of the issues I had with the N95-4 including fastest USB, fast CPU/responsive, excellent build quality.I would recommend looking at the N78 or the upcoming N96 (successor to N95) over the N95-4.
I'm going to be honest here. I am a big fan of nokia. I've always had a nokia phone and would never purchase any brand. I purchased this phone because of all the reviews, the 8gbs, the video and screen size. The camera on this phone is great because its 5mp but at the same time since the lens is in the phone you tend to get red eye and if the person you are taking a photo of is more then 10feet away the picture is dark when in a dark area even while using the flash. The video on this phone is wonderful. The volume keys on the top right side of the phone are somewhat hard and you don't feel like you are pressing them sometimes. I really wish this phone had a keyboard on it. Honestly that's the only thing this phone is missing. I do agree with many people that this phone is way better then the iphone because of its web cababilites. Did I mention the gaming is insane? Yes, it does have N-gage but you can go to another site like mosh and get cool fun simple games. Tetris looks so hot on the screen. The GPS on the phone works great! Somethings that aren't mentioned a lot with this phone is that you can get AM/FM radio on it as well. Any jack can go into the phone unlike the iphone which only allows smaller ear pieces. The phone is super loud I can hear it 3 rooms away when its ringing. Another great thing is that the phone has flash player and like usual real player. I do have to say that for me the standby time could be a little longer. I did notice that my nokia 6682 did last longer then the N95 8gb, but I don't mind because this phone is sexy. The buttons are easy to press when you are text messaging. But again I just wish the phone had a keyboard granted I can get a small bluetooth one but why would I want to carry something extra in my purse?
I've had N95-8GB for less than two months now. From day 1, had issues with charger pin not charging properly (need to play around a bit for it to start charging). The features of the phone are awesome - but you need to be really tech. savvy, which I luckily am. The phone is really bulky and the two-way slides isn't all that comfortable (slides when keeping in the pocket)Over a period of time, the N95-8GB started acting really flaky and eventually, the phone would reboot by itself. Some problem with the power switch. I sent the phone back to Nokia for repair. The online status first showed - 'Waiting for parts' and then, after a few days they simply shipped the phone back saying it has corrosion!! The phone has never been wet, so I don't understand how could there be corrosion. I smell something fishy - maybe they didn't have parts so they are making this up!When I called customer support, the rep said that the phone can catch corrosion by keeping it in the pocket or from humidity (I live in Chicago, close to lake Michigan)!! I was shocked with this response. Nokia expects that men won't keep the phone in the pocket?? Anyway, spoke to a couple reps and even a supervisor, but they simply refused to repair the phone. This is just pathetic customer service. Nokia just lost a faithful customer and an avid marketer of their product - for the last 10+ years, I've only used Nokia phones - I guess it's time to switch manufacturers!!New buyers - BEWARE. As long as your phone doesn't go bad, your fine. If it does, be prepared to dump your investment.
I bought this product on July 2nd 2008 and had it shipped overnight July 3rd 2008.  Even though the amazon description doesn't say it clearly I'm happy to say that it is in fact the n95-4 with US 3G support.I had the n95-1 before this.  The n95-4 is significantly faster.
The N95 has to be the best all around device. Everything works well. It's hard to imagine a device that small has all the modern day gadgets built in: Phone, GPS, Wi-Fi, bluetooth, 3G, Camcorder, and a fine camera. The N95 is quality built (unlike many high end Korean phones) with a very clear high res. screen. Battery life is excellent. I only wish the 8G device has an expandable storage like the non-8G models. I ordered from Amazon with one-day delivery and it arrived on time. Highly recommended to those who want an all around device that works. Set up is bit complicated but it's a complicated device. Be patient! Nokia website has good support. The software however is bit buggy for Vista-64 but works fine with XP. I spent a day setting up the N95. Once working, it's a small wonder. I also have an iPhone and the Nokia has far more features and is a better phone, esp. it's unlocked so that I can use it overseas - this restriction on the iPhone is the worst thing to an otherwise a great device of its kind. The N95 is well worth the $660 price!
The N95 8GB has exceed all my expectations. I have been working my way through the User Guide, slowly coming up to speed on its seemingly endless capabilities. I won't even call it a cell phone any more - that is only a minor function of what is in reality a portable computer with a communication feature. My highlights so far:The phone itself works exceptionally well. I plugged in the SIM chip from my old cell (AT&T;) and was up and running immediately. I am looking forward to using this unit in Europe next year. Since it is unlocked, you can buy inexpensive Vodaphone SIMs from just about any newsstand and all your in-country calls become local calls at pennies per minute. No more exorbitant roaming fees. And the quad-band capability ensures you will connect virtually anywhere.I had no problem using the WLAN feature. It hooked up with my home wireless network flawlessly, and so far, has found and connected with various other Wifi hot spots around town. The internet browser is excellent and once I figured out how to get my e-mail retrieval set up, I was able to check my home mailbox with ease. Very convenient feature!The camera takes excellent photos considering it is a cell camera. With 5 megapixels and the Carl Zeiss lens, you end up with pictures good enough to post on a web site (I did).  I also like the performance of the video capture and plan to use it more often.Bluetooth paired up seamlessly in my car and with my ear bud. I tested the unit's FM radio using my Bose head set and the N95 picked up all the stations in range quickly. The quality of the sound was exceptional! I also played some downloaded sounds and some streaming video. Excellent performance.After dowloading the Nokia software on my home PC, I tested the N95's Office features by downloading some PDF, Excel, and Word files to the phone. They are all accessible on the N95 and very easy to view on the high resolution LCD. I plan to purchase the software that will allow me to edit these files on the N95. I already bought a portable bluetooth keyboard that I will use with the unit as well. With that, I will have many of the functions previously available only on my laptop.The GPS is excellent. I had no problem acquiring satellites, even indoors on a couple of occasions. My phone came with a complementary six-month subscription to all the voice guidance features. I have used this in my car to test routing and it matches up well with the GPS built in to my 2008 Dodge Magnum.In summary, I am extremely pleased with the N95 8GB unit. It will take me more weeks to learn everything this "phone" can do, but it will be an enjoyable process.
I loved all the features of my N95, although the screen was really too small for internet browsing.  Then, after only a few months of normal use, my Nokia N95 began having video problems.  The video would go dark, or display upside down and backwards, or show half the screen and half snow, with the visible half reversed. It would fail for a few hours, then magically resume normal operation. Sometimes powering it down repeatedly would bring it back to life, but without a screen, it's very difficult to operate.  Warranty repairs, with shipping, equaled the cost of a new iPhone.  Never again will I spend so much money for a phone with moving parts.
The N95 8GB phone definitely stumps the competition. Packed with a myriad of features, applications, and connectivity possibilities, it's tagline "Open to Everything" is right on the money. With video and sound converters included in the PC suite software, finding compatible video and music files is a thing of the past. Lightning-fast connections and a massive 8GB memory diminish storage and download speed problems. A month after purchasing my N95 8GB, my amazement remains on fire. Each day I discover new and practical applications compatible with my phone, not to mention dozens of free 3D games available for trial and purchase in various websites. Overall, this phones is the perfect description of the term "Bang for the Buck!" Go ahead and try it, you'll be amazed...
The Nokia n95 8gb is a fantastic smartphone, its got it all. I am sadden to say Vista changed their software so you can't download the software via nokia pc suite, which irons out the problems with the phone. Problems i encountered software crashed and phone turned itself off all the time which is a pain, especially a fews seconds from downloading software i was happy untill the phone switched itself off and i lost $10.00 for my trouble.I registered my phone and told them my problem. I was told they can FLASH the software on to the phone. You have to ship the phone to them. Why? hence i sent back both phones. I still love this phone thats why im getting the Nokia n96 16gb which has the upgade on it.
Excellent product. Lightweight yet quite complete. Excellent picture and video quality. Excellent sound quality in both ways (speaker and headphones). Also, it has a very good antenna reception (which is a serious issue for me because there is no good signal coverture in the city where I live). U.S. version represents no real difference compared to Int'l version at least for me (besides the fact that I saved like 50 bucks).Only setback: keyboard is small and uncomfortable, but I can live with it.
As an adult who held out from buying a cellphone for years, this was the first one I bought after carefully researching other phones.  This model has many advanced features, not all of which I use.  Overall, the model is an excellent, all-in-one, smart phone and will meet your needs for all uses (saving you money from having to buy other gadgets that provide the following services): phone, video, music, gps/navigation, digital camera, organizer, etc.  I rate this model 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 for the following reasons. After 3 months of light phone-only use, the charger input hole disappeared into the phone and the phone could not be charged. I had to send the phone to Nokia Customer Service for repair. This issue was unexpected for a phone of this price calibre. The repair took 10 days including postal travel time. Unrelated, on rare occasions, the display will "freeze" and not respond to any commands.  To remedy this, the only solution is to remove the battery from its compartment and reinstall the same battery. The display will resume after the phone is turned back on.  These two issues are minor in comparison to the delight that this smart phone offers the user. If you are in the market for a unique and advanced smart phone, I would highly recommend the N95 8GB (even to first time adult users). 8GB is more than sufficient and I see no reason to have a 16GB. Best of luck to all.
Still the best on the market after 1 year release in Europe.There is NO BETTER phone on the market for media creation.There are FEW BETTER (Arguably) phones on the market for media consumption.Take a picture, upload it to flickr.  Geo tag it then share you vacation with family realtime.Make a video, add a soundtrack, edit the movie, add text, upload it to youtube.Put all your music on this and use your 3.5mm headphones.Most importantly, stop carrying a camera, pmp and phone around!Downside is there is no qwerty or touchscreen.  So text input is limited.  Couldn't care less about the touch screen.
Very cool phone. Does everything it says and more. The only problem i had so far was the video would glitch when recording in high quality and mass memory. Researched it online and figured out that if you format the mass memory drive it will fix it. Others online claim that the problem came back again but mine has not.Other than that this phone is very very cool. I figured out how to convert DVD's to MP4 format and watch movies or whatever. phone quality is very good. During calls the loudspeaker is super loud A++, but the regular speaker for your ear is a little low. But maybe I have bad ears.
I had this phone for a few days now, and it is everything i could expect, i had a Sony K850i for a few months but had software problems from day 1. I am very impressed with this phone and would recommend anyone to purchase one despite the cost as it totally blows away phones you can get in anywhere. My friend has an Iphone and going to sell it and buy one of these.
so far, this phone has a good features,but after you have downloaded some applications, and your phone memory getting lower,it's kind like,,the n95 engine getting low,loading take a little whileeven just to open a text messageso, i wish, the upcoming n 96 n n85would be a better gadget
I've been using the phone for over two months. Thanks to its 400MHZ processor, the phone's capable of many tasks. I install Garmin GPS on it with the latest North American 2009 map. I can now find satellite within 10 seconds with the pad slided up. The Nokia-Garmin bundle works perfectly driving around and this's almost like a dream only 5 years ago. Be aware that there's no way the CMOS camera can take equivalent pictures as CCD camera, even with the Carl Zeiss lens. The video shooting is amazingly fine though. Some people complain about no camera cover compared to older versions, but I've found absolutely fine with the glass protection. I haven't got a single scratch on it and I assume it's hard material. The symbian operate system provide extremely flexible expandability that you can almost treat it as a palm computer.Pros: great GPS hardware, very loud speaker with decent music sound, acceptable camera, good battery life (w/o GPS turning on), nice audio and video playbackCons: the front pad looks a little cheapIn all, this is a great great little gadget for cellphile. It's the assemble of functionality you can ever imagine.
From my knowledge that phone don't have microSD slot. I don't think U.S. got the special edition.
It's light not heavy, because the Symbyan S60 3rd edition you can do many things and install many applications the only one problem that I can note it's the Battery life it's short and it's a little bit slow when you try to make something else. Iphone it' faster but has many limitations I have both and I can compare that things.NOKIA it's more functional that iPhone.
Absolutely amazing phone.  Everything works great.  GPS, WI-fi, spearkphone, call quality.  N-gage is amazing.  way better than iphone
Pros:  Great 5 mega pixel digital camera. Video quality will pleasantly surprise you, its DVD quality and 8 Gig will let you make never ending videos.  Phone comes YouTube ready, you can Skype or Google talk to save minutes where ever you have wifi after.  Phone can handle high speed applications at about 450 kbps download speed, absolutely no problem with streaming videos. Mp3 player quality is as good as apple. Multimedia keys, on the top slider are very convenient to operate mp3 and video. In short true phone which will make you rest your Ipod, digital camera, video camera and old phone.  Never seen a phones speaker so loud.  Best phone available in market for gaming.  Phone is actually not as big as it looks in the images.Cons: GPS is ridiculous, I live in San Francisco, phone does not catch signals at most of the places, and it just says searching signals. I hate the Nokia Hands free, because it comes with a remote control connected to hands free wire, which makes it inconvenient to carry. Iphone hand free is much better. The slot to insert hands free is poorly designed, it should have been on the top or bottom of the phone, hands free jack is on the left side of the phone, which make it inconvenient when you place the phone in your pocket. Nokia maps did not impress me. I downloaded Google maps, its free and much better. It takes forever to copy music to N95 as it first converts the Mp3 to some other format.Overall: I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, except with the GPS of the phone. If you think N95 will rest your gps as it will your IPods, digital and video camera, then you are wrong.  Phone`s processor is fast and multimedia features are colossal.
This phone was introduced in US in March 2008. I am using it with AT&T.;Pros:Excellent sound quality - with as well as without speakersExcellent Video recorderAbove average picture qualityLots of connectivity optionLots of free Apps available  @ MOSHCons:Lacks the latest firmware updateNo micro SD slotBattery life is average - about 2 days after moderate to heavy usage (other than calling)
When the N95 came to the US, I spent a large sum of my bonus money to get it. Generation 1. I loved it! It was all I wanted from a phone and more! I read books, I get myself home when I am lost, I take pictures, listen to music, watch news casts from my home country and so on, and so on. I have google maps, and read gmail on it. I surf the web, and play games. The menus are configurable, and I have almost none of the original buttons on the front "page". I usually keep forgetting all the things this phone can do.Unfortunately, on the day I had had my phone for a year, it started acting up on me. It was with deep regret I sent it in to get a replacement phone. Since I was so very happy with my N95, I spent the money on getting another one. This time, I went for the third generation, with 8G storage built in.I am not as impressed with the 3rd generation as I was with the first generation. This phone is a lot slower than my old, and lags quite a bit. I also cannot connect it to my Linux laptops like I could with my other. I believe it's because the phone mounts the disk, and it cannot be unmounted. This is probably my biggest problem with this phone. I could do this with the first phone. I have had times when the phone does stupid things like shut itself off. At first I was worried, but the alarm will ring even if the phone is off, so I have reliably used it as an alarm clock when I am on the road.It's a good phone if you want an all-in-one phone. I am really looking forward to N97 being released later next year, as I will most likely upgrade to it as soon as it becomes available. I will recommend this phone, but be aware that it can be slow to move through menus sometimes!
I bought this phone over 9 months ago for one particular reason. I installed Slingbox Mobil on it and linked it to my Slingbox so I get live TV on the phone and whatever I get on my TV at home I get on this phone.  As long as I have strong upload speeds on my home DSL service the picture is exceptional. I like all the other features of the phone, the camera is fabulous, it is very good as a phone, works well on the WEB and I do not find it too thick although it would be nice if it were thinner. BUT whenever someone sees my TV they are blown away by the concept and the quality of the picture and the sound. The coolest moment was the Monday playoff of this year's US Open (Tiger against Rocco and a broken leg).  I had to play in a pro-am golf tournament that day and while everyone was trying to find out how the playoff was going - I got to WATCH it LIVE. Amazing.
I am very happy with my Nokia N95 8GB phone.As the title says MORE THEN I EXPECTED!I would like to take a moment to thank Amazon forquick and courteous service.OK. My review...First of all the phone itself is excellent. both on andoff speaker phone. It is loud and clear. sometimes evenbetter quality then a land line.Second is the music and video players. The player thatcomes with the phone is great but, if you want morediversity with different codec's try Core video player.You can find it on most symbian forums.People compare this phone to the iphone and, thats fine.I've owned both now and, have to say that there aremore application and other items you can get on the N95then the iphone...and as far as I'm concerned the callquality is so much better with the Nokia.On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this phone a solid 9 becauseof it's quirks. Being able to charge via usb is one and, withmost smart phone an occasional unscheduled reboot.But, even with it's minor drawbacks its a phone I use in manyways everyday and, will continue in the future.Thank You
Overall a great phone. GPS is crazy slow to get a signal - works great once established. Keypad is a bit strange. Not sure why it is so recessed. The phone is definitely thick. But makes up for that by how lite it is. Good luck finding a good case for it. Not a lot of good options. I found a good universal case from AT&T; for it. No SD card slot. Of course I was aware of that when I purchased it. But it sure would be nice if it had one. The loudspeaker is amazing. There are two loudspeakers in fact. Sound quality is very good. The phone has only locked up on me once. Very stable and responds quickly otherwise. Camera works great. Would be nice if it had a xenon flash vs. the LED flash. But hey, nice that it has one at all. I might suggest to people to look at the N96 instead of this phone. If the N96 is too $$ then this is a fantastic alternative. Good luck!
very good prodcut with a spectacular 5.0 megapixels and the GPS and WiFi is GREAT! is the best cellphone.
i ordered this phone from amazon, amazon has great phones for sale, the one i received is made in Korea.after checking it out for several days, so far, so good. despite this phone is considered wonderful by everyone, it has some cons i need to say. maybe its helpful to people who are interested in this phone.1. slide screen is fancy, but made very loosen, it feels like it will break after using several weeks.2. when talking on the phone,voice is not even as clear as my motorola V3(old one and same phone company)3.its getting slower when there is a load of pics and videos. sometimes, if you have many songs in it, it's loading forever.however, this 600dollar phone has a lot of functions that you expect.good quality of picture and video. many applications.amazon's phone is real one i guess, since the one i got at least is made in korean and with 1 year warrenty. i think maybe the one made in korea is the real one.
I did lots and lots of research on a number of phones, including this one, on the best one to buy. I had a list of things I wanted in a phone and I have to say, this phone not only had everything I've ever needed, but I was surprised on things I didn't know about! For instance, I didn't even know it had an accelerometer when I bought it! But for now I'll just list the major features and review them:CAMERA(s): The main 5MP camera takes great pictures. Obviously it's not the same quality as a stand alone, say Sony Cybershot of equal quality. But the different scene shots and bright flash make up for that. (portrait, night shots, fast-moving, etc) Video is as good if not better than a Sony Cybershot point and shoot camera. (You can even edit pictures right on your phone!)CALL QUALITY/SPEAKERPHONE: Call quality has been very good. Speakerphone is VERY loud thanks to the pair of high quality speakers.GPS: The assisted GPS antenna on the device is pretty good. When using Nokia Maps to navigate, it takes very little time to connect (5-10 secs mostly) You have to keep the slider open however to get good signal. If you don't like nokia maps, you can always buy/download other software like Google maps, TomTom, etc. Very handy.BLUETOOTH: Basically like any other bluetooth. It can connect to headsets, other devices, computers, and it also is compatible with A2DPEMAIL: It its own email client that you can set whatever address to or you could use the free Gmail app if you have gmail. (thats what I do)MUSIC PLAYER: 8GB memory. To today's standards, thats not a very big size for a primary music player. However, when you transfer music to the device from Nokia's PC Suite, it asks you if you want to convert the songs to a smaller format (~5 times smaller) which is very helpful in storing more songs. Other than that, its a great player with many features. (Playlists, shuffle, album art, EQ, etc) Great speakers too.WiFi/3G: WiFi connects very quickly and smoothly. 3G signal is great too. Every now and then it will cut out but will automatically continue. Even reaches 3.5G speeds (HSDPA) on AT&T;'s network.CALENDAR: Nicely laid out with many viewing options. Can add new memo's, tasks, meetings, and anniversaries. Can also sync with computer. (Assuming outlook, but don't use)ACCELEROMETER: VERY cool to have. Enables the phone to auto-rotate when phone is flipped sideways. Also automatically straightens pictures that were taken sideways. And MANY more applications that you can download that use the accelerometer like games or cool apps like Step Counter.COMPUTER SOFTWARE: Didn't realize this was a big thing until I tried to sync a Blackberry to a computer one time. Not very user friendly. But Nokia's PC Suit is the most simple, yet powerful sync program I've ever seen. Can easily use phone to connect your computer to the internet with the touch of a button. Or you can read, sort, and reply to your text messages on your computer. Very, very nicely designed.BATTERY LIFE: As the N95 was my first smartphone I've ever had, I didn't realize this was as big of an issue. But sadly on the N95, the battery life is terribly underrated for the many features this phone has. I charge it every night and even when doing minimal things on the phone, it will usually die around 6pm. Nokia knows this, which is why they offer different types of portable battery packs and ways to charge your phone. Gets very irritating at times but just make sure you carry an extra battery or 7 around with you. :)So overall, this phone has been everything you really need in a phone. I get comments all the time on the lack of a touchscreen and full keypad. Truth is, you really don't need either. The predictive text function does the job good enough and touch screens don't do much for me. This phone is focused around applications. There are hundreds and hundreds of applications (usually free) you can download that do anything from make your phone into a portable lightsaber to turning your phone into it's own WiFi Hotspot. The options are limitless with apps.
Every thing you need in a single device, GPS, WiFi, e-mail, web, Office, PDF, MP3, Video, Games. Feels nice in the hand, very good voice call quality.
The Nokia product is as decribed, only even better with added applications which you can purchase to suit your needs on the go. Also nice to know such Hi-tech can be rugged and tough!
this is the best cell phone i've ever had. the sky is the limit with this phone. i find out how to do something diffrent with it every day
This phone is the best phone on the world. its like a pc on the phone. everything you need is on the phone camera,camcorder,gps,mp3,wifi,voip. what more you need?
The best phone I've ever owned.....Everything the N95 does it does Perfectly.The only thing I don't like is the fact that there are some nice updates for this phones firmware, But because its the US version we don't get them.
I owned this phone and although many people praise it, it gave me a lot of grief. It is far from "perfect" as others put it here. It may have to do with Amazon maybe (and I am reflecting what I was told by Nokia) that they are not authorized to sell Nokia products so they may be selling bad batches or refurbished products...If the phone I had owned is the real deal, then take praises hereto with a grain of salt. There are many flaws to the phone starting in the Bluetooth pairing (drove me nuts..) to GPS which takes forever to sync and get you your position.Battery life time? The biggest exaggeration. What is stated in the spec, is not even close to reality (but every manufacturer is overstating this parameter because they know it's hard to test).Camera: Even with its stated 5M pixels, quality is typical to Sony, bad! I have a Canon 4MP which has a far better picture quality. No comparison.Although it has 8GB, loading songs which is a cumbersome task on its own, will eat up a lot of juice. Couple that with GPS maps and photos you would want to take and save, you quickly run out of memory.SO I think buying a different model with MicroSDHC is a better option.Additionally the phone tend to get sluggish takes some time to respond to a menu item, taking photo, editing music, etc...There are some good features to it in call making, contacts, SMS etc (the classic phone features)My conclusion: It is not worth the price. Think about what you expect from this phone and consider other realistic options.I give it 3 stars, as after all it is a phone that serves some purpose.
I dont want to add much to already reviewed feautures.I bought this phone in Nov 2007 and till now did not have single problem.Meanwhile I tried iphone 3G, Motorazr2 V9 and Sony ericsson W580i... but now back to this powerful Nokia.I use this for browsing,checking mails and everyday in Gym as a music device. Battery is really good, and reception exceptional.
This is a powerful phone. It's also a good tool for entertainment. Everything is perfect except the battery. I have to charge my battery everyday.But after all it's a great phone that I've ever used. If I buy another one later, I will go for Nokia.
I've had this phone for a month or so, and I discover some new trick or feature or something this thing can do everyday.The only thing that I am having trouble with is the music loading or unloading via Microsoft Sync, this system gets confused as to what is and is not on the phone.
Thought I purchased a great cellphone. It did everything I wanted but when it came connecting to my BMW X-5 it was very frustrating. Called BMW who said it was not on their approved list. Then called Nokia who was aware of the problem but offered no fix at this time. Oh well. The $600 phone is going back. Boo Hoo
ok look...i LOVE NOKIA. all the reviews have said great things. however on day two of ownership my LCD screen will not come on. the phone is on but it will not come on. this to me is a bad omen and i have to return it and not for replacement. im sorry. take this review for what its worth. for me i just am leary now of the model. on the plus side. yes... its really packed full of features....however i do admit that keypad is a bit on the small side. for me.... its definately loud and the graphics are pretty...i will admit that it isnt always the smoothest as it transiitons from menu to menu. i did get to download ngage games and that was kewl. and the gps was neat but keep in mind you do need a data plan of sorts in order to use it...i thought you didnt either way i didnt have anytime to figure it out before it died this morning. for this amount of money and with no tech support from my tmobile since its unlocked i simply can not take the risk nor do i want to mess with nokia usa warranty. i really wanted to love this phone...really! i think i will look at the e71 im sorry for having to post this review...i hope it was just a one fluck with my unit.in closing...it is a good phone...but i think its a bit quirky and for me...i didnt consider it an excellent phone...in fact...my nokia 6131 worked better...sorry for the bad review...
I had a Blackberry and moved to N95 hoping for a better phone and email appliance. Boy was I wrong! To read emails, I need to push1. Messaging2 to 5 keys: Go down with the arrow 3 items to my inbox6. Options7 to 10 keys: Retrieve Emails11. New11 Strokes to read my email!!!Then, if i want to read beyond the header, click and wait again.This is too much trouble, is not friendly or fast.To delete the messages from the phone is impossible, the headers will remain there, unless I delete all the messages from the server. I want my messages on the server, as a backup, but now i need to move them to another folder, for the sake of the Nokia!After I do that, I need to synch the phone again, and it takes FOREVER to remove and clean up the inbox.This is not a phone for people who use it for work
Ya voy comprando como 15 de estos celulares y puedo decir que son de excelente calidad, sus funciones son muy buenos, la camara de las mejores en el mercado. No hay duda que este es un celular que vale la pena, lo recomiendo. Saludos a toda la gente de Peru y Sudamerica!!
tuve problemas con el celular.. se descompuso los 10 dias de haberme llegado pero no tuve ningun problema con la garantia.. a los 15 dias la gente de amazon me envio un celular nuevo
This phone has all the cool features I looked for in a phone, blue tooth is ok, playback of mp3 is of good quality. Operating system is stale, it only has frozen 4 or 5 times in 8 months. The only problem with it is quality!!!! After using is for 6 months, treating it like a pearl, no drops no scratches or nothing.... the center bottom fell off, then the circle around it. It seemed to be glued, not attached in any other way. I guess with the heat the phone produces, glue just gave in.Mi cousin has the same exact phone and but it same week I did, and when I saw him last week. Surprise, same buttons where missing from his phone. Went to the dealer, and they said, when the buttons go off, we give it no guarantee!!!
I bought this cell phone several months ago, and I was very pleased.. for about the first couple weeks. Shortly after I got this phone it went funny, and I have had the same center buttons fall off. It went from being slow once, then more, and now every time I try to do something I end up waiting several seconds. It may not seem like a lot, but when it takes you several minutes to type a single text message it gets old. Also, it will not play music any longer. I would not recommend this phone to anybody simply because there are so many better phones that actually work.
My last Motorola phone was a Dynatac 8000G, and it worked great for years. A few months ago, I bought a Z6m and now hate not just the phone, but Motorola. (The Z6m is the CDMA variant; I've observed that all sorts of GSM phones regularly cause interference, violating US FCC rules part 15, and therefore unlawful to operate.)The first thing that infuriated me was the speakerphone. It isn't loud enough to use in a moving car, even when holding it near my head. (Under the same conditions, my old Nokia worked just fine, allowing me to keep both hands on the steering wheel.) The MP3 player can play plenty loud through the same speaker, indicating to me that it's not the fault of the speaker, but an intentional shortcoming designed to sell Motorola's hands-free car kit.Even while using all the power-saving options, I still can't get a second day's use out of the phone before recharging, and that's with a brand-new battery. My Nokia gave me a week.The phone supports adding a memory card only up to 2GiB because it uses FAT16 and not FAT32. It would be nice to offer a non-Microsoft file system, if only Motorola could get the disk interface right.Plug in a USB cable to a computer and it charges the phone, and allows access to the memory (card if installed or main if not) or the modem.See something you want to take a picture of? Hold down the button and wait. It launches the camera application, so wait some more. The moment is long gone.I went somewhere with no service and quickly learned that I couldn't even set the clock to the right time.Want to browse the Web? Forget it.The designs of many parts of this thing were outsourced and clearly not managed competently.This is the last Motorola product I buy. I feel ripped off, and hope to soon replace the phone and punch any of its designers in the nose.
I currently have this phone and I find it to be amazing. It is a phone that has a stylish look and multiple functions. When I play music, I don't have to use the headphones, it comes out clear. I'm the type of person that likes to customize my ring tones; I am able to do so with this phone.
I have had this phone for 2 months now. It a great phone just sometimes when i call people they cant hear me all they hear is someones else phone call. and also i dont always get peoples picture messages. texting is easy, i atleast have to charge my phone everynight. but otherwise a good phone but not to many phones can be perfect!
The servis is superb and the nerchandise is excellent. It had met my expectations in all respect. It is indeed user friendly. All pros and no cons as far as I can see. Believe you me, it does what the features say it can do. I definitely recommend this phone to everyone. Do not not be swayed away by the negative reviews, they are just isolated incidents. In actuality, this is an excellent cell phone.
i owned and i can do a lot of stuff...seem simple but got every thin...nice flash camera and mp3 player... great telephone and support over the internet around the world...so don't worry about paying for music or games and apps when you can get it free and pass it with usb cable is really easy...this cellphone is actually much better than the other z6tv z6c or z6m just read the review and also it has a 500hz processor same as the famous v8, v9...
I bought this phone as a replacement for my Nokia E51 business smartphone. I know this choice sounds odd. I just accidentally dropped my E51 in water and needed an inexpensive phone I can use before I can get a free upgrade from AT&T.;This phone is slim and build quality is good for the price. As for the low call/speakerphone volume, you can actually increase it (and it gets really loud). I assigned the "volume" function to one of the keys (Settings > My Shortcuts) and now can adjust the volume (even while you talk). Reception is above average.What's not so good about this phone is its grainy low resolution low color depth screen. It reminds me of one of the first phones I had back in the early 2000s. And of course, its basic functionality and lack of many features. However, if you need a phone to make/receive calls, this little phone is right for you.UPDATE!!!! There is another thing about this phone that annoys me much - you'll get a lot of dust and other particles between the screen and screen cover. Considering the screen is already far from being perfect, this makes it just the worst phone screen ever. Giving it two stars not four.
I can't believe Nokia made such a useless product 2630 model (in comparison to Nokia 6126). This was supposed to be my secondary basic phone, but so disappointing -1) The call volume is too low2) Loud Speaker (handsfree) volume is also quite low.3) Bluetooth range is less4) Frequent disconnection from laptop connection (bluetooth sync)5) During the call, when the device syncs, it is not an easy task to get back to call options6) No easy option to turn off the radio. You have to navigate to the menu to turn it off.7) When you look at the picture, you will notice two ear pieces (buds), but that's not what in the box.I will not recommend this product.
The Nokia 2630 is a good practical phone with a useful camera and speakerphone.  There's nothing more useful than a speakerphone when waiting on hold.  The FM radio is an added benefit although it requires that you have earphones handy in your pocket or purse.I threw away my free flip-phone from the provider (actually I stashed it in a drawer) and shopped for a phone with the features I wanted.  Buying an unlocked phone is a lot cheaper than upgrading from my service provider.The Nokia 2630 is really thin making it great for a pocket phone.  The best part is that it has no side buttons to accidentally push that hang-up on the caller when you reach in your pocket to get the phone.  The sound quality could be a little better especially in noisy environments but I haven't found that to be a major problem.  All in all I am quite satisfied.
If you're looking for a simple, but with all that you need now a days, hare you have it. Is perfect, small, slime, cheap, good appearance, easy to use.JUST THE BASIC, no more, no less. If is just to call, sms, and some pictures is great!
This is a very good value for your money. I love the slim built and compared to the higher end phones there is not much difference as it relates to features.Gallery storage space could have been more but with that price I cant ask for much more.The FM radio is very handy although it would have been nice if the radio could work without the earphones.My coworker has a higher end nokia but she loves mine but I love it more.Lovely phone.
The Nokia 2630 phone is light and thin. It has the basic necessary features I look for. The only complaint I have is the lack of volume control or calls.
Both Amazon's product description AND the Nokia website say that this phone has pop3, etc, email.  Amazon's description mentions it several times.It does not.  The manual does not mention it, and it is obviously not present on the phone.I returned it immediately, and did not spend much time with other features.  The display is brighter than the older Nokia 2610, although scan lines are occasionally visible.  The menu speed is also slightly improved from the 2610, although still slower than any of the low-price Ericsson models.
This phone is the worse touch screen device i have used. I have used many touch screen devices like HTC Touch and iPhone and i gotta tell you, this phone is samsung's first touch device and it sucks. Secondly this OS is properitry to where you will not find any programs for it.Go and instead buy a Samsung Omnia i900 which is windows mobile and touch screen is A LOT better.
We bought this phone as a gift and it works well and is easy to use. We like it so much that we're buying another one for ourselves.
I had this Phone.  It gets great signal and is very sturdy... I'm a teenage boy who is extremely hard on phones...this phone took everything i dished out and then some.  I wish i had never sold it.  It is a good buy especially for those who aren't exactly "nice" to their phones.
Motorola V197 Unlocked Cell Phone--U.S. Version with Warranty (Charcoal)Don't even consider buying from Amazon.com.  I've spent thousands through them, & made the fatal error that they actually monitor the resellers they profit from, but disclaim all responsibility.  Bought this "new" "US" cell from HassleFreeCell (irony aside)--which they STILL sponsor: 1)"SUBTLE" indication that it was returned, not new: no plastic wrap on (slightly crushed) box (cheapo packaging), clear plastic shipping protectors slapped on worse than a a very uncoordinated 3-year old, no install disk; & 2) (what a surprise) DOESN'T WORK--both XP (2 different computers) & Vista return fatal hardware install messages--small wonder it was returned goods.And Amazon??? Too bad, deal with the nice folks who cheated in the 1st place (& don't even have the cell listed on their own website).  Add idiot customer "support"--clear message that the main issue was used goods--later found out it was defective for good measure--& these bozos respond "sorry it was damaged during shipping."Caveat emptor--shop at a reputable website.
The best thing I like about this cellphone is its loudness: built-in speaker is loud and speakerphone is loud.  This helps a lot if you're in a noisy restraunt (reason I dumped my old cellphone).Pluses:1. Well designed music player UI and dedicated buttons.2. Loud speaker for playing music.3. Standard 1/8" mini jack for headphones.4. Solid buttons, crisp display5. Very small, stylishMinuses:1. Short battery life -- must charge almost every night.2. Camera is fair in quality.3. No 3G
Pros:- Phone is compact- For a small phone has decent MP3 quality- Clean lines- Sturdy casing- Separate ports for charging, USB and earphones- Call quality seems to be good- Simple Bluetooth connectivity- Easy menu interface- Convenient music player controls- All necessary accessories (except for a travel charger) are included in the package (along with 2GB Micro SD)- Seems to retain its charge well (stand-by and talk time)- Nokia technical support, phone features, and website access to options without nickle-and-diming you really stands out.Cons:- Speakerphone could be louder (however new FCC rulings place limitations on US Version phones with this capability so Nokia is simply abiding by the FCC).- Voice dialing gets it right about 80% of the time.- Using Nokia PC Sync software may still not allow you to Sync with the phone.  Was unable to get this problem resolved.For the most part am very pleased with the phone.  My only serious disappointment is my inability to Sync, however that may be unique to myself.  Am very pleased with the extent of service by Nokia technical support in providing guidance and support, and appreciate the Nokia website which offers various extras (software and other downloads) free of charge when other manufacturers expect you to purchase some of the same options to fully utilize the features of their phones.I also commend Amazon.com customer and wireless services personnel for their attentiveness and dedication to true customer service!
The Nokia 5310, aka "The Music Xpress", is one nifty little phone! Sure, it's no iPhone, but if you want something that got just about as many bells and whistles for a little less money, you want this phone.The 5130 is available in purple, orange, red and blue (I own the purple). It's very thin and small, but fits easily in the palm of your hand and doesn't give the impression it's going to fall apart if you look at it cross-eyed.The buttons are raised up just a bit. The display is bright and vibrant. If you have T-Mobile service with this phone, you'll find it can handle the My Favorites plan just fine, with nice little icons and customizable options fo each person.The phone has several nifty features, including a 2 megapixel camera that takes good-to-very-good quality pictures. It can also function as a video camera, doing both sound and image. There's no flash or self-portrait mirror, but you can make do. The screen acts as a view finder, of course. There's also four different levels of zoom and several different video effects (like black and white, negative, false color, etc). There's a nifty little mini-USB port you can use to move your files to a computer (assuming you have a cable. Thankfully the phone comes with one).There's also the usual selection of programs, like a calculator, alarm clock, organizer, etc. The system also comes with a few game demos, none of which are particularly memorable.Ah, but you want to know about the biggie, right? You want to know all about the music capability!Well, this phone doesn't disapoint. There's external music controls and an external volume control. You can turn it up loud enough to annoy the people next door if you really try. There's also a headphone jack that, thankfully, allows for normal headphones to be used. I have a neat little set I got on a Delta flight, and they work just fine.When I bought the phone it came with the USB cable I mentioned earlier, as well as a stereo hands-free headset with a detachable mic, and, joy of joys, a 1 gigabyte memory card! That's a really nice thing to have! I've got quite a bit of music on mine and it isn't even close to being filled. Tiny card, too. About the size of a fingernail.Overall there's no real reason not to recommend this phone. It's sleek and stylish, has a great price point, comes with plenty of goodies and plays music very, very well. It's worth every penny I paid for it, and that's not something I can often say!
Love the compact size... automatically locks when not in use... 4GB of music and videos... great screen and input keys.  I'd change the location of the volume controls, currently you have to reposition your hold to change the volume.  The PC Sync took some work to get it working with Outlook but now it works like a charm.  (Quick tip: try syncing without the SIM and SD card the first time, it'll force the software to reset)

The phone is amazing. It's simple, yet very entertaining. Camera takes nice pictures, but there is a small delay after a shot. I'm not sure if it's a setting I must change.  However, it is still a nice purchase. Handy mp3 player, as well. The price was incredible. I think I might have gotten it at the lowest price. =)
I recently bought this phone and it works great. has signal everywhere where my other phone sony erricsson 580i does. very easy to click pictures and play music.
This phone is okay for teens.  The picture quality is not as good as other 2.0's you must be exactly still to take a good photo.  The battery life is horrible.  I am not a real talker, but if I don't charge this phone every night I will not be able to make it through the next morning and buyer beware if you buy this phone from T-mobile, they WILL NOT take it back if you have it more than 14 days.
THIS PHONE IS VERY TINY AND EASY TO CARRY WITH. I LOVE THE SOUND SYSTEM, IT PLAYS VERY LOUD, AND YOU CAN CHANGE IT FROM POP,ROCK, JAZZ, WHAT EVER, IT'S LIKE A LIL MP3 PLAYER. IT COMES WITH 3 FREE GAMES, AND 3 THAT IS A DEMO, WHICH IS NOT BAD AT ALL FOR ME. YOU CAN PUT AS MUCH RING TONES AS YOU LIKE ON THERE WITHOUT PURCHASING ONE. IT HAS RADIO, WHICH I LOVE. I WISH I COULD LISTEN TO THAT ON MY BLUETOOTH INSTEAD OF THE EAR PIECE. I DIDN'T GIVE FIVE STAR BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE I HAD, HAD A SHORTAGE, IT KEPT TURNING IT SELF OFF AND FREEZING, LUCKLY IT HAPPEN THE FIRST DAY THAT I HAD IT, SO I EXCHANGE IT FOR THE SAME KIND, AND THIS ONE IS AMAZING,I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. MY ADVISE IS TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO HOW THE PHONE OPERATE WHEN YOU FIRST RECEIVE YOURS SO YOU WON'T HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAD, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THE PHONE IS GREAT, GREAT SIGNAL, VOLUME, FUN TO HAVE.
Amazing phone, soooo slim! All the music in one place, great smart phone and agenda functionality, camera... at a reasonable price.No issue at all with the car Bluetooth connection in my case!
Almost too thin of a phone but biggest issues is that when connecting to bluetooth in car if choose to use handset it doesn't reconnect back to bluetooth.  Also downloading music is difficult and not compatible with Itunes.  When trying to download putting CD in Nokia Suite keeps telling phone not supported by Suite.
I bought this to replace my Tmobile MDA. What I needed/wanted was a touch screen with Microsoft Excel. I update my stats for work on the touch screen very easily. I also like that I can download alot of different softwares that run on windows mobile. This allows alot of customization. The increased ram & hard drive on this was perfect for me. I had to soft reset my MDA daily. I soft reset my Touch maybe once/wk. I bought an 8gb SDHC that can hold A LOT of stuff. I have more than 40 audiobooks; 30+ mp3 songs, a lot of games, 20+ pdf files (scanned documents), and I've only used up 2.5 gb of my SD card. Battery life is very good. The Touch pairs easily with my bluetooth and I can easily talk for 4-5 hrs on the bluetooth and the phone still has 50%+ battery life. Everyone else has to plug in their cell phone. Pictures aren't the best, but it's only 2 MP and I'm used to using a 7 MP, so I really don't use the Touch's camera features. Also, you can set up your yahoo email accts and it will automatically receive all new emails every 5 mins if you want. I think it can do the same with other email accounts but I'm not 100% sure. Overall, I really like how thin and lightweight the Touch is in comparison to my MDA. Hope this helps.
I was given this phone by my company. I have a Nokia 6682 myself and I thought I was going to miss all the features in the 6682 but I was surprised that this phone not only has the same features enhanced but radio is great. The camera is better. The only thing is that I would have liked to keep a previous ring tone from my other phone.
I purchased the European version of the Diamond for use in the US on ATT. I have not had any problems so far with voice service. Data service is slower than I had on my Blackjack, but I knew that would happen. The Diamond has Wifi and it has been easy to connect to my home network and to hot spots to get broadband internet service.The Diamond was designed to be a one hand device. It really is possible to do everything with one hand, even use the camera. (I recommend using two hands when using any camera for better stability.) The 3.2 megapixel camera isn't bad for a mobile phone, certainly better than many I've used before- when there is sufficient light. There is no flash, so your indoor photography will be disappointing.The Touch Flo interface which seemed almost like frosting on top of plain old Windows Mobile in other HTC touch devices, is very much a fully intergrated part of the system on the Diamond. It runs very well and is every bit as intuitive as other touch oriented devices. You can turn Touch Flo off, but I don't know why you'd want to.Diamond's good looks demonstrate that Windows Mobile devices can be great looking as well as powerful. The phone is attractive off or on, but it also great to look at when you're working on it because of the VGA screen. After several days, it still startles me how much clearer text and graphics are on this phone.Thanks HTC for including the Opera browser. You can still browse the web using pages for mobile units if you'd like with IE, but you will want to step up to the real internet with Opera. Scroll, pan, zoom if you need to, but with that VGA screen, you may not even need to do so.Battery life on the Diamond is as advertised unless you make heavy use of Wifi or the music player or camera. These will significantly diminish your time between charges.A few final points: yes, the phone collects fingerprints. So do all touch devices. Sound quality on calls has been good in my experience. Sound quality on the music player is not as good as on a dedicated MP3 device. The FM radio is a great feature. I hadn't come close to filling a 2Gb micro SD card on my Blackjack so the 4Gb internal storage on the Diamond should be sufficient. Will you master every touch move immediately? No. Within a day or so? Yes.If you live in Europe or Asia or live in the US but don't need 3G service, the Diamond is a great phone. It's pretty darn close to great even with its present US limitation.
The Good:  Full features - e-mail, internet, GPS, photos, all the connections you will need (tri-band, wi-fi, 3G, GPRS, Edge).  Looks great, can carry in a pocket without knowing it's there.  It avoids many problems of the i-Phone (i.e. you can replace your own battery, and sound on calls is good.)The Bad:  Problems with almost every feature that I expect will be worked out in superior phones in the next year or two.The Big Problems:  Battery life is very short.  With even moderate e-mail or internet use, one charge will not last a full day.  And recharging takes longer than any other phone I've had.The screen is too small.  I would be happy to carry a slightly bigger phone to get another 1/2 inch larger screen.  Anyone who's shortsighted or has big thumbs will have problems using many applications and commands on the small screen.Other Problems:  Using your thumb on the screen to scroll takes quite a bit of practice, and in many applications, it's VERY difficult to avoid selecting an item when you're trying to scroll.  For example, try adding a new city in the weather application - it's nearly impossible to scroll through the list of countries and cities without selecting unintentionally, and selecting the wrong item means you have to start all over again.Windows Mobile 6.1 is billed by Microsoft as simplified access to applications compared to 6.0, but I find this software more complicated, requiring more button taps than the Windows 6.0 on my Dopod C500.  Finding various settings can be extremely difficult, since many settings appear in different places and don't always seem logical:  want to change the settings on your e-mail?  The one you're looking for could be hidden in 3 or 4 different places.Entry Device:  The "letter recognizer," using the stylus on the screen, is much faster than a QWERTY keyboard, and is great for composing a long e-mail or text message.  But to send a quick text message, using a phone pad with dictionary is still much easier and requires only one hand.  The Diamond has an on-screen phone pad available (no hardware phone pad), but changing from one entry method to another (from stylus entry to phone pad entry) with one hand is very difficult.  Unless they make changes to allow access to the phone pad faster and easier, it would be better to have a slide out hardware pad.  One of the great features on my Dopod C500 was easy switching between the phone keypad and the QWERTY keyboard.  HTC needs to work on this with the Diamond.The internal-only storage (4 gig) is large, but my guess is a changeable storage card would be better.  Also, the Diamond has only one port for charger, USB connection, or hands-free headphones, and changing the SIM card requires removal of the battery.  The camera, though advertised as 3.2 mp, is practically useless.  All the photos come out blurry, and unless taken outdoors in daylight are too dark.Finally, I use the phone in Thailand, where 3G is not available.  Using the internet with GPRS is normally very slow, and getting the internet to work when roaming in other countries is difficult.  The application to download my Hotmail rarely works, and nobody can tell me if the problem is with the phone or with the Windows Live servers.  I have to check my hotmail through the internet browser instead, which is very slow.  I have a feeling that 2 or 3 years from now, we'll have far superior download speeds on mobile phones.This phone is a very good effort, but HTC needs to work out the problems to have a really superior product.
There is not much I can really add to these early reviews. The phone is pretty good. My reception is clear and the phone feels sturdy in your hands. I have to agree with the disappointment in the battery life - although the manual does say it may take a few charging to get the battery to specifications but my phone is dead at the end of the day.I have had about three resets since owning it now for about five days and a sync with my Vista Dell yielded some pretty strange messages that have since disappeared. The screen is gorgeous and the touch is good but no where near the iTouch or I assume the iPhone. It took about a half day to get the hang of what kind of touch was required.Yes the screen gets tacky with touching but so do all the other products. Textured protectors will help and hopefully better ones, than the one it ships with, will come out as time goes on.Cost was a big factor in choosing this phone over the iPhone which is ridiculously expensive in Canada with limited carriers. Will I stay with it? I will give it two weeks to improve the battery life - if it doesn't improve I will turn it back in on my 30 day DOA clause. Could I live with it for my three year contract? I really don't think that it is that durable but I might be wrong. In the end - even though I don't like the OS - I will probably be forced to go with the Blackberry.I hope the battery thing resolves.I recommend caution when purchasing this phone and be aware of these early problems.Update:My first phone experienced software issues that resulted in daily restarts after about six months. The weather would never update without something going wrong. The software issues were acknowledged by my providers Tech Support. (I thought updates would be pushed to me - nope) It was replaced with a refurbished unit.On the first refurb unit bottom panel buttons went n/s after 3 months. No drop. No hard use. Just didn't work one day. However the software issues that plagued my first unit seemed to be resolved. Got another refurb unit (my second).The second refurb had again serious software issues and increased restarts of two to three a day. Again software issues acknowledged by provider. Again no fix.Finally I spoke with my provider and it agreed to give me a credit toward any of the smartphones in their line. I chose the Palm Pro. See review.In light of my HTC experience over the course of a year I really can't recommend this phone. And I would have serious reservation about any of its other products.
People complaining about the phone being slow should install the latest ROM (or one from xda developers). It will also improve battery life.If you want a regular phone, just get a nokia and get out of here... If you want a PDA that is also a phone, get the diamond and have some fun! This is a device for those freaks like me who like to install lots os third-party apps and mess around with the system.Battery life, btw, is ok to me, just don't leave wifi, 3g, and etc on all the time (anyway, what's the point of having them on if you are not using??). Or just get an extended battery and your problems are solved (There is one very nice from HTC - 1350mAh, but cost around $70 - others exist, even with 2200 mAh, but they ruin phone appearance!!).Sorry for the bad english...
A splendid phone with a plethora of features that put many other devices to shame.Pros: - HTC have done a good job customizing the default Windows Mobile experience. The device is thumb friendly almost 95% of the time. - VGA screen is really beautiful. - GPS reception is great. I managed to get a fix indoors sometimes. - Very fast and responsive (mine shipped with rom version 1.93, however, some people reported horrible performance using earlier roms). - Performs well as a music/video player. Sound quality in the included earphones is nothing spectacular. However, bluetooth stereo audio performance is wonderful. - A whole array of sensors make using the phone very easy (accelerometer automatically rotates the screen in certain applications, touch sensitive front panel helps in camera, browser and some other applications; some 3rd party applications required to fully unleash the potential)Cons: - Questionable battery life. The 900 mAh battery sometimes borders on the unusable. Adjusting to the battery drain/recharge cycle required. - Fingerprint magnet. Sometime I imagine government authorities using it to take criminals' fingerprints. :) - Gets fairly hot under stress (try using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS simultaneously). - Mine shipped without the case/pouch. I now live in constant fear of putting the device in my pocket.All-in-all it's a good phone, well worth its price. However, if you're looking to consolidate your other devices (phone, music player, GPS navigator, etc.) into this one device, then consider investing in a larger capacity battery, carry around an extra battery, or try a car-kit for charging when necessary. Using all the features available in the phone will leave you scrambling for a power outlet very quickly.
I bought this phone because I do not want to fall into the craze of iPhone and paid almost $700.00 for it but it was a disappointment. First it was supposed to be a touch phone but sometimes 4 out 10, it does not work with the touch. You will need to do the touching over and over again before it responds.  Sometimes it just start performing various functions on its own without control, like dialing on its own and choosing any of your contact number without you doing the calling. Secondly the battery saving mode does not make sense.  If you have a voicemail and needed to respond by choosing options like "for English please press 1". The battery saving mode sometimes refuses to light and you may miss out the opportunity at that time to receive or answers the call. Thirdly, I have never seen a phone that has the shortest battery usage as this phone.  If you are to use all the functions - Internet, Bluetooth etc, expect to have a charger within 2 hours or the phone will be dead. I had to buy like 2 batteries as "stand-by".  Lastly, the Internet most of the time just "hang" and you may need to remove the battery and start all over again. Moreover, the Internet is the slowest I ever saw in any phone. I am planning on returning the phone and getting another type of phone.  So disappointing
I really enjoy the features that this phone has and that I don't have to carry a phone and a PDA (like I used to) to get more connectivity than I used to.  I didn't get along with my phone for the first 2 weeks but now I understand it alot more and am able to get what I want off of it quickly.  The battery life is a major problem but one of the other reviews mentioned getting a larger battery.  I got this phone from sprint for about $250 after all the rebates and deals so I won't have a problem spending $70 for a better battery.PROS:-Looks awesome-Great Features (calendar, tasks, windows media/word/excel/ppt, opera browser, GPS)-Navigating around the different features is cool (but has a learning curve to it)-Lots of settings to personalize the device to your liking-Works with Rhapsody so you can download unlimited music to your device (legally with subscription)-Internet is lightening fast when even not on WI-FI (which is broadband capable)-Camera looks great and works well (again with a small learning curve)-Sound quality is ok (some cracks and pops sometimes)CONS:-Battery life short (I have to make sure I give it a mid-day charge-Some of calls to the device don't go through (I was standing right next to the guy who was calling me and his phone was ringing) (not sure what to think of this one because my last phone did that also just not as frequently)-The learning curveOVERALL:You are wondering, "should I buy this phone?"  I can only answer with another question...how logical are you at troubleshooting problems?  If you expect the phone to work out of the box, look for another phone but if you think you can do battle with some rather frustrating problems and win...this is the phone to get.  Most of what I learned about the phone came from the problems that I had because it is a very technical program.  As a phone, it functions well (with a few calls that just don't through but that could also be a result of a bad signal) and plays well with your contact list (which is also very detailed and cool).  As a PDA, it functions just as I would expect.  As a device, it behaves just like windows device so if you can accept the fact that it needs to be restarted for about 90% of the problems that arise you will never regret purchasing it.
I've heard about this handset for months before I really went for it. Two weeks ago I bought it from Telus with special data plan promotion (C$15 per month for unlimited emails and web browsing). After 7 days I returned it to the vendor and replaced with a Blackberry Curve.Telus' Diamond Touch is a sister model of the "real" Diamond. It was called "Victor" in Asia. Most of the hardware and softwares are the same but "Victor" doesn't have a diamond back, which is the reason why it is called Diamond.I've been a Blackberry user for two years. I also own an Apple iPod Touch (1st generation) for a year. They are good comparison to the Diamond.After receiving this tiny sexy Diamond Touch, I couldn't stop playing with it for the whole night. However, the touch screen was far from good as the iPod Touch, which is identical to my colleague's iPhone. The touch screen of Diamond was annoying to control. The web browser virtually didn't work. I touched the links of webpage but it couldn't go through, no matter I used my finger tip or the stylus. I read the user manuel to find out if I've done anything wrong. No, it just doesn't work. iPod Touch is much better in web browsing experience.The email function is okay, and of course far as good as the Blackberry. The Contact and Calendar are also hard to use. I should blame Windows Mobile for it, not HTC.Eventually, I hit the trigger to return this handset. It's input stuck on number mode. I couldn't make it back to ABC mode, until doing a hard reset and gave up all my data.I have gotten the Blackberry Curve for 4 days and very happy with it. If you want a fancy toy with powerful multimedia and web browing, get the iphone. If you use your handset a lot to talk and receive/reply emails, get a Blackberry.
I have owned this device for one week and I finally put it on ebay. This is the most beautiful phone I have ever seen, but it is also the slowest one. The touchflow interface is not very reactive, it is not uncommon to have to wait for the scrolling to happen; sometimes the slow speed causes unwanted selections to be made.Loading any decent size application takes forever (e.g., flexmail).I had serious problems connecting to the local EDGE network (T-mobile) - it would just hang forever (my T-mobile dash zips on EDGE in comparison).A very nicely designed device but with serious problems.
This phone has all the features I expected, the performance is excellent and I have no complaints.the thouch flo 3d is incredible, as it works alongside the Windows Mobile 6.1 pro, there is not much to say. 100% recommended
I gave it one star because:  +1 It has a very classy design.It lost four stars because:  -1 It is too slow.  -1 Low battery Life.  -1 Difficulty in using the touch screen.  -1 Too expensive compared to the other phones with the same technologies available in this phone.
I do not know why, but it came without touch flo 3d.Other things ok.
Great phone. My granddaughter has this phone in her hand all the time. If she is not texting she is listening to her music. If you buy it you will not be disappointed.
I received this unlocked phone from MobileCityOnline.com (via Amazon) in the last week or two.  I've spent hours of time with tech support with Motorola trying to work out the kinks.  Let's start by saying it's a very cool smartphone with tons of features.  BUT - the caveat is that many  would have only worked if I'd lived overseas.First, the charger that came in the package is non-compatible with U.S. outlets,  and so I purchased (at very low cost) another charger to get the phone working.Then, although my manual was in English,  the phone itself (menus, etc) were all in Chinese,  presumably because it came from Hong Kong and was geared toward that area.  Hence the first call to tech support.After working through converting  the language to English (I'd needed help navigating the menu's since they were all Chinese),  I tried to do simple things like buy new ringtones and wallpaper.Come to find out,  no dice. These are not able to be downloaded in Atlanta (or U.S. period, apparently). Motorola tech support reported that they could not help as the phone model is not supported in the U.S. I am also unable to access the web.I've spent too many hours with tech support in the short time I've owned this phone, and so I need to return it. I have never have needed to contact tech support for help with any other phone, and have never needed to return one.Please be careful before you spend 259.00 on this model if you live in the U.S.So, here I am today, spending more time (on a beautiful Saturday afternoon) making YET another call; this time to MobileCityOnline.com to return the phone.
thank you for the service, I was very pleased to receive the phone so fast, 100% recomendable
This is my 4th Motorola phone and I LOVE it. I don't generally espouse such affection for my electronic toys and gadgets, but the phone really does deserve high praise IMHO. The quality and asthetics are great (although, I would have preferred slightly more contrast of color in the face) and it has enough features to make it a useful device without the bulk of a smartphone. Obviously, BlueTooth stereo rocks (no pun intended) but you WILL need BT headphones because there isn't a headset jack. It's unlocked, so you'll have to do a bit of research and tinkering for web settings and MMS, but once done, $15/mo through AT&T; gets unlimited web access with video from news, sports, and entertainment channels. You can also view YouTube videos. Download Yahoo Go! and Opera Mini (both are free) and you've got a GREAT litte device that gives you internet access and information at 3G speed to pass idle bits of time, but is still primarily a slim and sexy phone that fits discreetly into your pocket or purse.
I have no problem for this unit except for the phone tools driver that comes with it. I look like the phone tools is not compatible with the cellphone.
Over the past decade I have been through half a dozen cell phones. With a brief (and unsatisfactory) PANASONIC interlude, I have always gone NOKIA and did not regret it.My previous phone was NOKIA 6230i, a stylish working horse that, after three years of non-stop use, lately kept having ringer failure. I loved my phone and, although realized its time was up, did not want to have to familiarize myself with a whole different Menu SetUp.The NOKIA 6500-SLIDER was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful and robust brushed-steel finish, a large screen of impressive quality and one of the best phone cameras available (a 3.2Mpixels sensor behind an autofocus Carl Zeiss lens with flash). An important detail: the brushed steel is NOT that sensitive to fingerprint marks and will not require the constant wiping that other metal models do.The menu is intuitive and easy to use even if new to NOKIA 6-series. The buttons are large enough for adult fingers and, important for a slider phone, even the top buttons are fully accessible.Like most NOKIAs, the phone is greatly customizable, from colors and sounds to wallpapers and screensavers. It is robustly built and the slider glides easily in place with zero wobbling. NOKIA 6500-SLIDER is a beautiful phone that can be your helper for years.My only complaints are actually...three:(1) the very limited OnBoard memory (it has only 20MB - when my older 6230i had almost double that). Since only mp3s and photos stored on the Phone memory are guarantied to work when used as ring-tones or contact/group images, to have a cavernous 256MB Memory Card yet a puny 20MB OnBoard capacity seems ironic.(2) the placement of the speakerphone in the...back of the phone. Activate it and the phone speaks to your desk, voices coming out all muffled; and(3) the absence of photo stabilization. It may seem excessive for a phone, however when increasing the pixel number beyond 3M, image stabilization is actually essential if photos of any value are to be taken.All in all, an excellent stylish phone that, (six months after its initial release) should be available at bargain prices.
This cell phone is amazing. TONS AND TONS AND A LOT OF FEATURES! SONY ERICSSON DID A GREAT JOB WITH THIS SLIDER PHONE.  THE SERVICE NEVER DROPPED (SURPRISINGLY FOR AN UNLOCKED PHONE).  TEXTING WAS EASY FOR ME I GOT USED TO IT.  OTHER THEN THAT IT'S BEEN A YEAR WITH THIS PHONE AND IM STILL GOING WITH IT!
DO NOT BUY. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I HAVE MADE.Read other reviews in other pages. Same problems. Very pretty phone, extremely BAD and frustrating. Turns off by itself and many many other things. Just dont buy it, trust me.
This phone is truly amazing.  I got one for my 86 year old blind, arthritic mother who is in a nursing home, and liked it so much (I'm 61) that I upgraded my old Sony Ericsson to a Pantech Breeze.  I ordered hers with voice dial and all she has to do is open the phone, press *8 and the phone asks her what she wants to do.  She says who she wants to call and it dials the number for her.  When she is done, all she has to do is just close it.  I couldn't figure out how she could use a Bluetooth headset with voice dial.  That is due to Bluetooth controls, not the phone.The keypad is close to as large as a regular phone, with keys that are slightly raised in the center.  I measured the size of the numbers on the display screen, and they are a full 1/2 inch tall!  The size can be adjusted.For the most part, I was able to start using it without really reading the user's manual.  I had never used Bluetooth before, so that took more time.  I took it to my local AT&T; store and they transfered all of the contents of my address book.  For my Mom's phone, I put her address book in via the internet.  She lives in California and I live in Illinois, so being able to manage it at a distance is a real plus.The phone has great clarity and although it is considered a entry level phone, it beats my old phone hands down.  Some people call it the "little old lady phone", but to me, it is more of a cradle to grave phone.The only thing I wish they had done differently is the cover for connecting the charger and wired headset.  My Mom, even if she could see, would not be able to recharge the phone without assistance.  I even have a hard time gaining access to the connection slot.AT&T; states that the talk time battery life is at least three hours.  Well, I got almost 10 hours which is partially due to the fact that both of us have a very strong signal and I don't send graphics, read email, surf the net or take pictures.Some people have complained that it only comes in white, but I could care less. Clarity of sound and ease of use are of higher priority.All in all, this phone does everything it claims to, and then some.
Okay, I've had this phone for a couple of weeks, and I like it quite a lot.  It's slick-looking, thin and pearly white, lightweight, and fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans.As others may have said, the battery seems to hold a charge for a good long time, and the big buttons are nice.  I haven't had the opportunity (?) to test out the sturdiness of it yet, but I'm sure that will happen sooner or later.The thing I like best about this phone, though, is that it's LOUD.  I do concert photography, so I spend a lot of time in noisy bars and at outdoor music festivals, and I can actually hear this phone when it rings, even when it's in my back pocket.  I had to turn down the receiver volume from the factory default setting, because it was uncomfortably loud.  How great is that?I changed the menu setting from the EZ setting to the advanced setting, in order to have more options and control, so I can't honestly say I've noticed the menus being any easier to navigate than any other phone I've ever had.  And it may just be because I haven't gotten used to it yet, but entering text -- phone numbers and text messages -- seems more awkward than with other phones.  The button that I instinctively expect to use to delete characters, instead throws me out of text-writing mode and the phone asks me if I want to save what I've entered as a draft or not, without giving me the option of saying, "Oops!" and going back to continue entering text.  I don't like that.  I've abandoned more than one text message from frustration and not having time to try again, that way.So: I like the phone.  I think I'll get used to the texting weirdness, and it's all worth it for the YAY!VOLUME! and -- if it turns out to be true -- the tough, takes-a-lickin'-and-keeps-on-tickin' survivability of the thing.
I've had this phone for 3 months and it is for EVERYONE! Large buttons.. bright screen.. Bluetooth.. my own mp3 rings assignable to whoever calls (My wife's call says I LOVE YOU).. easy to use in both the EZ mode and advanced mode, etc. The only thing wrong is that it has low signal strength when on the fringes. Other phones have 2 bars when this one has none. But if you mainly are within a good cell signal, look at this phone seriously!  You'll like it!
The people that placed this ad neglected to list the specs on this phone. At this time the only HTC Diamonds in the US are imported European phones and so they support the European frequencies. This phone only supports the 900/1800/1900 GSM frequencies, ATT sometimes uses the 800-850 frequency for GSM in the US so if you use ATT you might find yourself without service. Europe and Asia both use different 3G frequencies than are going to be used in the US. If that is not a big deal for you and your current GSM service provider does not use 800-850 and you are not interested in 3G service then this is a cool phone.  However, I would wait until HTC releases this phone in the US where it will have the correct frequencies supported and you will be able to use 3G.  If you haven't already done so, you should also check out the HTC Diamond Pro which is the same phone with an added slide out keyboard.
The phone looks very good, the screen is clear with crisp images and it has many nice features, but a very poor battery life. It hardly lasts a day. The touch-responsive user interface is a big disappointment and scrolling is far from Apple's iPhone. It is impossible to not open applications while scrolling. This is not an iPhone killer. The camera lacks flash and you can not upgrade your memory from the 4GB (I knew this but I like to remind potential buyers about it).  I regret buying it and we now use it only for the games, the screen is very good. I hope HTC will provide upgraded software for the touch-responsive interface so the function gets close to iPhone's, and on new phones, better battery life, a flash, and a slot to upgrade the memory to at least 8GB.
This is a really good phone but I think the touch screen is worse than IPhone. It not accpets memory cards, but the 4 gb is more than enought for me. Overall it is a good phone.
Muy buen Telefono, el tamaño, el diseño, el GPS y en general No le pide nada al IPhone!.Los inconvenientes por asi decirlo son:La duracion de la bateria y que solo trae un cable para cargarla, estaria bien incluir un adapatador para el automovil.Otro Detalle es que para poder escuchar el radio tienes que utilizar los audifonos pues sirven como antena. Yo tengo un manos libres Bluetooth y tengo que cargar con los 2!El precio podria ser un poco mas bajo.
This is a great phone, considering its retail price.  For $80 full price, you get Bluetooth capability (although Virgin Mobile prevents the phone from transferring files between devices; you can only connect to headsets), an okay camera, and some nice, solid style.The phone is sturdy in terms of build.  Some elements of the body are not the best and give away its affordable, basic nature.  The battery gets practically red-hot after about seven minutes on a voice call.  I talked for about 20 minutes once and almost singed my fingers.  Perhaps indulging in a bluetooth headset for longer calls is warranted.The keys are comfortable and responsive, and the T9 text entry is very good.  The T9 dictionary is the best I've used, and I've used phones from nearly every manufacturer, including other Samsungs.You'll hear talk of how the screen is not full of vibrant color; this is true.  It has a limited number of colors on the screen, but I have not noticed this negatively affecting my enjoyment of the phone, especially at this price.If you want to know about Virgin Mobile service, I find the website relatively easy to use (although not the best I've used; it doesn't quite measure up to T-Mobile or AT&T; in terms of ease of use).  They have many many options in terms of how you buy your minutes, and their pre-pay monthly plans and minute packs are VERY affordable.  They also have a program called SugarMama, where you can earn free minutes by giving your feedback on advertisements.All in all, I am happy with this purchase.  The phone's not fancy, but it's sturdy, stylish, and fits my needs well.
For those who want the productivity features of a Blackberry with the power of Windows Mobile, here's the device. Here's the good, and the bad in a nutshell.The Good:1. Size, weight.  This device is the same width as a Blackberry curve, and just slightly longer. Fits nicely in a pocket.  Also, it's not too heavy.2. Excellent Keyboard - Windows Mobile works excellently with an exposed keyboard.  Dial numbers quickly, write emails, even filter your music library quickly by typing letters.3. Plethora of features - Wifi, BT, GPS, a lot of customizable buttons, volume control buttons, and scroll wheel.  Gps works well (tried it with TomTom 6) and WIFI and BT both performed well.4. Speed - The device is snappy.  Coming from the AT&T; Tilt, it was a welcome experience to have a quick device again.5. Battery - At 1900 mAH who can ask for more?!The Bad:1. Phone call volume is low compared to most other devices I've used2. Too few backlight/brightness options. The middle setting is too bright, the lower is too low.In summary, if you need to write and respond to emails 40% of the time or more, then this is the device to get. You sacrifice screen size for more portability and productivity.  (Note that you don't sacrifice resolution -the screen is smaller, but the resolution is still 320x240)*** EDIT ***After using the device for several days, there seems to be an issue with power drain/battery life.  The PDA seems to drop roughly 5% of battery every hour with no use, and only AS Push active.  With moderate use, the device seems to lose roughly 10-13% per hour use.  Using the device the same way as I use my Tilt, wheras with the til I got roughly 12-14 hours of use, with the HP I get roughly 6-8.Also, I'm experiencing another strange occurence.  Using my 6GB microSDHC card, the device seems to lose its connection to the card when I turn it on, every so often.  I'm looking into both of these issues.
Picked up a 910 to replace my old T-mobile Dash which didn't have enough memory to handle my needs.Overall a very serious, high end business phone.The good:* GPS with Live Search & Google Maps is handy,* Pretty fast with lots of memory (256MB ROM/128MB RAM)* Ability to handle my 8GB MicroSD card for music/videos, will pick up a * 16GB when they come out* WiFi, Quad-band GSM, Tri-band 3G, Bluetooth 2.0* Navigate with keyboard, scroll wheel and/or touchscreen* Windows Mobile Pro 6.1The not so good:* Once I put my T-mobile sim in it appeared to auto-configure, but I couldn't get edge to work until I changed the Edge configuration to [...] from [...]* Cyberon Voice Commander seems pretty accurate, but not as full featured as Msft Voice Command (no bluetooth support being the biggest...you have to press the voice command button* Mini-USB charging and included USB headset are good, but no option for connection to my stereo.  On my HTC devices I could get a extended USB adapter, but I don't see any options/adapters for the iPaq 910.  More and more stereos have bluetooth stereo in, I have a couple, but not all of them.* T-Mobile's upcoming US 3G is 1700Mhz which isn't supported, but Tri-band UMTS/HSDPA up to 7.2 Mbps via (850/1900/2100 MHz)* Battery life: while it has a 1940mah battery, it only lasted about 10 hrs for me today.  Had DirectPush email and Bluetooth on.
I was waiting for this device since its announcement.I am a big fan of Blackberry 8810 and 8820.I was waiting for a Windows Mobile device with GPS and QWERTY keyboard like my Blackberry 8820.Since I am a Medical Professional I like Windows Mobile because of the medical software availability.Good built quality. Looks and feels just like my Blackberry 8820I love the QWERTY keyboard, GPS works great with TomTom 6 and iGuidance 4.0, 1940 mAh lithium-polymer battery gives great battery life.Works great with AT&T; 3G, WiFi is great (WPA2 support). Bluetooth work perfectly with my printer, car and computer.Works great with SANDISK 8 GB microSDHC.
I owned this phone for about a week.  I was pretty excited by how many features it had in such a small package: touch screen (small, but still useful), wifi, 3g, GPS, Windows Mobile 6.1, built-in keyboard, the list goes on...First off, I actually like Windows Mobile for its similarity to Windows on the desktop.  I tried a Nokia e71 with Symbian, and I found the user interface somewhat inconsistent between applications.  Windows Mobile apps usually follow a pretty standard way of doing menus and icons.  This Ipaq performed very well, though I have had other Windows Mobile devices which are sluggish.Next, the keyboard.  I found this Ipaq's keyboard suffers from one primary problem: the four-way navigation pad is too close to the top row of keys.  Time and time again I accidentally hit the "down" button when trying to hit the T or a Y.  Apart from that the keyboard was cramped but pretty useful.GPS:  I used Google maps which is a free download if your device doesn't come with it.  What an awesome program to have for free.  The program itself worked great, but it often took the Ipaq over one minute to acquire the GPS signal.  Sometimes it used cell phone towers to get my approximate location, so while it was tracking down the GPS signal the "where am I" dot on the map would jump all over the place.  Other times, it would not do this and would just wait and wait until it found the GPS signal to show me where I was.  There is some kind of application on the Ipaq (which I forget the name of) that lets you download additional GPS information from the internet so it is faster to acquire the GPS signal.  I ran this program numerous times but it did not seem to make a difference in how fast it locked onto the GPS.  Once it was locked on, it updated very quickly and very accurately.  Given that, GPS would be perfectly useful on this device if you already had it turned on before you started your trip.  Or, perhaps another pay-for-use mapping program would not have the same problem Google Maps did.Battery life: Other reviews have complained the battery life on this device is pretty short and that the battery gets hot while using the device (even when not charging).  I did find the battery pack got warm while on a call or using the PDA functions.  Battery felt on par with other smartphones I have owned (T-mobile MDA, Cingular 8525).  In other words: not very impressive, but good enough to get through one day.Last: In spite of these minor weaknesses, I really liked this phone.  Sadly, call quality was just not up to par.  I found I had to have the volume on maximum all the time, and the sound output seemed too grainy/staticky compared to other cell phones.  I decided that for the price of this phone, the sound quality should be nothing less than excellent, so I wound up returning it and going back to my incredibly-bulky-but-sounds-good Cingular 8525 (HTC TyTN).
This little guy is exactly what I hoped it would be. WiFi works perfect, bluetooth perfect, Office Mobile with Outlook Mobile helps me carry my work around with no problem.The phone signal on this little guy is perfect!! I've had a couple of other cell phones but this one beats them all.Audio is a little on the soft side but I haven't had any problem with it so far.The only bad thing I've found is that when you have been using the screen for a while and then you have to take or make a call, it feels too hot on the ear and face.But, so far, I am extremely pleased with it.
I have been looking forward to this phone ever since it was announced by HP last September.  Along with the 610 model, I was really excited for an iPAQ for the first time in several years.  After the 610 was cancelled for its U.S. release I started to get really worried that the 910 would follow its same fate.  After numerous delays it seemed as though the 910 would end up along side the 610.  Fortunately, that didn't happen.I got my 910 on Friday, July 11, only 2 days after ordering it.  Opening the box was almost like a child opening Christmas presents on Christmas Day.  The excitement was magnified after I actually got a chance to play with this beautifuly designed device.  First off, the screen, although a little small (2.46 inches) is beautiful as far as clarity and sharpness go.  Also, the form factor is just about as perfect as you can get.  It doesn't feel too small or too bulky; it's just right.  The back of the device has a surface that makes it difficult to lose your grip on it, almost as if it was covered in a slight fur.  I can't describe it any better than that and simply don't know what the actual name of the surface is, but whatever it is, it works well as far as helping users keep a good handle on it.I'm using it on AT&T; Wireless' Edge network and I've gotta say, this thing screams on it.  I've had extremely fast downloads and web browsing sessions using the 910.  The processor seems to handle multiple running apps well, as there is very little slow down or sluggish-ness when multi-tasking.  I had Internet Explorer, Word, Excel and text messaging running at once and the hand held's performance was still outstanding.The one thing, at this point, that I've got a bit of a problem with is the camera.  No, the camera doesn't have poor output of photos; it's quite the opposite, as the picture quality is very good.  The issue is the shutter on the camera is VERY slow to respond.  You have to keep your arms steady for, what seems like, an eternity (probably closer to 3 or 4 seconds) to make sure that any of your movements don't interfere with the photo's clarity.  The camera is 3MP so for a phone, that's really strong.  The 910c takes nice pictures, so long as you've got a steady hand that can deal with the shutter's delay.  Hopefully a driver will be released eventually that could rectify the issue (not sure if it's possible but here's to hoping).  If not, it's not necessarily a deal breaker but it is definitely something to consider.I haven't worked much with video using the camera but the limited time (maybe 15 minutes) I've had with that feature seems to indicate that there is a bit to be desired as far as photo qualtiy goes, mainly because of some noticeable pixelation.  The video is passable but I'd not say that the quality of the video is great; merely passable.The last point on the camera I'd like to make deals with a feature that allows you to snap your pictures/videos and upload them from your phone to Snapfish, HP's photo service.  I thought that was a really cool feature and because I have a Snapfish account (I sing the praises of Snapfish as much as I can because it is an outstanding service) this was a very good selling point for me.  I've used it to upload 20+ pictures in the day I've had it thus far and plan to use it extensively throughout the lifetime of my iPAQ 910c.Well, that's all I have to say about the 910c up to this point.  I'm going to continue to play around with this outstanding phone and hopefully learn more cool things to do with it.  I'd definitely reccomend this phone to anyone needing a powerful messaging device with a strong processor to help with heavy multi-tasking.
The phone works well and I have no problems with battery life, as I live in Ethiopia and don't use bluetooth, etc. What I want is easy interface with my Outlook (calendar and contacts) and the phone does this even better than my previous ipaq (h6300 series). I hope HP will have sorted out the durability problems of battery etc on the previous h6300 - I got through about 4 batteries in 3 years and eventually both the main charging and the USB charging stopped working.The negative side is the very quiet ringtone, so I usually miss all calls unless the phone is on my desk - does HP or anyone have suggestions on how to improve this as its a major problem?Also who can recommend a good case? I wrote to Krusell, who usually supply excellently strong for the last ipaq, but no reply after 7 days.Looking forward to getting to southern Africa so can try the Internet, email, using it as modem for laptop, etc.
I've had several different Windows based devices over the last 4 years and this one is the best I've used.  Yes, the phone dies if you are running bluetooth, WiFi, GPS etc... but what phone  with all these features turned on doesn't fade quickly. (come to think of it my 12 cell laptop battery dies with all these things turned on as well)Keep it charged up and you should get 3 -4 hours of wireless 3G internet surfing, wifi and bluetooth.  Turn off all those features and you can use it as a Edge phone for several days without a charge.Setup with ActiveSync to the corporate Exchange server was painless and the setup for my gmail and hotmail accounts took about 2 minutes each.  I love the google maps application with GPS - very cool thing to show the tech weenies at work.Bottom line - this is a fast, stable business device.
This ipaq delivers for what it was made: a small laptop with phone. The major asset for me is that I can synchronise e-mails with the server, wherewever there is a wifi. I also like that it is not too big, I can fit it in my pocket. If you have largeer fingers, typing will be more difficult than with a normal phone (more keys=more mistakes) eg. I cannot write an sms while walking or at least not yet. The camera is completly useless ( you take the picture, the ipaq staarts to think for a couple of sec and only then it take the picture). So a good office tool, less good for fun.
Phone: Worked well with T-Mobile SIM, very good voice qualityPDA: Installed medical software without troubleWeb: Works well with Wifi, I haven't bought a full data plan yet, I mightEmail: Primarily use gmail and have configured device to update periodically, don't need to use web browserBluetooth: Works well with laptopOther software: Office, camera, etc, yet to tryForm factor: Nice sophisticated feel, feels a bit delicate though
I have owned a fair number of WM phones (Wizard, BlackJack, Kaiser) and am a heavy user for both voice and data.  I must say, if you want a solid voice and messaging phone, this is it.  It's light, thin, decent keyboard, bright screen, and the fact it is WM6.1 Pro with a touch screen make it totally incomparable to the Q or BlackJack I/II.  Most of the complaints I have read are more from people who don't really use WM phones - fact is, they need to be charged every single day.  Get used to it!I have played with the HTC Touch Pro and iPhone, and both are elegant, but if you are like me and do a lot of business travel, need solid messaging, and actually have to write real responses, I would be hard pressed to find a better candidate.The only downside so far - I don't like the rubber cover over the USB port - will probably just cut it off!
I think this is an excellent device! I've had the device now for about 4 weeks now and so far it has performed better than expected.In terms of media, music and video files can easily be synchronized to the device. I even sync it with RealPlayer and it works fine. With the supplied stereo headset, listening to your music is just as good as with an iPod.I love that I can download recent e-mails to the phone and read them even when I don't have a wireless connection. I also like that I can create and/or edit Word and Excel documents. You can also print photos from the device without having to transfer them to a PC first.The only problem I have with the device is the camera. As some of the other reviews here state, it's a bit slow to respond. The pictures it takes are great though (once you have the patience to capture them). I enjoy photography so this isn't an issue for me as I usually have my camera with me.This device multi-tasks very well and is very responsive... even when it is near full-to-capacity (though the lack of memory does slow it down noticeably in such a situation). I've ordered an 8GB memory card for it so that I can store even more files without having to worry about slowing down the device.Another thing I like is that it can read your text messages and e-mails for you. This has come in very handy while driving. Of course, it becomes a bit confusing to understand if the text message contains abbreviations or slang.Battery life in my opinion is good. However, when charging the device while in a long call the "high battery temperature" warning comes up after a few minutes. I guess living in the tropics doesn't help this either. (I usually just remove the battery cover to help keep it cool... sort of odd but it works)Some reviews spoke of the tight keyboard. The keyboard is quite tight but the curved keys help to reduce errors in typing. If you prefer, there's also an additional keyboard on the touch screen interface with optional sizes so you can adjust it to your liking. You can also use the transcriber feature to write directly on the screen and it will convert your handwriting to text. If your handwriting isn't the best (like mine) you can teach it how you make your letters.Overall the device is excellent! I love it! Had no problems with it thus far. Hopefully it stays that way.
This could be my most perfect gadget purchase.  I love this thing!  So far, things have all worked as planned.  I use my ipaq at work (I am a nurse), and the programs installed without any problems.  Calendar and contacts seem to be easier to use than my previous ipaq as well.  I love having the phone and ipaq all in one device - and it is even smaller than my previous ipaq.  The only drawback I have found so far is the volume on the phone.  The speaker phone is actually the problem.  Listening to voice mail on the speaker phone still requires holding the device close to your ear, but if you are like me and don't use your phone nearly as much as the computer part, then it is a small thing.  The screen is also very easy to read.  It is smaller than my previous, but has better resolution.  All the options for navigation of the screen are great too.  You can use the stylus, the toggle buttons, or a scroll wheel on the side.  I have not yet played with the camera much, but it seems to take a couple seconds to focus, so it is not so great for quick shots of the dogs, but for a planned picture would be fine.  All in all...I love it!
Great phone only has everything and in general everything works greatcons.when low battery keyboard freezes and if using GPS and a reminder appears GPS gets lost
Nice phone except for battery life. It needs to be charged everyday if actively used (i.e. occasional surfing, music etc.) It could last 2 days if just used to make calls. If playing music a lot it will last less than 12 hrs. Wifi and bluetooth are both enabled for me.Satellite information needs to be downloaded before the GPS will work but it works well.In all other aspects performs reasonable well (camera, responsiveness, sound etc)I used it like a laptop, battery life is too poor to really use it as a mobile device.
This phone is a nice phone.The screen could be bigger, but otherwise it is allright.Most people complain about short battery life - yes, but this depends on two things: the 3G/HDSPA burns energy like a semi the gas. Raise the timeframe to check for emails.But that is not the worst battery killer: it is the screen! Make sure, the screend turns off and not just dimms. This is not turned on by factory default.I am beyond the 2nd day, and it still shows 57% battery power available.That is more than the weak 1 day you have withpout the screen-turn-off-option turned on.With just GSM/EDGE the phone was running out of power after half a day.You will find the option under settings- system- power:there it says backlight on the bottom- now activate the "Turn off backlight if device is not used for x minutes"!The GPS:well Google Maps doesn't work! Ha, epic fail HP!I am using iGo8 anyways. Works!Make sure to let it search for the GP with these settings:Baudrate 57600Port 6
Very handy, powerful, elegant. A bigger screen and less thickness would make it fit the word perfect.
Phone has some features that take time to find.  I have unlimited data usage with att.  Phone can be set up to be a wifi hotspot with data obtained from the 3g network(requires 3rd party softwware).  I can log on to my office windows network using logmein.  Very handy for simple tasks.  Phone and software is complex but seems unlimited in capability.  I like it more each day.  Also it has never crashed in the 3 weeks I have owned it.
I expected better performance from Windows mobile -  ssems slow at times and sticks so I need to soft reset.  Also regards the text messaging:  it's cumbersome requires too many steps, not too inteligent wher in number fields still need to set input to numeric in other models the unit recognizes this.
I purchased the HP iPAQ 910c Business Messenger about 2 months ago.  At the time it seemed a very excellent phone.  Here are my thoughts.NOTE: I am reviewing the product as a PDA, as I have no phone service in this phone yet.  When I get service I will update the review.***THE PHONE***The phone itself is very sturdy, despite being made of plastic.  It feels good in the hand, and the keyboard is good for typing out emails and text messages.  The screen size doesn't bother me as much as it would bother some people, as being a small landscape touch screen (QVGA).  I also liked the scroll wheel on the side of the phone.  It is convenient when scrolling through email or changing the volume in Windows Media Player.One things I wish was better is battery life.  I left the phone on with push services turned on and wifi connection.  It lost battery around 7 hours later.  I ended up purchasing the extended battery, which needed a case with a huge hump in the back of the phone, which looks ugly and feels ugly to hold.  The same test, the phone drained about 10 hours later.  Not much of an improvement in my own opinion.  One fear I have is when I get service with unlimited data, the battery life will be even worse.Another thing I disliked was the location of the speaker.  Its on the back of the phone, and that hinders the sound when the phone is laying on its back.All in all, the phone itself is an excellent device, and I would call it top of the line.  So why did I give it 2 stars?  Well its because of...***THE SOFTWARE***The HP iPAQ 910c is powered by Microsoft Windows Mobile v6.1.  Now the last windows mobile device I used ran Windows Mobile 2003, which was an excellent mobile platform to use.  I figured a later version would be even better.  Boy was I wrong.  Windows Mobile 6.1 is very unstable and buggy.  A day of use with this phone always included a crash, slow-down or hang-up.  I also disliked the fact that at some points, Windows Mobile rejected my MicroSD card, forcing me to reboot the device.Despite running Windows Mobile, there was good software loaded onto the phone.  It came with HP Photosmart Mobile, which is much better than WM's default Pictures and Video software.  It came with the other usual stuff, Office, Outlook (which sucks, by the way), Windows Media, and Windows Live.  It also came with a Java manager, so I could play games and use the famous Opera Mini web browser.I loaded selects of my music collection onto my phone for those times I forget my iPod.  Windows Media player gets the job done quite well.  Sound quality is great when the included headset is plugged in.  Not as great using the default speaker.  I cant say as much for video though.  Being a business phone, I dont think this phone was designed for playing video.  The video would skip every now and then.The camera on the phone took good quality photos, and the camera app was decent, but I found no way to get it to flash when taking the pictures, there was only a button which turned the flash on and stay on, which could really blind someone fast.As far as software goes, I dont like it.  Windows Mobile 6.1 is not a stable platform.  I constantly have to reboot the device, and I cannot stand the frequent slowdowns.***THE BOTTOM LINE***Well, as expected, HP has outdone themselves in the quality of the device.  It looks good, it feels good, and it is very sturdy, despite the plastic casing.  It's a shame to see such an excellent phone loaded with such a horrible platform.  Windows Mobile 6.1 is not a good platform to work on.  It's unstable and unreliable.  You never know when it will freeze or crash.If I were to give HP a tip to improve this phone, I'd tell them to look into adopting Symbian OS and using it, or taking the source code and writing their own version.  Windows Mobile is not good, and is literally the downfall of this otherwise excellent device.
I was excited to get this phone and all the features seemed promising.  Like many others however I found the battery life to be unbelievably short.  I am a heavy user and after all, why get such a phone if you are not intending to take advantage of all the features.  Just using it for the occasional phone call and push email would barely get me through the day, try to download any data, browse the web or IM and you won't last the day at all (unless you constantly have it docked at your computer, no good if you wanted to use this as a mobile office).  In order to extend the life, I turned down the backlight etc but then the device is impossible to see in daylight.  So it was 6 of one half-dozen of the other.But the real killer was after only a few days I decided to try the headphones...they didn't work. Looked around for drivers, settings but no luck.  Then I set the phone down funny and I heard sound through the headphones.  It turned out my mini-USB jack was loose and only got looser as days went by.  The phone was 3 weeks old when I returned it.My advice on this is wait until HP works the execution out maybe generation 2 will resolve some of the issues with it.  Or...maybe mine was just a lemon.
I tried the phone for 2 days and I am having to return it.  Too many problems like low ringtone/text/email notification volume.  Sometimes the phone would not even make a sound when I received a new email or text.  Also the battery would overheat and Windows Mobile would say "Battery Temperature High" and the phone would stop charging if it was plugged in.  Just too many problems.  Finally speakerphone volume and mp3 volume was miserably low.I've had Motorola Q9h, BJ II, and Tilt so I'm very familiar with Windows mobile phones.  All those devices were better than this HP 910.  I tried to like the phone but the problems outweighed the advantages.  Do some research and check out some real life reviews at howardforums DOT com.  You will find I'm not the only one with all these problems.
nice item the bag thing is battery, by day if you have like 4 longs calls the battery will unloaded
The specs here and Phonescoop (just to name a few) state that the unit has a head phone jack (2.5mm)- it does not have one.I almost bought this until I found out.  I guess I will keep my Dash until someone brings a good Dash replacement with a headphone jack and the features this unit has.USB does NOT count as a headphone jack.
Well, I have been waiting for this device to come out for some time now.I have been using Dell X51V PDA, great unit, with so many features but lacking the internet. I have been wating for a powerful smartphone, and this was suppose to be the one.Ok, this is a great phone if you are a big fan of blackberry but need Windows platform, however after using iphone and X51V the screen on this 910c is very very small. I opened this unit up, tried it for 30 minutes and put it back into the box.Also digital pen does not slide smoothly, it stumbles, probably just my unit.With units such as HTC diamond and even Iphone these units will soon be outdated. These units are very powerful, but again, you can't possibly browse internet with these small screens. Remote Desktop is a pain to browse, exchange & owa not much better.Need to try HTC diamond, as it looks like Windows answer for Iphone for business professionals.
Buyer Beware: Windows Mobile 6.1 is not a stabile OS, the iPhone is hands down a better device. The iPAQ crashes every day and needs to be reinstalled every week. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED A RELIABLE DEVICE!
I usually don't write reviews, but I just want make a few comments about Tracfone. I got my Motorola tracfone stolen a month ago and Tracfone was kind enough to transfer my minutes (over 1000) to a new Tracfone. They didn't have to do this but they did. As far as the phone goes - this Motorola w376 is the best tracfone you can get. It feels solid, it has great battery life, camera, good clearity and unlimited double minutes. The tracfone service is very good. I've never been unable to use my phone and I travel alot and everywhere. To sum it up, this is a great phone and a great company and you can't go wrong here.
I am pleased that Amazon has seen fit to return this fine phone to their stock, even if it comes from Target.com.  This phone has many features for the just under $30 price and I highly recommend it.  In addition to the description, the camera has a 4X telephoto lens and produces acceptable pictures.  The "phonebook" holds 500 entries and talk time is closer to 8 hours.  To access the owners manual, go to TracFone.com and select this model.  From there you may download and print the Motorola manual.This is my second cell phone from TracFone and have never experienced a problem with reception or customer service.  Their coverage is as good as the "big" networks without the need of a more expensive contract.  Now, this phone comes with double minutes for the life of the phone.  For a modern looking phone with lots of extras, this is a very good buy.  Get one.
Versitile pay as you go.  I got the $10 a month credit card deduction with this phone.  I get 100 minutes added to my total each month. All unused minutes are rolled into the next month.  No extra fees or taxes!
I had the same tracfone for a while and I got sick of it. I wanted a more upgraded phone, and this is it! The camera is very good, although many times the web browser doesn't work, so it's hard to get pictures onto the computer. That is the only downfall pretty much. It is a very customizable and personalized phone. The price went down about $20 right after I bought it, so I was a little mad about that.
In this age where Bluetooth, WiFi, touchscreen, mp3/video players, FM radio, GPS navigation, PDAs, memory expansion slots, voice recognition, web browsers, digital cameras, polyphonic ringtones, etc. are being incorporated into mobile phones, the LG 300 is a severely stripped-down phone that doesn't have ANY of the aforementioned features. It's just a bare-bones, no-frills phone that's reminiscent of the mobile phones in the 90's. Not surprisingly, then, the LG 300 is nothing to write home about.But I will say this -- the LG 300 is sleek and one of the most compact and lightweight mobile phones I've seen. The battery life on standby time is about 4 days. I can't speak to its battery life on talk time because I've never had a long enough phone conversation to determine it. It uses a lithium ion battery so there won't be a problem with "memory effect."If you need a basic cell phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies, this compact phone is a good deal and Net10 is a good service to go with:Free Phone----------For starters, for 30 bucks you get this phone PLUS 300 minutes. Since Net10 sells add-on 300 minutes in airtime for 30 bucks, you're in effect getting this phone for free.Cheap Rates-----------At 10 cents per minute for local or long distance calls, the Net10 phone service is simply the best deal. Text messages cost only 5 cents to send or receive.No Hidden Charges-----------------No wireless contracts or penalties for early cancellation. No roaming charges. 10 cents per minutes, plain and simple.Rollover minutes----------------If you buy more minutes before your old minutes expire, your old minutes will roll over and expire the same time as your new minutes. Minutes will keep rolling over for as long as add more minutes before your current minutes expire.The airtime available for purchase come in 150, 300, and 180 minutes:cost in dollars/airtime in minutes/expiration in days15/150/3030/300/60180/1800/603 Convenient Ways To Add Minutes--------------------------------You can add minutes by:1) buying Net10 phone cards2) buying airtime through the Net10 Website3) buying airtime directly from the LG 300 phone.To buy airtime directly from the phone, you are required to set up a PIN at the Net10 Website. You will be asked for this PIN whenever you add airtime through your phone.Decent Coverage---------------Net10 reportedly uses both AT&T; (formerly Cingular) and T-Mobile networks. Most of the time, I have no problems with coverage in my area, although I do get dropped calls every now and then.Customer Service----------------Net10 could definitely use some work on their customer service. I had to call customer service on at least a couple of occasions for (1) minutes failing to appear on my phone after I've purchased airtime and (2) problem transferring my phone number from an old phone to a new phone. It took about half an hour for them to credit me for my minutes and almost an hour to get my number transferred to my new phone. Part of the problem is _communication_ with the operators. It was a little frustrating getting them to *listen* and *understand* the issues I was trying to explain to them. But I will say that at the very least their operators are courteous.If you can get past their customer service - well - Net10 offers very competitive rates. Hopefully you won't have to deal with their tech support, ever. Many of the support you need is automated on the Web. Things like transferring your old number to a new phone can now be done yourself through their Website.Conclusion----------The Net 10 service offers the best prepaid rates bar none. If you need a cell phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies, the Net 10 phones will fit the bill perfectly.
hahaha i bought this phone over in africa  durring a 5 month trip there! i have to admit it was pretty prehistoric as far as features go but but it was extremely durable, our floors were cement and drop this thing so many times it should have broke! the flash ligh came in handy as we did not have power on sundays! I don't remember ever dropping a call back to my family in the states. Yes a very basic phone but very reliable if all you need is a phone and to send mesages!
I order this cell phone. It is showing as new one on the amazon site but it is not new one. It is used one. And also J&R; is not offering shipping for returning item back. and also J&R; is ready give me cell phone at lower price. But not ready to accept that it is the used one.
very limited options or in other word a prehistoric form  of cellphoneI will never recommend it to anyone
I have been a long time user of smartphone. Started with one of the first smartphones, Ericsson p800. Then some windows flavor as well as blackberry.This phone is by far the best phone I have owned. And I think this phone is probably one of the best looking phones in the market. Here are some of the things I love about this phone:1. It has a very strong signals.2. Call/voice quality is really good. Speaker is loud as well.3. Battery lasts a long time.4. GPS works really well and fast (this phone has 3G). GPS works especially well with google map/earth.5. It plays youtube out of the box.6. One hand handling capability from typing, taking calls, etc.7. Screen is bright and still usable under bright sunlight.8. Lots of applications available including a free SEVEN push email solution which is still beta version.9. Multi-tasking.10. FM Radio.11. An ability to subscribe to podcasts and download the only the ones you like.Some of the features that can be improved:1. Audio playback like play list creation and sound quality when using headphone are not as good.Creating a play list requires too many clicks. I am using a kingston 4gb and often my song list just disappear. I need to refresh it many times.I can hear a hissing sound from the headphone. From what I read many people experience this as well.2. Lack of task manager. I can not kill an application like I can on windows phone.Correction: The task manager came with the phone can kill most of the programs but not all. A media player for some reasons can't be killed using this. And in my experience, this is the one that hangs often.3. Keyboard takes a little time to get used to. I don't have big hands but I am still trying to adjust to this keyboard.4. Copy and paste only works in some applications. With windows phone, you can always copy and paste almost everywhere. Not with this phone.5. Headset output is not a standard size.I found 'Shure' makes an adapter which allows you to use regular size (3.5 size?) headphone of your choice. This adapter comes with a microphone. There are a lot cheaper one, but none comes with microphone. This adapter was made for Palm device but works well with E71.6. I like the FM radio but this feature only works when you attach the included headset. I think the antenna is actually on the headset.I hope this brief review helps. Some of the feature like camera, I have never really used. So I don't mention it here.
This phone is possibly the best smartphone available right now (December 2008).  I've had windows mobile, palm and blackberry phones in the past to compare this to.Very thin, sturdy (all metal casing) it feels solid in your hand, professional and sleek.  Screen is good, keyboard better than most, camera, GPS, email....it essentially has it all.  "Mail for exchange" software works flawlessly for "work" push email and calendar syncing.  Battery life is outstanding (two days on one charge with moderate to heavy use...which is as good as it gets).Nokia makes everything customizable with many shortcuts available to get to all functions.  Really a great thing about Nokias in general and this one is no different.  Short press the dedicated calendar key (like on a Palm) for the calendar, long press for a new calendar entry.  4 dedicated keys for these types of things (calendar, messaging, contacts and a home key) and 6 on screen shortcuts, plus two more soft key shortcuts and even some keyboard long press shortcuts on top of that.  That means one click access to just about everything you would want to do with the phone.OS crashes less than windows mobile, though not as good as blackberry (simply turn off / on to get back to normal - this happens once every two weeks or so if you use it heavily).  There are many app's available for download.  Camera is good in good light, video quality is surprisingly good (even in bad light).  GPS works great (download google maps).This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned and as good as any smartphone available on the market right now in terms of build quality, battery, features and certainly in terms of looks (slimmer than the iPhone 3G and as I said before - it is made out of metal).  The metal gives the phone a certain gravitas, a certain feeling of quality that it generally not available in phones.  It feels like a well made tool, it just feels good in your hand.Get a blackberry if you mostly just need email and don't care as much about multi media and games and the like.Get an iPhone if you mostly want multi media and the like and not so much email.Get this phone if you are in the middle (though it handles email and calendar syncing about 95% as good as a blackberry - I use it heavily for work email and have no complaints).
I picked the phone because I wanted something that not everyone else has.  iPhones and Blackberry phones are Everywehre.  I like the look of the iPhones, but I don't like the touch screen for texting.  I like the keyboard on Blackberry phones, but I don't like how thick the phone is and small the keyboards are.  Nokia is such a great choice for two in one for my life style. It's functional, it's user friendly, its got clean sounds and clear screen, it's got 3.2 mgp camera, and it's thin and beautiful.  I'm very very very happy with it... :)
I used Nokia when they made the brick phones. I updated to all kinds of phones, and I still missed the quality of the Nokia, but I was too embarrased to carry around such an ugly brick of phone. This phone does everything! I have a hard time keeping track of events, when to take my vitamins, when exams are due, birthdays, everything. With other phones I had, there was the option to use the calendar and alarm settings, but none like this. Now, I don't have an excuse. I used to be stuck by the monitor all day waiting for that email, myspace message, Google Chat, AIM, messenger, facebook photo tag, listening to Last.fm, and now, I can literally take all of that with me. And the best part is, it does not eat up the battery and I can go anywhere! I can scrobble music on here with my SD card, and I have a GPS and it tells me where the closest dry cleaner is and what not in walking distance that I never knew of before! It also has this really cool application called SportsTracker, and it tracks not just the miles, but your pace. It is a great tool for athletes. I can see how many calories I am burning on my bike rides, and I can see how far I go when I walk to places. It made me get a little competitive with myself and I try to beat my own record. I love Nokia, and I have seen and tested all kinds of smartphones, and I know this phone will be with me forever!!Me + Nokia = Common Sense
I love my phone.  I have had many phones before, but this one comes with many great features.  I am very happy that I made the purchase.  I bought it due because I needed a phone on a GSM network.  And only AT&T; and T Mobile are on those networks.  I travel to Europe mostly and South America and Japan on occasion and I needed to have a phone that would work in all of those locations.  I found the manual a bit difficult to understand initially, but with time the features and function are great!  I am very satisfied with my choice.  The phone does require patience if you are not a Blackberry person!  I was not.  The sound and volume of the calls is great!  I had previously used LG and Sony Ericsson And I would have trouble hearing my phone ring if I had it inside a purse or backpack and even my pocket.  I can hear this phone very clear and the volume is not at maximum!The camera is not a great as my LG, but in general I would make this choice over again!
I must chime in and state that this is another solid performer from Nokia. I also have the Nokia N95, but wanted something with a qwerty keypad.  Like another reviewer, I really like to step out of the norm where phones are concerned. I tried the Blackberry 8320 and was disappointed (after being spoiled by the N95's GPS, VIDEO capabilites, 3G, browsing capabilites, etc.). So I sold the Curve and got the E71. This is an extremely impressive device. It is VERY user friendly, has a sleek yet sturdy design and is free of bugs and glitches others have experienced with many (dare I say) similiar devices. I like the Symbian OS and the available applications for this device are endless!I only have a 2GB micro in it, yet I have had no lag issues and it has not crashed or locked up on me. It is easy to customize and the switch features are GREAT!  I was able to completely transfer everything on my N95 to the E71 using the Swich feature in Tools and the Switch feature for business and personal use on the homescreen is VERY handy!Who needs a touchscreen when this phone is the trump card against ANY phone!
I own the N800 for the last one year and it is the almost perfect device for Net, MP3 player and the occasional reading of ebooks. Though, i still was looking for a device that can also act as a phone and has wifi(i am 99% time within a wifi network, so 3g/edge is not a factor).I debated between E71, N95 and many other phones. So what sealed the deal? E71 is way smaller than any other device (iphone included) (and that too with a very easy keyboard), perfect seamless pairing with my bluetooth headphone(motorola HT820) and easy OS. I never used a symbian phone before and without much effort(no RTFM) was able to learn all functions. Though there are times when there are just too many options and i do click the wrong button.People might complain about the no-touch small screen, but to tell the truth it serves the user adequately: compared to the N800, i find, i prefer the keyboard on the E71 better than the onscreen keyboard of the N800. It serves best as the enterprise device for which it was intended for so the camera is just ok (too much purplelish), screen is small for video but the processor/OS is snappy to handle it. Though the media player is awesome, pair up with a stereo headset and voila (it also supports album art, and easy way to create playlists )! There are many good and free Symbian apps from Yahoo, Google for mail, news, maps and work good with E71. Also, the battery is huge and can last more than a day with heavy net usage. Oh and the charger is the half the size of a fat thumb!Accompanying Software is pretty good and connects seamless through via IR, bluetooth or USB. for Mp3 files there is a convertor to convert to a smaller AAC format and load to the device (one can load as MP3 too btw). I use a Sandisk 4GB microsd to store media files as the inbuilt phone memory is just about 120MB. It has a one stop app solution to handle almost all phone functions like transferring files, to reading SMS's, backing up, etc.Symbian is pretty snappy as OS and i have yet to have a 2 sec+ lag moment (which sometimes happen when switching between wifi access points). GPS is Ok and takes sometime to get a lock, but with a real nice app from Nokia called Sport tracker to track walking distance etc etc and also works with google maps.Pros: Snappy OS, excellent bluetooth capability, very good apps, on the first look i wondered 'how did they cram so much stuff in such a small package and that too with a massive 1500mah battery!'.No Cons, except perhaps the red on/off switch on the top of the phone (see it's so hard to find a fault with e71)So overall its a dream phone for me and worth much more than the going price of 350$.
for 4 years I was strictly sony ericsson. All the way from the T68 to the K850i. My K850 was incredibly buggy so I decided to give the N95 a go and never looked back. After nearly a year, there were just aspects where the '95 didn't do things I'd like it to do, namely, extended text entry. So I figured why not give the full qwerty a chance. Again, never looking back. In terms of my mobile needs this phone meets and exceeds all of them. It's great for listening to music, however for extended sessions I do bring a dedicated music player. This thing gets a GPS lock lightning quick, my N95 would take upwards of a minute to two, while often times I blink and google maps has already located me. The camera... leaves much to be desired. However, I was never content with any of my previous phones (K790, K850, N95) which had incredibly impressive cameras for their time. I only rely on cameras in phones for the rare times where I want to capture something but haven't brought a camera with me, or one isn't allowed. In terms of actually talking on the phone, I try not to do that. Not because of any flaws, I just prefer cell phones for their features rather than the phone aspect. It's flawless, I've yet to have a dropped call, or reception problems. My only gripe is with S60, not the phone in particular, caller ID pictures are handled horridly. If you buy this phone, be sure to look into FS Caller Id (check google) for full screen caller ID images.
I migrated from a Palm Treo 650 to the Nokia e71.  I have found it to be an outstanding device and Amazon has the lowest price on the web.  I utilize my device more for reading books and roaming the net.  Built-in WiFi is great!  It finds the hotspots for you.  It handles ebooks from ereader.com and renders all fantastically.  You'll be surprised at the speed of the browser.  GPS is also included and works w/o the network.  It will take you the better part of a month to learn all the operations but it's well worth the time.  Plus, it has a good, steady feel when you hold it.  Recharge time is minimal.  Video rendering is superb.
I am so happy i got this phone! i had an iphone and hated how restricted it was, i couldn't bluetooth to my computer from the phone, the camera was bad, no mms etc i was tired of itI got this phone and i am so happy! build quality is excellent and its much faster than my nokia N95 , it has wifi, agps, bluetooth, tons of media options,If you have a mac look for nokia multimedia sync, it will allow you to browse the phone and drag/drop files too and from the phone. I also bought a slim skin for the phone, as it is a bit slick to hold on too
I always love Nokia and I was debating whether to get an iPhone or this E71. Boy, did I make the right decision. My husband fell in love with this phone too and is getting one for himself. Highly recommended.
If you will like to be organized and to be conected anytime of the year this is the smartphone for you. The world it's in your hands now that you have the Nokia E71!
nice phone & easy to use with great features & stylish yet functional at the same time
The phone pictured is not the phone received.  The phone received has ivory white keys, but is silver otherwise.  (Kind of ugly if you ask me.)  The phone pictured is entirely light silver.  They must have at least three different color schemes and the one sent is very different in appearance than the one pictured.
first a comparison to the e61i: i had both the e61 and e61i and this is a major improvement over both. the form factor is incredible as it is only 10mm thin, much narrower than its predecessors, and feels very solid and sleek with its all metal body. the phone is just beautiful to look at. nokia has improved its processor greatly and the phone has almost no wait time with all its functions now. when i went back to use the e61i, it was unbearably slow compared to the e71. the keypad on the e71, although a little cramped, feels good on the fingers. one of my biggest complaints about the e61i was that earphone speaker was hard to hear out of, but the e71's narrower body and seemingly louder speaker solves the problem. the e71 has also added a microUSB port, and 2.5mm earphone jack. in terms of software, the e71 has an updated symbian os that includes some additional features and programs that were pleasant to see. the biggest program improvements for me was the updated organizer and the shortcut key options. for all e61 and e61i users out there, the e71 is a must update to nokia's wonderful line of phones.comparison to competitors: function-wise, it has all the features blackberry's and the iphone 3g have. however, the e71 is much smaller than both (just put the e71 side to side with the blackberry curve and the iphone and they both look like monsters compared to the e71). i have no complaints with the 3g and 3.5g (umts/hsdpa), and I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about-- it must be a network/area dependent problem. i live in the SF bay area and i almost always connect to the 3.5g network with att and the internet is extremely fast, comparable to web browsing on a computer with broadband cable access. i really dont like the all touch screen of the iphone, so i would never consider it. i was debating between the curve and e71, but e71 beats it in both function and form-factor. the e71 has a umts/hsdpa, 3mp camera, and better battery life. all the rest (OS mainly) is just up to personal preference.concluding remarks: if you ask "why should I get the e71", i would answer with these points based on what "I" feel is most important:- very fast 3G capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved OS and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3MP camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable- and lastly, did i mention that this is the most beautiful i have ever seen? see one for yourself (i know its hard b/c they dont really have them in stores) and you will love the look and feel of it.
Some notes to consider for this phone:3G -- Despite Amazon saying this is the US Version of the phone (which it is,) this phone does NOT work with T-mobile 3G in the US. T-Mobile 3G in the US uses the 1700 mhz spectrum (you can read on wikipedia as for the reasons why) and there are no 3G roaming agreements with AT&Ts; 3G spectrum like there is with EDGE. That being said, I have found that EDGE is fast enough for my web browsing and e-mail use (220 kbps+.) Using GSM/EDGE only also more than doubles your battery life, so this is not an entirely bad thing for T-Mobile users. The 10 hours talk-time and 17 day standby is no joke with GSM either.Network Settings -- Nokia has a great website that will text you all the internet, voicemail, and MMS settings for your carrier to the unlocked phone.Bluetooth Tethering -- This phone does not tether with Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. It does tether perfectly with 10.5 Leopard. It tethers with Windows XP via included Nokia PC Suite.  It would be nice if a Mac suite were included from Nokia but Apple provides everything necessary with Leopard. It obviously tethers perfectly with Nokia N800/N810.GPS -- The GPS in the phone is first class with both an actual GPS receiver and assisted GPS through cell tower. It works much better than my TomTom One especially indoors. The phone comes with a great program called Maps but the only drawback (and it is a HUGE drawback) is that you have to pay a monthly fee to use any sort of route guidance. You're allowed to see your position and browse maps for free but if you want to plan a route it costs extra. It comes with a 7 day trial that you should save for emergencies in my opinion.Networks in General -- This phone works great on both AT&T; and T-Mobile but each has their drawbacks. AT&T; has the faster network but limits you to 5Gb/month bandwidth and charges extra to tether. T-Mobile allows actual unlimited data on EDGE and allows free tethering to any device but has the slower "2.75G" EDGE data network. Wifi is available on the phone and works flawlessly.Third Party Apps -- Two must have apps are the S60 Divx player and the Slick IM client (AIM, Jabber, Etc.) The Nokia mail client works great and a third party solution is not necessary.All in all this is a first class phone whose only missing feature is a touch screen. Depending on your need for a QWERTY keyboard I would say this and the N95 are battling it out for best phone in the world right now.
As the first phone to run on the US 3G network (and in some areas even faster 3.5 G), I was wondering how well this would work as a modem for my laptop for accessing the internet.Guess what? I'm using this regularly now to connect my macbook to the internet! I'm giving up my mobile aircard (which costs about $ 70 per month) and I'm just using my unlimited mobile internet. Another positive - no need to take out the usb aircard dongle and insert it into the side of the laptop each time I need to use it!The connection is fast enough to download video and music (you tube etc. will work fine both on the phone and the tethered mac) but the phone gets hot when it's used as a modem. It also uses a lot of power so for long time use as a modem, I'd keep it plugged into the charger.Joikuspot is the software I used ($ 25 for a perpetual license) to tether my phone to the macbook so I can use internet.I'm happy that MS office comes built in. I'm able to import my financial worksheets (even big ones where I do financial modelling) and it still works fast.Fring works well on these phone - much better than on the Nokia N95. With Fring and my Skype call-out account, I can carry on telephone conversations with almost as much clarity as using my skype on the laptop.  In the N95 (which is also a great cellphone), the processor isn't fast enough to allow phone conversations - the voice quality is so degraded that it's barely understandable. Apparently, Nokia placed a very powerful processor in this machine.And since it has a fast processor, all the applications open almost instantly and my cousin, a Blackberry curve user was so impressed with the speed he said it's the next phone he'll get.Another excellent software I like using with this phone is my Salling Clicker. I use it for remotely controlling itunes in my laptop (like when there's a party and I was to change albums or artists from my phone) or clicking to the next slide in my powerpoint presentation or fast forwarding my DVD player to the next chapter.This is a lot of technology for the money and I highly recommend it to everyone!
Ive used this E71 for three months now. Im over my initial high, so here are comments from after the honeymoon:1) keys are small; needs practice. better to type in one hand. it's like learning to use a typewriter for the first time, but youll get used to it in about three weeks of constant use. set aside the backup phone in the mean time. cant practice by instinct if you have a second phone, for that second number, with conventional keys. youll just be confused.2) leather case is badly thought of. awkward when you take the phone out. high probability to drop the phone when you pull it out in a hurry. dropped mine several times while driving... i know it's bad to do this but there you go.3) the red dot for the power button is weirdly misplaced. seems Nokia ran out of same-colored plastic while making this phone, then suddenly saw red plastic remnant from another model. weird but I LOVE IT. brings character to this model.4) there's a nifty autofocus feature. while in camera mode, press letter t. it substitutes for the half-press in digicams (why is this instruction not in the manual?)5) there's also a white balance option in the camera. amazing to have that shade option.6) signal seems to be fluctuating in this phone. I have a second phone, under the same network, which reads a stable high bar, while E71's reception is jumping from 1 bar to four wildly. (is this a hardware or software problem)7) no blackberry support. demmit, you two companies get your act together.8) great for internet browsing.9) i wish there is an indication somewhere to make sure that youre using wifi while surfing; not the expensive network.10) FANTASTIC battery juice.11) after charging from power off, do not power on immediately. seems to hang (coming from power off) that way.12) definitely reasonably priced13) when you open your appointment note and clicked again, does not automatically turn to edit note (unlike in the e51)14) should have had that separate ctrl key to have that full ctrl+v, ctrl+z, ctrl+x, full-keyboard experience.15) not much annoying lags. very responsive.16) i like very much that the screen turns off after some time to save power. just have to press middle button to see time or if there are any missed calls and messages.17) also do not turn on while charging. (coming from off). seems to hang.Great investment overall. But as you can glean, still has a big room for improvement... some of it just firmware-based perhaps.
Wow! I think it is safe to say that this Nokia E71 device of mine has definitely been an instrumental part of my daily life and will remain as such for a LONG time to come. One primary reason for being with this particular model for an extended period of time may be my inability to afford new phones, but nonetheless I actually LIKE and PREFER this model even to my E90 Communicator!The slim profile, solid build quality, acceptable weight, tactile qwerty, word completion, exceptional reception and sound, useful apps, GPS, wifi, bluetooth, and North American 3G support have made this device one of my most prized possessions. I had dropped this phone twice in past months onto concrete and one time even had it slip out of its leather case, but the metallic exterior held up quite nicely and only shows a slight scratch on the upper right corner. At an overall glance my E71 is still in pristine condition as I use it every day of the week for home, school and even fitness. I cannot say enough how much of a benefit it has been to have a capable ESeries device that is light, portable and pocketable, and I haven't used a belt clip holster in MONTHS since I have owned it and don't plan to get one anytime soon!What can I say about the qwerty other than it's a perfect compromise for being narrow yet retaining perfect tactile feedback for my messaging needs? Not much. Over the weeks of usage I have become proficient in quickly typing on the keys to churn out texts, emails, documents and notes in the most efficient way possible (with copy/paste ability included), and a big thanks can also go to the word completion software that Nokia has included in the E71. Why Nokia hasn't added this feature to the E90 in the latest firmware upgrade is beyond me, but I am happy to have it on my E71 and have no complaints. Being so familiar with the qwerty is indeed a good thing, and I recently learned from Howardforums.com users how to dial phone numbers with letters such as 1800-TOSHIBA or 1800-MYAPPLE. The qwerty bar form factor is extremely great in regards to performing on the go in the midst of my ongoing activities, since I don't have to worry about opening or sliding anything to type a simple response message.Sound quality on calls has never been an issue with my Nokia devices in past and present, and this E71 continues that legacy. Infact, if I didn't know any better I would say that the implementing of 3G has actually enhanced the reception quality of my E71 in comparison to my EDGE-only E90. Inside my condominium there are two dead spots for my network signal and I have no idea why, but EVERY single past phone that I have owned would fall victim to those dead spots with dropped calls and weakened reception...yes, even the E90. However, that had all changed once I started using the E71 with AT&T; 3G and I am pleased to claim that the dead spots inside my own home are NO MORE!! I can finally email attachments, send texts and make calls without having to find a window or go outside onto my terrace!! If this isn't reason enough to stay devoted to this device through thick and thin, then I don't know what is.Out of all of these apparent pros for the E71, what stands out the most in my usage is the useful functionality of the available applications that add more to a great user experience! Google Maps has saved me plenty of times in either finding my way through unfamiliar areas or connecting me with local businesses via thorough searching capability. Nokia Podcasting has provided an alternate way to stay current on some of my favorite podcasts such as This Week in Tech and The MobileTech Roundup. Internet Radio is simply amazing for when I need a departure from the 920 audio tracks on my 6GB microSD card. The S60 web browser is a terrific alternative in efficiently navigating the Internet with a non-touchscreen phone, and the inclusion of flash video support has been such a worthwhile feature for Nokia to implement! The calendar being updated to reflect the double-pane interface I first saw on the E90 Communicator has lent to quick managing of appointment scheduling. My most favorite application by far has got to be the impressive Nokia Sports Tracker that I use on my 5 mile runs to track my course via GPS along with other data. After completing the workout I can then upload the information DIRECTLY to my account on the beta online service for all to see, essentially doing the same thing my iPod nano does with the Nike Sport Kit without a computer!!! A third party application named Missing Sync for Symbian is a GODSEND and is worth EVERY penny from a Mac owner looking for a reliable sync utility for their Nokia device!! Since day one of installing it on my laptop and phone I have relied completely on the automatic bluetooth proximity syncing between my E71 (even my E90) and MacBook Pro with no problems whatsoever!Another pro that cannot be ignored is the new interface of the home screen. Being able to initiate communication with ANY of my contacts by typing their name from the home screen is such a time saver. So much so that I have completely forgotten about the voice dialing capability! Having new notifications for missed calls, incoming texts and voicemails posted at the bottom of the home screen for easy access is another convenient addition.Easy to reach home keys for home, calendar, contacts and messaging that can also be programmed for long press commands offer great ease in quickly accessing information when needed. The iconic d-pad with the built-in notification light is GENIUS!! Having a screen saver that shows the time of the day in HUGE font has come in handy for me more than I thought, especially on those mornings when I've had to get up early!I can admit that the Symbian operating system is a challenge for any first time user, but with time and patience anyone can master confident and speedy navigation of its menus. Due to my E71's processor, speed has always been at a high standard whenever I would have to go through the interface or multitask with numerous open apps. For instance, in the midst of writing this blog email and playing music from the speaker this E71 continues to alert me of incoming messages and emails! Even two phone calls were accepted, and once I hung up the E71 took me back to my email draft and resumed the playback of my music without missing a beat!!While there is so much to be thankful for in owning this E71, I would be lying if I said there was no compromising to be made with certain features. Firstly, the 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera, though tolerable, is not up to the same level as the E90 in regards to low light settings and video capturing. Still pictures taken in low light reveal a grainy appearance that is an inconvenience when being viewed in full resolution on a computer screen, and video footage is not at the same TV quality 30 frames per second as the E90. However, over time I have learned that having an outstanding phone, reliable PDA, and suitable multimedia features come first before a perfect phone camera since I have a Canon SD750 anyway. Secondly, the external speaker in mono took a while to get used to after the amazing stereo performance of the E90, but its LOUD volume and clarity of sound had won me over. I had also found that since the speaker is at the top of the E71, it isn't muffled by my hands while I am typing on the qwerty like on the E90. If I was picky I could even mention the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, but I have an iPod for music and am not a fan of talking on headsets anyway. With this in mind I conclude that even though some things could use a bit of improvement, they are still tremendously worlds ahead of offerings from certain competitors such as Windows Mobile.As of now I do offer my sincere apologies to Nokia. I had previously brought critiques against the Nokia Email beta app due to the Sent folder not updating properly. It turns out that the Sent folder must be enabled in the settings to start syncing with the server, and once I did all has been working perfectly!I must admit that so far the Nokia Email application has been a great addition to my E71 in managing incoming emails. The interface is quite vivid and professional looking and provides a much welcomed departure from the plain aesthetics in the old Messaging app, which still handles my SMS and MMS messages. As a huge fan of the Outlook Mobile on Windows Mobile devices, I am pleased to say that for the first time on my Nokia I am starting not to miss it.There are a couple of features that I do enjoy about the Email beta which have made my transition from the original S60 Messaging app most comfortable. The auto completion of potential email contacts while typing in the recipients fields and the organized layout of the Inbox folder really give me the impression that Nokia knows what its doing. I am certain that further accomplishments in software development from the Symbian Beta teams will continue to take place, and I am excited to see them all come to fruition.I can really see myself with this model permanently. Now that I am off the market as a buyer of new phones, I notice that there really isn't anything out there that is currently a worthy upgrade to what my E71 can do for me. Seeing the same old mediocre offerings from Windows Mobile devices as well as the apparent iPhone copycats has caused me to grow bored of the smartphone industry to a point. I recently read a review on the new Google G1 that didn't really cast a favorable impression and the Palm Treo Pro didn't come out on top for me either. At the end of the day I got what I wanted from Nokia in the E71, a suitable alternative to my E90 that is more adaptable for my everyday use. Until a competing conglomerate can manufacture something that fits or surpasses this standard, I am sticking to my E71 all the way in the midst of the mediocre predictability of today's smartphone industry.TRENTSent from my Nokia E71-2
I've been searching for a solid business smart phone for some time. The key criteria was first and foremost solid phone reception in an area that can have spotty coverage due to many hills plus strong battery life. I also needed solid syncing capability to my work calendar (Oracle Calendar), a very strong web browsing experience, and well designed contacts and call management. I must say that the Nokia e71 has excelled in each of these areas and the battery life is amazing (2 days solid with no charging). The main screen (Home Screen) is very well designed and more customizable than any other smart phone I have seen including the iPhone (which I also like very much). The extent to which this phone and its menu options can be tailored to meet your unique needs is impressive. The keyboard is small but eminently usable and the weight and thinness of this phone is incredible. This is one phone that I carry in a pouch in my pocket and not on my belt -- which is a first. The speaker phone is very decent ... not as strong as a Blackberry I used previously ... but respectful. And the call clarity and reception is a major plus for this phone. I loved my iPhone but dropped calls more than I would have preferred. Not so with this phone ... I've gotten consistently good reception. The included web browser is very usable and Opera Mini is also excellent (a free download). The email client on this phone -- which I use for IMAP4 -- is decent but I find it can occasionally be slow in updating or syncing with my corporate e-mail. Also, the calendar sync works well, but there is no auto-sync capability (you have to initiate the sync directly although that's easily done). Not a deal killer for me, but the email functionality needs some further refinement (perhaps a firmware update is coming on this one) and Nokia really does need to add an autosync feature for the syncml client so it can for example run once in the morning and once in the evening without user intervention to keep your phone's calendar in sync with the office. But in the end, there is no perfect smart phone ... but this seems to me to be one of the most solid one's out there based on my own extensive research and hands on testing. Excellent build quality, very rich functionality, and a reliable phone connection. I'm well satisfied. Nokia seems to have a winner here and if you have a Mac, the sync support to the Mac platform is an added plus. Good luck in your search for the perfect phone!
This phone is a viable alternative to BlackBerry or iPhone.  Keyboard is a little cramped, and not layed out like a BB QWERTY (the M is in the wrong place).  Battery life while on a 3g network is not great, may not even last a day with heavy data/voice usage.  Camera is excellent, as is video camera.  Operating system is very stable, with very few crashes, and voice and signal quality is very good.  WiFi works well and is easy to set-up networks with the built-in scanner.  Quick Office program works very well with Office docs and PDF's.  Excellent browser and good processor speed.I'm still partial to BlackBerry overall, but this is a solid device.
This is an all-around amazing phone, from feature set to call quality.While the E71 doesn't have the amazing UI of the iPhone, if you like Symbian/S60 (which was designed for one-hand use), a real keyboard, and excellent battery life, this is your phone.My only complaint is the mail app, but Nokia's working on a subscription-based push email service (beta is available now) that looks good so far.One bonus of the E71 that you don't get with the iPhone -- you can tether it to your computer using Bluetooth or WiFi (via Joiku) to get 3G internet speeds on your PC.I *highly* recommend this phone for business and/or power users who need to be productive on their phone no matter their location.Side note: I have no idea what the other reviewer it talking about in terms of speed -- both GPS and network/web access are terrific on the E71.
I bought a Nokia E71 hoping to replace my SE K550i.  Main reasons for looking for a replacement was to have a Qwerty keyboard, 3G connectivity, GPS, being unlocked, Quad-phone, video conference capability, a decent set of commercial or free application availability, especially editing MS Word type documents, expansion (via memory cards) and a decent camera.I am happy with E71 - EXCEPT the camera.  When it was originally advertised, the 3.2Mp camera seemed too tempting to have and sounded as a nice upgrade from my SE K550i - Boy I was wrong :(  the 2Mp pictures my SE K550i was/is taking are much much better compared to E71. There is NO COMPARISON - it is THAT BAD.  Everybody who owns an E71 now complains on Nokia forums or similar platforms and everybody is hoping and praying for a software update with a firmware from Nokia so the problem will be fixed.  Until then, the problem (the picture quality is horrible) is there.The connectivity is very nice - you can even use E71 without a simcard for Web Surfing.  It finds the wireless connection points really fast, call quality is nice, sound is very decent, A-GPS is amazingly fast and the Nokia Maps software is very nice (though expensive for an online service in my opinion) - the Google Maps works as a champ with no turn by turn voice help (if you don't care).  Some reported that Germin XT is another option to have already downloaded maps to avoid online expense in addition to the data charges.  The default browser is very nice and fast. Opera Mini and even firefox mobile are available for E71.  The office software that comes with the phone, when updated, is capable of editing/creating MS Office 2007 compatible docs/spreadsheets and presentations.  The device has bluetooth 2 compatible and also works as a hotspot itself for other devices such as your laptop when JoikuSpot software (I am using the paid version but a free light version is available) is used.Other than the camera problem the phone is very very nice and capable.  Unless you are looking for a nice camera phone, then this is a nice smartphone - if the camera is important - then don't buy it now (nov 2008) - wait until there is any software fix that will address the issue.If camera is important then SE 850i is a nice 3G , unlocked phone option (if it was not that Qwerty keyboard I almost bought one) with a nice price tag (online) after some search.Hope this proves useful
I've had the E71 for a week, and here are the highlights:- slim and fits in your pocket- fast interface with multitasking- excellent battery life- keep an eye on multiple email accounts- the phone will read your messages to you- the built-in browser is great- the beta Skyfire browser is like a desktop experience- the camera is OK, and can upload directly to Flickr- the call quality is top notch- QWERTY keyboard goodness- real GPS- turn-by-turn talking Nokia Maps by subscription- free Google Maps with GPS location- Nokia Sports Tracker to map hiking & biking trips- MP3 player that can scrobble songs to last.fm- download podcasts right on the phone- FM radio- multi protocol IM with Fring- wireless syncing of corporate calendar with NotifyLink- open PDFs and office documents- encryption and remote locking security- works as a wifi voip phoneNokia is really great about user feedback, too.  I've joined the S60 Ambassador program to share and experiment more with the Maps application.
I've had my E71 for about a month and I'm just thrilled with it. I've owned many smartphones and most recently tried an iphone. I loved the ipod features of the iphone- easy sync with itunes, big screen for videos, etc., but found it not the best for my business and communication needs. And I really never got the hang of the soft keyboard. Even after several months of use, I kept making many typing errors. The first thing that struck me about the E71 when I saw it in a store was how beautifully designed it was. However, when I found out it was a Symbian phone, I was a bit leary as my past experience with that os was not at all positive. However, after reading a few reviews I decided to give it a go and I couldn't be happier. It's a great email device. I have it set up to sync my work exchange account for email and PIM info and I'm using Nokia's free (for now anyway) push email client to get my .mac account pushed to the E71. The phone is really fast responsive and the keyboard is lovely. Unlike the iphone, I can type quickly and accurately. There are many other great features, including Nokia sync to itunes on my mac, GPS, loads of 3rd party software like audibleplayer for ebooks, 3g tethering to my laptop using the joiku hotspot software.One negative is the Wifi. Sometimes it works great, but other times it is very tempremental and just won't connect. The only other negative I can think of came from a friend who also bought an E71. He has trouble reading small type and was used to the font adjustment feature on his BB Curve. There is no way to enlarge the fonts on the E71 and they can be a bit small for some. Other than that, I would highly recommend this phone.
This is the prettiest phone I have ever owned.  Build quality is excellent and I liked the keypad.  The phone is quick and responsive and call quality was good.  The browser is not as good as on the iPhone, but much better than Windows Mobile.  The OS does take some getting used to and does not look as pretty as competing ones.  However, it offers tons of customization that iPhone owners can only dream of.I wanted to keep this phone, but chose to return it because of email integration.  For POP email, it either checks email automatically  and downloads the message or it checks it, downloads the header and informs you that you have a new message.  This was a deal breaker for me.  What's the point of downloading the message if it doesn't alert the user that there are new messages?  Going the other route (by downloading headers only) would be ok, if it didn't take ages to manually download messages.  Also, hotmail and yahoo mail required special apps to download, which did not automatically check for new messages.  The final email related frustration is that by default, it does not download html messages.  You can click the attachment and it brings up the message in the browser, but it's an extra step.One final distraction was the phone's constant alerts asking if it was ok to connect to the network and asking which one to connect to.  For North American users that have an "unlimited" data plan, this option is annoying.
Only had my E71 for a few days now, but I'm incredibly impressed.  The biggest concern I have is the number of people in this forum comparing the E71 to the iPhone.  E71 is NOT an iPhone, it was not INTENDED to compete with the iPhone, and it is not fair to compare it with the iPhone!  So many people are talking about what the iPhone has that the E71 hasn't, what about the things the E71 has that the iPhone hasn't?...like a beautiful steel case, video calling, a removable memory card, RELIABLE 3G connectivity, etc, etc?  If all you people want an iPhone so bad, then why not just get one unlocked/jailbroken and let the rest of us evaluate hand held devices on their own merits?The best features of the E71 are its sleek and elegant form factor, the aforementioned steel case, the 100% customizable interface, and the availability & support for third-party applications.
I should start by saying I have used a Blackberry for quite some time, most recently a Pearl...and I liked it.  When it came time to get a new phone, subsidized phones were not an option for me, and the Nokia E71 became the frontrunner based on my criteria.This is certainly not a full review, but a few highlights and lowlights based on my initial experience.First, the highlights:* The build quality is impeccable.  It's a beautiful device, and it comes in a hair smaller than the iPhone.* Call quality is great, bluetooth pairing is flawless, and tethering (via USB or bluetooth) works fine with AT&T; 3G and 3.5G.* Syncing with Outlook 2007 works fine overall, although every once in a while a calendar item seems to show up in the wrong place.* Google Maps works great with the GPS.* Impressive battery life.* There's a whole 3rd party ecosystem for Symbian; I haven't even scratched the surface.Now the lowlights (you'll see my Blackberry heritage here):* Haven't found a great solution for push email for Hotmail and Gmail. Windows Live and the Gmail client don't seem to be designed to automatically grab my email and notify me the way Blackberry did.* Still getting used to the keyboard.  I was less error-prone with the Blackberry (both their full keyboard and the Pearl's suretype).* No ability to set different ring/vibrate behaviors for holstered vs not.* Less control over notifications.  For example, meeting reminders vibrate and flash way longer than I need them to.The lack of the kind of push email I expected is a bit of a bummer, but overall I'm still very happy with this phone.  I show it off to my friends because it looks good and it's not an iPhone.
I bought this phone as my first smart phone ever. I love it! To say the least. I almost bought and iPhone but wasn't diggin' the DRM double lock-in to AT&T; and apple.I will just bullet list all the pros and cons:pros:1) Slim. Slimmer than the iPhone2) Incredible battery life. 20 DAYS standby!3) Incredible bluetooth support including A2DP (stereo audio), bluetooth printer (photos?), and bluetooth keyboard. As well as DUN/ AVRP etc..4) FM radio is cool.5) NO LOCK IN! Means, I just inserted my SIM and now I pay only $15/month for data6) Very customizable (all the buttons can be remapped to do almost anything)7) Supports Java.8) Great call quality.9) Keyboard is easy to work with10) Supports SIP (You can receive company phone calls directly)Cons (and this is why it isn't 5*****)1) Subtle annoyances in the UI (text messaging in particular)2) The menu system is too complex.2) No Corporate/Exchange email support. Licensing issues and such. Don't expect your help desk to help.3) Can't work directly from your SIM4) FM Radio REQUIRES you to have a wired headset plugged in.5) Does not charge with USB (interface is the old USB 1.1). Even my 5 year old razr did that.6) No auto-sense for data connection to prefer wifi to 3g. No "stop asking me to connect all the time!" configuration.
This phone is an encredible piece of engineering.  its so small, solid and slim.  the OS is lightening fast with ZERO lag or delay.  the GPS gets a full satellite lock in 15 seconds every single time.  Garmin runs fantastic.  the symbian OS is super stable.  the keypad has perfect tactile feedback and i can type one handed on this qwerty phone.one of the reviews on here didnt mention the e71 ONCE.  it talked about his old e62 and how he didnt like it, and somehow that was relevant to the e71.  not one mention of the e71.  so yeah, maybe those type of people who have no analytical skills should be pre-screened before being allowed to write a review or interact with the rest of civilization.i highly recommend this phone!  its better than the BB Bold hands down, unless you need the BB email.  otherwise, the e71 is the better choice.  much smaller, s60 web browser is the best on the market, period, and the s60 OS is mature and stable and has tons of applications.  nokia hit a home run with this phone.
I was someone who waited and waited for the Blackberry Bold because the Iphone never did much for me. Eventually I got tired of waiting because I found something better...the Nokia E71.My first impression is wow, if you could only see this beauty in person. It is a masterpiece. With its titanium encasing, I have no idea how I could break this product.The next thing you notice is its size. From being around Blackberry's and Iphones this thing looks small and compact. For me this is an advantage, but for those with bigger hands you may be disappointed....but unlikely.So far the best thing about this phone is it's software. This is simply  because it is incredibly easy to use and set up. I typed my gmail account and bam! I was all set with push email.The phone is set up so you can switch modes, which is great. You can go from your regular calender, browser, email, and messaging to more of your media device. It sort of is like work and play for me.The camera isn't the greatest for some. I feel that it is good to have but not a necessity so it's quality doesn't bother me.Overall, I am extremely happy with this product....the negative reviews are honestly ridiculous when you add up all the positives of this device. For those of you looking for a more refreshing change from the iphones and Blackberry's  but ultimately want to keep it high end...I would recommend this.
I've had this product for slightly over 2 weeks. Note that I said product and not phone. The first phone that I received worked fine for about 10 days. Then it suddenly went blank and no amount of cajoling could get it to work again. I called Nokia to see what they could do. But they told me that since the phone was brought from Amazon it wasnt covered under the Nokia warranty (since Amazon is not one of their authorized sellers - whatever !!). So I called up Amazon and they assured me that someone from the Cell phone support team would get back to me within 2 business days. I wasnt sure what to expect next.I casually happened to check my account on Amazon the following day and noticed that Amazon had already shipped the replacement. I received the new phone within 48 hours of encountering the problem. This is where the fantastic Amazon service saved the day for me. The reason I've taken away one star in this review is that the first phone broke down abruptly.Back to reviewing the phone - There's not much for me to add here, a lot has been covered in other reviews. The product quality is amazing, very sleek and impressive. The photos dont do justice to the real thing. You have to see it to believe it ! Wireless connection to my home network was easy, too easy ! Camera is pretty decent - I've captured images and videos. I was able to upload these to the web from the phone in almost no time. Speaker quality is good - I've been listening to internet radio and music from the memory with complete satisfaction. Being a Blackberry 7100T user, the keyboard took some time to get used to, but now its as easy to use as the keyboard on my laptop. 3G connect is fantastic - I get great connectivity to the AT&T; network.The only complaints I have are:- The battery doesnt get charged when the phone is connect to the computer.- Nokia used a 2.5 mm headphone jack instead of the universal 3.5mm. Not a major issue since they provide a set of headphones.Overall - I highly recommend this phone.
Just got this as a weekday phone (have a Nokia N95 for the weekends). As a former Blackberry user I have to say I'm pretty impressed by this phone. I set up my Gmail in 20 secs out of the box, and now send photos and videos via both email and MMS. Couldn't believe it when a friend told me the iPhone doesn't do MMS or videos, both of which seem pretty useful (cool) to me. since there are 2 home screens, I use one for work and the other for leisure time. This means I'm connected to work email during the 8-6 workday, and then flip to music, video and gmail outside work hours. Pretty neat. Email is quick and the screen and keyboard do the job nicely. Battery life is good (lucky since I'm not a conscientious charger) for such a feature rich phone. Also comes with a cool program called wireless presenter which can transmit the screen image wirelessly to laptop/projector etc. Great for seminars and conferences. Overall, I think Nokia have done a great job with this one. Its solid, feels good and well made in the hand, and I like the styling.
No soy usuario regular de telefonos Nokia, pero es muy amigable, el unico detalle es con el GPS, se queda colgado el telefono sino estas en un area despejada, como la ventana o en la calle, pero en la oficina o en la casa hay que sacarle la pila al telefono para poder encenderlo de nuevo...El diseño es muy delgado, un poquito pesado pero soportable, es una compra muy buena a pesar del detalle, que puede eliminarse de colocarle o instalarle otras aplicaciones...
I own the N800 for the last one year and it is the almost perfect device for Net, MP3 player and the occasional reading of ebooks. Though, i still was looking for a device that can also act as a phone and has wifi(i am 99% time within a wifi network, so 3g/edge is not a factor).I debated between E71, N95 and many other phones. So what sealed the deal? E71 is way smaller than any other device (iphone included) (and that too with a very easy keyboard), perfect seamless pairing with my bluetooth headphone(motorola HT820) and easy OS. I never used a symbian phone before and without much effort(no RTFM) was able to learn all functions. Though there are times when there are just too many options and i do click the wrong button.People might complain about the no-touch small screen, but to tell the truth it serves the user adequately: compared to the N800, i find, i prefer the keyboard on the E71 better than the onscreen keyboard of the N800. It serves best as the enterprise device for which it was intended for so the camera is just ok (too much purplelish), screen is small for video but the processor/OS is snappy to handle it. Though the media player is awesome, pair up with a stereo headset and voila (it also supports album art, and easy way to create playlists )! There are many good and free Symbian apps from Yahoo, Google for mail, news, maps and work good with E71. Also, the battery is huge and can last more than a day with heavy net usage. Oh and the charger is the half the size of a fat thumb!Accompanying Software is pretty good and connects seamless through via IR, bluetooth or USB. for Mp3 files there is a convertor to convert to a smaller AAC format and load to the device (one can load as MP3 too btw). I use a Sandisk 4GB microsd to store media files as the inbuilt phone memory is just about 120MB. It has a one stop app solution to handle almost all phone functions like transferring files, to reading SMS's, backing up, etc.Symbian is pretty snappy as OS and i have yet to have a 2 sec+ lag moment (which sometimes happen when switching between wifi access points). GPS is Ok and takes sometime to get a lock, but with a real nice app from Nokia called Sport tracker to track walking distance etc etc and also works with google maps.Pros: Snappy OS, excellent bluetooth capability, very good apps, on the first look i wondered 'how did they cram so much stuff in such a small package and that too with a massive 1500mah battery!'.No Cons, except perhaps the red on/off switch on the top of the phone (see it's so hard to find a fault with e71)So overall its a dream phone for me and worth much more than the going price of 350$.
This phone is fantastic. It does everything as advertised, however I am not sure the 10 1/2 hour talk time or 17 day standby time are entirely accurate. I've only had the phone a couple of weeks, and my experience with these batteries is that you go through several recharge cycles before they reach their full potential. The phone is easy to use once you get used to it, but the manual leaves a little to be desired. However, Nokia's phone support (customer service) is really good. I had a couple of issues I couldn't figure out and they walked me right through the solution. Some of the things I really appreciate, other than all the special features are: 1) adjustable ring volume that is loud enough for some of us older folks and 2) a really good speaker with a phone that will stand without having to lean on something. Additionally, the bluetooth connection to my navigation system was very easy to set up, and the bluetooth connection to my Nokia 6682 allowed me to transfer data with a minimum of effort. I am still learning things about this phone and probably will have it all figured out in a year or so. All things considered, this phone has exceeded my expectations. I wavered a bit and was considering 2 other Nokia phones with 5 megapixel cameras, but I'm satisfied I made the right choice. 3.2 megapixels is plenty unless you are trying to do really big pictures, and those are best done with stand-alone cameras.  I really recommend this phone highly. I guess I should add that I'm a Nokia fan. I just think they make the best product.
This is my 4th attempt...I can't seem to keep it short!  Anyway, right off the bat, I LOVE this phone.  I looked for over a month, reading reviews, trying to find the perfect phone since my contract was ending (I had a Motorola V3xx). I wanted a smartphone, and thought the iPhone was the way to go...then I found out it had no stereo Bluetooth (unacceptable to me for my next phone), the forced data plan was kinda pricey to be locked into, I didn't like the plastic of the new 3G version, and I heard the battery life wasn't very good.  I also read the same about Windows Mobile phones.  Then I got to the E71.  I'd have to sacrifice the flashy big touch-screen...and I'm so glad I did.  To have a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard on a device this thin (instead of a big-brick slider phone), a beautiful steel frame and battery cover, great tactile feedback and domed keys making up for lack of space between them (even with my big thumbs)...it was so worth it.Received it in 2 days, popped in my old SIM card, called up and got an inexpensive unlimited data plan (active as soon as I hung up the phone, turned it off and back on), and was off and running!  Web browsing is a blast, e-mailing is great (probably my only complaint with the phone is that I can't SAVE e-mails on it..check for new ones, the old ones disappear..still haven't found a work-around for that yet), there's a ton of freeware out there for the operating system (for AIM/IM programs, even a free voice-guided GPS program I found!), camera is better than the RAZR's (though most do say it's terrible compared to other phones), I've got over 500 songs (any of which can be the ring tone!) on an 8GB card, 4 e-books, and lots of room left...I could go on, but just read other reviews!If you have the opportunity, hold one...that alone may sell you on the thing!  I don't regret spending the $$$ on this phone unlocked vs. getting a subsidized phone/new contract...the $$$ I will save on the data plan alone will pay for the difference in a lot less time than a contract would take!
I'm a long time E series user specially the qwerty keyboard type (ie. E61, E61i) and now E71.  Why do I keep coming back? well in my day to day life I work in an enterprise class environment and the complete range of features offered by the Symbian OS, the processing power of this type of phones and expandable memory allow me to make my life easier from connecting remotely via VPN to my workplace over Edge to redirecting calls via VoIP wherever in the world I'm in.This phone is truly a lifesaver and a great tool/gadget for my day to day activities, and talk about the sexyness factor sure it's a geek phone but come on the redesigned look of the E71 is definitely an eye catcher, when compared to other enterprise class phones such as the previous E series and even the blackberry.The bug count in the current firmware version is somewhat minimal but I recommend definetly doing a quick reset on it every couple of days, Nokia is bound to release a new firmware version soon to address this small bugs so hang tight there and keep checking your favorite blogs for more info on this phone.[...]
I love this phone - I am a big Apple fan but need a 'real' keyboard.  I probably would have bought an iPhone if I could get it with a keyboard.  This phone is the perfect compromise - blends the best features of the Blackberry with the iPhone, and available unlocked to boot.3G works great, voice quality is excellent, battery life is FANTASTIC. I also love the form factor - the keyboard is nicely laid-out and well-sized, screen is very sharp, and the build quality is terrific.  This phone is absolutely gorgeous, and extremely well-built.Also, Nokia's free Mac syncing software does a great job of syncing with both iTunes and iPhoto for music, video and pictures.  Has a nice PC suite as well (I sync it with my Windows laptop at work)Only downside is the camera - it's OK, but despite the 3.2 MP pictures look grainy and the colors aren't quite right.  Rumor has it a firmware upgrade will fix that but haven't heard for sure yet.If you're considering the BlackBerry Bold or iPhone you should at least check this phone out as an alternative - for me it's the perfect blend of the best features of both.
I ordered this phone from Amazon and initially liked everything about this phone (looks, build quality, features, etc.).  The main problem I had with this phone was the small fonts.  Even at the large font setting, the words were hard to see.  I do not wear glasses but have difficulty reading smaller print than normal. This is just a heads up to anybody who may have a problem with small fonts.If you are a person who has no problem with small fonts, then this phone is an excellent choice.  I need not say more as the positives have been covered by the many reviews on Amazon as well as outside sources.  It was too bad I had a problem with the small fonts, otherwise I would have definitely kept this phone.
I have been using this Nokia E71 since two months.In my opinion its the best smartphone in the market. you can always type without missing any letter, compared to the iphone which i had for few days then returned it back. Its the lightest,thinnest smartphone in the market, and its gray titanium colour is great, and dont forget the perfect sound properties and loud speaker. I went to check the blackberry storm, but i didnt like the size of it beside it doesnt have wireless in it. Nokia E71 has all the applications i need,and really fast with the 3G service(although AT&T; 3G service is down in few places). The battery life is two days after torturing the phone,but not more as some people says.I bought this phone after i did alot of search on smartphones and i highly recommend it, try this product and you will never regret it.
I wont lie I was surprise by the quality and overall look. I did not expect this phone to be so "high-speed." If you are a net wiz, you have to get this phone. As far as emails, it could have retrieved them faster but overall it is fast on a world wide web. I love the sound, mic works perfect....clearer then the actual phone. It slim, looks expensive and is flashy for those who like to look rich and famous....LOL that was a joke. Overall software worked fine. I sync everything i needed. Mirco SD fits in perfectly. Up to 8 GB of storage which is more then enough. Trust me! +whatever storage phone provides. Ringtones are playing nice and clear. Well is there anything wrong with this phone? Besides the fact that it attracts some attention...NO! lolYou wont regret. And its so much cheaper with this seller then on bestbuy or else where.
Just got this phone from Amazon.com and I am totally loving it.I have been looking for a phone that is similar to my Blackberry Curve and this is definitely it.  The Nokia E71 is just so sleek and smart looking, much prettier than my Blackberry Curve.  The Nokia is a tad longer than the BB Curve but it is much slimmer.  Comparing the Nokia E71 with my iPhone 3G, the E71 is smaller, it is much shorter and slimmer as well.This is much easier to use than my Nokia N82.  I actually decided to sell my Nokia N82 after receiving my E71 coz hands-down, the E71 is a much better phone in terms of looks and functionality for my use.And being unlocked, I don't have to extend my contract with TMobile.Way to go Nokia!-A
Update: After more than 2 years of using this phone, I just wanted to provide an update for anybody who is intereted in this one. My phone still goes strong, no issues at all. Battery life is still good. Nokia provided 5 software upgrades so far. Turn by turn navigation is awesome which was not there when I bought this one. I paid $450 when it came out, now it costs $200 which is a real steal. Very few products on Amazon hwv such high rating after 300+ reviews which speaks a lot about this product.This phone is amazing! I am impressed. The best build quality I have ever seen on a cellphone. This is built like a tank with some real metal and precision engineering. You have to hold it to feel it. Even with all the superlatives, be ready for a pleasant surprise if you ever buy this phone.The 1500mAh battery is one of the juiciest ever on a cellphone and will last 2-3 days on 3G with moderate to heavy use. I gave up trying to drain the battery out on this one.Call quality is excellent and the earpiece is loud. Keypad is nice and comfy. Symbian OS is really snappy with no lags, and supports multitasking. No crashes or reboots after 3 weeks of ownership. E-Mail setup was super easy. There is a wee bit of learning curve with Symbian, but I could master this phone in 2-3 days with little help from the manual/online forums.The out of the  box feature set is awesome. It is the swiss knife among smartphones. Bluetooth stereo, Podcast, music player, GPS, WiFi, VOIP, MMS, email push, POP and IMAP support, calendar and contacts sync, Microsoft exchange compatibility, full web browser, QuickOffice, PDF, zip..you name it, this phone comes with it. There are tons of 3rd party apps available online for Symbian OS.And the most important of all it works as a phone!. Very good reception like any other Nokia, and the call quality is superb.Only cons I can think of are:- Finger prints on the stainless steel and glass surfaces.- Camera is nothing special to write about.- Email clients are adequate for an average consumer, but not enterprise grade.- 2.5 mm audio jack needs special adapters (cheap) or Nokia earphone.
When my e61 traveled to the big cell cemetery in the sky, I went into deep mourning. But when my new e71 arrived with angels singing, clouds parting and sun streaming in, my depression lifted. This is a welcome update to the eSeries and is fantastic. The network capabilities are great, the speed has jumped considerably and the applications run flawlessly. Great attention has been paid to tweaking the interface to remove the quirkiness of the e61 in certain sections, so the user experience is more fluid and pleasant. Speaker is good, screen is a hair small, but very clear, processing speed is great, and on-board memory is adequate. Can't recommend this phone enough! Just be careful to get the correct version (e71-2 for US). Enjoy!
I was a little skeptical in ordering this because of some of the faults people have described here and other places.  I am pleased to say that mine does not suffer from any of the bad things described, e.g. doesn't hold 3G signal very well, drops calls, and cramped keypad.  Mine is a signal hog and not a single call dropped.  Keypad is samller than other phones but this one is more than sufficient and has great tactile feedback.
I won't do a long and detailed review of this phone, my previous reviewers had done it already.  I just want to add my 5 stars to the phone and I support every single positive comment the previous reviewers did.I had several Motorola phones (with Windows) and my latest one was an HTC S621 with Windows.  I got tired of Windows phones, lazy start, continuos OS "freeze" and all the bad stuff you already know about this Operating System.  Symbian is all the opposite of Windows, on a positive point of view.This phone humiliates ALL my previous ones and I'm more than happy with it.  And the price, OMG!!UPDATE (JAN 3rd, 2009):Some "flaws" I have found:- Links that come with emails, you won't be able to open them in a browser, the phone identifies them like telephone numbers and the options you will have is to "call" the number.  There is no "open link" option.- When opening the phonebook, sometimes the phone gets freezed and it restarts itself (maybe a flaw in my particular unit).- When turning on the phone, I ALWAYS get a message on the screen that an application couldn't be installed, but there is not details, I mean, the error won't say what application is having the installation error nor a suggested solution for it.  I had used my 8GB microsd to install "themes" on my phone and they work great, should these could the "applications" with errors?  I truly don't know.
I have been a dedicated Nokia supporter for a few years now. Started with a Nokia 7610, then switched to n80i and finally about a month or so ago purchased THE E71-2. To me there is absolutely no comparison between a blackberry and an e71, however it could not be perfect. Two major downfalls are:1. Does not work on Tmobile 3G network in continental US, which is a huge factor for current Tmobile users. Just have to settle for EDGE right now or use AT&T;2. No standard 3.5mm headphone jack, so unfortunately you won't be able to use your favorite headphones.Other than that it is an absolute iPhone and Blackberry killer
Great phone I got 3G on my phone and I love it.What I like the most is the phone can use a 8 gb micro sd card lots of room for stuff.
This is one the best, or maybe the best cell phone that I have own, very light and slim, for the person that want more out of a smart phone, I picked this one over the iPhone, I know they are different but this one suit my needs and works great.
Just an incredible phone. As a long-time Symbian user, I thought I knew what to expect but I was wrong. For me, the highlights are:1. Great form factor (thin, solid, great keyboard and screen)2. Very fast OS (press a button and the action happens instantly - almost no lag)3. Much improved PIM (Calendar and address books are both top-notch)4. Great reception (solid 3G everywhere I go in CT and 3.5g in the larger cities)5. Compatible with all my software (except Yahtzee, which looks weird, but hey, it's a game so who cares)Highly recommended. I know ATT has a version coming out which will be much cheaper but they ALWAYS find a way to screw up their phones.Enjoy. I am.
I used Nokia when they made the brick phones. I updated to all kinds of phones, and I still missed the quality of the Nokia, but I was too embarrased to carry around such an ugly brick of phone. This phone does everything! I have a hard time keeping track of events, when to take my vitamins, when exams are due, birthdays, everything. With other phones I had, there was the option to use the calendar and alarm settings, but none like this. Now, I don't have an excuse. I used to be stuck by the monitor all day waiting for that email, myspace message, Google Chat, AIM, messenger, facebook photo tag, listening to Last.fm, and now, I can literally take all of that with me. And the best part is, it does not eat up the battery and I can go anywhere! I can scrobble music on here with my SD card, and I have a GPS and it tells me where the closest dry cleaner is and what not in walking distance that I never knew of before! It also has this really cool application called SportsTracker, and it tracks not just the miles, but your pace. It is a great tool for athletes. I can see how many calories I am burning on my bike rides, and I can see how far I go when I walk to places. It made me get a little competitive with myself and I try to beat my own record. I love Nokia, and I have seen and tested all kinds of smartphones, and I know this phone will be with me forever!! Plus the video is amazing. I don't need to carry my ipod, camera, cell phone, gps with me. I have it all in ONE phone!!!Me + Nokia = Common Sense
This is an absolutely great product. It will do everything it has advertised in an excellent manner.  I highly recommend this product.
The main reason for my purchase is to get an unlocked phone so that when I'm travelling (Usa, Can, Europe) I can pop in another simcard and avoid the roaming fees (starts at 2$ / min. ouch!!)The Nokia E71 is my first smartphone and overall i'm pleased with it. Very quick to get setup using AT&T; Gophone. I was able to make it work with my Exchange work email without bothering the IT guys. My E71 did not come with the application to synch with Exchange so I had to go online to get it.Surfing is my next big activity. The included browser does the job but due to the limited screen size (compared to apple iphone), it's a bit of a pain to zoom in/out and scroll. It works best with pages formatted for mobile devices. A plus compared with Iphone is that I can surf with one thumb ;)Applications wise.. this one is a plenty. Google Maps works sweet with the included a-gps on the phone. It's no comparison to the Garmin -- but it's very usable to find the closest Starbucks or your friend's address. For the road warrior, you can leave your GPS home. Then, there's Widsets to get pages with various contents: Wall Street Journal, Google Calendar, .. Not to mention chat clients, running client (using gps), wifi hotspot (be careful about your provider's service agreement).. Works great, everything is mostly free..Last word: Make sure you get a data plan because not everything works with just wi-fi. If you can go prepaid the better to avoid the AT&T; tax for iphone users.
After two years of WM, finally I got a Symbian phone again, it's not perfect but veeery close. No more sluggish os and dead batteries!
This phone is the best phone you can hold in your hands. It feels great, looks great. Very SOLID. I mean it! Well, I have had many phones before, including iPhone and iPhone 3G, but this thing makes them all. Really. No matter that it does not have a touch screen. Navigation buttons and QWERTY are so useful - you actually forgetting about the touchscreen within 2-3 days. You understand that you don't really need touchscreen anymore. No lags or so with this phone. And with the latest lowest price on the market from Amazon, you clearly win! RECOMMENDED to ALL!
Outstanding product. Does a great job in every aspect. Have not found a flaw yet.
* This phone is excellent* The battery long life* The design is great is very slim* The web browser is not good, beacause there are some page that can't view and can't use the copy paste* The email client is bad
Nokia has stopped Blackberry Connect support with this phone, so unlike the E61i (which I have), one has to get a separate data package if one is on ATT. This makes this about as expensive to own as an iPhone on ATT, in which case the iPhone makes more sense.The keys are also much smaller than E61i, making texting and email much slower. Screen is brighter and phone is lighter, but that is about it.For a world traveler this remains a half-baked solution as the 3G support is region specific as well - even the iPhone and Treo support 3-band 3G. So, if you have 3G in the US, it won't work in Taiwan and Japan, which really sucks if you are in the tech business. This also means that you can't use VOIP programs like TruPhone outside the US - which is exactly when you actually need to save on ridiculously high roaming charges. And if you get the Asia 3G version ...it works only there.Basically, this is a cute non-iphone for folks who will not travel out of the US, and have very limited data package needs. Apart from that, it's an expensive paperweight and a poor replacement for the E61i. Nokia needs to get back to basics and develop phones that meet solid needs. A smartphone should be smart. And useful. And be real improvements on prior models - not just nicer candy wrapping. And we all (including me) need to really read the specifications in detail and not just assume Nokia knows what they are doing.I bought this, then had to return it after a detailed tryout which is what my feedback is based on. I was and remain rather irritated at Nokia. I expected more.I'm now waiting for ATT to get me a Blackberry Bold that's actually useful in my line of business - which is data heavy and has tons of travel useful features across US, Europe and both South and East Asia.
Great phone for business use...emails, text, etc.For multimedia, the N-Series (N95, etc) are way better...sound & pic quality.
I had this phone for about a month. The first couple of weeks were wonderful with it until it started to freeze on me. When it would freeze I would end up having to remove the battery. After I tried to start the phone back up I would get a blank screen for about 20-30 minutes until it would come on. When it finally came back on it would show an error message. I really enjoyed this phone up to this point. The navigation on it was ok. It was sad to see this phone had to go though. I ended up returning the item and getting a Blackberry Curve. The good part about this phone was the 3G capability but I am willing to sacrifice that for a phone that wont freeze on me when I go select programs, remove the media card, or send an email. The phone overall had some great ideas to it but it lacked the engineering within.The phone was also a finger print magnet. The buttons were really close together so I would accidentally hit other buttons when I was typing. The ability to navigate with the thumbpad was a little annoying compared to the ball on the Blackberry Curve. Kudos for the design but fooey on the software engineering. I wish it would have been a little better because I would have kept it.
More than what I asked for. Good buy at good price . Infact cheaper than most of the countries I inquired except Australia. But nevertheless if you are always on a move then this is one gadget that should be part of your travel must carry item :)
Bought this at best buy a few weeks ago and after spending all night, and half a day back at BEst buy and trying several different units, I still couldnt get it to sync with my Computer. No error messages nothing . just wouldnt happen.Phone looks feels and performs every thing else great, but if it cant sync it is near usless to me.
It works well.  Nicely sized and does what its supposed to do.  Symbian isn't my favorite OS so I traded it for a Bold.
I did lots (and lots and lots) of research on the e71, which was my choice to replace a Blackberry Pearl I'd had for a couple years.  I needed to buy unlocked because 1.) my BB died one day, and 2.) I'm stuck on T-mobile.  Because iPhones aren't "officially" unlocked, I settled on this e71, which seems to be Nokia's iPhone alternative.After the giddiness of having a new phone wore off, I became more and more disappointed in this phone.  It is certainly no iPhone (which my wife has), and isn't much better than my old Blackberry.  Call quality is the best feature.  That's about it.Because Nokia has not updated the firmware for North American versions (e71-2 models, i.e. this one I bought from Amazon), there are a number of very annoying bugs in the operating system.  Strike 1: The OS routinely crashes and reads "Memory Full" when it definitely is not full, and the only way to stop the warning screens from appearing is to reboot. Strike 2: The enclosed app for corporate email, called "Mail for Exchange" was so bad and difficult to configure that my IT guy and I finally gave up and bought a $50 RoadSync application that works OK.  (As a comparison, it took my wife approximately 3 minutes to configure her iPhone for corporate MS Exchange email.)  Strike 3: The phone sometimes makes an awful popping sound when playing keypad tones or application chimes,  It is like the clicking and popping sound you get when speakers overload or get too much signal.  Others have experienced this on the Nokia support boards, as well, and it may be a hardware issue.OS bugs aside, there are also significant hardware disadvantages of this piece compared with the iPhone.  The screen isn't wide enough to see a full line of sender, date, and email subject on the screen.  You have to guess sometimes at what the message might be.  This makes the chances of opening SPAM from the coporate server a lot greater, in my experience.  The camera is merely adequate, and mine casts a purple hue to all pictures -- not uncommon, according to other users.  I can manually set it to Sepia mode and it looks better, but that's a pain.  My wife's iPhone takes great photos as is.By far the most annoying "feature" of this phone is in setting up ring tones and alert tones.  In the Blackberry, you can indicate how many times you want a tone to ring.  It seems that, in this Nokia, it's either ON or OFF.  Sometimes I want an alert to ring once, and that's it.  Maybe a single chime to let me know about an email or something.  The sounds on the e71 just keep going and going until you manually silence them.I bought this phone mainly because I thought Nokia had a reputation for quality and solid phones.  It also had a full size, real qwerty keyboard, which I prefer to the screen-based keyboard of the iPhone.  The construction of the phone is solid.  It has nice build quality.  It's pretty.  But this and the qwerty keyboard benefit doesn't make this phone worth all the trouble of the other numerous issues.My T-Mobile contract is up in February, and I'm headed to the Apple Store to get an iPhone unless Nokia updates the e71 firmware for N. America.  I'll end up selling this one on eBay for a loss, and I'll be happy as a clam to get rid of it.  Overall, my experience with the phone as my main corporate and personal communicator has been at the most satisfactory.  My apologies to all the Nokia fanatics out there, but the iPhone beats this brick by a mile.
The camera is awful and the quality of the image is THE WORST. Even the $10 camera available in wal-mart is much better than this. Even the web browser and the other features are not good.Overall not up to the expectations.
I was extremely excited about this product. To my disappointment, I received a defective unit that randomly powercycles while using almost any application on the device for extended periods of time.I contacted Nokia tech support. I am a technically savvy person (professional IT and web design), and I was asked the same set of questions three times before being told to mail it to them for repair, at my expense. While it was completely under warranty.Amazingly disappointed, considering the great things I've heard about Nokia, and the great device reviews. Will not purchase a Nokia product again. Would advise others not to as well. If I could give this product zero stars, I would.
This an excellent alternative to a regular cell phone. The phone is lighter than a regular cell phone but the quality is still there. The phone is as easy as any regular cell phone to use with typical controls but the customer support from the company is great. Although geared towards kids I have used this and found little difference between it and a basic "regular" cell phone besides the cute start up graphics. The company does have some great controls in place if you do buy it for a kid. Although it looks like for a limited time they have a rebate program that makes the phone free![...]The economics the way they are it makes no sense at all to buy into any two year plan. This one makes it so I can adjust to whatever happens right away, which is a serious piece of mind. It comes in handy for when you need it on trips or an "emergency" but has enough to it for regular use as well. Finally able to break away from the two year contracts and very happy about it!
I was not at a computer to begin the kajeet activation process for the LG so I called kajeet customer care. The person I spoke with was very friendly and patient with me. I was in my car with my kids at the time. The customer service person walked me through the process and everyone was very happy before we reached our destination and the phone was a hit. The LG phone works great and the parental controls are fantastic. It is the perfect phone for the younger ones. We have three kids and each loves their kajeet. Thanks.
This phone may be ok but product support is terrible. I spent 8 minutes on hold with Amazon at the number listed above. Be warned, they have NO relevant information re how to actually get the phone activated, number portability, or coverage.  I did look at a Sprint map for coverage details and it is much more limited than my current carrier.  Amazon finally said they would refer me to a number at Kajeet that might be able to answer my questions.  I would not consider buying this product based on this service experience. Apparently you get what you pay for.
As other reviewers wrote, this is a Europe/Asia model (the E71-1 RM-346 to be precise). If you want to use it mainly in US you should take a E71-2 (e.g. the US version) so you can use the US 3G. If you need a phone for Europe or Asia, this is a good deal because with the current currency rate it's cheaper here than anything I've seen in Europe.The one I have came from Philippines. The manual is in English and the language can be set either in English or Philippines languages. The AC adapter is the same shape as US/Japan, and it accepts anything from 100V to 230V.There are already a lot of reviews about this product, but here is what I love in it, in a nutshell:* SIP (VOIP) is integrated to the system, so you can very easily initiate a VOIP call (just by typing a number or from your address book). Very convenient to make cheap international call when you're on a WiFi* The battery life is amazing* It's very responsive* It's thin and slim but the keyboard is still very usableThere are a few cons in the software (such as having to switch networks manually) but unless you're really into multimedia (music/videos) it's the best phone out there.
I would like to add to P. Nanda's review.In order to use 3G/UMTS/HSDPA, go for model E71-3 which supports WCDMA 850/2100 HSDPA, since AT&T;/Cingular 3G runs on 850/1900 and T-Mobile 3G will run on 1700/2100. This way you will have both the networks covered.* I do not make any guarantee regarding the 3G specs above. It is based on facts that I have today.
My colleague ordered and then later had to cancel. Phone is great, but I wanted to add a line about what is available when it means 'EURO'.People look at quad band and think that US is fully supported. Yes, as long as you are on GSM network for voice calls. But for HSDPA/3G data service, you would have to check specifically if US frequencies are supported under HSDPA frequency range.For 3G/HSDPA to work in US/ATT/T-Mobile, the frequency support should be 850MHz/1900MHz under HSDPA category. To make it very easy, I advise going to iphone 'Tech Specs' and see what frequencies it supports under various features and you will be clear. Here is a cut/paste for what works for US:Cellular and wireless (iPhone frequency support list)UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz)GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)Wi-Fi (802.11b/g)Bluetooth 2.0 + EDRThe EURO E71 doesn't have some of the HSDPA frequencies that US requires (850/1900MHz I believe). Hopefuly I didn't make things more confusing.
I have been cheating on NOKIA in the last 2 years with LG and Palm. I am sorry NOKIA this will never happened again. You know what they say about the cars. Once you own and drive Mercedes that's it there is no other car can satisfy you. Same with NOKIA about phones. There is no more to ask in the phone that E71 can offer you. I guaranty once you open the box that's it you are in love and as soon as you touch it the love become unconditional.  I will tell you what. iPhone, Palm, LG , G1 or  what ever phones look like prehistoric ugly stones compare  to the NOKIA E71. About the functions I have only one world. Symbian OS. The people who's know and looking for good reliable product will know what I am talking about. I am happy and I know I will be happy in the future with the E71 as I was happy with my NOKIA communicator for years. I have no Cons for this phone. If you need more then what this phone can offer, you need to buy a laptop computer and stick it in your ear.  One more thing. The EURO E71 doesn't have some of the HSDPA frequencies that US requires. You need to buy the US model in order to be in 3G networks in USA. Yes US are always behind the mobile technologies.
THis is the best phone I ever had. I had around 12 mobile phones in my life, and this is definitely the best one.The down side of the version that amazon sells is that only comes in english, pilipino and melayu. If they sell the version as "Internaitonal", thay should get a version that at lease has spanish and english languaje, apart from others of course. But well, nothing is perfect...
Bought the phone for a month now and I am very happy with it. Very light to carry and very slim look. Nice choice to someone looking for a slick smartphone.
If you will like to be organized and to be conected anytime of the year this is the smartphone for you. The world it's in your hands now that you have the Nokia E71!
I upgraded from a Nokia 6233 to the 6220 Classic recently and haven't looked back. The main feature for me was the inbuilt GPS. As I was considering buying a GPS unit, it made perfect sense to get a new phone with the GPS built in. It does a great job, I've got mine stuck to the windscreen in the car which is where the best signal is achieved. The screen on the phone is nice and bright, the camera is great, and the text to speech reader is very handy when you can't look at the screen e.g. for new messages. The only drawbacks would be that it's a tad small for people with large hands, and the plastic casing could have been much more sturdy. The 6233 has much better stereo speakers, however the 6220's loudspeaker does the job. All over a good unit.
I got the purple one. I mainly wanted a good camera that I would always have with me and would always be charged and the only way to ensure that was the case was to have it on my phone... The camera's pretty good. I have pulled it out and taken pictures in many situations that would have just passed me by since I hadn't been expecting anything worth photographing to happen. I use this thing as my ipod too. It's nice because I don't have to carry headphones everywhere, I can just use the builtin speakers. I am thinking about getting bluetooth headphones for it... Sadly, my keypad seems to be dying on the left side. I've only had it for a few months. I had to change it to always unlocked because I couldn't get the thing to register the * key to unlock the keypad... then the number keys down the left side crapped out... It's odd though, when they work, they work for awhile with no problem... it's like the phone forgets to pay attention to what's going on on that side, but once you remind it, it's all good for a bit. I'm hoping this problem is unique to mine though, and provided it's not a common problem, I totally recommend this phone. Though, as the previous reviewer stated, the casing is very flimsy.
I got this phone as a replacement from t-mobiles insurance provider. I am very disapointed; the internal charger outlet was loose shortly after I recieved it. three months latter it is completely unchargable because the tiny foil like prongs that hold the charger part inplace, broke. this phone is terrible. I wouldn't take it if it were free.Dont waste your money.
I recently upgraded my sidekick from an ID to the new LX, and couldn't be more pleased. There were many things about the ID that frustrated me, such as a lack of camera and poor screen quality. The LX has a crystal clear sceen and a pretty good camera, considering it is still a phone. Of course the LX is pricey, but you will get what you pay for. I'm a sidekick girl at heart, and this was a great buy.
EDIT: I would like to note that I've actually gone through TWO Sidekick LXs so far, with a third on the way in the mail. This is due to my bluetooth malfunctioning to such a degree that it can't be a fluke or occasional connection problem. I do not have high hopes for this third phone and I anticipate that I will also have to return the third one to swap for an equivalent but different brand phone just to have bluetooth functionality. If you don't use bluetooth, or don't mind a wired headset, this problem is irrelevant, but one of the main reasons I purchased an LX was because it did have bluetooth. I've not read online of anyone else having the same problem I have, so it is either a rare problem or I'm just absurdly unlucky. (and no, sadly, it isn't user error for me--I've troubleshooted this issue with TMobile quite a bit with no less than three bluetooth headsets from two different manufacturers)Aside from that problem, the LX is a fine phone, and you can read my original review below.My first Sidekick was the Sidekick II. I loved it! I skipped the Sidekick 3 because I heard a number of awful things about it. And now I own the Sidekick LX.I actually purchased the Motorola Sidekick Slide first, because I liked the colors better and didn't see a real need for the upgraded Aquos screen. Big mistake. I was lucky and didn't get one of the ones with the notorious power-off problem, but it still had problems of its own. The MicroSD card, for instance? The Slide read it once, and then for some reason, it decided it couldn't read it anymore! Typing was uncomfortable compared to the SK2. I decided to go to the T-Mobile store and return it for a Sidekick LX.Popped that same MicroSD card into the LX and it read it just fine!I like my LX, I really, really do. But the lack of features really hurts:-No Wifi support (Curve has this)-No 3g support (Curve doesn't have this either)-No A2DP Bluetooth support (you can't use bluetooth headphones to listen to your mp3s)-The speaker on the phone sucks--when I'm using my phone directly (instead of my bluetooth headset) I have to turn the volume to the max to be able to hear who I'm talking to, and I have no hearing problems whatsoever!-The camera REALLY sucks, I've not gone to compare yet but I remember my SK2 camera being better than this one!-Very, very limited in what third party applications are availableThere are some bonuses to the Sidekick LX:-Cheapest data plan of all the T-Mobile data plans, and it gives you unlimited texting (the other plans do not), which is key if you're the type of person who sends lots of text messages.-Terminal program (big selling point for me--don't worry if you don't know what it is, you probably won't need it)-Big, clear screen-Easy to use keyboard (it is larger than most smartphone keyboards and may be the best smartphone keyboard around)Considering the price I paid for my Sidekick LX, I'm quite happy with the phone in spite of its flaws. There are a number of times I wish I had purchased the Helio Ocean or the Blackberry Curve instead. Unless the next Sidekick sports some of the more important features (3g, WiFi, A2DP Bluetooth) this will be my last Sidekick.For text happy teens, however, this is the best phone on the market due to the data plan alone--unlimited text messages!
What the SK3 should have BEEN & MORE!!!!!This is a great DEVICE and really throws you in the social scene of TRENDY teens and early folks in there 20's. This device SCREAMS mainstream. The SK LX is everything the SK3 should have been and more. The SK3 had a washed out screen and ironically the SK2s screen and colors just POPPED while the SK3 was total dullsville. The SK3 couldn't even send picture messages and at one point i think mine started to not even accept picture messages. You get everything that was on the previous SKs accept this time the screen has been improved by 100% and its also a larger screen. You also get to send picture message but no camcorder or video message on this device. Which was a bit shocking, considering every standard cell phone has this feature i was a bit shocked that this one didn't have that. Perhaps maybe the SK4 will have it. You also get to record voice message that only last 20 seconds but you can send em to a friend for laughs. There is still no 3G service so your surfing the web at EDGE speeds and i live in NY and i haven't seen a slower browser then this one. There are certain times where its actually quite fast but i couldn't imagine trying to surf the web if i lived in Texas by the horses. Anyways this is a great buy and I love keyboard and as much I try to stay away from the SK I always find myself coming back to the device. Hopefully the next installment will fix all the flaws as the SK LX is just a cosmetic upgrade over the SK3. Real great device but for the price I would of liked to see a bit more new features added in.
OKAYTHE SIDEKICK LX IS ONLY USEFUL TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INSTANT MESSAGE JUNKIES. TEXTING IS HORRIBLE, IT ONLY HOLDS 100 TEXTS INCOMING AND OUTGOING SO THERE IS ALWAYS A POP UP REMINDING U TO CLEAR IT OUT WHICH IS TOO OFTEN. THE INTERNET SUCKS PERIOD. ITS SUPER SLOW AND IT CAN ONLY VIEW CERTAIN PAGES. AND THE EMAIL ISNT THAT GREAT NEITHER IT CAN ONLY DISPLAY CERTAIN KINDS OF PICS.ALL IN ALL THIS PHONE IS FOR KIDS WHO ENJOY INSTANT MESSAGING, AND MYSPACE ..ETC..FOR THOSE USERS WHO PLAN ON GETTING IT FOR INTERNET BROWSING U WOULD WANNA GO THE OTHER WAY. I SUGGEST A PHONE PDA WITH MOBILE WINDOWS AND INTERNET EXPLOROR.
I LOVE MY SIDEKICK LX [BLUE] HAVE TO BE THE BEST PHONES EVER OUT THERE IT DOESNT HAVE VIDEO WHICH SUX BUT OTHER THAN THAT BECAREFUL CAUSE ITS ADDICTING LOLZ..CANT KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF OF IT
WOW I LUV MY LX. BEST SK SINCE DA 2. I...I JUS LUV IT ITZ HOTTTTT, LOL!!!!
Do not buy this phone.  It is a waste of money.  I see that the Sidekick Slide is not listed on Amazon probably because it is such a piece of junk.I bought two Sidekicks at Christmas for my daughters.  I was not told that unless i bough the additional $20 a month Sidekick package, the phones would not have the basic functionality available on other phones such as retaining contacts.  THey also lose messages constantly.When I talked to T-Mobile about this, the answer I received was basically, too bad.  They didn't communicate that I would need the additional package but that's not their problem. So basically I paid them $440 for phones that are a piece of junk unless you are willing to increase your monthly bill by $20 a month per phone AND I am stuck in their two year contract.I am seriously considering legal action.
I just got this phone last week, and it has some nice features. The one I liked mostly is that you can put specific phone numbers on a black list and have the phone send a busy signal when they call you. One other thing is the calendar and to do list. Very practical. Also you can have an alarm set to wake you up only on weekdays. Cool!!Also, what I liked about this phone is that it's a sturdy phone, it feels good in your hand. It's beautiful, but it will get smedged easily with fingerprints. However, battery life is really bad, not what I'm used of with Nokia. Also, the slide mechanism has a major problem. When you slide open the phone, it just doesn't react by unlocking the phone. You have to unlock it manually. It seems this is some kind of magnetic failure of the phone. More users have reported this same problem. You can see these on the Nokia Discussions website. I took the phone back to the store and exchanged it for the N95. But still I like the E66 best because it has some features the N95 does not have. E.g. when in sleep mode you press the selection key you see the time. And the phone is so slim it slips comfortably in your jeans pocket. Try that with the bulky N95...I hope Nokia fixes this slide problem.
A smartphone that is not huge like the iPhone and Blackberries, e.g. it has Wi-Fi, GPS, Maps, Browser, RealPlayer, E-Mail, Office, Camera/Video, etc. but it's about the size of a RAZR (slightly taller but thinner).  Same features as E71 but smaller.  Solid construction, quality feel.I have not experienced either problem referenced by the other reviewer.  Battery life is excellent, and the unlocking issue is not present.  Perhaps confirm that you're getting the extended battery.
I liked:- Size- Resolution of Display- Features- Qualiade signal- System multi-tasking- Construction- GPSI did not like:- 3 weeks with the hood is deformed- The battery is very low- The menus are confusing and outdated- The keyboard is terrible for typing text (recommend the E71)- Live voice with low volume- Poor sound quality in speaker- The international version does not have many options for language, including Portuguese- The image of the camera is designed for blue violet, and low quality (I was very disappointed)
comes with a chinese wall plug and US adaptor.this allows you to plug into a US wall outlet, but my personal experience is it will not provide right voltage to charge device.  Therefore this product i purchased will not work in the USA.also important to know the nokia6210 3G works on 900/2100 frequency, EURO standard.  Voice and EDGE will work because the device is quadband, which would be enough for me.but know that usa at&t; 3G service operates on 850/1900
EDIT - After owning this phone for close to a year, I figured I would update my review. Just a few cons I've discovered -- the speakerphone is way too quiet to be useful, especially in the car (which is where I want it in the first place). And I have noticed the battery cover tends to pop off once in a while if the phone is in my jeans pocket. Other than that, I still love it. It's nice and thin, features are great for the price, and battery life is very good. Probably the best inexpensive phone that Virgin offers, go for it!My original review:Just picked up two of these, one for me and one for my wife. There's really nothing bad to say about this phone.It's THIN, has a camera and bluetooth and speakerphone! Pretty much has and does anything you need a phone to do. Plus it's Virgin, so if you don't use your phone too much, it's very economical!!!I guess if I had to give any cons about it, it would be the camera is only VGA (were you expecting any better for a $50 phone?) and the buttons are a little small (same with about 90% of other phones on the market).I love it!
This is my second virgin mobile phone after using my old Rave phone for about the past 4 years. I was looking for a flip phone that had a camera for quick snapshots. So far, the voice quality seems pretty good, and the battery life is great.  After charging the battery for the first time it stayed on continuously for 10 days before giving me a low battery warning. Like another reviewer I am a little disappointed by the small number of non-obnoxious ringtones.  But overall I have no problems with the phone's calling functionality, voice quality, or with sending text messages.  My biggest problems are with accessing the internet and sending picture messages.  Supposedly this phone is capable of sending e-mails and uploading pictures.  However whenever I try anything requiring internet access (including requesting my account balance) I keep getting the message "Error:  Network down".  Is anyone else able to connect to the internet using this phone?  How about sending pictures?  Does this work for anyone else?UPDATE: I contact Virgin Mobile service to report the problem mentioned above.  At first they had me re-activate the phone and try accessing network after at least 4 hours.  After that didn't resolve the problem, I called back and they had me try removing the battery and restarting the phone.  When that didn't fix the problem, the service adviser opened an investigation.  The next day Tech Support contacted me and did something at their end to reset my phone.  After that I was able to get the account balance and send picture messages.  Things are all working fine now.  Virgin Mobile service has been friendly and responsive.  I'm glad that my phone is now able to do all that it is supposed to.
We have been Virgin Mobile owners for about 10 years now.  This is my 3rd VM phone, my first one wasn't that great and I had to return it 2x but they quickly had a new one to me.  My 2nd one the battery charger started acting strange and they replaced it and it started failing after 5 years... We just bought 2 more phones because the pricing and the service is pretty good.  $35.00 at Best Buy!  It includes a lot of features that are important to us!Pros:  Speakerphone, Bluetooth, Camera, Voice activated dialing, Standby and Talk time and ease of use out of the box.Cons: The contact list set up could be more user friendly or intuitive. It would be nice to have some more FREE ring tones that are not "rap" or perhaps ones that are event oriented or 70's, 80's, 90's.  I always have to buy a handful of ring tones to get ones that are not obnoxious. Also the camera is nice but not very high quality.EDITED 04/10 - Even though I do top-up through my credit card automatically... from time to time it "forgets" and then I have to manually call in and top up through my card on record or give them another card.  It came at a most inopportune time about 10 days ago.  I don't know why it did it but this is the 2nd time in 3 years.
The Arc is awesome, spend the extra dough for this one. I have been a virginmobile customer for 3 years and this one is the best. Also they don't tell you this but the battery lasts forever on this, literally up to 2 weeks on standby!
Love this phone! I got it for my 15year old son and the ring tones are up to date he loves it
I don't know whether the phone works well or not, because I have not been able to activate it. I can say that Virgin Mobile has terrible customer service. The Web site gave an error message, and when I called in, I had to talk to four different people who told me four different things about why the phone wouldn't activate. A supervisor told me that Virgin Mobile would send a new phone, then he passed me to a representative who said that I couldn't receive a new phone until the the one I'd just got was activated. Now I have to wait 72 hours for them to "investigate" the problem. They won't even call me back when they have it fixed. If you go with a Virgin Mobile phone, pray that you never need to talk with a human about it. This company does not care in the slightest about good customer service.
I was extremely excited to open up the Nokia N96, because from its specs it looked to be one of the most powerful mobile phones on the market.  It certainly lived up to its expectations in some areas, and exceeds them in others, but fell short with some very common issues.For anyone looking for a camera/media device that also does phone calls, this might have been a serious contender.The media player works well for audio, the built-in FM tuner is great, and the internet radio feed was easy to use and loaded with content.  This phone does everything well, but not nearly well enough to justify its astronomical price tag.------------------Things Done Right:Browser - The browser on the phone rendered the pages I tried perfectly and it was very easy to navigate using the device.  Bookmarks and other features you'd want were all there.FM Radio - This worked like a charm!  It was very cool to have this in a mobile device.Light Weight - The phone weighs considerably less than my AT&T; Fuze and Tilt.Massive Storage - The phone's best feature is its internal 16 GB of storage.Looks - Trust me when I say the phone looks even better in person.---------------Half-Way There:Mapping - Rather than relying on a live internet feed for maps, it had very detailed maps of the US right on the phone.  This is great if you are in an area with patchy service and need directions.  But, it's no Google Maps.  I've been spoiled by having Google Maps on my Windows Mobile phones for some time now, and while the mapping application on this phone is good, it's not Google Maps.  Plus, many of the advanced features of this application require an extra fee such as turn-by-turn directions and traffic reports.WiFi - Connecting the phone to my home wireless network with WPA/PSK was a breeze.  HOWEVER, many of the features  on the phone such as the mapping tool, internet radio, and others required use of data plan, even if you were connected via WiFi.  And despite trying, I could never get it to connect to my computer for WiFi Sharing.Help - The phone has online help for nearly every menu, most of which was well-written and useful.  Some of the more rare settings had no help, however.Camera - While this phone won't replace your $200 digital camera, it's better than what I've seen on most mobile phones.  I especially liked the on-screen menus for making adjustments on the fly.  The flash on the back of the camera is great for close-up subjects.Voice Command - There is a utility which reads you your messages to you, which was pretty neat.  And, you can dial your contacts through voice command, plus launch applications.  Unfortunately, that's all.  Voice command apps on other devices allow you to dial numbers as they are spoken, play specific media, or dictate text messages.-----------------More Work Needed:No Keyboard - This device lacks both a keyboard and touch screen, limiting all input to the numeric pad and a plethora of other buttons.  If you are a heavy text/emailer, this is going to be a deal-breaker for you.IM Difficult - The phone includes an IM application, but it was intimidating to configure with settings that I had no clue about.  Other phones include apps which are preconfigured for Yahoo, AIM, and MSN, but that was not the case here.  The manual and help were useless here.Micro USB - Every portable device I own uses Mini USB for sync and charging, but the Nokia N96 introduces the even smaller Micro USB.  That means that I need to carry yet another cable.No USB Charge - To make it worse, you cannot charge via USB.  While the phone comes with an AC charger and a car charger, its proprietary and means yet ANOTHER cable to carry.WMV Playback - Despite being touted as a media player, the phone would not play any of the WMV files I copied to it.  These were non-DRM files that worked fine on other phones.AGPS - The manual claims that the phone supports Assisted GPS (to speed up your positioning) but it would not work.Other Annoyances - There were a few other things that bothered me about the phone.  For instance, the music playback stuttered while using the phone for text messaging or mapping, and there was no option to disable the power-saving features while on AC power.--------------In Conclusion:For the price that this phone sells for, and comparing it to other devices on the market at half the price, I find it very hard to justify recommending the phone to anyone.Its only real saving grace is the 16 GB of storage, although some of its competitors will support memory cards with 4-16 GB of capacity.If the price came down considerably, and they issued a software upgrade to fix several of the above issues, it would probably beat its competitors hands-down.  But until then, I recommend passing this phone up for any of its half-priced competitors.
It's a nice little phone. The one I had just had a few bugs to work out. The battery I got in this first one did not last as long as the second one I received. The voice command on this first one was jinxed. About one out of 20 names I would say would 1st pick a wrong name, (which can be expected) but then would commence to shutting itself off and then restart. If I said the same name, it would do it consistently. Like I said it would do it on about 5% of the names. I called Nokia of the problem and ordered one from them because it was so new, and I wanted one made in Finland as Stu promised. It was also from China. The video and photos aren't near as good as I expected. They were OK if taken in bright light. I want a qwerty pad. So I am going to wait for the N97 coming out in June or July 09. The N96 locked up on me about twice a day, especially if I was doing heavy internet chores, (on wifi). Sometimes if I would just wait it would catch up. But if it was in the middle of something and I got bored waiting I would try to back out and do something else and it was too much for the little thing to absorb so it would lock up. At this point I would have to remove the battery to get it to reset itself. And the release and the little catchs on the rear cover are sort of chincy and it didn't feel like the rear cover  would last very long removing the battery so often.It's nice to have the tv out cable ability but the stuff we record does not play back as well as a 99MB travel piece that they have for us to playback. This tells me that they record that on a good camera and downloaded it into the phone. I could get the predictive text shut off on some things but not on the internet browsing. I would have to enter letters til the thing told me to spell the  word myself, which I wanted in the first place.On the toggle buttons for the volume, they're OK but the volume goes up one way so you would think that when the buttons are used for zooming that to zoom in would be the same direction as the volume increase. Nope. While this is not a big deal It just takes a bit more memorization. The screen shuts off way too fast, (to save battery). This can be reset but that poor battery doesn't like this new setting. The second N96 I got seemed to last longer with the battery.If I wanted to hear the sound out of the speakers I would have to shut my bluetooth off. The screen protectors are good just make sure you have every piece of dirt and lint of the screen before install it or it will make a bubble around the piece of dirt.The thickness of the phone did not bother me either.I thank Amazon very much for having a place for these reviews. I read them all the time before I purchase anything.
This phone is amazing.  But please keep in mind that you will NOT be able to use this phone on T-mobile's 3G network, because the frequencies are different than HSDPA 850 / 1900 (american version).  If you dont care about 3G, I really recommend this phone; however you don't need to get the US version ($100 more expensive than buying it from someplace else) if you are on the T-Mobile network.
This phone does it all dvd quality video 5 mp camera wifi and gps.I didn't give it 5 stars because its a bit slower than my n82 the dual led is good but no were near the xenon flash on my n82. Also the gps won't lock as fast.I really like the dual slide option with the media control their great they feel sturdy and have a nice click to let you know you pressed them.the screen is bright and pretty big compared to my n82 the over all size is similar with the same build quality.The Symbian OS is the greatest feature its runs very smoothly and theres lots of  cool programs to be downloaded from nokia or mosh some are even free .This phone is a must have for a tech freak or any person who doesn't want to carry a camera a camcorder a laptop an mp3 player a tv and some video games in your pocket ! the mobile tv is already supported in some US states with more to come soon.Also google maps works better than nokia maps in my opinion. Worth every dollar maybe 4 stars and three quarters
This is a great phone it has everything you can imagine, Lots of applications, multimedia,  great resolution you can download movies from amazon.com movies into this device. 3G you can send e-mails watch your direct  tv if you buy a sling player in great digital quality. internet radio, 24 gb of memory in total (16gb  already in the phone ) and 8gb on a memory card,  great camara 5mp considering being a cellphone  and much much more.  Now Be Careful when you get it and  make sure that memory funtions and the phone in general are working propertly. I had to reurn 2 of them before i got one that really works the way  it should. they were acting funny, slow and turning on and off bythemself. By the way NOKIA cust service is the worst  cust service to deal with make sure you get it from amazon or a store you trust. nokia gave me a very hard time on a defective phone i had to return and took a long time to refund my money eventhought i trust nokia brand a lot i would never buy direct from nokia ever again, also the prices here are a lot cheaper nokia wanted to charge me $776 plus taxes and shipping for my n96 and i got it for $639 without taxes and free shipping on amazon.com.
Reader's Digest Condensed Version:----------------------------------If you are looking for a phone geared more towards entertainment than providing a mobile office, this phone is for you.  If you are looking for a work-friendly phone, keep then perhaps the Nokia E90 Communicator Unlocked Smartphone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD--U.S. Version with Warranty (Red) would be a better (and more expensive) choice.Also, if you do buy this phone, make sure you buy a case/holster and a screen protector, as well.----------------------------------------------The Details...I had a hard time deciding on a star-rating for this phone because it is quite different from any other smartphone that I have used.  In the last couple of years, I have used:Blackberry 8300Helio OceanAT&T; 8525Samsung SCH-i760  (my current phone)With the exception of the Helio Ocean, the Blackberry, AT&T; and Samsung are business-centric phones.  All four feature a Qwerty keyboard.  The Helio, AT&T; and Samsung each have their own numeric keypad in addition to the qwerty keyboard.All except for the Helio, did business applications, email, telephone communication, and syncing with easily -- that's what they were designed to do and that is the frame of reference that I am coming from.The Nokia N96, to me, isn't really aimed at the business centric crowd.  It is aimed at the multimedia "I want to be entertained" crowd (and a rich crowd, that must be judging by the price tag).Sure, the Nokia does email and "office stuff" ok -- but because they decided not to include the qwerty keyboard and opted to include so much multimedia stuff, it is clear that they decided "work can wait".  Not necessarily a BAD thing... just different than I'm used to.So let's talk about what the Nokia IS designed for: talking, listening to music, taking pictures/video, and watching video.First, initial impressions about aesthetics:-- it is actually smaller than I'm used to (the Samsung).  It is lighter, shorter, and thinner.  You open the box and you certainly experience that "WOW" factor -- this phone is elegant and sophisticated.  The finish is the shiny "piano finish" that is so common.  Frankly, I HATE that because the moment you touch it, it is smudgy and that just drives me crazy.  The sides are metal but the back is a flimsy plastic and overall it just doesn't feel as solid as the other phones which were mostly metal cases.The screen is unbelievably gorgeous and bright.  No other smartphone I have used can hold a candle to it (I have not seen an iPhone so don't really have a basis of comparison there).The first thing I did was call someone.  Call quality is excellent -- also much better than any other cell phone I have used.  Very very close to Landline quality.  I paired it with a Nokia 02705X6 BH-503 Bluetooth Stereo Headset and sound quality (both receiving and talking better than most phones.  One of the things that is good about the call quality is the ability to really turn up the volume.  With other phones, I could seldom get the volume loud enough to hear over road/wind noise in the car.  With the N96, you actually have to turn it down because it can get uncomfortably loud.Even using the speaker phone is very good.  The N96 has "stereo speakers" and while you aren't going to throw out your home theater system, the speakers make the phone even better.Camera------The N96 has a 5 mp Carl Zeiss camera built in.  The camera can take stills or video at 30 frames per second.  I really like the camera because it allows me to be more spontaneous with taking pictures/video.  With my Samsung, the only time I used the cell phone feature was when I wrecked my car and wanted pictures of the evidence.  With Carl Zeiss optics (Zeiss is known for making the best optics in the world), you can take very solid photo album quality pictures with this camera.  It isn't going to replace your 12 MP SLR but for "on-the-go" pictures that you wouldn't otherwise catch, it is really nice to have.Music-----Again, the music quality on this device rivals any MP3 player.  I actually used it with a set of high-end Denon cans today and it was almost as good playing the CD through a PC.  I say "almost" because I was able to pick up some crackly artifact that resulted from the Nokia converting my higher bit-rate recordings to a lower bit-rate for space considerations.  But this trade off is worth it.  With 16 GB of main memory, I have over 3 hours of music loaded on the phone with space to spare.Keypad and controls:--------------------I'm still not sold on the T9 only keyboard.  I read a previous commenter about how you can learn to type faster with T9 than Qwerty and I intend to try it.  I do have to say that T9 typing seems to work better than I remembered it on previous phones.I'm not wild about the feel of the buttons.  They are all flat and do not feel "solid" to me.  I could see them cracking with a lot of use.Web and email-------------Even though this is a smaller device, the screen is actually larger than my Samsung.  You wouldn't think a couple of pixels in either direction would be that big a deal but it really helps with page display.Video-----I believe the N96 was designed around this feature.  Downloading videos from Amazon was very easy and the playback is just like a tiny TV.  To me, though, this is the least "useful" feature of the phone.  If I'm sitting around and have some time to kill, I'm more likely to check email, listen to music or just plain read.Battery life-------------Average battery life.  I was able to use the cell phone for about 1.25 hours of talk time and 3 hours of listening to music before the battery died.  That means if you use your phone a lot, you'll need to keep it plugged in (fortunately, the phone comes with both an AC charger and a car charger -- very unusual in this day and age).Syncing with your PC--------------------Included with the phone is a software suite that will allow you to sync with Outlook etc.  Installation took awhile (I had to download .NET) but getting all my contact data onto the device was a snap.  Transferring music wasn't great -- it could be that I just don't have the sync settings set up correctly.  However, the N96 requires Windows Media Player 11 for the syncing.  I have A LOT of music loaded in WMP and didn't want to load EVERYTHING on.  I tried to create a playlist to identify just what I wanted transferred over.  Unfortunately, it still grabbed more than I wanted it to.Miscellaneous--------------- The USB cable that comes with it is not your standard USB cable -- at least on the end that connects to the phone.  It has a smaller connector than most devices (like MP3 players, external disk drives, my other cell phones, etc.  So if you want to sync up at home and at work, you'll have to hang on tight to this cable (or buy another one online).-- The Nokia does provide both a car and standard AC charger which is good since you will need to keep this thing constantly plugged in.  There is no way to accommodate an extended battery at this point -- it would require a new "back plate" (this is the approach that AT&T; adopted for their 8525).  Hopefully, this will be something Nokia will provide down the road.  However, I will say that this device provides a LOT of options to tweak the features to maximize battery performance.  For example, you can specify during what hours to go fetch email.  There's not much point in fetching email 24/7 when you may only want access to it 12x5.  You can also set it up to shut down during night hours etc.-- The screen is not a touch screen.  Also, if you want to protect it, you're probably going to want to get a HTC Touch Diamond JAVOScreen (Ultra-Clear) + JAVOedge MetaCharger Bundle (Euro) screen protector to hide the finger prints and prevent scratches.  I had one left over from my 8525 and it isn't a perfect fit but works good enough.-- You will also want to invest in a good case/holster.  I can't believe that Nokia is selling a 700.00 phone with a screen like this and yet they don't even provide the most basic protection required.  Even the bluetooth headphones came with their own carrying pouch.
This is a really great phone, media player, and gps. The ONLY and i say again ONLY reason its not a 5 star, is simply becuase they didnt opt to go with a qwerty keyboard. So after using a palm, or blackjack phone you have to revert back to your old ways of typing in text messages which i do not like. Other than that simple flaw, the phone is a great investment.
The first comment is completely UNTRUE.  Nokia offers a full one-year warranty through third-party vendors, such as Amazon. I called Nokia and they said they will warranty this product.Also...the N96 is the only mobile device compatible with Amazon Video on Demand.  Download videos & transfer them to your N96!!  with 16GB built-in, & another SD card slot...pretty sweet.
First of all, this review is based on how this phone fits my lifestyle, so you need to know a little bit about that. I am a businessman, but I love music, and movies, and even reading ebooks when I'm waiting for an appointment, so I can't wait to see how this phone performs in those capacities. But I am also a PC user, and keep all of my contacts and calendars for work and at home in Outlook 2007. My other phone is an AT&T; Tilt, and I'm quite pleased with it.(1) FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Unpacking the phone and setting it up was a breeze. I removed the sim card from an old phone, inserted it into the N96, and powered up. I was instantly connected to AT&T;, and have no problem making and receiving calls and using AT&T;'s internet features. I am glad I bought a GREAT silicone skin for the N96 (Tuff-Luv (Nokia N96) Slim&Lite; Silicone skin case cover (black) offered by Eforcity on Amazon), because although the case is shinny and attractive and has a good feel in the hand, fingerprints from handling grundge it up quickly. The silicone case I chose is a great fit and allows the keypad to slide out and keeps it firmly in my hand and is reviewed by me elsewhere.Controls and keys are firm and positive, so they reinforce the phones overall impression of quality build.I plugged in an 8GB microSD card that I mostly expect to use for music or backup on the phone, but 16GB on board the phone is a lot of memory. The screen is reasonably clear and bright, although it does not seem quite as bright as my Tilt.I did not find Nokia's documentation for the phone as clear about using this phone some on other vendors' phones I've owned, but it is adequate overall. On line documentation from Nokia USA is very helpful.The phone immediately found the wi-fi in my home, and on entry of the security code, it was seamlessly integrated in my home network. I quickly began surfing the web to a few spots. Using the cursor with the thumb button to move around the keyboard seems clumsy compared to a touchscreen, but it works.I go to Nokia's USA site on my PC and register the phone and check for software or firmware updates. Everything is current, which is impressive. I download and install the Nokia PC Suite on my PC, and it takes about 10 minutes and requires a reboot. Plugging the phone in with the USB cable, the PC finds it and I am in business. I use Office 2007 on my PC, so I immediately want to sync my contacts and calendars, and this is where Nokia's documentation for PC Suites lets me down. A search for "synchronize outlook" does not lead to anything useful on the website. I am afraid I'll be relegated to actually having to map Outlook Contact fields to a csv file or a vcard format, but after 30 frustrating minutes, I find an icon in the Suite that synchronizes to Outlook folders as well as other common business products. While the process is fast -- 319 contacts in about 3 minutes, a quick look shows them organized by "first name" rather than "last name" as in my contacts. Also, some of the name fields are blank and some are mismatched -- a few "first names" are now "middle names". So, I give the synchronization a "C" -- it happens, but some of the data will have to be cleaned up, which without a keyboard will be painful and frustrating.I quickly attach a new Plantronics Bluetooth headset and place my first call. The call is clear on both ends. Reception seems better than my AT&T; Tilt, so good marks for voice clarity. Similarly, surfing the internet is a little faster than the Tilt, but once again, the user interface and moving the cursor around takes more time.(2) USING THE CAMERA AND WATCHING VIDEOS AND GAME THOUGHTS FROM A NON-GAMER:I have not been able to get the download to work from Amazon so far, so that's been frustrating - I haven't been able to watch the movie. The two cameras - lo-res to video you using the phone as a video phone and hi-res to video or photograph other people or objects are very adequate and user friendly. The hi-res camera is the best camera I've used for inside (and darkly lit) subjects. Flash is decent, and color is acceptable. You can go to a restaurant or party and shoot some nice snapshots without taking a separate camera, and you have ALL that storage space on the camera.(3) GPS AND NAVIGATING WITH NOKIAThe GPS of the N96 locates itself quite quickly, even inside an ordinary house. The maps are downloaded in "sections", and are quite simply the best looking and most intuitive graphics display of maps I have seen on a cell phone. Similarly, it is easy to switch between satellite and map vies or a combination of the two. When you are setting up a navigation, you are given the choice between walking and driving instructions, which would be of great use in a strange city, and also in planning that daily walk or run for exercise. Big thumbs up for these features. Using the maps is a little trickier - first of all, it is disconcerting when you take an exit on a trip according to the instructions, and the unit suddenly displays "road not found" and blows you out of the navigation software. It's tricky to find your way back through the confusing menu interface (menu->maps) when this happens - especially in a big city that's strange to you. This "undocumented feature", until it is corrected by software or firmware upgrade, keeps this from being a "thumbs up" feature.(5) CONCLUSIONSIf this camera had a touchscreen to speed up navigation, I'd rate it much higher. The interface does not seem to be highly customizable, but I've downloaded a more friendly interface for a charge. I don't love this version of the Symbian operating system as presented on this phone--it seems "clunky" with non-intuitive menus. In short, if you are coming from another operating system, there is a steep learning curve. The lack of a QWERTY keyboard similarly frustrates ease of text messaging or data entry, but can be overcome if you are willing to spend $100 more for an excellent Nokia Bluetooth folding keyboard. I'm not sure exactly what demographic Nokia was targeting this.This smartphone is quite capable of being a telephone (excellent reception and voice quality), and being an MP3 and video player, and a very good camera. Lack of an acceptable keypad for text messaging and email and lack of a touchscreen, and a clumsy text entry system keep it from being an acceptable PDA replacement, regardless of the software bells and whistles. Yet, it seems to me that for the price, it should be more.
I own this phone and it is wonderful. I even dropped it in water and not a little water a lot of water and it is now still working perfectly. I love this phone. I have all my kids pictures on here and they are very good quality. This is a great phone.
I've own this phone now for 4 months and it is terrific. Very fast internet access via 3G or Wi-Fi. The screen and camera quality is absolutely stunning (5MP Carl Zeiss Optics). Plenty of storage 16GB internal and up to 8GB microsd slot. Radio, music player, outstanding media features. The only bad is the key pad, flat and small. Takes some getting use to.
Wow, there is so much to say about this new little phone! Nokia did a great job! I previously have been using an HTC Advantage x7500, so I am accustomed to having some serious gear with me. The Nokia N96 is more convenient to carry around, and is packed with features!The video looks great on the screen! It seems small at first, but it looks great! The quality is beautiful! The phone supports MP4 and 3GP video, and will not play many other formats, so you will have to convert things either with the video manager that comes with it, or another program. I tried full DVD size videos, and resized videos for the screen, and both play fine, and look great! I was worried it would choke on the larger file.Amazon's Unbox video on demand works great with this phone, and the quality is beautiful! There is a trick, though. When you plug in the phone to your computer with the USB, it should ask how you want it to connect. Select "Media Transfer" for it to show up, and be patient. Unbox scans your phone for video files, which can take a bit. Otherwise, the portable videos hop right over with no problem, and play great! They will, however, be protected, and the phone respects that, and therefore will not play the Amazon Unbox videos on your TV with the provided cable. However, Unbox makes adding videos to your new phone a snap!Video quality is very high for a cell phone! I was amazed with the camera! The video and pictures look great! I do have to say though, it suffers in low light situations, giving you a grainy image. For a cell phone, that isn't bad. And how often do you find yourself in a situation where you could whip out your cell phone, take a full video, and then play it on your friend's TV with the included video adapter cables? In addition to that, if you have an X-Box 360 or other UPnP video player, you can share your N96's video, pictures, and music right over a wireless network!I liked the feel of this phone. It has good weight to it for it's size, and feels very durable. I did not have to worry that harm would befall the N96 while in my pocket at work. The buttons have a good feel, and tactile response. The headphone jack is a standard 3.5 mm jack, and is NOT recessed, so you can plug a standard pair of headphones in! It also comes with an in-line remote control too!Battery life is great! I was constantly transferring data over cell, wifi, and gps while playing videos, music, and everything I could do, and it lasted me over 10 hours before it finally quit after doing some GPS tracking and playing music in my car at the same time for over half an hour. This phone is a trooper!The Sync program was awesome! Synced with Outlook (Office 2003) really well! That was a relief when it came to transferring my calendar items, contacts, and to-do lists over. Made migration to the N96 a breeze!Unfourtunately, there are a few things that were not quite perfect. Nothing too bad, but a little annoyances. The USB connector is proprietary. The wall outlet charger has a very thin feeling chord. The screen and buttons are glossy, and collect finger prints. I have had it lock up a couple times. It is quite possible it was due to the phone being in my pocket, with the key pad unlocked, but it happened. I had to pull the battery out to restart it. Also, the software that came with it seems to have troubles on my Windows Vista 64-Bit computer. It runs slow at times. Not sure if it was crashing, or just scanning the phone really hard, but I killed the programs when that happened. It may have been my computer not agreeing with it too. Also, when the battery runs out, the phone makes a "peep" sound, and flashes a message really quick right before the phone shuts off. I would have liked a "battery running low" warning, so I could prepare for it to die.There is no QWERTY keyboard. However, the "Predictive Text" works really great for me, so it is not that bad. I write full e-mails on this phone (previously being a keyboard-only kind of guy). I kind of miss a touch-screen for browsing web pages, and a scroll wheel would have been nice, but it works just the same.One thing I find that might be helpful is to remember is that this phone is geared towards video functionality. Taking pictures & video, playing video, displaying on TV, and everything else.  The phone functions are all there. Voice recognition, and some detailed settings on handling calls too!If you want a cell phone that doubles as a GPS device, plays music, and videos on the go, you will want this phone. The Nokia N96 is great! 16 GB storage, 5 MP camera, and lots of fun!I did test this phone on T-Mobile service, and it worked great for me, so that is a bonus! I love the freedom of SIM card based phones!
GPS with maps from all the world. 5MPx camera with DVD quality video. 24GB (16GB memory + 8GB memory card) with all my music and photos and videos with me. WiFi and HSDPA. really great!
i search for the price all over and i find the best price on amazon
Its ok but my phone the clock can`t set i don`t know y it doing that it that long too load up. i just don`t knoww
99% of cell phone users want a cell phone that works. N96 has a plethora of useless features and "wizards" that don't work but only frustrate the user. 90% of these addons do NOTHING for us. See below.For instance: after a week of reading all the manuals and online help, I've yet to get the GPS to work in ANY way. I am a techno nerd, a scientist and I embrace high-technology. So when I fail at a FEATURED function of this phone, I know that Nokia did not intend for it to actually work.I've had numerous Nokia phones and most-recently a Sony-Eriksson, and a Sangsung SGH-G608. All have had a nice PC suite that enabled copying of addresses from SIM to phone or mass media, synching with PC, etc. It was also easy to make such transfers without a PC.N96 does not allow simple management of CONTACTS; thus, it fails the most basic function of a phone, something my home portable phones on landline perform easily. It seems obvious that a user should be able to copy and backup contacts among Phone, SIM, mass storage, and PC. But apparently Nokia hasn't thought of that.The N96 does not seem to allow transfer of CONTACTS from SIM to phone, or to my PC. Thus, requiring manual entering of individual contacts. Most, if not all other phones accept contacts from a SIM.I bought one N96 from Amazon for myself to test before I would buy four more for friends overseas. In spite of the slick package, we really need a functional international phone. The Samsung GH608 is superior in all regards, though it doesn't have GPS (moot because the N96 GPS doesn't work). Thus, I'm thinking, eBay for the N96 and iPhone as a possible replacement.The PURPOSE of N96 is to get the user to game and surf online. Pure and simple. The PURPOSE of the N96 is NOT to easily place phone calls, manage contacts and calls. So... if you want to do anything like actually use a cellphone, do NOT get taken in by the N96 hype.
I am glad I bought this phone. I fell in love with it since I got it out of the box.PROS:* Slim design, executive look* Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional (great improvement)* AGPS. 100% accurate when you choose My Location. Associated with  google maps is an A+. (Why pay for something that is already part of the  phone...That goes for you VERIZON!!!!).* Opera Browser works great (sorry Internet Explorer)* Touchscreen is very responsive (if you do not want screen to vibrate,  you can disable it in SETTINGS.* Stylus, I do not use it. my fingers do the job excellent.* Push E-Mail. I get all my emails from work, POP accounts, Gmail, (which  is already integrated in the phone), and of course windows live  messenger.* Video player is very good, good resolution, great audio. (One thing  I dicovered today is that I can listen to Internet radio, WOW!!)* My 5 Faves...NOT REALLY, but keep reading, (in this case 4 faves, yes, one of the widgets lets you add 4  people you call the most just like my five faves.) I am using my Omnia  with T-mobile and this came very handy.)* Microsoft Office, YES! you have Excel, Word, Power Point. All 3 are  mobile version, you can read and edit any documents as you wish. you  also can read .pdf files, isn't that something?? you will love this  phone.CONS:* I personaly, don't have any negative comments on this phone, but I will  mention one that I know bothers some people out there, that is:  NO 3G Network compatibility in the USA. This phone was made exclusively  for Asia and Europe and their 3G works on a different band.  But I tell  you one thing, Internet over EDGE is very good, so I really don't care  at all about 3G speed. So keep this in mind....NO 3G in the USA.Over All, this is a great phone. you will have to take your time to play with it to find all its features and how to make them work for you. Don't get frustrated if you don't get it to work the way you want the first time. It took me a good week to figure this phone out and now I am very excited I chose this phone. Iphone is a thing of the past, which I never had but my friends have it and some of them are not too happy with it, plus, they got stuck in a contract. Here you don't have to do that.Thank you SAMSUNG for this phone.I have include this link called Omnia i900 - The Whole Nine YardsThis will make you take a final decision to get this phone or not.Hope it helps, like it helped me to get this phone[...]Thanks! and let me know what you think.
The Samsung Omnia is a major disappointment.  Let's go over all the things this phone does wrong.1) Touchscreen - There is only vibration feedback when using the keyboard.  You'll find yourself repeatedly tapping a command before the phone finally recognizes your finger press.  The touch keypad is nothing close to the Iphone and impossible to use without the stylus.  It registers on keypress (not release) so typos are a common occurance.2) Slow - Throughout the day I have to run task manager and kill unwanted processes to keep my phone from dragging.  I visit task manager between two and three times a day because this phone can't run at a good pace with more than 4-5 programs running3) Stylus - THERE IS NO INTERNAL STORAGE FOR THE STYLUS!  You have to loop it through a tiny slide bar and let the stylus dangle.  It makes it look like you have eyeliner hanging from your phone.  I've received multiple comments from people at work. (It's very noticeable.)4) Widgets - Terrible.... It's easy to clutter your phone front screen with them and none of the widgets are truly functional except the calendar and Opera shortcuts.  The alert widget is the worst.  You can't set alerts for just one of your email accounts, meaning you'll constantly receive alerts (in the same widget) if you have multiple email / text accounts.5) Visual Voicemail - You have to pay $3 extra a month for this feature.... Ridiculous.6)  Internal Antenna placement - I have dropped more phone calls because of the placement of the antenna on the phone!  The antenna is located on the bottom of the phone and not the top!  So if you hold your omnia like a normal cell phone,  the palm of your hand covers the antenna, instantly dropping your cell phone coverage in half (usually 2-3 bars).  The only way I've made quality calls on the OMNIA is with a handsfree device or via speakerphone with the butt of the phone facing the sky.7) Web Browsing - Comes with Opera and IE.  IE works for "mobile sites". Opera tries to render actual web pages and does a poor job of it.  The omnia doesn't have internal memory dedicated to video / graphics so when you zoom in/out, the phone pauses before it re-renders the page.  It made browsing a chore and painful.The plus sides of the phone.1) Light - barely feel it in your pocket2) Internal memory - 8gb internal memory is a plus3) Camera - 5 megapixel camera takes great picturesIn closing, do not buy this phone, you'll be deeply disappointed.  The positive reviews must not have been reviewed by people that have used other smartphones.  This is by far the worst smartphone I've owned.  It's so bad I've switched back to my Motorola Q....
The phone has a few issues with the plasma screen if the sun is around the screen can't be seen. The signal is kind of weak but that could be a regional problem. The touch screen is not that great you have to use the pointer stick to sometimes use the icons. Your finger can't sometimes work on the screen. The phone is great but in time it will upgrade with better features.
I have no need for the bells and whistles that often overburden most "hip" phones today.  I need an inexpensive phone that is small, lightweight, has a simple contact manager, gets decent reception in the Chicagoland area, and has decent battery life.  I got this, and more, in the Kyocera TNT phone with Virgin Mobile prepaid service, and it only costs me approximately $6.70 per month - Nice!The TNT has a nice sized screen, with good contrast for use in bright or dark environments.  The earpiece and conference speaker are easily configured, whisper quiet or loud enough to hear while driving.  The external screen is clear enough that I can see who's calling, at a glance.  The extra features like the text and voice memos, calendar scheduler, multiple alarm clocks, world clock, calculator and so-on are welcome additions, since they're easy to use.  SMS text messaging is quick and simple with the very responsive keypad and Tegic T9 "easy input" option, even when wearing riding gloves. There were plenty of after-market cases that fit the phone like a glove.  Voice dial worked, though I don't regularly use it because the regular contact list, with "frequent listing" turned on, works great.  It can be charged with the included charger, inexpensive after-market chargers, or micro-USB cable (I haven't attempted data transfer yet, via bitpim, but I may try eventually).  With a good signal, I can go days in standby without recharging.Sound quality is fair-to-good - a step above the VM Switch Back, Aloha, K10, Shorty, and Party Animal, and equal to the Slice, Flare, and Wild Card (all the VM phones I have owned or used).  The default ringtones are very sparse, and none too enjoyable, but I don't mind.  As my primary carry phone for 3 months now, it has held up well to the rigors of my job. The center hinge feels more rugged than many more expensive flip phones, and the rubberized-feel finish enables a good grip with gloves on.All in all, a very good spartan phone, for pragmatic users who happen to be in an area with good coverage (check their webpage).  Would also make a good inexpensive emergency or backup phone in a glove compartment, suitcase, backpack or purse.UPDATE:  I have tried, but have been unable to access any data on the phone via the MicroUSB port.  It appears they have locked out any access, which is common for pay-as-you-go service providers.  There are reports of some people being able to work around the lock, but I didn't feel following suit.  Regardless, I still find this to be an excellent phone for my needs.March 2010 Update:  I've had this same phone for almost 1 and a half years, and it's still working very well for me.  A few months back, I lost a few lines of pixels on the outside screen.  It must have happened, when I jumped down from a decent height, with the phone in my pocket.  That aside, all other functions are great, and the phone isn't showing much sign of wear.  Battery life is about 2/3rds it was when new, which is pretty good, considering the age of the phone.  I still recommend this phone, for an inexpensive utilitarian phone.
Very lightweight and easy to use; similar to the VM Marbl phone but slightly more advanced. Cool outer soft shell almost feels like a cover. Very basic phone but for under $20 its definately worth it if you don't want a contract. When inserting the battery the back cover is very hard to remove it almost feels like it will break when you pry it off.
Overall good product.  Very lightweight and love the soft feeling the outside of the phone has.  The back cover is very tricky to get off.
i like the color of the phone, overall it is a good phone for prepaid
Warning! I am NOT a techie. I am just your average everyday technology-using non-...uhm, techie. So what you'll get here is just a superficial review based on my observations. Ask me what certain programs are for, your guess would be as good as mine. :) So here goes...Exterior - Don't judge a book by its cover for sure! The Samsung Omnia has a very simplified, sleek look. Just three buttons on the front: accept call, end call, and for navigation.The Touch Screen - The screen is adequate. The touch screen sensitivity is fine, although sometimes you need to tap two or three times. But then again, being the phone is new I suddenly find myself with a very light touch.The Keypad - Portrait-oriented, the keys are narrower even for my small fingers. But I typed 'the quick brown fox...' sentence with only 3 errors. Landscape-oriented, the keys are much much better.Battery Life - This is the only area with which I had a big problem. I researched a lot about this phone but somehow I missed out on this one important factor. It turns out this phone's battery can only last an average of 5.8 hours. I charged it one whole day and the next day I had to recharge it twice again, and after 3 hours it died on me. This is NOT good. So I looked up ways of saving battery life and hit on this - [...] The topic is about HTC Diamond, but the advice works on Omnia. Right now I'm up to 75% charged after 1.5 hours. Believe me, I'd rather have that than charging it for a full day. I'm still researching for other tips on saving power. :)Wi-fi - Since this is an unlocked international phone, I don't get the advantage of 3G network here in the US. But with the battery life issue, that's okay with me to just use the internet while I'm at home using wi-fi. This might seem very discouraging to some, so you can always avail of the Omnia from Verizon. It can access their 3G network.Text Messaging - I'm a text fanatic. I give Omnia 100%! The only thing I don't know how to work out yet (or this might not even be possible) is how to make the messages in my inbox just reflect the sender's name in the front-view of the folder instead of a snippet of the message. I don't know, I just feel uncomfortable with seeing snippets of messages at a glance. :)Camera - Really really nice!!! 5mp with auto-focus, flash, smile-focus, image editing, and a lot more. :DVideo - Pretty decent for a phone.Synching the Phone to PC - Really haven't figured this out yet. I popped in the CD and followed the steps but I think I missed something since after synching it, my phone alerted me its memory was low. I checked my media storage--I had downloaded almost every file in my computer from pictures to music to videos! That's a looot of memory! I had to hard-reset my phone to erase everything. Good thing I only had it for 1 day at that time. :)That's it for now. Will be updating if I have any more info to share. :)
unfortunately does not meet my expectations, as its menu is very complicated, nothing friendly. The battery lasts for absolutely nothing not even 24 hours, making only 2 calls during the day, also is heated too much, so much so that I almost burn your hand. I am sorry for samsung thought that the phone could overcome the past, but what I question. pass it on to my language is another problem, as well as this $ 45 cheaper. by what I see in January cost $ 300.Camera excellent, good sound, excellent audio quality to talk.
i have bought lots of items form amazon ,this is the first time i am unhappy with this purchase.the main reason i bought this phone is for the wifi feature and this where it failes me, my wife has a nokia n 95 and that works so so well, i am so disapointed in samsung.
The phone I received was in fact the ME770, which LG seems to think never existed. The phone was from Mexico, which I can tell based on the fact that the whole thing was set up for the major Mexican carrier MovieTel with the browser launch menu button being the Spanish word Emocion. Another thing is that despite what the review states and what other reviews have mentioned, this phone DOES NOT HAVE SPEAKER PHONE as stated in the description.I decided to keep the phone even though this was the case. Here's why.This phone is replacing my Motorola L6 phone. The ME770 is basically an upgrade of everything I loved about the L6 except the lack of speakerphone of course.The good: 2mp camera is decent but slow. Still, colors are adequate and flash is ok. Has Edge browser capabilities. Nice screen for the price. TINY size, which I personally. The metal case feels nice in the hand, and is very attractive. Very good reception.The bad: Again, No Speaker Phone. Unlike my old L6 the glass of this phone will scratch easily. Did not come with usb data cable. Uses priority LG adapter for charging and data.This phone is great for people who want a small attractive but capable phone for not much money.
I have had this phone for 3 days now and love it. I just sold my Nokia N95 8GB as I no longer needed a phone that does everything. I wanted something much slimmer with less features. I spent days going through the unlocked phones here. I was worried as I read the review of it actually being the international version. So I called Amazon first and the guy I talked to made it more confusing. I made the purchase anyway and the one I received was the US version, ME770. It did not come with USB cable but whatever. The phone looks great. Very easy to use. It is small but texting is no problem. I am a slim 37 year old and my fingers fit fine. I found all the WAP settings here: [...]Camera is nothing special but even the Nokia I had with the 5 mb was ok. Its a simple nice looking phone that does the job. Its less than 1/2" thin!
this phone is just alright for me. unfortunately my service provider, at&t; will not allow me to use the full functions of the phone. the phone is small, thin, and light. very good on pocket space. what i did not like was the fact that the ring and voice volume was extrmely low. if you work or play in loud areas you will not hear this phone. i also did not like the choice of ring tones which come with the phone. no plain rings just techno-ish beats. not for me.
I bought this phone as a B-Day present for my wife and am in the process of setting it up for her. As stated by "mnerd'" in his review this is indeed not the US version and is from the Spanish Carrier Movistar. I like the look and feel of the phone so far and I think my wife will too. Only time will tell if works out and if I can get the mobile browser or emocion as it's called on this handset to work. If I don't I am not too worried as my wife does not have a data contract. I can confirm though that it does work with the ATT/Cingular network for calls.
I bought the LG ME770 and I was impressed for it's looks and size (small candy type phone). I should have to say that the USB cable was not included like it said in the phone's description. The micro SD slot is difficult and delicate to operate and you have to extract the battery everytime to insert the external memory. Should be careful with this. Ah!! there's no speaker phone for atending and make calls.
First off, Amazon needs to correct the model of this phone it is the LG KE770 and not ME770 as advertised.So glad that's cleared up. Appearance wise the phone is beautiful nice shiny metal effect. In terms of functionality:-1. camera pictures are a bit grainy, ihave seen better with 2 mega pixels2. Number buttons are too close texting is a nightmare3. can only PC sinc with USB cable4. No 3G , no Wireless LAN ConnectivityOverall a good stylish phone, if you like to show off your phone to your friends this is the one for you. However if you're like me and would appreciate some kinda reliable functionality don't waste your money.
Great phone and great customer service from Amazon. I lost this phone during shipment and Amazon were kind enough to replace it. Thank you Amazon! God bless.
Phone is nice in appearance but it stopped working two weeks after i started using it. Refund procedures is in process.I addition, no USB cable was included in the package as advertised.
I barely ad the phone for a month and my left arrow button fell off.  Nowhere to be found.  That kinda sucks.
The description said there was a USB cable included but I didn't get one.  Nor is there a place that I can see to connect the USB cable.  It's a good phone but I dinged it for the inaccurate description.
I got this phone today and i really do like it.The one thing i like most about this phone is it talks when you dial the number. i would recommend it as a buy, and give it a 5 star rating
The Product is very good. The Product is a good buy for the cost i paid i think its worth a penny.
I love my new Treo Pro. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and already plan to hold on to it for the long haul. Little, history, I have had the Origional Treo, 200, 600,  and 650. This is the best of them all.  I swtiched two windows mobile 2 years ago because... well the PALM OS is dead in my book. That aside, I really missed the treo. I think palm gets how to build a nice device.Keyboard: Works great. I find for a thumb keyboard and now with some experience I can fly with it. Personally, I love the thumb keyboard. Perfect for one handed operation with little compromise.Thin: This thing fits very nicely into the pocket and the screen guard is excellent. I dont even know I have it with me and I never accidently Dial anyone. It fits in the hand wonderfully.Buttons.. Some devices are going away from having so many buttons. However I like the ability to launch frequent programs. The Pro is great at letting you customize. (You have many hardware buttons and some of them can also be configured to have an Option + Hardware button application bound to them)Also, you have hardware button access to volume control and wifi.GPS: Works great. I installed and worked right away.Power: this device is not a power pig. With normal use I get a good run off it. Mind you, I use applications on it all day along and SMS extensively.Camera: I havent used it. Frankly, it doesnt matter how many mega pixels any phone has, it still just a phone camera. Quality is never that good. But it is good enough for those fun quick shots.Dislikes: well, the screen is a standard windows mobile device screen. I was hoping for a new device, especially manufactured by HTC it would have a bit more kick to it. However, its very functional and does what I want. One thing I love is how they built into the keyboard access to the brightness control. This is something all devices should have. Its really hard to increase the brightness if you can read the screen. No problem with the treo.The ALT key on the keyboard allows you to access characters not on the keyboard, including accented letters for various languages. What I dont like is that its a little window that shows up with about 8 characters show and you scroll to see more. Well there are a lot of characters, it would be better if they just filled the screen so you can quickly find the special character you want.Windows Mobile Phone Dialer stinks! This is true in my opinion for any windows mobile device. Its a phone, but you have to navigate often 2 to 3 screens deep just to get a phone number. For example, you start typing someones name and the dialer appears. It instantly starts searching for a name. Great! When you select a name by pressing enter, it pulls up their contact screen. (HUH???) yes, you now get to see more info about them. I just want to DIAL the phone number.  Long story short, for simple dialing its more complicated than it needs to be. Second, the Windows Mobile phone dialer always seems unresponsive and slow. Its a phone... but the phone is slow. it makes no sense. This is not a critisim against the treo, but if this your first Windows Mobile device you will be a bit disappointed with this.My Final gripe is that it uses the Micro USB Cable. I dont know why. All I can say is that about 90% of my small electronic gizmos use Mini usb and now I have a new cable standard to deal with. I am sure there is some value to it, but I dont see it. Yes, the connector is smaller, but the cable is still just as thick and just as long. So why I need a thinner (by maybe a few hair widths) I dont know.If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Click Buy Great device.
I've been using windows mobile phones for the last four years, for work related purposes. When my HTC Excalibur flaked out on me last month, I checked around and waited for this to come out. I've been using it for a few days, but so far I'm extremely happy with the experience.The touchscreen/thumb keyboard combo with no sliding bits or bulky moving parts was the selling point for me. I use email and IM on my phones constantly, it's important that it works and is usable. I'm happy to report that this phone does it well. The built in GPS works (ships with Google Maps loaded, but I generally prefer the Live Search application for Windows Mobile). The touch screen generally improves over the basic smartphone experience, as being able to click a link with the stylus is much nicer than navigating with buttons.As speed and memory goes, so far they've been ample, and it's noticeably snappier than other devices I've used recently. I'm planning to use a MicroSD card to get a bit more space, but I do that with every phone. The camera is decent, but nothing spectacular. I do like the camera software on this phone better than the software on the HTC phones.Very minor features I do like:- Time on screen when the backlight is off.- Hardware switch to silent mode- My Treo link to mobile-friendly information about the device in the start menu- And of course, comes GSM unlocked. No carriers loading or unloading software before you get the device, things work like a charm out of the box.Very minor annoyances:- Everything else uses mini USB to charge, it would have been nice if Palm did too. This uses a proprietary end on a USB cable.- It's glossy, and black, but also very smooth. At times feels very slippery, and opening the case to get to the battery can be a pain.- Camera button is not as responsive as I'd like for starting the camera app. Seems fine for taking pictures.Overall, very high marks :)
I have been a Palm OS user for years, and I finally decided to switch to windows mobile given the beautiful design of the Treo Pro.The phone itself is great and I have no complaints, it is true that the back cover is a little hard to open, the first time, I'm a 7 month pregnant woman and have no problem opening it, once you follow the instructions in the manual and learn the trick it`s fairly easy. The wifi is fast, the design is great, many people complain about the small keyboard, but I find it perfect, maybe my nails and slim fingers help, but I really have no complaints, it is a phone not a keyboard after all.Windows mobile on the other hand, has it`s advantages but in my opinion is way too slow, I`m an engineer used to speed and efficiency and I really miss the fast performance of Palm OS, besides, it takes to many steps to do something you could easily perform in a couple of clicks before.It's taking my mind more time to create the habits to perform basic activities, since they take so many steps, to send a message used to take me 30 seconds, and now 60 or 90, I know 30 seconds may not be much, but it is double what it used to take me, and frankly to much for me.It has given me some small glitches like no rings for a couple of hours, and I have to soft reset it to get the sound back, but nothing major or frequent.If you get the SPB mobile shell software you will miss the palm os less, and get more productivity, this program is definitely a must.I strongly recommend to see the reviews in treonauts to choose software and freeware such as skype, skyfire, opera, etc to enhance the experience.I'm happy with the phone, but I surely wish it was a new version of palm os instead of Winmo.
I bought this treo after my phone and PDA died almost simultaneously. I had avoided a treo mainly due to the smaller screen compared to my Palm Tungsten but needed a device with a keyboard and wasn't interested in RIM products.  I initially bought an iPhone but gave it to my wife due to  1. Poor phone functionality 2. Crippled sms (message forwarding, MMS, file attachment; Apple?) , crippled Bluetooth and lack of a hard keyboard.  I was initially wary of buying  a windows mobile device due to prior poor experience with pocket pc software. I have been pleasantly surprised by this device.1. Speed-very fast overall, the only slowdowns I experience is with notes for some reason. I've accumulated 100's of them over the yrs but this is no excuse as my 7 yr old palm could speed through them2. Call quality is crystal clear much better than the iPhone's in my area.3. Bluetooth-this phone is compatible with Audi's car kit and the voice quality is stellar. Palm's site states it does not download contacts to the car but it did download some of them in my case. All the BT protocols of a 21st century device are supported unlike the iPhone's 20th century implementation.4. "Proper" GPs-not that iphone wannabe gps. Quick signal locks and 1 month free trial of TeleNav turn-by-turn is nice. I've heard TomTom's software works pretty well with this device.5.Battery life is so so, with email downloading in the background it will last about 2 business days. With a lot of websurfing it will barely last the day. I would say it's better than the iphone, not by much though.6. Touchscreen-finger friendly, I only use my stylus to write ink notes or use Epocrates.WM 6.1 although it looks ugly compared to the iPhone OS, is a true multitasking OS, actually feels like a portable computer. I can wait for a satellite lock loading, go to another program and return  back to the GPS as it finishes.7. Form factor- love the size,  overall dimensions are nice and its quite thin, great job on the design. Keyboard key material is fine for me a Treo newbie.Overall this phone is a keeper, the combination of hard keyboard and touchscreen is great, while the addition of some apps (SPB, skyfire, kinomaplay to name a few) make it a truly superb device.
after several weeks of researching, comparing, & then waiting for its release, i was very pleased to purchase the Palm Treo Pro. this was my first smartphone & i wanted something that fit well in my hand & also had a lot of practical features. i think that i got both in the Palm Treo Pro.design: it's design is very (dare i say it) fashion forward. unlike previous Treo's, its got a much slimmer profile & fits very well in either a pants or shirt pocket. i like the qwerty keyboard & the directional "palm" key works really well for moving from one field to another. i also really like that i can use the keyboard, the stylus, or even my fingertips to use the different programs & features of the device.setup: the setup process was actually not bad at all. once i inserted my SIM card, the phone recognized the settings of my current service provider & integrated all of the network settings seamlessly w/o any issues. it comes with a decent amount of memory on the phone when you purchase it & can be upgraded to as much as 32GB of memory using micro SD.i have found only one issue thus far. after using the device for around 3 wks i'v already broken a stylus. the styli are mostly metal with a plastic head & tip. the connection between the plastic head & metal stylus is the only thing i would suggest Palm redesigns.  otherwise, i LOVE the device..
I've been a Windows Mobile phone user for years now. Before buying this phone, I tried a Nokia E71 and then an HP Ipaq 910.  Both phones were not bad, but still lacking in many areas and just not worth their price tag.  This Treo Pro is worth every dime.Pros:- Very slim and light form factor.  I said "wow" the minute I opened the box.- Windows Mobile runs lots and lots of software.  Syncing with Windows PCs or Exchange servers is a breeze.- 320x320 display is bright and crisp.- Palm has added so many extras to the base Windows Mobile 6.1 platform, it's hard to list them all.  There is a nice screen saver when the phone is off, showing you the time and if you have any messages or missed calls.  Even though the backlight is off, the screen is still quite easy to read for this basic info.  Also, if you push the red "End" button from the home screen, the phone locks the keys and goes to sleep.  Why is this not a standard WM feature?  I can't tell you how many times I wish there was a simple keylock feature.  Turn the phone back on, and you have to hit the middle button in the 5-way pad to unlock the keys.- The buttons around the edge of the phone are perfect.  There's a power button, simple slider control for vibrate mode, a wi-fi button which flips on the wi-fi (holding it in lets you see available networks), volume control, and one more customizable button.  I sort of wish there were a wheel or scroller thingy that lets you zip up and down screens with a lot of text, but oh well.  There's also a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.  On the down side, the USB connector for syncing and charging seems to be a proprietary Palm connector.  I can't seem to find a generic USB cable to match it.- The built-in GPS works great with Google maps.  Sometimes it will pick up a GPS signal in seconds (holding the phone parallel to the ground seems to help).  The built-in GPS in the HP Ipaq 910, by contrast, often took several minutes to lock onto a signal.- The keyboard is small but quite usable after a while.- The Treo is like lightening compared to other Windows Mobile devices I have had.  Previously, I had a Cingular 8525 which had a 400mhz processor.  That device was often sluggish when turning on or moving between applications.  This Treo is also listed as having a 400mhz processor, but somehow it feels twice as fast as the 8525.  It performs like Windows Mobile *should* perform.- The battery life is amazing for a Windows Mobile phone.  I accidentally left my charger at work on Friday, but managed to make it all through 'til Monday with a few phone calls, using the GPS a bit, plus some internet access.  On my previous Cingular 8525, the battery would have been dead at the end of one day of that much use.Cons:- Yeah, the keyboard is small.- Built-in camera could have a higher resolution.  However, it is better than other 2mp digital camera phones I have used.  Also, no flash - not that those little LED flashes really do much anyways.  Indoor pics are pretty weak in medium lighting.- The built-in Windows Media player doesn't have an equalizer or any type of tweaker.  It's the 21st century for heaven's sake.  This is not really Palm's fault since it's a Microsoft program, but until there is a killer media player for Windows Mobile, it will not be a true competitor of iPhone.- The display is locked into sort of a "large fonts" mode which will stretch some older Windows Mobile applications all out of whack. This also effectively does not utilize the beautiful screen to its maximum.  However, you can use smaller fonts in IE and that makes web pages look good.- The battery cover is a little tricky to remove.  Once you've done it a few times, you get the hang of it. Unfortunately, the micro SD slot is under there.Summary:If you like Windows Mobile, this is truly fantastic device.  I just hope it's not too late for Palm.  If you're on the fence about moving to Windows Mobile from something other than an iPhone, you'll probably like this device a lot.  If you have an iPhone, keep it, there's no reasoning with you anyway. ;)
I have used Palm devices for years (since the first model), and I liked the Palm OS, even developed on it briefly a few years back.  Beyond the phone function, I use my Treo for business.  I don't buy every new model that is released, valuing dependability and familiarity over novelty.  I hesitated before upgrading my old Palm 650 which has been a real workhorse for the last three years, because I have never been a big fan of the Windows Mobile platform.  The choice was between the Palm Treo Pro and an iPhone.  The idea of typing on a touchscreen warned me off of the iPhone, and I like the feel of the Treo Pro keypad, an improvement over the 650 certainly, so I made the right choice in that regard.  The interface issues I had with the out-of-the-box Treo Pro WM have been ameliorated by installation of the SPB suite (thanks to Eimy A. R. Villamil for the tip below).Overall, a solid, sleek, well engineered (aside from the cover removal issue noted by the one-star review, which is more difficult than it should be) unit from which I expect to get several years of service.
Great phone this is an upgrade from my previous Treo 650. The screen is incredible it features a 320-by-320-pixel screen, larger battery, and thinner overall profile. The keys of the QWERTY keyboard keep the same arrangement of the Centro line has, but there is more spacing between the keys which prevent a miss typing. The back of the device is almost as attractive as the front in its own unique way. The centered camera lens and a large silver Palm logo are the only standouts on the otherwise smooth and shinny backside.Pros:WM6: Love it if you are a power business user sync with exchange and office apps, Excel, Powerpoint, outlook and word are installed.3G: depends on the carrier to get advantage of this.GPS: Google maps installed free of uses but requires Internet connection. Telenav is great, only 30 days trial.MicroSDHC: Support Up to 32GB!!!Wifi: Great receptionDesign: SleekSpeed: normally WM6 devices tends to lag, but the Treo Pro is really fast compare to HTC with WM6 installedCons:Battery Life: could be betterBattery Cover: removing the covver is a pain.Screen Size: c'mon palm get rid of that tiny square screenMemory: only 256MB (100MB user and 128MB RAM program memory)This is an all around great device I already brought two mine and another one for my brother in law after playing a while with the device he felt in love with it. With FM receiver and more installed storage memory could be the king of the hill.
The promoted performance of this 'phone has been prejudiced by what is evidently a defective battery with which it was supplied. It requires recharging every two to three hours each day with the minimal amount of phone usage only.I have avoided downloads of internet, music, photos etc. to prevent the need for more frequent recharges. The instrument holds an unusually high tempreture at all times. I wonder if a replacement battery will solve the problem and reduce the heat factor.Needless to say, I'm most disappointed with the purchase. What can you do to remedy the situation?Sincerely,Patrick L. Taylor Tel #1-330-238-4547
Hola a todos mis amigos del mundo.Desde hace unos 5 años he sido un fanático de Palm y de su segmento smartphones TREO, y definitivamente este modelo Treo Pro ha sido la mejor invención de esta marca. por mucho le lleva por delante al famoso "iPhone" y también a los "súper ejecutivos" BlackBerry, que para cualqueir ade estos dos casos necesitas tener o una mano mas o dos dedos extras en cada mano.Definitivamente ha sido Treo Pro, mucho mas de lo que esperabamos ls fanáticos de su marca. Solo estamos esperando que el software en español salga ya al mundo y seguro mejorará en algo el manejo, aunque no es necesario por ahora.Hasta la proxima amigos.
I have been using this phone now for quite awhile.  To say it's not a capable phone, much less a PDA, camera or anything else would be an understatement.  I don't know how much the other reviewers are getting paid to shill for Palm, but nobody can pay me enough to whitewash how profoundly horrible this phone is.  It's severely underpowered and does not adequately perform.  If you use a hands free headset (which is very important because this phone puts out more RF radiation than almost every other phone on the market and if there is any evidence cell phones cause tumors, it will be this line), it still doesn't work half the time.  I have used at least five versions of the Palm series of phones, mainly because I have a need to use certain Palm-based applications, otherwise I would not subject myself to this form of punishment.I cannot tell you how many times I've had my home phone forwarded to my cell and heard the tell-tale ring of my home phone indicating a call was to be forwarded to my cell, only to never have it ring.  This phone's reception, it's functionality, it's performance and everything is substandard.  Just say no.
Phone is great........needs more talk-time....higher processor speed ....more memory and an FM radio to be the King Of The Hill!
windows mobile is exelent but the palm get freeze every two  hours if you talk you can not type notes becouse the phone get freeze It should have a better procesor and more ram memory better buy os operating system palm hardware is not ready for windows mobile
I have been a very loyal palm treo user for years.  So I was really excited when I first heard about the Treo Pro.  Pre-ordered it.  When it arrived, I could not get the back cover off.  Asked my big strong husband.  Asked my big strong kids.  No go.  Had to return it.  I hope next version puts some skids on the back cover to solve this problem.  Oh well. I'm now waiting for the Blackberry Storm to come out.
The following review is for the XDA Serra, O2's UK version of the HTC Touch Pro (also known as the Raphael, T Mobile MDA Vario IV, AT&T; Fuze and Sprint Touch Pro).This is my third O2 XDA model. I`d previously used the XDA Mini S (aka HTC Wizard). I'd grown fond of the XDA Mini S but recall that the phone was a dog until O2 issued a major ROM upgrade about 6 months after its release.In looking for a replacement for the XDA Mini S, I had the following criteria in mind;* 3G (HSDPA) capable* Good touch screen quality* Single-handed operation* Decent QWERTY keyboard - for me a must-have* Preferably Windows Mobile 6.1 based (I'm wedded to a number of Windows Mobile applications including Outlook & Excel mobile, Ilium eWallet, Memory Map and Tom Tom Navigator)* Good camera quality a nice-to-have but not paramount* Available on an O2 UK Tariff (I wasn't prepared to pay a SIM-free price).Candidates included the HTC Touch Pro, Sony Xperia X1, Nokia E71 and Samsung Omnia i900. I must confess to a (possibly irrational) antipathy to all things Apple so didn't consider the iPhone 3G, though I have no doubt that the iPhone is probably more user-friendly. It's the proprietary lock-ins with Apple that get me. The HTC Touch Pro is categorically not an "iPhone killer" (though the newer HTC Touch HD may well be).The truth is, all of HTC's smartphone offerings have been exercises in managed expectation. They promise so much on paper but so often fail to deliver in terms of practicality. I often wonder if the professional reviewers who rave about HTC phones have actually used them in anger or are simply beguiled by the impressive specifications.The Touch Pro is, along with the Touch HD, by far the best phone HTC have ever produced, but it is not without its flaws. I will admit that in the first few days of having received the XDA Serra I found the Touch Flo interface and GPS performance so frustrating that I seriously considered returning it to O2, but having persevered for a fortnight or so I am now much happier. So far, this is how the pros and cons stack up for me:Pros:1. Size, form factor and build quality.2. Excellent screen resolution (640x480) and quality. Visibility in sunshine is very good.3. Excellent slide out keyboard - far and away the best available.4. Excellent phone sound quality.5. Good 3G (HSDPA), Bluetooth and FM Radio performance.6. Touch Flo interface makes single-handed operation feasible but the gestures take some getting used to. Helps to have small fingers.7. Accepts up to 16GB microSD SDHC cards (though the need to remove the back cover to insert the memory card is seen by some as a disadvantage - personally I prefer it this way)8. Magnetic stylus is less likely to drop out and get lost.9. Uses standard mini USB connector for sync and charge.10. Can charge from PC USB connection.11. As with all Windows Mobile devices, syncing with PC via Activesync is very easy.12. Huge variety of freeware and shareware available for the Windows Mobile platform, including some alternatives to the Touch Flo interface (mainly still in beta but very promising).13. Teeter game - which uses the phone's built-in G-sensor - is great fun.14. Very chic, for those who care about such things.Cons:1. Very expensive SIM-free.2. "Joystick" functionality on central Navigation button is almost completely unusable and is - in my opinion - a significant design flaw.3. Endurance with standard 1340mAh battery not great (especially if all radio options are enabled) but probably no worse than other phones in this class. Higher capacity (but bulkier) 1800mAh battery packs are available. I personally haven't found battery life to be an issue.4. 3.2MP autofocus camera is a big improvement over earlier HTC models but is outclassed by the latest Sony, Nokia and Samsung camera phones. The LED camera flash is barely adequate in low light. If you're looking for a digital compact camera replacement this is not the phone for you.5. Flaky Wi-Fi - needs to be set to `maximum performance' (at the expense of battery life) to get decent reception.6. Built-in GPS is very temperamental. Initial lock can take anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes, though once lock is acquired, performance is OK in open ground. Urban reception is poor and the Assisted GPS function (which is disabled by default on the XDA Serra) doesn't appear to improve matters significantly. There are some performance enhancing tweaks recommended on various HTC forums, but the phone will never be a match for a dedicated handheld SiRF GPS and I imagine many people will find the internal GPS unusable in practice.Note that you can always use an external Bluetooth GPS adapter such as the excellent Emtac BTGPS II or the one provided with some versions of Tom Tom Navigator.7. Touch Flo interface a bit sluggish at times, but can be improved with some registry tweaking (Google the XDA Developers Forum). People who are happy to use a stylus will probably wish to disable the Touch Flo interface altogether.8. Touch Flo interface cannot be customised, at least not without registry hacks.9. Pressure needed for some touch screen gestures means a screen protector is advisable (one is provided in the box).10. No built in headphone socket - needs special USB-to-jack adapter (a handy remote-control adapter with a standard 3.5mm jack is provided in the box).11. Cannot sync/charge and use headphone adapter at the same time using the adapter provided, though it is possible to buy third party adapters for around £20 which do allow this.12. Some relatively minor stability issues - expect to have to perform a soft-reset at least once a month.I expect many of these issues will improve with the next ROM upgrade, though I have my doubts about the internal GPS.Another reviewer has reported problems with accidental call answering. In fairness this is a hazard with many touch screen phones (I used to find this incredibly annoying with the XDA Mini S) but can generally be easily resolved by installing a freeware screen lock utility. I've found SU2U 1.35 (Slide To Unlock) works very well on the Touch Pro.If you like Windows Mobile and need a slide-out keyboard, this is undoubtedly the best phone on the market. If you don't need the keyboard, you might want to consider the HTC Touch HD (which has recently tipped the Nokia E71 off the top of PC Pro's smartphone A-List).
I bought two of these cells to replace T-Mobile's Shadow phone, which while it had great options, ate batteries to the point that we never used them. The Motorola set up for us with no problems. We inserted our sim cards and we were good to go.  We've had the phones for about 3 months now and have had no problems. A charged battery lasts sometimes up to 4 days. Texting is easy and the screen and keypad work well for people who need glasses. It goes online easily and quickly and games download with no problems.  Maybe we've been lucky, but so far this phone has out performed the Shadow hands down!
I have had several Razrs over the past 5 years and still stay w/ it because of the features and ease of use.  Even w/ so many new phones that have come out I would pick the Razr again and agian...
I bought this phone and only used it for about two weeks when the screen went white. The phone rings but you still can't use the screen. As this phone did not have a warranty I now have to buy another phone or pay to have it fixed.
wont ever buy electronic this way (purchased directly through Amazon, not a reseller).  phone did arrive on time, but has started falling apart within a month.It came without warranty, so there is no recourse.I have no interest in doing business again with crooks.
What a lovely phone.  What do you do with it?  Who supports triband phones in US?
If you're looking for a simple phone and cheap. A phone which performs the basic functions easily, that's your phone. If you look for something a little bit fancy you can take a pass at it. If you don't mind using a thick cell phone, it shouldn't bother you, that's a thick one. If you like slim phone forget it.I was looking for a cheap and solid phone to replace my Motorolla Razor, and this one made the trick well. The keys are not very comfortable but we get used to them.
I bought this product from "Dr. Cell Phone" because my 80 year-old father wanted the same phone he'd had before (with large keys).  Nothing on the Amazon site hinted that the phone was used, but it is clearly used and, I hope, refurbished.  If I could easily return it, I would, but the logistics (2 other family members; 3 cities) are just too complex.  BUYER BEWARE.
I've been using Blackberries since a blackberry was thought to be something you would find in a muffin. The 8800 was the one I was using until I was given the Bold and, up until then, I thought of it as the best Blackberry ever. Then, the Bold came and it is probably safe to state that the Bold is now the last and the best classic Blackberry ever because the Storm, lacking a physical keyboard, probably deserves its own class.When the Bold and the 8800 are placed next to each other, what's striking is the similarities between the 2. The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away. The Bold, with its high resolution screen and the same solid, functional build is a good tool, now with more 'fun' stuff (camera, video playing) added to it.
Yep, I love it.  So far I am totally impressed. I love checking out the newest PDAs, and this is certainly the best yet.First, the SCREEN.  Absolutely amazing.  I'm always looking over my shoulder because it can be read from like a mile away!  It's much bigger than it looks in the photos, and you can set the font as big as you want.Second, the KEYBOARD.  Soft, bouncy, easy to use.  Next best thing to an actual computer keyboard, I swear.  I am partial to PDAs with onboard keyboards, and I'm really picky about them.  I wouldn't buy the 8800 because I didn't like the keyboard, and the one on the Tilt drove me crazy.  This one's the absolute best.Third, the SOUND QUALITY.  I don't have a home phone, and the reception in my house sucks -- not anymore! When I'm on the phone, this sounds like a land line, and the people on the other end of the call say the sound is great.  3G reception is an improvement, at least where I live.Web browsing is greatly improved over the Curve, and YouTube can be viewed pretty well.  I am finding the Web accessing and viewing to be fairly good and often can substitute the Bold for my laptop.  It's a bigger PDA, so if you like the size of the Curve, you may want to wait for the Javelin.  It is not terribly heavier, and it's still slim, but it IS bigger (which I happen to like - I found the Curve a bit delicate-looking).And then, of course, all the other great things about owning a BlackBerry. This is a great machine.  All pros and cons of all PDAs I've checked out (and there have been many!) considered, this is the best.  A powerhouse.I have found no software glitches or needs to reboot.  I've had the phone for about 10 days now.
Great phone...However with a snag or two. Name recognition suddenly stops working and you have to remove battery so that it starts working again. I had the BB 8300 and it was flawless. The software was just real solid. RIM should have something soon to fix the software snags.I love all the bells and whistles (Add-ons) it comes with, you can download themes that make it look just like an iPhone, but obviously with BB functionality. A must buy.
Awesome phone this is best phone i ever had, it has it all it's like a laptop in hand...
This phone is amazing! Juzer at TriStar is an awesome rep to work with. Totally beats my iPhone 3G.Screen is totally gorgeous. Keys are no different than my 8320, very easy to get used to. 3G signal is kind of flaky, but I read on forums that it'll be fixed in the new firmware. UMA works like a charm, and the phone is FAST!Anyways, thanks for everything Juzer.Shaundra G.

The phone was unlocked from O2 Network, so that is why the keys are switched. Other thoughts: its fast, its beautiful, its a bit big, but I love it, so I really don't care about that.'Activation from my network was done un about 2 hours and everything is working perfectly.
I HAVE A NEW IN BOX AT&T; BLACK BERRY BOLD NEVER USE STAY IN BOX PHONE COME WITH EVERYTHING IN THE BOX YOU NAME ITI NEED TO GET MY TEXT BOOK ASAPCOME WITHPHONEBATTERYCHARGERMANUELCDCASEAND ETC
I knew this was going to happen. Research In Motion (the makers of the BlackBerry series of smart phones) finally made a product that didn't live up to my expectations.I'll tell you more in detail below, but first a bit of history: At my 9-to-5 job it is one of my roles to manage a BlackBerry server and 50-odd BlackBerry phones, so I've used every model of BlackBerry available in the US for the most part in some capacity or another.Currently, I have a Verizon BlackBerry Curve at the office. My current home cell phone is an iPhone 3G. I asked our corporate Verizon representative to send me a demo of the Storm, because I've had a lot of BlackBerry users at work asking me when we were getting them (due to the media saturation of the commercials and the general coolness factor of how the phone looks). So I felt it was my duty to get one in for review so I could make an educated decision about recommending this thing to upper management and other people who may be interested in it.A lot has been said about this phone in reviews by other technology journalists on the web (David Pogue of the New York Times for instance, and Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal), some positive, some negative. I used the phone for a solid 4 days of testing and one software upgrade (to try to fix an issue, more later on that) before deciding to write this.I'll go over some key items about the phone in a few sections, the stuff that's important to me as a consumer. Things that have been in BlackBerry OS forever (such as push email, calendar sync, etc) are really not that noteworthy to me, and I won't talk much about those. I can, and will compare this phone to the iPhone 3G though, simply because RIM was definitely aiming right at Apple when designing this, I have no doubts about that.Phone DesignThe BlackBerry Storm is a slick looking phone -- which elicits the expected reaction from nearly everyone you show it to. It is very heavy feeling, about the same weight as the iPhone 3G. I would say it feels solid, but then you press down on the touchscreen itself (since it is one large button), and it wobbles and leaks light in from behind the screen. It is not the most comfortable phone to hold, but then again I don't think the iPhone wins in that category, either. Both of them could benefit from the rubberized grip of the BlackBerry Curve (or other phones that actually seem like they're designed to be held).Underneath the black aluminum battery cover (yes, unlike the iPhone the battery can be removed - score 1 for RIM), there is a removable 8GB MicroSDHC card, which is a great thing for them to provide. The last generation of BlackBerry phones (The Curve and Pearl) include a MicroSD card slot, but they didn't give you a card with the phones. 8GB is more than enough for a decent amount of media and pictures. It also included a Verizon SIM card (which I think is a placeholder, since Verizon doesn't sell GSM phone service). I've been told that this can be unlocked just as easily as other BlackBerry phones so you can roam the world with it easily (this is another thing the iPhone 3G requires hacking to do.)RIM abandoned the standard Mini USB port they've used for several years for a new "Micro" USB port for charging and connecting the phone to the computer. This means all your old BlackBerry chargers and any wired peripherals won't work with the new phone. This is kind of a letdown for me as a BlackBerry administrator, simply because we have dozens of perfectly good spare BlackBerry car and home chargers that are now useless if we move to the Storm.The ScreenThe screen is one of the better things this phone has to offer. It has a 3.25', 480×360 pixel screen, with very easy to read text and a very bright backlight, with a nice glossy sheen to it. I really have no gripes whatsoever with the actual screen in this phone by itself, if I don't take into account the way or manner information is displayed on it or it's "click" function. It is better than the iPhone's screen in both clarity, size, and general readability.The AccelerometerThis is the first BlackBerry with an accelerometer in the device. Again, another thing I believe RIM decided to copy from the iPhone (even though the iPhone is not the first device to use something like this, it's the first one to do it right in my opinion.) I found the sensor had major lag issues (even after a software update to the 4.7.0.75 leaked firmware!) with moving from portrait to landscape. Sometimes it took up to 4 seconds for the phone to change back from landscape to portrait with nothing else going on. This is simply unacceptable. It would inadvertently switch screen orientation at random times when it wasn't necessary to do so, and it confused all the users I gave the phone to. The final straw with the accelerometer is for some reason RIM believes that if you have your phone locked, it should still change orientation from portrait to landscape. I honestly can't figure out why I'd want my phone sitting there in my pocket switching orientation when it's locked and not being used. I hope they fix this in a software update.The KeyboardThe screen being covered in its literal sense, I'll discuss the biggest part of what makes the Storm the Storm: The keyboard and its role in the UI. RIM decided in the BlackBerry Storm's development to eschew the traditional BlackBerry keyboard for two different "touch" keyboards. These both are familiar to older users of BlackBerry phones: The "SureType" style in the 7100 series and Pearl (2 letters per key), active while in Portrait orientation, or the QWERTY style (full keyboard), like in the Curve, 8700, and 8800 series, which is active in landscape orientation.However, the old keyboard layouts work completely differently in the Storm -- because they are now part of the touch screen and are activated by "clicking" in the entire screen while your finger is over the corresponding button. The screen acts as one giant button that you press in with every letter press, icon click, or menu selection.I've found typing for any period of time becomes tiresome after only a minute or so, and it seems like way too much work even to just send off a small text message. The auto-correction software (SureType) seems like it isn't as effective as it was in the BlackBerry Curve, and sometimes the phone simply types letters that I didn't press, even though it looks like I'm pressing the right one due to the blue "halo" around my finger as I hover over the letters.The keyboard isn't completely missing. There are still 4 physical buttons on the front of the phone, which include the typical SEND and END keys, the "Menu" key, and the "Back" key, both of those last two are holdovers from previous BlackBerry incarnations. I'm kind of surprised they couldn't find some way to integrate these into the touch screen.If this review was trying to convince me to buy this phone, this keyboard would be the deal breaker. I can't stand it. People who might peck one or two characters every 5 seconds might not care about how bad this is, but for me, it was infuriating to use it. I can type on my BlackBerry Curve at approximately 30 words a minute. The iPhone 3G? maybe 20-25. This was much, much less than that. I'm extremely disappointed; one of the huge advantages of BlackBerry was their highly efficient keyboard and the "Pearl" (or scroll wheel in the older generations), and that speed and fluidity is completely obliterated with a keyboard UI that just doesn't work. I had several non-techie users at my office try to type on it who were BlackBerry users, and they either typed incredibly slow or were just confused by the new keyboard.The Touch Screen, And It's Role In The User InterfaceIn general, the touch screen functions are a good effort for a phone if you ignore one thing: the existence of iPhone. Apple clearly invested much, much more time into usability and interface design here than RIM did. A few things about the iPhone that you don't notice you miss until you use the Storm are the ability to quickly "flick" through lists of items, multi-touch capabilities like pinch gesturing, double-tapping to zoom smoothly into/out of web pages, and smooth scrolling through websites. All of these things are not something the Storm does well (or at all in some cases), and I'm sure I'm missing a lot more here. Maybe its related to patent issues, but the touch screen in the Storm just seems dumber than the iPhone touch screen. That's about all I can say about it.Research In Motion has not paid enough attention to the menu UI in regards to making it easy for people to "click" on menu items, either. They are too small for even my (not that large) fingers to consistently press in properly. Making calls from the old UI was simple: Start dialing from the home screen. Now you have to press the SEND button to get to the call area, or click on the call log, which wasn't immediately apparent to any veteran BlackBerry user I showed it to.The AppsAs of right now, there's really little that is new or interesting about the applications bundled with the Storm. VZ Navigator is included, which is a turn-by-turn GPS application that has a lot of good Points of Interest and other neat features. Unfortunately Verizon charges $10/mo for this feature, which is really not worth paying a monthly fee for. There's not a good turn-by-turn GPS on the iPhone right now, but if it cost $10/mo extra, I wouldn't buy it anyway.Refinements to BlackBerry OS 4.7 to make it look very pretty are great, but those were done in OS 4.6 already for the BlackBerry Bold (a far superior phone for people who might actually want to type out an email!). BlackBerry even created some sort of half-baked version of Apple's App Store, but it simply forwards you to web pages to download applications. Not even close, RIM.The development happening for iPhone right now is astounding. I'd be surprised if the Storm gets this level of interest, considering there's already a huge glut of years worth of BlackBerry applications that still work on the Storm. There are a lot of great BlackBerry apps (A shining example is BeeJiveIM, which is also on iPhone), so it's not all bad but it really doesn't compare to some of the great stuff on the iPhone right now.On a positive note, applications on the Storm (or any other BlackBerry) can run in the background, which is one thing about the iPhone that is a frustrating design choice apple made that they play off as a feature to save battery life.The Web BrowserOne of the biggest changes in the 4.7 BlackBerry OS for the Storm is the web browser. The web browser definitely benefits from the much higher screen resolution on this phone, and actually renders real pages in a very readable way. Verizon's network is extremely fast (but not WiFi fast). The browser simply isn't up to the level of Mobile Safari on the iPhone/iPod Touch, though. The gestures that are in the iPhone for web browsing are light-years ahead in terms of ease of use than in the BlackBerry browser. This version is a marked improvement over the BlackBerry OS 4.5 browser, though.The NetworkAs the commercials state, Verizon's data network is the fastest out there. Their voice coverage is arguably the best in the nation. The phone does not have Wi-Fi, though, which comes in handy when you're somewhere that doesn't have Verizon's extremely fast Rev. A EVDO. This is the first BlackBerry on Verizon that supports tethering for internet on Rev. A EVDO, the prior ones only supported Rev. 0 (the slower EVDO speed).Generally speaking, sites and downloads came through very quickly in my tests in my metro area. The phone supports both CDMA (Verizon) network, and GSM networks with a SIM (worldwide with an unlock which is something very easy to do on the BlackBerry and not something you can do on the iPhone without hacks.) This is one of the major advantages of having this phone on Verizon, their network is great. You pay for it, though.CameraIt's not all bad news. The camera is 3.2 megapixels, with an auto-focus feature. At this point this is the best camera I have ever used in a cell phone. As a disclaimer I must mention I haven't used the Nokia N95, which has a 5 megapixel camera in it, or the new N97. The auto-focus feature is main reason I like this camera. Being able to focus on close items (e.g. a piece of paper) and still have the text on the page be sharp is a huge bonus; this is something you simply can't do with the iPhone 3G's camera. The camera's lag time for the shutter and taking photos is brutally slow, especially in low light. The iPhone 3G's camera has similar issues, though.Battery LifeThe battery life on the Storm seemed to be pretty decent; I don't have any scientific estimates on how long it lasts under light or heavy use. One of my gripes with the iPhone 3G is you can easily drain the battery to nearly nothing within 3 hours if you use it heavily. I didn't have anything worth using heavily on my Storm to really drain it, so I'm not a totally fair judge of this, but it seemed that the Storm's battery life is quite decent, and probably better than the iPhone 3G for general use.Additionally, having a removable battery is a very nice feature... albeit one I don't really care much about, since I generally have some type of charger near me, whether it's in a car, my desk at work, or an outlet at home.General Impressions / In ClosingSo, you're wondering after reading this, do I recommend the BlackBerry Storm to anyone?My short answer: No.My longer answer: The phone isn't refined enough. It lags doing simple things like orienting the screen and scrolling through the icons (even after their first firmware update), and needs more attention paid to the UI.For consumers on Verizon who won't leave (either due to loyalty or the other carriers not having good signal in your area), or corporate customers on Verizon: I'd say to either get a BlackBerry Pearl or Curve, or better yet, wait for Verizon to get the BlackBerry Bold (probably sometime in 2009). You don't want this touch screen. Skip it. I haven't personally reviewed the Bold yet, but it seems like it's inherited all the best UI features from the Storm and a great input interface to use them with.For consumers who want a cool phone right now and don't care about what carrier it's on: Get the iPhone 3G. Right now, overall, it is truly the best smart phone for the largest swath of consumers out there. Its flaws are overcome by an amazing development scene and a very well done user interface.
6-22-2009 foreword:I'm going to make this foreword short and sweet, after trying my friends iPhone 3Gs it just blows away my Storm, the little advantages I once had with the Storm (copy and paste, movie mode etc.) are now mostly gone and between that and the much better software execution on the iPhone I am now suggesting that you get an iPhone if you don't care what carrier you use.  For those of us with Verizon I hear our iPhone is on the way next year.For those of you still interested in my journey over the past half year with a Storm compared to the older iPhone or if you still really want a Storm read on.If you have to have a Blackberry but you love playing movies, songs and showing photos this is the one. If you need to type out hundreds of e-mails a week with one hand typing and one driving you need the more traditional Blackberries.5-2-2009 Screen Clarity update:The screen on my Storm continues to impress! Did you take some photos you really want to show off?  Photos of the family, or say photos of  Hugh Jackman and the cast of X-Men Origins: Wolverine  at the World  Premiere.  You will always have them with you on your storm and they will look very impressive indeed.  Click this link to see photos I'm showing off on my storm [...]4-3-2009 Battery update:I've noticed lately after several months use that my Storm's battery is luck to make it through the work day now.  Not sure if it's the way I have charged the battery or it's already losing it's power to hold a charge.Introduction:My old Verizon XV6700 was giving out and I needed a new phone.I borrowed my friend's iPhone and played with it and loved it.  But then I found out Verizon Wireless does not allow me to use an iPhone.  And then my friend told me about the dismal coverage and dropped calls using AT&T; so I decided to go with something that Verizon has.Review:My first thoughts were what a slick looking phone.  The Storm fit well in my hand and my pocket and the screen looked amazing: sharp, bright and great contrast.  The local Verizon Wireless store copied all my contact info over from my XV6700 and I was on my way.I loved the fact that I could open the back and replace the battery; memory card and SIM card myself.My second thoughts were what a slow phone.  It got faster after a while and you might not notice it if and this is a big IF you had not just played with an iPhone.  But turning the camera from portrait to landscape mode is not even close to the speed and smoothness of my friend's iPhone.  In fact none of the menus are as smooth and fast as the iPhone.Multimedia Experience:Now this is where the Storm really rains all over the iPhone's parade.  The screen is much brighter and sharper then the iPhone.  So much so that you can actually see every detail of a photo and watch a video outside in direct sunlight.  My friends iPhone was pretty dim in direct sunlight.  The speaker phone just blows away the iPhone, it's no contest not even close.  Both phones take headphones and both sounded good listening to music through the headphones.  I really like the fact that I can download TV shows and video to the Storm right on to the video card without using iTunes.  But if you want you can sync your iTunes to the Storm just like the iPhone.  You can also import playlists from iTunes or create your own right on the phone.Desktop Software:Blackberry Desktop ManagerThe initial software I got with the phone Blackberry desktop manager was very buggy both on the work computer (Windows XP) and my home computer (Mac OS-X Tiger).  Surprisingly the Windows XP version was the most problematic.  At least after loading the desktop manager on my Mac and working with Blackberry phone support I was eventually able to setup and transfer iTunes songs, my address book etc to my storm from my Mac.  I still haven't been able to get my Windows XP to do a correct sync.V CAST Music with Rhapsody:I'm sorry this software is just junk!  Don't bother loading this hard to use featureless software on your computer use the Blackberry Desktop Manager and iTunes instead.Storm VS. iPhone:PhoneStorm wins (Storm has great call clarity with no dropped calls and really loud speakers.  No matter where in our work buildings I went I could always place and receive calls with the Storm.  The iPhone at times had no reception deep inside the buildings and when using the external speakers the Storm was the clear and loud leader.  Both had good features for looking up contacts adding photos to contacts and controlling incoming and outgoing calls.  Also lots of ring tone options and features etc. are available for both with the Storm being able to add ring tones by simply saving files to the correct folder on the memory card.ScreenStorm hands down winner! (Brighter, sharper, clearer, more contrast)MenusiPhone hands down winner! (Intuitive to learn screen selections, smooth, refined graphics, slick transitions)TypingUpdated 12-3-2008iPhone hands down winner (with just a little practice on my friends iPhone I was typing away pretty confidently with little fatigue)  My Storm on the other hand took a lot of practice and I'm still pretty slow.  And the click to choose has inconsistent pressure with items clicked in corners harder to push then in the center which takes some getting used to as well.  Also, there is no cursor guide scroll button / device.  Which means when you want to select a different area of text you just typed on your Storm it's a frustrating thing.  My old VX6700 allowed you to tab through areas and select text with precision.  Before buying you may want to stop at a Verizon store and try typing for yourself just to be sure you like it.  I can see it being good enough for causal users but not good enough for the average business person.Storm Typing Tips:I learned if you place your finger over the area and highlighted it first then press until the screen clicks you are more likely to get the right letter or number.  Also make sure your finger is actually over the middle of the number or letter.  I had an initial tendency to get the letter below to  the right instead of the one I wanted.Copy and Paste:Storm hands down winner (Storm has it, iPhone does not)SpeedUpdated 12-06-08The iPhone is still the winner after software update 4.7.0.75 but the Storm is now MUCH faster then it used to be.  The iPhone still seems like an extension of your brain but the Storm is almost as fast now.  And after the update the Storm no longer just sits there when rotating the phone from portrait to landscape mode like it used to.  Now it usually rotates in less then a second.Speaker PhoneStorm hands down winner! (Blows away the iPhone)MusicTieSize:Tie both are close enough in size the iPhone a little longer but thinner.  The Storm a little heaver and thicker.BatteryStorm hands down winner!  (You can buy an extra battery to take along to swap out and it lasts a little longer).  And as a bonus it charges really fast!12-07-08 UpdateMade a two hour call last night on the Storm including looking up several contacts and looking around on the camera for almost half that time during the call.  I only used 1 battery bar up during that time!!  I had 4 bars left on the battery meter after the call!  I'm very impressed my old VX6700 would have been DEAD after a two hour call.MemoryStorm hands down winner!  (Again just like the battery you can buy your own memory cards and swap them out on the fly and even upgrade on the fly from the 8GB it came with to 16GB)Service Provider:Storm hands down winner (No comparison between the coverage and abilities of Verizon Wireless and AT&T.;Camera:Storm hands down winner (the photos look better and it does video as well, the iPhone does not do videos).12-07-08 UpdatedThe Storm takes the best quality photos for a phone I have ever seen.  With that said I must at least mention that like all other camera phones I have tried taking a photo with it is a slow process indeed both in getting the camera to appear on screen and in getting the camera to actually take the photo after you have pushed the shutter button.  You will not want to try and take any action photos with it.  And yes the quality is better then other phones but no its still not as good as a regular camera.WiFi:iPhone hands down winner (the iPhone has it, the Storm does not)Navigation:I'm going to give this one to the iPhone even though they don't have the coverage area that Verizon has.  It's much easier to navigate and there are nice little features on the iPhone like the ability to put a push pin on your map and have the phone give you the address then navigate you there.  Plus you can use standard map or topographical on the iPhone.  If the Storm has this capability I couldn't find it.  Plus the iPhone could be setup and actually navigating before the Storm even got to the Navigation screen.Computer integration:iPhone hands down winner!!  (No one is slicker then Apple at integrating a perhipials with their computers, it's not even close).Storm VS Verizon VX6700The Storm wins hands down in all areas save for a couple so I will keep this short and sweet.The Verizon VX6700 has WiFiThe Verizon VX6700 integrates well with Windows allowing you to plug in to your Windows based computer and automatically sync your Outlook Calendar and address book.  The Software for the Storm  is very problematic at this point and I never successfully synced on my Windows XP computer at work.  I'm hoping a new software update will fix this in the future.  Other then these two items one of which will probably be fixed soon I don't miss my old VX6700 at all.Surprises:I wasn't expecting a bedside alarm clock as I had never seen any commercial  showing one but it's pretty cool and I found out both the Storm and the iPhone have it.  When you plug your Storm into the electrical power charger cord it automatically goes into a night mode with a large bedside clock.  You can set an alarm to wake you and can even change it between different formats like digital or analog and even and old style flip clock if you have a longing for some nostalgia.E-mail is so cool on this phone.  I can have up to 10 e-mails on this phone and the way it sets up is so cool.  You can setup on your home computer then no matter where you are all of your e-mails automatically get pushed out to your phone with an alert. No longer do I have to request the e-mails like on my old VX6700 phone.Also the Blackberry support person I talked to waited on the phone patiently for the over 2 hour period it took to try and troubleshoot my Windows computer and get the sync working.  He gave me a lot of cool Blackberry tips while we were waiting between re-boots of the WIndows XP.Verdict:I like it and will keep it.  You should probably try both the iPhone and Storm before you buy and check your coverage area.Updates:In the coming weeks I will come back and update my experiences with the Storm.  I'm hoping that software updates will speed up the screen response time.  And after some tips from the Blackberry support line I'm doing much better and really starting to love my phone er I mean Blackberry.11-26-2008 Update:Verizon sent me this text message update about a Verizon Blackberry Storm interactive training guide on the Internet.  In just playing the introduction I found out the Storm has a neat pause un-pause feature button on the top right opposite of the screen lock button that I didn't even know was there.  VERY COOL.  I suggest that you go through every level of training as you never know what little thing you might find.  It's located at [...]11-27-2008 Update:It's Thanksgiving and I have time to play.  I setup my speed dials which is very easy to do I found out.  Just click on the call button and when the dialing menu comes up hold down a number until the add a speed dial menu comes up asking if you want to add a number!  Pretty cool.And found out you can hold down the menu button then press the screen to get a switch apps menu.Starting to really love this phone now.  I think if you are coming from a Blackberry already then you really have an advantage knowing about the menu and escape buttons which are an integrated part of the menu system but I wasn't aware of when I first got the phone.Also found out you can make home made ring tones by using the voice notes function.  It's so funny you can record your friend saying "Hey, its me pickup" or something else funny then assign that recording as their ring tone and every time they call you get to hear them before they even pickup.  Also assigned some of my iTunes songs as individual ring tones and a Led Zeppelin song as my default ring tone.12-1-2008 Update:Am a little frustrated lately.  The Storm really is slow to operate for a minute or two after removing from the charger.  Got a call from my sister and tried to answer with it plugged in like I used to do with my VX6700 phone but the Storm would not respond so I unplugged it from the charger and still would not pickup.  By the time it started responding again she had already left a long detailed message on my voice mail and I had to call her back.Thought this was a fluke when it happened again later in the day in exactly the same long delay.Also found out when my Storm is plugged into the charger it is VERY slow to operate almost unusable.  Good thing the battery life is really good.Bottom line on charging, if you are expecting an important call do NOT charge your Storm and expect it to pickup like in normal operation.Also, found out that when you get a call you had better have your Storm unlocked.  My old VX6700 could be locked and one button would work, the green call button to pickup an incoming call.  My Storm if locked will not allow you to receive a call either using the on-screen green call button or the main button on the phone.  Hopefully this will be fixed in a software update. Bottom line on this one, hit unlock before you attempt to answer.Still like the Storm and will keep it.  It's got let's see... character yeah that's it character, kind of like the old Dodge 340 Six Pack T/A Challenger I used to own.  Great performance when acting right but not so good when it doesn't.12-3-2008 Update:Storm getting a little slow, slower then normal.  Try a re-boot, remove the battery for 15 seconds then re-insert.  Usually revives mine back to it's original state.12-5-2008 Update:I'm really starting to get in the groove with my Storm.  Also, I downloaded the latest software yesterday with the Blackberry tech people on the phone. No change in functionality yet after install.  It's still slow and buggy and will update my Address book from my Mac to the Blackberry but not the iTunes songs. I still have to copy them manually which is easy enough to do but frustrating.  It could be that I don't have the latest version of MAC OS-X as I currently have only Tiger OS-X with all the latest patches.  I'm sure that Research In Motion is working on updates at a rapid pace.12-6-2008 Update:Software Upgrade:This morning I got a notice on my Storm of a software upgrade availability of version 4.7.0.75.  I currently have version 4.7.0.65.  So I downloaded 4.7.0.75 and installed the update to my Storm.  In the end it took almost an hour because I didn't know to reboot before I started.My experience:The initial download took several minutes but at least there is a progress bar running across the top along with the MB remaining to download.  And they provided a Pause Download button at the bottom of the download screen should you need it.  Pretty cool.  When the download is complete you have to option of Upgrade Now or Schedule Upgrade.  I choose to upgrade now.  If you choose now you get a warning that you may not be able to use your Storm for up to two hours then it starts a verifying the upgrade then it gave me a message upgrade requires additional memory. Removing older data.  Then I got an error message to delete 780 kb of personal data even though I had 4.6 GB of room available on my Sandisk.  I guess it only uses the main memory on the Storm to do the upgrade.  So I called Verizon support and they suggested a reboot by removing the battery for 10 seconds which I did.  Then the update started running with two progress bars: 1  Over all backup progress.  2.  Current database messages and an elapsed time window at the bottom.  Total elapsed time shown was 1:34 seconds.  Now the phone started an auto reboot.  I am now a half hour total into the process however including the support call and reboots.  After the reboot it started saying Patching OS and had a percent bar running across the middle.  Then it said Patching Java with progress bar.  Then it went blank again and then a Linking Java menu came up with progress bar.  Then it went white and a progress bar started across the bottom.  Then another overall progress menu came up.  Then it came up with a setup wizard and I picked close.  Then it asked you to auto or manually chose networks type and I picked auto.Upgrade Results:Total time taken was just under 1 hour so  I'm glad I started with a fully charged battery.Now the phone is much faster in all respects, browsing for photos, watching videos even rotating the phone from portrait to landscape.  It's still not as fast as my friends iPhone but it's much closer then it was before.  So I highly recommend going though the update to 4.7.0.75 just be sure to remove your battery for 10 seconds for a good reboot before starting and you probably won't have the problem I had.12-07-08 UpdateVery impressed after a two hour call last night had only used 1/5th of my battery power (see Battery 12-07-08 update above for more info)  I could see talking for 5 or 6 hours on one charge.  My old VX6700 would have been DEAD after a two hour call.Also updated the camera info above.  The Storm takes better photos then other camera phones but is still very slow to take a photo so don't buy it just to take photos.About those side buttons, I have locked all but the volume control out because I would keep accidently activating them bringing up say the camera by accident when I was trying to surf the web or make a call.  At least they give you the option to lock them out.Visual Voice Mail, what an awesome thing!  Especially if you get a lot of voice mails.  No longer to do you have to dial in and listen to voice commands to access your voice mails.  Once installed simply press the visual voice mail menu button and up comes a complete list of all your voice mails allowing you to listen, reply, call back and delete right on your Storm.  At this time it's a $2.99 a month option.  I recommend for all users that get a lot of voice mails.12-08-2008 Update:I've been messing with re-arranging the menu buttons but I keep accidently moving buttons to places I don't mean to or deleting them or putting them into a folder by accident.  So I'm just going to leave them in the de-fault arrangement.  Thank God there is a default or I would really be lost.12-10-08 Update:Strange thing since the 4.7.0.75 update seems like the Storm is just a little heaver on battery use like maybe 20% or so.  Still it was worth it since it's so much faster.  One other thing I do with for after seeing on the iPhone is the ability to quickly go to the top or bottom of a list or page with my fingers.  On the iPhone the faster you flick upward or downward the faster and further the listed items will scroll. On the Storm there is only one speed.12-12-08 Update:Unlike a lot of other products I have reviewed, the Storm continues to create a controversy.  I haven't seen any other reviews where the 1 stars and the 5 stars are equal.  The Storm truly polarizes consumers.  And I think that's the point, this is not a Blackberry for everyone.  It's for those who want foremost and above all a great multi-media system with typing and business taking more of a secondary role.  If you have to have a Blackberry but you love playing movies, songs, showing photos this is the one.  If you need to type out hundreds of e-mails a week with one hand typing and one driving you need the more traditional Blackberries.12-15-2008 Update:My Storm is still very inconsistent when it comes to rotating correctly at times rotating pretty quickly and at times not, must have a mind of it's own.  On the positive side it also still attracts a lot of attention and accounts for itself pretty well when showing off photos and videos.  Still loving it and will keep it.12-18-2008 Update:The Storm comes with two games one of which is pretty cool called Word Mole.  You are a mole in a yard with all these letters to dig up.  By clicking on each letter the mole digs out a hole where the letter is.  The goal is to try to dig up letters to make as many and as long a words a possible.  Sounds pretty dumb but my daughter and I both are pretty addicted to it.  Look for the games Icon in the menu area.  Gives you practice with your touch screen Storm typing as well.12-19-2008 Update:I'm heading out on our annual Christmas trip tomorrow and won't be back until next year so I won't be doing anymore updates for awhile.  Thought I would answer one more question about Windows Vista.  I really don't know if the Storm can be synced with Windows Vista, I don't have Windows at home only Mac and Ubuntu (a form of Unix).  I never did get it to sync properly with Windows XP.  Hopefully a fix is coming soon.  If anyone knows please feel free to comment.  Happy Holidays everyone!12-31-2008 Update:Well my trip to Texas was pretty much a bust.  I set up the push e-mail so I could access it on the road and in Dublin Texas and Brownwood Texas where I spent most of my time not only did the e-mail push not work but I had no Text Messaging or Internet.  And I ended up having to do a hard re-boot after leaving the area to  get all these items to work again.  Also none of my phones worked at first to even make or receive a call in these areas until after working for Verizon tech support.  No fault of the Storms I guess but it is frustrating non the less.  If your plans call for being in these areas I did notice some people with iPhones that worked perfectly.  The strange and sad thing was everything worked perfectly in the middle of no where between El Paso and Midland where there is absolutely nothing!01-15-2009 Selecting Text Update:I have always had a hard time selecting text on the Storm until I got an e-mail recently explaining how to do it.  See below.  It works really well.This is courtesy of BJ Lewis"When it comes to placing the cursor inside a text field, you do not have to click repeatedly until it's in the right spot or anything as difficult as that. Simply place your finger on the text field, without clicking thescreen for a few seconds without moving it at all. The cursor should change into a black outlined rectangle, at which point you can slide your finger across the text field to move it precisely anywhere you want within the text field."Black Berry Storm tips 2-5-2009:Here are some handy Storm tips and tricks I have learned over the last two months that save me a lot of hassle.  If you just want to read the review please scroll on down to Review:Select and Copy:To select and copy text lightly hold one finger before and one after the text you want.  Once selected click on the Blackberry key and click copy.Access the Keyboard:To access the keyboard quickly swipe a finger upwards from the bottom of the screen towards the middle.  To hide the keyboard swipe quickly downwards from the middle towards the bottom.Number Lock:Ever need to enter a bunch of numbers?  Tired of having to click on the number icon repeatedly?  To use the number lock, go to the onscreen keyboard and hold down the 123 key for 2 or 3 seconds until num lock appears.  The number keypad will stay on until you hit the 123 key again.Zoom in:Double tapZoom out:Tap once on the bottom of the screen and choose the - sign.Control a video:Tap once on bottom of screen.  Tap again to hide menu.Jump between menus:Hold down the Blackberry key until the Alt menu appears swipe left or right to go through entries then place finger on menu you want to jump to and click and hold the selection.Attention Mac users!Your Blackberry Storm comes with free Mac sync software right in the box but you will want to download the latest version from the web instead!I'm seeing comments on here and the workers at the Verizon store told me that my Storm did not come with software that would sync my Storm with my Mac.  This is NOT true!  The PocketMac for Blackberry desktop manager for Mac OS-X is right on the disk that comes with your Storm.  However it is pretty buggy and I had to download the latest version from the Blackberry site to finally make it work on my Mac with OS-X Tiger and help from the Blackberry support line.

If you have been researching this phone you are likely to have come across a lot of negitive reviews comparing it to the iPhone. I must admit that if Verizon had the iPhone I might have chosen it over this (at least until RIM releases a software patch or two). But as it is AT&T; service is horrible, so the iPhone os not an option for me and those who prefer Verizon's service. If you want to stay with Verizon this is a great phone. Let me give a run down of its pros and cons.PROS:-It has great reception (the most important feature seeing as its a phone).-Its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-Decent internet speed, even indoors.-Good MP3 and video playing capabilities, on par with the iPhone I tried.-A great camera as far as phones go. Obviously not a replacement for a stand alone camera, but no phone camera is.-Unlike my old Curve you can use the built in GPS without paying for VZNavigator.-Bright, clear screen that is much better looking than the iPhone I tried.-Sleek look.-Its a Blackberry, previous and current BB users will find a lot of familier features here.-Does not require iTunes, but it supports it if you wish to use it.CONS:-Its slow. It often freezes while doing the simplest things like turning or switching menus. On the bright side this seems like it could be fixed with a software upgrade.-Its a touch screen, which can be a pro or con depending on whether you can get used to a touch screen or not.-Like the iPhone (and any other touchscreen phone), the on screen keyboard can take some getting used to. In this case the SureType feature in particular.-Typicall early adobter syndrom. If you buy this you know that it is likely an improved version will be released in a year or two. Also as of right now accessories are hard to come by along with apps taylored to the Storm (luckely most Blackberry aps work on it). The last two issues will likely dissapear when the stores stock more accessories and the App Store launches next year (along with more 3rd parties supporting the Storm).All in all I'd say if you want a an iPhone, without switching to AT&T; and their lousy service you won't regret getting a Storm. I love it, and its likely to only get better through software updates. As for the price its basically $30 or $45 (depending on whether you need/want corperate e-mail or not) on top of your regular Voice plan charges, as is the case with all Blackberry devices.
This review is based on after installing the .75 update. The phone got a lot faster on the screen rotation. The keyboard really really SUCKS... I think RIM built this phone without thinking people were going to actually use the keyboard.. :).. Great Screen though super sharp when watching a movie... the camera takes an eternity and a half to take a picture. If you press the bottom to snap, you have to keep the phone steady for 5-6 seconds after you snap to get a good picture. The touch screen is a pain period... I found myself constantly "talking" to the phone... "no it's not what I wanted to do"... "no don't start that program"... "no I don't need the keyboard".... The keyboard layout is also not friendly... let's say you had to type an address like 1125 NW 16 ave Miami, FL... well my friend you will be up for a good lesson on patience... the letters one layout of the keyboard, the numbers on another and the commas and questions on another... BAD IDEA!!!!I have seen keyboard that you can just hold a letter for 2 sec and you get the numbers... simple and less messy... On the storm if you hold a letter you get the capitol version... I think it's useless... So to type my little address here 1125 NW 16 ave Miami, FL you would need to be bouncing between 3 keyboard screen layout... did I mention it goes back to the letters after you type each number... unless you lock the numbers but than again you have to unlock to get another letter.
UPDATED 12/15I just so happen to love it.  But that's because I'm open minded about these types of things.  Was the thing overhyped?  Probably.  But so what?  Methinks too many people get their hopes up and expect the world when they should understand by now that NO technology is ever perfect.First of all, to those that wonder if BlackBerry has lost its touch (no pun intended), wonder no more.  Internally this is a BlackBerry, through and through.  The only real distinction between this and other BlackBerries is the screen/navigation, period.  It's still the champion of email and messages; still handles documents, still handles PDFs, still is one of the best all around communication devices there is.  In fact, behind the the pretty interface, the apps are nearly identical to that found on the Curve or Pearl.As you've likely noticed already, this device has been getting either lauded...or blasted...depending on who you talk to.  Some reviewers love it, some hate it.  99% of reviews compare it to iPhone (AT&T;), simply because of the touch screens and accelerometer.  But to be truthfully frank, that's really where the similarities end, and is the background of my review here, as I've not used an iPhone and therefore make no comparisons.  I did own an iPod Touch for about a day (returned it, couldn't stand it), so I'm familiar with some of the touch functionality found there, but ultimately I didn't get the BB for its touch; I got it because it's a BlackBerry.  If you're in the same boat, read on.As I mentioned, this has all of the functionality of the other BlackBerries.  Email on the go is the #1 feature for me and the reason I keep coming back to BlackBerry, and this one is just as good as the others, if not better.  Of notable mention is the new method of navigation on this phone; there's no scroll wheel, no "pearl" to scroll through options.  There are two ways to navigate: touch, and click.  Touch selects an option (referred to as "highlighting"), which click activates it.  This is important, because it means you can't use touch to type.  You have to use click for each key.  Some don't really care for this. Part of that is RIM's fault, because of the way they presented this functionality.  They made it seem as though the screen was some sort of soft press deal that "felt" like keys...when really it's a single dimple pressing a single button to activate whatever option is highlighted.  You can hopefully see where I'm going with this and why I said it that way.Sometimes you'll highlight an option not what you want, thinking you're on something else, and when you click, it will do the option you didn't want.  So for example, you'll be on a menu option attempting to close an application, and it does "Switch Application" instead.  You'll see "Close" clearly highlighted, but it does the other one.  You didn't see where the highlight shifted at the last minute.  It happens.  The reason this happens is due to the user and the adjustment period to getting used to the device.  You really need to take your time and pay attention to what's being selected; it's not like other BlackBerries where you can feel out certain options, or like some users who can select options with their eyes closed because they're just that good at the navigation.  It's just a learning curve, but one that not everyone will tolerate.I had a co-worker ask me what kind of person would enjoy this device.  It's hard to say.  What I know for certain is that if you're not a "gadget head", you probably won't like it.  If you're the kind of person who just needs to make calls this is not the device for you.  That's not to say it's not good at making and receiving calls, because it is...better than most other phones I've had.  It's just that, if that's all you care to do, this phone is overkill.  Same for the Sidekick/LG Voyager/Dare converts; in my opinion, this phone is way overkill.What some have to understand, is that BlackBerries are business phones.  They are designed for the business-minded individuals who need to get stuff done.  Certainly RIM has gone out of its way to "consumerize" the device, but at the end of the day, it's not going to have a stellar, if any, camera.  It's not going to be the ultimate media player.  It's not going to be the ultimate instant messaging machine.  But it will get stuff done efficiently.Another co-worker approached me after having bought the Storm, on the verge of returning it due to multiple frustrations with using the device.  His #1 complaint: too confusing how to figure out how to do everything.  I countered this by explaining that the main difference between iPhone and Storm is that the iPhone wants to hold your hand through the process.  It wants to "teach" you how to use it effectively.  The Storm, on the other hand, is still a BlackBerry at heart.  BlackBerries don't "teach".  They expect you to know how to do the basics already.  This can be considered a shortcoming on RIM's part, but to their credit they do run you through a setup the first time to try and help you learn the basics; quite honestly, you'll only learn by doing it and patiently working with the phone.Another concern people have, and have had since the Pearl, is with SureType, complaining that it's difficult to use.  SureType is actually more intelligent than the regular phone predictive text engines; What some miss, and the reason they get frustrated with it, is that SureType is also attempting to think for you.  There are a lot of things it will do for you without you even realizing it.  Basic things such as punctuation, first letter capitalization, etc. are all done by SureType automatically.  The best way to use SureType: don't think too hard about what's going on the screen; just spell out the words, space, period.  Repeat that, without worrying about what's happening on screen (for the most part).  If you let SureType handle the logic behind the sentence structure, you'll probably find that it's even easier to manage than standard QWERTY, even though QWERTY does some of the same things.  If you think/worry too hard about what SureType is doing, it's guaranteed to give you errors, because you're effectively fighting the engine without even realizing it.Finally, make sure you update your phone to the latest firmware as soon as you get it, as it will resolve a lot of the issues with the screen navigation and accelerometer.  Other than that there isn't really much else I can say.  Either you will like it, or you won't.  The more open-minded you are about the phone, the better the experience.
I'm going to keep this short and sweet, I've been with Verizon for about 10 years now with no complaints. I'm one who has to have the latest in phone technology. My last phone was a Blackberry Pearl, it was great and I loved it. Except it was so small and kind of flimsy. I absolutely love my Blackberry Storm, it has everything I can imagine a phone having. I've had it just a couple of days now and I can hardly stop playing with it, figuring out all the old and new features it has. I didn't have any trouble navigating the main menu because I knew how to since I owned a Blackberry before (which helps). Bottom line, it's by far the greatest phone I've ever had.
The Storm has plenty of potential, but they obviously wanted to get this out the door as soon as they possibly could. Way too many bugs. Typing is a killer as it is always turning the keyboard off seemingly at random. I keep think I'm hitting some secret button to tell the keyboard to go away, but even when I slow my typing way down and carefully check each keystroke, it will suddenly disappear.It has locked up on me a few times requiring battery removal to reboot. You need to hold the phone carefully to keep from accidently hitting a button on the touchscreen with your cheek that may either mute you or switch to speaker phone. Sometimes the speaker phone activates without me touching a thing and then I'll set the phone down on my desk and use it as a speaker phone when it will suddenly go back to handset mode without me even touching it!The camera always delays several seconds before snapping a picture. It's worthless for trying to take any shot where kids/pets/anyone without patience is involved.Yesterday starting out with a full charge the phone was barely discharged by bedtime. Today is a virtually identical day, same usage, same office, etc and by noon the battery is 2/3 drained. Why? I have no idea.The browser is VERY slow, even on a 3G network. Also, several web sites won't work including Netsuite.Finally, hitting the right menu item is very difficult. Even when you are careful to make sure the thing you want is highlighted, the key press will often take you to an adjacent item.The good: Visual voice mail. Very nice.I really wanted this thing to work, but it looks like I'll be taking it back. I may hold out for most of my 30 day return period in the hopes of some magical software update, but I won't be holding my breath.
First of all, I am a gadget-freak and I think that the BB (other than the Storm) is, hands-down, the best phone/email device ever.  Nothing even comes close.  RIM decided to step outside their core competence (not a bad thing) and developed a cool concept, but unfortunately, the execution was incredibly poor.In short, as long as you don't have to type anything, i.e. the interaction is one-way from the device to you (as in browsing), the device is phenomenal.  Browsing and media capabilities are fantastic whereas phone and email capabilities positively suck.The click-screen is a nightmare to use.  It slows you down significantly - you have to wait until you the screen is fully depressed until you can press another key. If you have fat fingers like I do, you will use the backspace key more than any other key.To make a phone call using the other BB devices, you would either type in the name of the person you want to call or simply dial the number. With the Storm, if you want to dial by name, you have to first go to the Address Book (a tab in the phone screen) and then do so using a Pearl-style keyboard. Incredibly frustrating.A good thing that came of my using the Storm for two weeks before I returned it for a Curve is that I found typing to be so freaking frustrating that I simply began responding to emails either in person or by calling the sender.  Another good thing, I found myself not checking or responding to emails while driving. So, I guess there is a silver lining in the Storm cloud.  Yes, cheesy, I know.
I have to say, when I ordered my Storm, I really wanted to love it. I have an Apple iTouch and was used to typing on the Apple iPod keyboard. It was quite easy. I also owned a Blackberry Curve and have used Blackberry devices since my original 850 which looked more like a pager.I liked the look of the iPhone, but most of the people I know that have it don't really like the AT&T; service (at lease in the USA.) So the thought of a iPhone like device on the VerizonWireless network, which I've had great experience with, was welcomed with great anticipation. Unfortunately, the Storm turned out to be a dark storm.I'm not going to detail the lockups and problems with the camera starting when pressing keyboard letters. I know these are software problems and will be fixed as RIM releases software patches. But oh, the keyboard. If it had only had a touch screen like the iPod. I found typing on the iPod vs. the Storm to be like night and day. The iPod is smooth, you get the characters you want when you press the virtual keyboard on the screen.With the Storm, there's no predicting what letter will really appear when you press the keys. And after over a week of practice, I experienced almost no improvement. They keyboard just isn't implemented well. Plus, the keys to the far right and left of they keyboard, near the edge of the Storm, sometimes just won't even register they key press unless you press quite hard. I kept debating, how long should I keep it. But after a week, when spending almost 10 minutes typing an e-mail that could easily have been typed on the Curve in less than a minute, sealed the deal. It was time for the Storm to go back.I will agree with most of the comments in the other reviews. If your need is for multimedia or web browsing, the Storm is a good choice. If you need to type information or e-mails, it is not going to be a good fit. And although Verizon Wireless in my opinion is the better wireless service, if you must get a device, I'd really suggest you consider the iPhone. It will do what the Storm does better than the Storm, and with its superior keyboard, it even does e-mail better than the Storm.
I have had this phone for a few weeks now.  This is my first Blackberry device and also my first touchscreen device.  With that said, I cannot compare this product to other Blackberry devices or other touchscreen devices.Overall I really like this phone.  The email feature and the internet browser work very well.  The internet is fast and easy to use, although sometimes when trying to click on a link or button, it will zoom in first.  The phone is programmed to zoom in when the screen is clicked twice, so if you miss the button or link the first time and try and click on it again, it will zoom in.  However, this has happened only a few times to me and was not a big deal.  I would give the internet and email option 5/5 stars.Typing does take a little getting used to, not for the pressing of the screen but for using a touchscreen in general.  I find I make a lot of typos, but fortunately it usually knows what I am trying to type and instantly replaces my mistakes.  If I don't want the word it selects, I can simply hit the backspace once and it will leave the word exactly as I have typed it.  Typing is a bit slower than I would like, but I am also hoping that as I use the device more, I will get better and more accurate at it.  I give the typing 4/5 stars.The screen is very sharp and clear and responsive to selections.  The surepress technology is nice because you have less of a chance of accidentally selecting the wrong thing and then having to back track.  It also highlights what you are selecting in blue before you actually click on it, so you can know what you are selecting before you push.  I give the screen and this portion of the surepress 5/5 stars.The camera takes pretty good quality photos, but it takes too long to actually take the picture.  The delay between pressing the button and the camera taking the picture is much too slow, especially if you are trying to capture anything with movement.  I was disappointed in this aspect as I was trying to combine my phone and camera into one device for simple pictures.  Cell phones in the US are still no replacement for actual cameras, but I was hoping this one would do a better job.  Hopefully a software update can fix this delay.  The quality is still good though, so I give this feature 3/5 stars.Overall, I have been very pleased with this phone and would recommend it to others who want a touchscreen smartphone and do not do extensive typing on their phones.  Extensive typing is much more efficient on a device with a full button keyboard.  I look forward to seeing what other apps Blackberry comes out with for this device.
I am going to keep this short since I'm about to go to the Verizon store to replace the "Storm" (aptly named) with a Curve.  This phone is a disaster.  Very buggy, which while the bugs can be fixed with upgrades, will never fix the really (for me, at least) difficult to use touchscreen keyboard.  The problem is that it is nearly impossible not to touch a nearby key on the keyboard and that slows one down considerably.  I've tried, I really wanted this phone to be great given all the features, but can't stand it.  Also, if you want to use the keyboard, you have to go to menu, scroll down (should be a top menu choice) and then select "Show keyboard."  That's an annoyance after being used to having a keyboard (a real one) right on the device.  When entering information into a field on a webpage, the keyboard does automatically come up.  But you have to tap exactly into the field data entry box on the page (good luck in doing that; you can magnify the page but then have to demagnify the page to view it after entering your text).  Just too user unfriendly and an enormous missed opportunity by RIM to create something great.
I realize that Blackberry products have been out for awhile now and that experienced users may be less impressed by all the things the Storm can do but as a new user, I can't believe how long I've gone without one.First of all, I've held off getting an iphone for quite awhile now despite having a month to month cell phone plan for awhile because I didn't want to leave the Verizon network (patiently waiting for the Storm).  Despite all its features, a smartphone is a phone first and foremost and a cell phone is only as good as its network.Essentially, I wanted something which held its own against the iphone and yet allow me to stay with Verizon.  Alas, I'm a proud owner of a Blackberry Storm 9530.Now for the Good:Versatility- I can check email, browse the web, read and edit documents (.doc, .xls, .ppt), tether to my laptop for internet connectivity, IM on gchat, etc.Touch Screen- I was nervous about the keyboard because I kept mistyping the demo they had at my local Verizon store.  I went ahead and purchased it anyways and the update seemed to have resolved the issue for me.  I should add tho that the auto-word feature is annoying but at times comical in its stubborn insistence.  The screen is bright, looks great and the keyboard takes some getting used to but works with the update.  I also like the tactile feel of the screen which gives feedback.Voice Dial- No programming required and the voice recognition works well.Battery Life- I can go 2 days without recharging.  I do have my screen brightness setting at 20% but it's still very bright.Cut/Paste- It doesn't work in all case but still very useful and something the iphone doesn't do.Now the Bad:Speed- Or lack thereof.  Almost anything I do on the Storm has a slight delay to it.  Whether it's rotating the screen to the alternate view (portrait and landscape), looking up contacts, dialing numbers- everything is just a tad slower than you would want.  The only time it's become a real annoyance is when I'm fumbling to access the numeric pad while I'm on the phone.The Ugly:Transferring contacts was a pain.  I had to import each contact one by one as a media transfer using bluetooth connection.  For $10, the local Verizon store can sync everything for you but still it shouldn't be this cumbersome.GPS- The BB app is free to use (which apparently hasn't been the case with previous BB's) but is painfully slow.  The maps render way too slowly and I would only use it if I were lost in Siberia.All in all, I think it's a good product.  If you're looking for something which can hold its own against an iphone but want to stay on the Verizon network, it's a solid (probably your only) choice.
After problem after problem with At&t;'s service, I finally cancelled my contract and finally made the move to Verizon. While I am extremly happy with Verizon's service, I'm sorry to say that I will be returning my Storm for the Curve because it just isn't working out for me. Too many kinks and I just dont have time for the sluggishness and the freezing and the lengthy rebooting sessions, not to mention typing on that nightmare of a keyboard. Here's my more specific review..SMS and MMS Messaging: Probably one of the main uses for me and with the storm its a nightmare! Texting on that keyboard takes forever. Not only that but everytime you press a letter it never seems to be the one you were going for and you have to keep erasing and starting over. Sometimes I just give up and throw it down and say I'll just call them! I can't tell you how frustrating this is.Calender: Good, no major problems with that.Browser: Excellent! Fast and easy to use.Media: Ok this is where some of the major snags are. While the picture, video and sound quality are top notch, don't plan on using them too much otherwise it will freeze up, get stuck between screens, or tell you after only 1 video your whole memory is full! And trust me once its frozen, the only way to unfreeze it is by taking the battery out and rebooting the phone takes forever! Really inconvienient. I was so mad..I was at a concert video taping the best part and guess what happened? You guessed it! It froze and lost my whole video. I was pissed to say the least.Instant Messaging: I use aim alot, glad it came with the phone, although if you stay signed into it all day it will drain your battery. Again anything where you have to use that keyboard is a nightmare so that would be my only complaint with the IM feature.Voice Dialing: Awesome! Can't say enough great things about this feature. All you do is press the side soft key and say call "so and so" and you can easily dial anyone from your contacts list without having to pre- record their name.Games: Love em! Especially Word Mole.Email: Awesome! But thats typical for Blackberrys. But once again that keyboard will definitly slow your typing speed and acuracy down alot so if you have a lot to say in a short amount of time use your desktop.Call sound/Quality: Speakerphone is choppy although its nice and loud. Answering the phone can be hard sometimes. On several occasions I've pressed the answer button both on the touch screen and the regular key and both were unresponsive and the phone just kept ringing like I had never answered it and eventually sent the person to voicemail. Another extremly frustrating and inconvienient thing to have to deal with.Battery: Not so hot. Ok if you aren't signed into any web based applications, but still plan on charging a full charge before you leave in everyday.Picture Quality: Excellent! Just as the say it is.Overall:Pros: Picture Quality, Browser, Email, Games, Instant MessagingCons: Keyboard, Sluggish switching from screen to screen, freezes during Media applications, Lenghty Reboot, Answering CallsIn conclusion..I feel that Blackberry should have let this cook in the oven a little longer before releasing it. Don't take advantage of your customers and try to get it out in time for the holiday rush if you know it still has all these glitches. And I'm sorry but Blackberry had to know about these before they released it. I don't believe that they didnt. So for now I'm going to the curve, maybe not so fancy but I've had one before with At&t; and it was more reliable. Can't wait until Verizon gets the Bold, that's the Blackberry I really want!
Pros:Verizon Navigator - works great on this phone. Drove from CO to MN and used it to save money on gas and find restaurants.No problems with reception from CO to MN; my former phone was Verizon too and I saw no change in connection. Internet speed fast in major cities and slow in NE.IM - has several applications and my work uses Yahoo IM and AIM so it was easy to setup and use.E-mail accounts work well and are easy to setup.Can download music easily from iTunes to phone.Phone quality is good and sounds can be set very loud.Cons:Verizon Navigator / Bluetooth to FM radio - uses LOTS of battery power.Keyboard - takes a lot of getting used to (coming from a Treo 700W). It works a lot easier in landscape position.Need to spend a lot of time setting up. If you are new to a PDA allow 30-40 hours. It still took me 20 hours to setup all accounts, settings, sounds, music, load IM software, etc...My boss has the iPhone and really likes it except for the AT&T; coverage. I live in a small town so Verizon is the only option. The phone has a lot of features that still need exploration but so far everything has been amazing and the screen is bright and very detailed.
Ok, I have had this phone for about two weeks now.. its amazing. I do believe this is the true iPhone killer. TO start, its on the Verizon network which is JD Power and Assoc. #1 Rated wireless network over.. AT&T; simply can't compete with the speed, power, coverage, and customer support.As a phone this kills the iPhone again thanks to the amazing call quality, speakerphone, bluetooth support, and the network for lack of dropped calls. to add, bluetooth is stereo supported with excellent sound quality on my Motorola Bluetooth headphones that I listen to music with, and my Cheapie Motorola Bluetooth Headset from my last phones LG Voyager and LG VX8300. This is my first BlackBerry, the trackball always turned me off from them. The touch screen is very sensitive and very smooth, I haven't updated to the newest latest official software update yet. My only complaint is the accelerometer lag, which to me.. isn't a big enough deal to break the love with the phone for me. The included removable and upgradable to 16Gb, 8GB MicroSD card is another sweet deal on top of the 1GB built-in memory.Final-Breakdown:This is the real iPhone killer.. the only real features this phone doesn't have is the wifi.. but most of the people I know with an iPhone, don't use the wifi.. since they generally have data plans. This phone has a 3.2MP camera with video, copy/paste ability, MMS capability, all things that trump the iPod with a phone.. because face it, that's all the iPhone really is.While the iPhone has a slightly more aesthetic value to the O/S.. I will give it that. Its only a matter of time before Bplay and RIM offer manipulations to the GUI for the BB Storm's Theme interface. IN fact there are already clone themes for the blackberry O/S to look like the iPhone, plus many others, soon to be in development for the Storm's version of the O/S.This device screams past my requirements and expectations as a phone, internet/email device, messaging device, and media player. It gets a 10 out of 10 in my book, hands down.
The Storm? is it worth it for the new user?In a nutshell the answer is yes. As a non blackberry user I will say no matter what device I picked up it would take both time and effort to get it both setup - synced and also get used to the interface.The Blackberry platform in general is very business oriented. This is not an issue for me as I have a business lifestyle and multiple email accounts across multiple companies as well as a couple personal ones I like to check daily. Thou I will admit I am somewhat jaded by my IPod Touch I have because my previous Verizon phone really only could be used for calls and not much else - well it supposedly had other features but in general they were all so terrible I just gave up and decided to get the Touch to solve my multimedia needs where as the phone would remain a phone.I went into my purchase of the phone with an open attitude and the knowledge that more than likely I would be in for some hiccups in software as we early adopters should get used too.It all began at 12:01 on the day it was released where I hit the refresh button to find that the Verizon site was broken. (Awesome Start) - Let me clear the air on this issue thou I am not usually a wait in a line or wait up till it releases kind of person - I just happened to be up late and said what the heck I will buy it now... well buy it I did approximately an hour later when the site finally started to offer the unit in their shopping cart. Scheduled for FREE next day delivery I awaited the arrival of the phone.So no phone arrived but I did get a nice follow up email that explained that due to demand (and for what we found out later was a small firmware labeling issue) the phone would be delayed till the 8th. Well the short of it was that Verizon must have burned the midnight oil on the release because it showed up 3 days early on the 5th and now it is up and running. But lets look at setup for a minute because for the new user its, well, less that perfect.So let me save new users some time and headaches. If you use outlook - Go there now and take a close look at your contact list - And let me be clear that if you use multiple contact lists it could be an issue. I have not yet found a way to sync multiple contact lists from outlook to the phone (I have to be missing something major - so if you know how please pass it along) I fixed this by just copying the contact to the main contacts folder and then the nightmare began. So you think your contacts are nice and full of information right up till you sync the phone - then you find out how just putting in someone's first name and phone can get a tad bit confusing. So the motto would be fix your contact lists and update them before you sync for the first time, or sync and be prepared to make changes later._____________________________________________________________________Tip#1 - If you are a Gmail user you can download a slick free app from:[...]Info:Synchronize the built-in calendar and address book on your BlackBerry® with your Google account over the air!Get your Google Calendar events to your deviceSynchronize your Gmail contactsBe alerted for upcoming appointments with sound and vibration using your BlackBerry's native calendar____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Tip#2 - The Blackberry Desktop ApplicationInfo:Amazingly with some previous nightmare desktop sync applications under my belt the new interface / sync application really works well - Just make sure that you follow the instructions for setup and follow them closely._______________________________________________________________________The above tip after a bit of messing with Gmail and cleaning up my outlook contacts really helped speed along the contact update process. Thou I have been just testing using Google Calendar I have also found a way to sync Google Calendar to Outlook and Outlook to my ACT database and thus in a perfect if the internet aligns properly and all the syncs work it should be updated in all locations. That syncing process in an entire article in itself.Negatives so far:Phone on the first version of software was slow and in some cases really just did not want to play well when using some aspects of the interface.Latest version that was released fixed many of those issuesAccelerometer is still - well - lame at best and they really need to get that software worked out - sometimes it works and other times it just does not want to work at all. It is slow to react and the transition from portrait to landscape just is terrible (Oh wait I mean utilitarian) IPod Touch and Iphone you have Storm beat for sexy interface. Yet in most cases the Strom really does get the job done. I also want to mention that the accelerometer really seems to have the most issues when transitioning from a lying flat position, like on your desk to a vertical then portrait or landscape view. Might just be me but in most cases it takes time for it to figure out where in the air it is... Almost like you startled it out of bed and it needs a second to ask itself: "Where am I?"There have been complaints online about the light leakage around the screen and it is definitely apparent. You can see it and if you are in a dark room it looks like a picture frame. This is clearly a build issue that will not be fixed easily. It can be diminished by just dimming the screen but mine like to auto dim etc and in the end it a fight to fight it so I just deal with the small light leakage issues. The screen in general is really nice - just play the video sample that comes with it and you will see the quality. I for one do not spend much if any time watching movies on my phone and if I do its short and I just will not care about overall quality.I want to set this negative off from the rest because its related to the cases provided so far - They are horrible. You have the options of the silicon case or some of the leather cases that go on your belt. Yeh ummm... Leather is not my style so I opted for the silicon case and I have to say that the first version of these are not designed well. The case is flimsy and I do not know how people test cases but its a touch device - If you touch it it gets fingerprints and you will need to wipe the crud off at some point - with the silicon case that fits like a floppy flyer you will more than likely wrap the case around the back of the phone when you go to wipe it off. They REALLY need to make better case options and I hope for the aftermarket to catch up with that aspect of the Storm. First version blows but its all you can get so get something or be careful and forget the case.Let's move on to applications:Overview:Here is where in my opinion the Storm has a ton of catching up to do and might never actually be able to pull it off. With the IPod Touch you have access to ever app you can ever imagine and most, at least the ones for things like Facebook, Myspace, Flickr etc are so much better on the Apple platform it is just sad. Not to say that RIM did not try to get something for us to use as they do have an App Store - It currently has 9 Aps in it and 4 of those are IM clients (Man do we need a good all in one free IM application). In general all the aps are greatly limited and for the most part make me not even want to use them as I am more worried they will not allow me to do what I want or they are so hard to use that its easier to wait till I get to a laptop or desktop to check. There are also multiple work arounds for almost all the aps by just using the mobile versions of the sites. So do not despair if you need your fixes - with the new browser and some patience you can always get to do what you want if you are willing.RSS Readers:I am a huge fan of RSS feeds - I think the advent of Google Reader added to my daily things to do has haled the time to stay on top of current issues and events. How bummed was I that I was using what could be called a beautiful interface on the IPod Touch to now be relegated to the more "Utilitarian" version for the normal mobile user.You can see the Google interface here:[...]When logged in you will see your feeds. To me this view is less than desirable as I monitor a ton of feeds and this just shows the top of latest.If you go here: [...]Then you get a list of your actual subscriptions and it is much easier to use. There are still too many steps and adding a Star to items is less that perfect but maybe Google already is designing a better mobile interface more like the one supported for the Iphone and IPod. (Let Us all hope)There are definitely many more application out there but for the fear of breaking the new device I will keep it minimal for the time and get used to the email deluge each day. Setting up initial email is interesting especially if you have multiple accts you want to monitor. That said - figure out a strategy or simply load each account separately and it will not be a much a nightmare as forwarding all your accounts to one acct then having twice as much email to look over at the end of the day. Trust me on that one... Having 400 emails in the morning done - then moving to a mobile day to look at the Storm and see 400 unanswered emails is not the way to start a Monday.Visual Voice Mail:This is one added service I suggest you get. It really is nice to be able to do all the items you can from the application. Its more money but worth it in my opinion.TwitterBerry (For the Twitter User:Links: [...]In Summary (At least up till this point):I am pretty happy with the device in general - there are things I would love to see released now and I know I will have to wait for but eventually all the applications will catch up, the case options will catch up and my fingers will figure out how in the heck to use the Blackberry Sure type keyboard (That is the strangest thing I have ever used)I will go up against the critics that compare it to the Iphone of today as the Iphone of today is multiple software revisions and an entire model revised. Will there ever be a large an application store, I highly doubt it, but for most the aps will be in place that they need. At least at my place of work playing games is somewhat frowned upon when trying to talk to customers.So if you are looking for a nice phone that can also give you decent media player options with most if not all of the standard blackberry options then this is definitely a phone to look at.... but as always - hit the store and pick it up... and play with it first, but understand if you are not used to on screen touch typing it will take time to get used to the interface.On that note and something I have refrained from talking about till now is the Touch / Click interface. The internet has been buzzing with negative about it and I will stand my ground saying I actually like the interface yet I do not like at least up to this point the software based around the interface - It is so close to being good - I think in another tweak or two of updates it might really get refined. As for the click the screen - I rather like knowing that I clicked it. You must get used to how the unit operates and expects input or you will fight it for days. Read the manual - it actually gives allot of pointers for how to make this transition much easier.More to come as I use it more - Unlike allot of the reviewers out there that pick it up for 5 minutes then voice their opinion - I will be using mine daily for everything I can get it to do without melting down or causing me to mortgage my home to pay for the bill.
I anxiously awaited this phone for a couple months, the day finally came and the phone arrived and what a disappointment it was!I spent about a week trying to "get used" to the feel of the phone, i really gave it every effort but the phone just didn't work the way it should have.  I know there have been software releases to make the phone work the way it was intended but I just didn't have the time to invest in it.I'll make this short and to the point, if you're a business/power email user then this phone will cramp your style, try it out for a week or two and you will see.  Numerous times buttons on the screen were accidentally touched and the camera would come on and different things would activate.The screen rotation system was horrible with a 3-5 second delay from landscape to portrait mode not to mention the phone is just awfully slow.And keep in mind, this wasn't just my phone, i ordered over 5 of these and everyone complained about the same thing, all were sent back.  Even now, a few weeks after the release people that have them still seem disappointed but are "stuck" with them.This would make a great phone for your teenager still in school, but if you use a BlackBerry to make deals happen and to manage your day then this phone is a sad disappointment!!
I have had this phone for around a week. So far this phone has been great. Multimedia on the device is good. The screen is phenomenal. Only problem I have had so far is the mute key in calls is sometimes hit by my cheek. Other than that I love the phone.
BlackBerry Storm 9530 Smartphone (Verizon Wireless)I had made peace with the dead pixels on my Blackberry Storm. I did this by looking at the phone as a tool and not as a source of joy. In other words, I matured. I actually felt bad for RIM and Verizon too, having to give one dude four phones.So, I went to the Verizon store to activate my wife's new Samsung SCH-U740, the Alias. I started a conversation with customer service young lady, as I'm annoyingly conversation-inclined (Cuban). I told her about the pixels and without me telling her anything except that I was over my 30-day return window, she called the Verizon customer service store and ordered me a new Blackberry Storm. It came today. In addition to not having any dead pixels, the screen click is 400% better than any of my three previous Storms. In other words, if you're on the fence about the Storm, go ahead and try it.asymmetricblog.com
this is a great phone. the only thing i reccomend, if you plan on using the VZ navigator, get a car charger. navigation tends to run the batt down.
I have owned the Blackberry Storm since the first day it was released.The phone is like a bottle of wine that holds a lot of promise after aging 5-10 years but not drinkable now.The phones software and applications are not remotely ready - the applications don't work well with the touch screen, switching between portrait/landscape is troublesome, etc.  I could literally list 50 different examples of core functionality not working well.I'm hoping that that future software/firmware updates corrects the many bugs.If you are not a business user with stringent requirements around Microsoft Exchange integration (calendar/email/contacts) than get an iPhone.  If you are still think about getting a Storm, wait until Blackberry has a desktop version of the software newer than 17-Nov-08 (version 4.7.0 B50).
First let me say, if my company didn't require me to use a BlackBerry, I would get an IPhone.  I went to work today and set-up my Storm.  As a person who uses the keyboard much to do business, I found the light clicky thing annoying.  I have large hands and felt like I could never push the right keys.  Anyway, I'm very discouraged as typing a simple response to a text message is a lesson in patience--something I don't need.  Verizon, I am coming to visit tomorrow. The purpose of my visit is to return this monstrosity and reactivate my Curve.  At least I could type at a reasonable pace.
I am extremely disappointed in this phone.  This is my first BlackBerry and I regret the purchase.  The touchscreen keyboard is very frustrating to use and it completely mitigates the other features that may be exemplary.  I am considering trading it in before my 30 day period expires.The touchscreen keyboard is slow and my life is fast.  I cannot quickly respond to a text or email because of many mis-punches on the keyboard or because I am being so overtly careful as I type.  I do not recommend this phone for anyone who loves to shoot out a quick text or email.
OK...I got this last night via FedEx as my local VZW store didnt have any in stock.  I opened the box, and I loved the look of this thing!  Cool, slick, neat, etc!  I activated it and it went down hill from there...The typing was clunky at best, and you have to push a bit to the left of the character to make it work...annoyance but not a deal breaker.  The camera was SLOW, don't expect  to click and shoot instantly, there's a quite a lag time, again an annoyance, but not a deal breaker.  The DEAL BREAKER came on the first phone call I made.  When you rest the phone on your shoulder, your cheek presses the mute button!  Absolutely the WORST possible placement of that thing!  That was FAR AND AWAY the most annoying thing EVER!!  I was absolutely JUMPING OUT OF MY SKIN to be able to return that thing!  I got my money back, and re activated my LG VX 8700.  NEVER NEVER again will I buy any BlackBerry product...EVER.In conclusion...DO NOT BUY THIS "PRODUCT".  You saw it here, so dont blame me if you buy it and hate it in 2 hours like I did.
If you have never owned a Blackberry, you might like this phone.  As stated, typing can be frustrating to the point of chucking the thing against a wall.  I had a Curve prior to the Storm.  I used the Storm for two weeks and basically hated it, it seems like all the simple logic in the Curve were left out, or were totally hidden in the Storm.  The phone was returned to Verizon in two weeks and I switched back to ATT and the Bold (which is the way a Blackberry should be !!!).
I just spent ten minutes trying out this phone at a Verizon store - only needed two to discover that this is a very pale imitation of the Iphone. Touch screen needs lots of pressure, response time is slow, screen options not intuitive. More importantly, I was informed by an employee that the "perfected" software is not yet available, and that might be the reason I wasn't wowed by it. He suggested I'd be better off to wait a few months to purchase it!! However, if you do decide you want one now, their starting price is $199 with a $50 rebate. I realize you must use Verizon service for this price. But it's a little hard to believe that Amazon says the retail price is $499 and they're selling it for $199.  Do they really think we believe this? I've been a longtime customer of Amazon, but starting to become very skeptical of their current pitches.
I've wanted a Blackberry to use as both phone and PDA for some time.  I realized that the PDA software support was lagging, but I thought it was catching up.  Not.I'm so so pissed off at this device.  I try to access websites that both Firefox and IE can load on any PC and I get error messages (.  I realized that medical software had not yet been ported.  I didn't realize that the internet as it exists on PCs and Macs would not exist either.  Blackberry is not complying with Open Source.  It's a mistake microsoft made.  I'm seeing a lot of arrogance here in expecting the world to comply with a new device.This is unacceptable.  The Storm was released way ahead of schedule. Where do I return it?EDIT 11/3/09:I've completely changed my mind about the Storm.  Successive OS software releases have made the phone better and better.  I have all the software I need (expect maybe a Kindle reader) and the phone is stable.Typing on the virtual keyboard is greatly improved.  I can type quite quickly on it.The radio is 100% reliable.  Memory is stable (this is application dependent).  Battery life is OK.  I'm happy to keep it for another year.  Maybe even beyond that if there's not something better.
If you want the Storm for multi-media capability for the camera, your music, pictures, videos,etc. do all of us business people a favor and buy the iPhone. BlackBerry is watering down [and I might add slowing down] its new units to appeal to those of you who have a 14 yr old mentality and just want to justify trying every new cool thing out of the box. Frankly we would prefer that you buy something else so that the phones that we have relied upon and need aren't further corrupted by all of the silly add ons that 14 yr old "need."The Storm is a great unit in theory but it is disappointing because of its slowness and all of the 14 yr old mentality add ons that will eventually kill it. I don't know if the huge amount of inane emails and text messages from children will kill the effectiveness of its email forwarding/receiving, but there is bound to be a problem at some point because of a huge volume increase.The Storm is not a toy. Buy the iPhone which is a toy.
sorry, i'm not bright enough to figure out how to just ask a couple questions, so i had to do this in the guise of a review.First, does Verizon require you do subscribe to a monthly 'data pak' when u buy the Storm?  I hear AT T requires you to purchase a $40 monthly data pak.Second, how's the navigational speed on the internet with 3G?  Is it similar to dial-up at home or broadband?i'm very interested in this phone but need more info.  Any feedback i can get on this is much appreciated . Thanks, and happy thanksgiving!
What is the USB good for in this device? Can you connect the Web Cam, External USB drive, USB hub, a USB Printer?What about a camera or a high precision GPS?Also, can I use Gizmo over WIFI to make free calls when in WIFI range?
I'll just list out the aspects of the phone.  More convenient that way.-Touchscreen: Not as responsive nor as user-friendly and intuitive as the iPhone, but definitely usable, stylus (which is provided), and finger-wise. Sharp, bright colors, with an auto-adjust function that works amazingly well, even in bright sunlight. Slightly recessed, so it does collect dust and other debris (which I found surprisingly annoying, since even lint easily picks up from my pocket), but overall, very attractive and usable.-Windows Mobile 6.1: Though there are still some bugs, a marked improvement over the last version.  The one really annoying aspect of the system is still the slow loading time, and the main nagging thing I noted is that there's a HUGE lag after text messaging, after the message informing you that the text was sent.  The system freezes for a good 5-10 seconds, and won't let you do anything during that time frame.  Mostly just annoying, though certainly not a detractor, especially if you don't text a whole lot.-The keyboard: Spacious, despite the compactness, and slightly curved, with an assisted spring mechanism that feel very, very solid.  The one qualm I have is that they keys are nearly flush with the tray, and the top row can be difficult to press, since it's nearly flush beneath the screen.  Other than that, with some use, it's easy to get used to, and doesn't add bulk or awkward feeling to the phone, like some full QWERTY keyboards. The keys are also backlit, which is a nice touch, especially in shadowed or darkened areas.-The keys: There's plenty of softkeys and shortcuts available, and they're very well-suited for the phone.  There's an optical joystick (passing your finger over the surface allows you to scroll without physically pressing the top/bottom keys, or the screen), which also serves as an "OK" key.  I really liked that addition to the phone, since I'm not a big trackball fan, and the sensitivity is customizable, since a too sensitive setting can sometimes lead to wrong commands. There's a dedicated panel key, which is somewhat like a home-screen key, since it takes you to the main panel selection every time. There are also dedicated phone keys, a toggle on the side for volume, and a power/sleep button on the top.  They don't detract from the phone, and the only sticking point is that they're sometimes a bit stiff to press.  Other than that, it's a nice, somewhat comforting feeling to have dedicated keys available, unlike the iPhone.-The panels: These have been touted as, and are, really, the main attraction of the phone. They're are an interesting, very positive feature, since they're customizable (you can even move them around, though this has to be done through choosing a panel and editing it, instead of just dragging it across the screen, which would have been much more intuitive), and varied, and give the Windows system a more personal feel. They can be a bit laggy, but they're fun and functional (the fish panel is just amusing, with the ability of the fish to change color, follow the touch, or swim away if pressed), though I've yet to find a use for the Google page, since it always defaults to Internet Explorer, which I don't utilize.-Internet browsing: Pretty snappy and speedy, even on the Edge network.  The area in which I live doesn't support the 3G bands on this particular phone (I have the overseas Xi, while the U.S. will ship the Xia), though bigger cities with the 1900mHz towers do.  I don't use Internet Explorer, since it's still one of the most useless and dated mobile browsers out there.  The phone is shipped with Opera Mobile 9.5 installed, which works similarly to Safari on the iPhone, though thankfully the cut and paste options are available, unlike the iPhone.  (Trust me, after you've given up that option, and then come back to it, you'll really notice the difference.  Why Apple hasn't picked up on that yet, I'll never know...) There is also the option of downloading Skyfire, which works very well, sometimes faster than Opera.  Both platforms support Flash, and display the full-page layout, like you'd see on your PC.  Either way, pretty enjoyable experience there.-Text/Multimedia Messaging: Windows finally incorporated the threaded conversation for text messaging, much like the iPhone did, creating a more "IM" feel to conversations, and making it much easier to keep track of specific conversations.  It lags a bit, as mentioned prior, but a great improvement, without a doubt. It also does Multimedia messaging, and for that alone, in some ways, it is worth more than the iPhone, since Apple still refuses to include that basic function.-Camera/Video/Music: The camera is 3.2 MP, a very decent camera, especially considering the phone size.  It includes a flash, and can be adjusted for various speeds, colors, effects, etc.  There is also a video-camera, which records up to 30fps, though only 24fps, I believe, for the American version.  Why the difference, I couldn't say.  The music player is easy to access (it has it's own panel), and there is also a Sony FM radio included, which is a nice touch, and easy to use, though only with the headphones included, since they act as an antennae, apparently.  Still, very decent media package.-Construction: I have the silver finish, which is really just stunning.  It's very has a very durable, solid feel to it, though can be somewhat slippery, and feels very comfortable in the hand.  The size in my opinion is perfect, compact and sleek, and though this means smaller screen size and somewhat cramped keys, it's really my favorite aspect of the phone.  Has the old, comfortable handset feel of a Nokia candybar phone, actually. Sony really put a lot of thought and effort into it, and it shows.-Other features:  The 3.5mm headphone jack is WONDERFUL.  I had a Sony a few years back, and the one sticking point that kept me from using it as a full-time MP3 player was the fact that I was supposed to use Sony's headphones.  The fact that Sony has branched out, and incorporated the headphone jack, along with the capabilities for a Micro SD card slot (located on the side, when you remove the back cover), really shows that they're creating a platform which is more friendly to users who branch between companies. (Sony usually has their own M2 storage card, which is more pricey than the Micro SD.) Whether it lasts or not depends on their continued association with HTC, I suppose, who designed and helped create the physical phone. I suspect that if they next phone doesn't run Windows Mobile (which has been rumored), those features might disappear. Oh well.  The fact that they're included on the Xperia is really a very nice, convenient touch. The phone also connected with the network very easily, loaded all the information, and formatted the phone, without any heavy programming from me, which was awesome.Overall?  Fantastic phone, with very reliable software, convenient system, sleek and sturdy construction, speedy network connections (even overseas), and plenty of opportunities for personal tweaks and modifications, given the open platform from Windows.  I'd love to give it five stars, instead of the four, but the price was ridiculous, especially considering that it's really just another Windows Mobile smartphone, albeit better-looking and more personal than some others.  Still, it's without a doubt my favorite phone to date, when combining the ease of use and construction appeal.  Well worth buying, if you can burn the money.
First the disclaimer: I'm an avid Windows Mobile user so am familiar with the Windows Mobile interface.I love the camera. Of course it doesn't compare with a point and shoot of course, but pictures are rather sharp. The shutter runs a little slow, so sometimes you might miss the action, but for quick snaps in bright light it is pretty good. The LED gives a little bit of light in low light situations. Auto focus is a very nice feature too.The panels are an interesting concept. I've actually given up my mp3 player and am using the Sony Ericsson music player with an 8G SD card (a touch heavy for this, but not bad). Also the integrated FM radio panel is nice. I haven't found a use for the fish panel yet!The curve of the sliding keyboard is pretty nice. I like how when you slide the keyboard there is a solid feel to it. Makes me think that Sony Ericsson paid attention to the design here.Very stable. Doesn't crash.I've dropped it a few times...ugh. Hasn't scratched or died (yet)The device is responsive. a touch snappier would be nice, but definitely usable.People definitely notice the phone - not that I pay attention to that anyway ;)Cons:A little heavy - just a little lighter and I'd be happy.The keys on keyboard are a little too flush - sometimes hard to type, but now I've had a bit of experienceThe panels are a little slow.The speakerphone is a little quiet - I wish it were a little louder, but doable.This could be a con if you don't like or haven't used Windows Mobile, but since it is Windows Mobile so it might take some getting used to.Neutral:The screen has a bezel, which flys in the face of recent "smartphones - iPhone etc. I don't mind it personally.Like most Windows Mobile phones, the battery doesn't last as long as my old Nokia 3510. But hey, I'm using 10 times the features and it always lasts me more than a whole day from sun up to sun down.I personally don't like the touch sensor to scroll - I like clicking through menu entries rather than swiping.
This is by far the best cell phone out there currently. I bought this phone about a week ago and was waiting for it for some time, but the wait was worth it.The phone has many excellent features, such as:o Multi band covering the whole worldo Full communication suite (BT, wireless, push email, Internet...) that is easy to setupo Nice touch screen and nice panels, which can be developed by a normal usero Office tools and applicationso and many moreIts features are better than many cell phones such as the HTC diamond, which is comparable to it, and is always said that this is an imitation of it. Moreover, it runs great and flawlessly.The couple of things that I would like to be better are the speaker phone function, it just needs to be a little bit louder, and the multimedia player that comes with it, but again you can always buy third party applications that can cover all types of audio and video.I'm extremely happy with the phone and recommend it to anybody and everybody.
This is the only cell phone I ever bought that just worked right out of the box without a thousand questions.  It connedted to the web, found new panals, downloaded my mp3 files and assorted and assembled all my music and video files.  It is like haveing a real computer in the cell phone.Voice was very clear and easy to understand.  The speaker phone isn't bad but I keep blocking it with my finger.  The position of the speaker phone not very good.It is well build and solid as a rock.  Most people are saying that it is too thick.  It fits in my pocket just fine and I like the extra size and weight.The slide out keyboard is real neat.  I popped in a 8gb chip and it transfers fast and acurately.Like everyone else the price is a bit steep but then you really get what you pay for these days.Good:  It really works with little effortMobile 6.1 is teriffic.  Quite an improvement over the old one.Screen GorgeousSlide out keyboard is a blessingBad: None (unless you think it is too expensive)ConclusionIf you can afford it buy it.  Great Phone.
Like many tech fanatics, I eagerly looked forward to the release of this phone over a year ago when it was first announced.  But after all that wait, I must say that I am a little disappointed with the final product.  Sony definitely delivered a great looking and solidly built cellphone.  However, the choice of using Windows Mobile on the Xperia X1 is the real failure of this phone.If you have used the iPhone (OS X) or the HTC G1 (Android) and then you used a Windows Mobile phone such as the Xperia X1, you will be blown away by how poor an operating system Windows Mobile is.  It is slow, buggy (even after its been out for ages), prone to crashes and restarts and not designed for finger touch.The panel interface does little to mask the ugliness and user unfriendliness of Windows Mobile.  With the exception of the sbp panel and the Sony designed media player panel, most of the other panels that are available at this writing are nothing to write home about. At the end of the day, the panels are just eye candy and are not enough to improve the user experience significantly.That said, the phone is well appointed with GPS, a beautiful screen (800x480) resolution, nice keyboard, FM radio and a very handsome design.  The screen clarity will impress you.  I was able to watch a Divx encoded movie on the Xperia X1 and I was thoroughly impress with its clarity.In my opinion, this phone would be better served if it ran Android (Google OS) instead of the crappy windows mobile operating system.Pros:1. Great design.2. Very stylish and will grab positive attention.3. Excellent screen. High resolution (800x480) Crystal clear, excellent for movies.4. GPS, WIFI (802.11b/g), bluetooth.5. Very good battery life.Cons: (all the negatives are due to windows mobile)1.  Sometimes slow and buggy.2.  Archaic user interface.3.  Poor finger touch implementation (forces you to use stylus).
This phone can kick the iPhone's behind any day of the week; but the price tag will hold it back. The other factor is the thickness. It's a little thicker than an iPhone.The rest is just perfect. You have windows mobile with literally millions of applications out there to choose from. Call sound quality and battery life are amazing. I haven't tried all the features, yet. I'm used to the slow performance of the N95. Now this is just the opposite, the applications seem light and quick. Looks like Sony Ericsson got it right this time. I hope one of the carriers would "subsidize" it soon; otherwise, it will be doomed in the US with such a price tag.You can pick up an 8GB SD card for $10-$15. Within a few months, you could probably get a 16 GB HCSD card for $20 or so (compare that to the iPhone with a $100 premium for 8GB).I can't find a good use for the qwerty keyboard, though.
Easy to Google for benchmarks and details, as with the Tilt, this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented, inferior multimedia capabilities compared to other (Samsung, LG, Toshiba, Apple, Nokia) devices.  Current Qualcomm cpus have been well-documented to be slower than even circa 2002-2003 PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia.  It's unfortunate a class-action law suite hasn't panned out.Even with the poorly received CLIE NX/UX keyboards, Sony hasn't improved their design.It also doesn't help that this device was delivered with cracks in the casing so the whole first-batch of the US launch was recalled.  Now what was a Nov 28, 2008 launch has been "back-ordered" until January, 2009.
This is an updated review; I originally wrote it before this phone was commercially available in the USA.  After having tried one out in a store in Singapore, I had decided to keep my N95 8GB and wait for the N97 instead.  First, I was unimpressed with the keypad design, as the flat surface gives you very little guidance to help you hit the right keys.  Plus, both the N85 nor the N96 are merely incremental upgrades, neither one offering the type of groundbreaking advances that the N95 did two years ago.Well, being a compulsive gadget geek, I succumbed in a weak moment.  As the price started dropping (and it has been dropping fast, and continues to do so!) I latched on.  The couple of factors that did it for me was the bright, crisp screen (and it is gorgeous!) and its smaller, more pocket-friendly size compared to the N95.  Also, I liked the new features that it offered: Tri-band UMTS ("worldwide" 3G), FM transmitter, a UI upgrade with "transition effects".I was soon taken in with the N85.  Not only does it have a much sleeker and modern-looking design than the N95 (especially the N95-3 now looks klunky by comparison), but there are dozens and dozens of little details that have been tweaked in the user interface, making for an overall more pleasant experience.One thing that came up for me, as apparently for many others, is the issue of build quality.  After having used the N85 for less than two weeks, a lot of dust had gathered underneath the display - it turns out it is not sealed properly onto the base.  I returned it to Amazon for a replacement - initially I actually ordered a N96 because of this issue.  It turns out that there were other problems with the N96 (particularly related to its slow performance and low available run-time memory), so I returned that too in favor of my second N85.  This time I was luckier, and I can now say that I have never been as happy with any other phone.My original review follows, including some reasons I had planned to forgo it; I have marked updates as appropriate.Both the N85 and N96 incorporate nearly every feature of the N95: GPS w/optional voice navigation, 5 MP camera with LED flash (though these newer models use two LEDs for brighter indoor pictures) and built-in geotagging, support for up to 32GB of µSDHC removable memory (currently 16GB are largest available), standard 3.5mm headphone/headset connector which doubles as a TV-out port, comprehensive bluetooth suppport, and last but not least Symbian S60 (by far the most popular smartphone operating system in the world, far ahead of Windows Mobile, Blackberry OS, iPhone, etc - with a corresponding wealth of available applications).  See my review of the N95 8GB for some more details.  Also, both the N95, N85 and N96 are issued in a "standard" version for international markets, and a "NAM" version for enhanced support of North American 3G networks.The N85 and N96 differ from each other as follows:UPDATE: I have added the older N95 8GB into the mix for comparison's sake.* The N85 has a 2.6" OLED screen, whereas the N95 8GB and N96 has a 2.8" standard LCD screen.  OLED offers brigher colors, especially in sunlight, and lower power consumption (longer battery life).  That's because the pixels themselves illuminate, rather than relying on a backlight to do this.* Both the N85 and N96 are running S60 release 3 "Feature Pack 2", which means that they support "transition effects" for an overall smoother UI and interactive experience.  In particular, the N85 seems overall more "modern" than the older N95.  (ADDED 3/19/09)* In addition to quad-band GSM/2G (850/1900 MHz for North America, 900/1800 MHz for the world outside), the N85 also has a tri-band UMTS radio.  The North American version supports the 850/1900 MHz UMTS bands (for e.g. AT&T;), plus 2100 MHz for roaming internationally, while the N85 8GB NAM and N96 NAM only supports 850/1900 MHz.  (Conversely, the international versions of the N85 and N95/N96 support 900/1900/2100 MHz and simply 900/2100 MHz, respectively).  In short, it means that if you take your N85 with you abroad, you should still be able to get faster 3G coverage in most places where available, something which is not true for either the N95 or the N96.  (Plus, among the North American models, the N85 is the only one that also will work in Japan, since there is no 2G/GSM network available there, only 3G/UMTS over 2100 MHz).* The N85 has a built-in FM transmitter, for streaming voice calls and music e.g. to your car stereo.  This is particularly useful if your car is not equipped with bluetooth (incl. A2DP) technology.* The N96 has a built-in TV tuner, supporting DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds).  However this feature is not enabled in the North American version, because such broacasts are not available here.  AT&T;, like other North American carriers, have instead chosen to use MediaFLO for digital video broadcasts.* The N96 has 16GB of built-in mass storage, in addition to a µSDHC slot.  Thus, in theory, it is able to store up to 48GB of data with the addition of a 32GB µSDHC card.  The N95 8GB is limited to the same 8GB of memory for its lifetime, while the N85 has a µSDHC slot (I currently use a 16GB card in it).* The N85's processor contains a 369 MHz ARM11 core, while the N96 has a dual 264 MHz ARM9.  It is difficult to say which one performs better, but both use Symbian S60 version 3 feature pack 2, which offers significant improvements in interactive feel over the N95 (which contained a 333 MHz ARM11 core).  That said, none of these have the graphics coprocessor that the N95 did, so applications (mainly games) that are optimized for this, will run much faster on the older N95.  The N95 also wins hands down in JBenchmark trials.UPDATE 3/18/09: Now having owned/tried all three, I can say that overall, the N85 is the snappiest one of the bunch.  The N96, in contrast, is quite underperforming; it even has problems streaming audio to my Pioneer car stereo over Bluetooth A2DP without hickups every 11-12 seconds.  As for interactive use, both the N85 and N96 feel a little bit quicker than the older N95.* Some people have complained about cheap, plasticky build quality on the N85 (see e.g. HowardForums); in particular, the keypad is seemingly somewhat flimsy and simply glued onto the phone.  People who have tried both generally seem to prefer the N96 on this account.UPDATE 2/8/09: With a few day's use of the N85 under my belt, I'd say it is no worse than the N95.  The keys are flat and with less tactile feedback, so it may be a little bit more difficult to text with one hand; however it's no worse than, say, the Motorola RAZR or some Samsung phones.UPDATE 2/19/09: As described above, mine had a problem with the display peeling off the base, and dust gathering underneth.UPDATE 3/19/09: My replacement N85 has been stellar.* The N85 is smaller (mainly due to the smaller screen) and will fit easier into your pocket.  UPDATE: Both the N85 and N96 are slimmer than the N95.* Both the N85 and N96 use the micro-USB standard (a slightly wider and flatter connector than mini-USB as seen on the N95) for data, and both can be charged through this port as well.  In addition, the N96 has a separate Nokia charging connector.  Now, here is the single reason I will not be replacing my N95 with a N85: This connector is at the top of the phone!  To me, this is stupid (and the only reason I subtracted a star from my rating), because it precludes the ability for third party manufacturers of docks and cradles to create one that you simply dock your N85 into for syncing/charging.  This is especially important in your car, if you plan on using the GPS navigation feature of this phone (keep in mind that when the GPS reciever is turned on, the batteries are drained pretty fast).  With my N95 8GB, i simply got a Brodit/ProClip device holder, along with a corresponding vehicle mount from PanaVise, and voila - I have a very nice little GPS device/music player/etc readily available; the N85 is definitely a bit more cumbersome in this regard.  UPDATE: Obviously I caved in and got the N85 anyway.  [...] now has a cradle for the N85 - but as I said, it does require that you manually plug the charging connector into the phone.* As always, beware of rather dismal repair/warranty service from Nokia USA (c/o PALCO).  You buy it, you own it.  You should be able to do most repairs yourself, though, with parts from e.g. cnn.cn - once available for this device.  UPDATE: Various customer accounts both here and on[..] indicate that PALCO have gotten significantly better lately.All this said, the bottom line is that there is simply no match for these phones when it comes to their sheer capabilities and the amount of features found on them.  Sure there are phones out there with more emphasis on ease of use and eye candy (e.g. iPhone), and sure there are ones with their own unique features/gimmicks (e.g. the Google Applications in the new T-Mobile G1) - but Nokia S60 smartphones are widely regarded as pure workhorses with the best overall feature sets.The N85 pushes the limits a little further, and is perhaps the phone with the most capabilities on the market today.  But if you are concerned about a solid build, you might want to consider the N95 8GB or N96 instead.  Or, wait for the newly announced N86 8MP, where apparently a lot more attention has been paid to build quality.
First and foremost, Nokia phones have the BEST reception of all phones on the market. In addition, the call quality is exceptional. This is one key reason I bought this phone. Tried the iPhone....amazing gadget but mediocre reception (do a google search on the topic) and lousy camera. Tried the Samsung Eternity...also a really nice gadget but so-so reception and call quality.I have a house in Boston and Vermont. The house in VT is in the mountains and the n85 is the first cell phone that my wife and I have ever used that worked at the house....3 bars. Moto razor, 2 Blackberrys, Sony Ericcson 810i, the iPhone and Samsung Eternity...none had reception...the n85 is a standout in that department. Also love that the n85 is a slider and a fantastic 5MP camera w/flash. The browser is pretty quick, screen flips from vertical to horizontal smoothly and there is a 3.5mm jack for std headphones. Previously had tried the Nokia n78....loved the phone but found it a tad long (like the form factor on the n85 better) and really did not like the n78 keyboard (needed to type using my nails). I like the form of the n85 much more than the n78/n82n95/n96. Do feel that if you do alot of texting, the n85 might not be for you, you may be happier with a full keyboard. One problem I have is that the phone is so striking looking that when I use it (especially as a camera) people want to check it out.....a striking nice piece of equipment.Overall, if you care most about phone reception and quality of calls...buy a Nokia....the n78 was amazing...I had one a few years ago (3000 series), also amazing....does not have to be something as expersive as an n series phone. Nokia makes the best phones in the world....may not make the best gadgets (the iPhone definitely has the wow factor)....but their ability to make a phone is amazingPros:Amazing reception, don't have to worry about losing/dropping calls like with other brands (particularly an issue if reception is not strong)Solid product, feels high quality and great form factorGreat camera! Love that it has a slider lens cover that activates camera when openedFM radio, FM transmitter (use it more than I thought I would)Wifi and bluetooth (very easy to make connections)Unlocked 3G (use ATT)GPS (tried the n78 GPS, assume the n85 is the same)3.5mm headphone jack, great quality loudspeaker (for receiving calls)Fast browserLove the 2 direction slider (keyboard, mp3 controls)Brilliant displayCons:Keyboard not ideal if texting frequentlyPrice may not be what some are willing to pay
I purchased this phone for my girlfriend for x-mas.  The previous reviews have gone into depth with the features and what is possible.From both of our experiences, S60, the phone's OS, does have a learning curve, but offers up more options than any previous phone we have owned.  This phone makes me want to get rid of my iPhone because of everything it does, let alone not have to pay to add on third party apps because everything works out of the box.The camera takes excellent pictures and does well in and outdoors.File transfers are easier on a Mac, but if you have Windows, do not fret as it is not too terribly difficult.  Nokia's website is extremely helpful for trouble shooting and learning how to make things work.If you are looking a new nokia phone, purchase this one.  It will not disappoint.Because of this phone, I am patiently waiting for the N97.
I will try to summarize how excellent this phone is.I'll begin with the cons*OS Symbian can be slow sometimes but I think It can be fixed with the Software UpdaterPros*Excellent call quality and Signal reception*Nice design(for me it's the best for now for a N Series Phone)*Camera quality is really good: maybe not the best of NSeries but it is really good for quick shots...As I always say; a camera phone is not a replacement for a real camera(see my customer images. Pics from my city)*Very good sound quality and Mp3 player*Easy to customize*Nokia PC Software is very useful*At first, keyboard is hard to use but later, You will get used to it and you will see how it's easy to use*Several useful applications*Nokia Maps works great*Comes with a 4GB Memory/can be upgrated up to 8GB*3.5mm jack, so you can use any head/earphones*Great Web browser*WI-FI works excellent and It's very easy to use for people who are not used to thatOVERALL, An EXCELLENT Phone... Pros are more than cons...I really recommend it!
I got this phone as a present from my brother and I have to say, im pretty impressed with this phone. it has a lot of cool features and has two cameras with 5 mega pixels and autofocus. since when did the iPhone had auto focus on its camera, maybe in 5 years but nokia n79 brings tomorrows technology today. love this phone its the best and nokia is the best.
The phone part's great.  Motorola's been making communications equipment for years, and their experience shows.  The Crystal Talk feature work like a charm.  I could be heard talking while standing under an elevated train rattling overhead.  By comparison, try an iPhone, whose phone portion is on par with phones I owned in the '80s.And the Kodak camera works amazingly well.  The Night Mode gets surprisingly good results at very low light levels.  And in daylight, the pictures are on par with what I've gotten from small digital cameras.  Very impressed with that as well.The device itself is quite nice.  Well put together, totally solid construction.  Nice materials.  A pleasure to handle.The downside is that the software is a pain.  Different parts of the device seem to have been put together by different developers.  And navigating around between different parts of the phone is baffling.  But slowly, I'm getting used to it and I've gotten the Bluetooth to my computer (to download photos -  great feature) to work after lots of trial and error.Overall, the two key parts of this phone are excellent.  It's just the overall integration that's not up to standard.  Net result: I'm pleased.
First phone where I actually use almost all of its features. I have had it for about a week and can't stop playing with it. It's now the only thing I have to carry around, mp3 player, camera, phone, internet device(with WiFi), and I love it. This phone was made for me.Was thinking about getting other phones, iphone, g1. But they force you to buy the most expensive data plan for the phone to be fully functional that is way too much money for me.Only con I have found is it has an internal micro SD slot under the battery.I have the locked version, but you can still get google maps on it if you download it a bunch of times, very cool free app!Also the voice recognition works fine for me (I had problems at first but all you have to do is wait till after the beeps to say your command). And for the radiation concerns, they give you a free stereo headset with the phone (a pleasant surprise).
Pros:-High-end 5MP camera with xenon flash and auto focus-Easy to use controls-WiFi-Decent battery life (3-4 days)-Price ($100 with 2-year contract)Cons:-no 3G-Menu scrolling sometimes slow-low video capture resolution-Only 1 color availableThis is a great phone with a high-end camera integrated. With its price, you usually get a 1.3/2MP pin-hole camera module these days. But this 5MP camera (with great optics, fast auto focus, and effective xenon flash) is one of the best you can find in a phone for the price. The Nokia N95 has a 5MP camera, but it is quite expensive. The image colors for the ZN5 also looks better than the N95.Unlike your typical Motorola phone (which don't usually generate a market buzz), this ZN5 separates itself from the pack. If Motorola keeps making standout phones like this, they can get some market share back. Normally I don't get Motorola phones, but this is an exception.Call quality has been good so far (I own this phone for about a month now). Real-life battery life has been decent, with 3-4 days per charge. Given the pros, I really enjoy this phone. The cons didn't bother me too much so I would highly recommend this phone. Searching online, I also found many positive reviews for this phone (CNET, NYTimes, etc).
I purchased this phone because of the camera and the features, not to mention a reasonable price. Then I found out that this phone has the 2nd highest radiation output of any cellphone out there. The FCC allows a maximum of 1.6 SAR, digital radiation, the Motorola ZINE has an SAR of 1.59. Now some studies have found no link between cell phone radiation and cancer...fine. Some studies have found a link between cell phone radiation and sleep problems and headaches. It really is just a matter of whether you would like to have the world's second most radiation generating cell phone. I didn't, so I opted for the Samsung Behold, which is a touch screen, decent camera, and has all the bells a whistles.This late in the game, Motorola has the power to put out a great phone with lower SAR levels...look at the RAZR, one of the lowest SAR levels of any phone.So, ZINE is an okay phone with a wonky interface that takes great photos.....but you might sprout multiple arms, breathe fire, and attack New York City.
I just got my new HTC Touch HD phone a few days ago. It has replaced my old SPV M700 (HTC) with Windows Mobile 5 handset. I considered the HTC Diamond but disregarded this due to the slow TouchFLO 3D at the time (has now been updated) however battery life (900 mAh) is still bad. I also considered the iPhone 3G and the Blackberry Storm. The iPhone is fabulous, but not for editing documents etc., plus the screen resolution of the HD is near double. The Storm has a "click" screen which I'm not sure about.First thing you notice when you take the phone out of its box it how solid and well built it feels. Also striking is the lack of the usual array of "HTC" style buttons. This gives the phone a very minimalistic and elegant look. After starting it up you are greeted with the home screen of the flo menu. This now responds much faster, looks stunning and is a real asset. However the flo does not cover all the phone's functionality and it soon reveals the WM 6.1 prof. underneath. Then navigating the menus using your finger becomes very tricky. Even the fantastically high screen resolution (480x800) can't make up for this. The HD does come with a stylus (held in by a magnet) which you'll need for those occasions. The virtual keyboard is good and responsive but I find it takes some time to get use to. To sync the phone with my PC with Vista was very easy with active sync. It works very well with MS Office 2007 and Media player. I took it to the gym and found the HD works very well as an MP3 player. You can even adjust the volume with the button at the side of the phone without turning the phone back on. The sound quality is very, very good. Importing/converting vids and photos is a doddle with the media player. However I imported a video podcast and the software did not make use of the g-sensor to view landscape, why? Playback is smooth and seems good. Web browsing is a joy with the high resolution screen and Opera 9.5 preinstalled (this does make use of the g-sensor).I contacted HTC customer service and found them very helpful. If you go to the HTC website you can download the latest fixes for the phone.Good:TouchFLO 3D now fast and very usefulBuild qualityBattery lifeGreat preloaded programs e.g. MS mobile officeVery good MP3 player and video playback with fantastic sound qualityVery slim and portableHTC customer service seems fineVery good compatibility with MS VistaLooks stunning5 mega pix cameraBad:Windows Mobile rears its ugly headFiddly small buttons in MS windows mobileG-sensor does not support many prog.Only digital zoom and no flashOverall a great versatile handset.
i am writing this review from the xperia: that's how much i've been using it lately, and that's how easy it is to use for typing, browsing, editing and reviewing important documents. the touch screen is great and the phone has a sturdy, heavy metalic feel that i personally love. but there ARE some shortcomings. You need to fiddle around with it BIGtime before you get its battery to perform decently. And the camera could be better (my old nokia n82 took far superior photos and even more so for video).Overall a very impressive mini laptop disguised as a phone, a trend in design many others are already following, such as the n97. Running on WM 6.1 pro opens up the door for so many great programs, ive had it 5 days and ive downloaded 11 apps: audio recording, tweaking, barcode reading, chat, skype, facebook, media players, maps, gps, security, etc.
Like many tech fanatics, I eagerly looked forward to the release of this phone over a year ago when it was first announced.  But after all that wait, I must say that I am a little disappointed with the final product.  Sony definitely delivered a great looking and solidly built cellphone.  However, the choice of using Windows Mobile on the Xperia X1 is the real failure of this phone.If you have used the iPhone (OS X) or the HTC G1 (Android) and then you used a Windows Mobile phone such as the Xperia X1, you will be blown away by how poor an operating system Windows Mobile is.  It is slow, buggy (even after its been out for ages), prone to crashes and restarts and not designed for finger touch.The panel interface does little to mask the ugliness and user unfriendliness of Windows Mobile.  With the exception of the sbp panel and the Sony designed media player panel, most of the other panels that are available at this writing are nothing to write home about. At the end of the day, the panels are just eye candy and are not enough to improve the user experience significantly.That said, the phone is well appointed with GPS, a beautiful screen (800x480) resolution, nice keyboard, FM radio and a very handsome design.  The screen clarity will impress you.  I was able to watch a Divx encoded movie on the Xperia X1 and I was thoroughly impress with its clarity.In my opinion, this phone would be better served if it ran Android (Google OS) instead of the crappy windows mobile operating system.Pros:1. Great design.2. Very stylish and will grab positive attention.3. Excellent screen. High resolution (800x480) Crystal clear, excellent for movies.4. GPS, WIFI (802.11b/g), bluetooth.5. Very good battery life.Cons: (all the negatives are due to windows mobile)1.  Sometimes slow and buggy.2.  Archaic user interface.3.  Poor finger touch implementation (forces you to use stylus).

I don't know why I'm reviewing this after, what 4 years since this phone has been out? Well I like going to the cheap route sometimes, and this was one of those instances. I bought this new 4 years after it was released, and I can tell you that I can see why Blackberry caught on. This phone has flawless execution, meaning that the menus and options are not implicitly absconded through menus and sub menus, they are easy to manage through and easy to read through.This phone offers all that the new blackberry's have except, well graphics, camera, video, and unfortunately speakerphone and polyphonic ringtones. What you get though is vintage Blackberry. You get the email, memos, bluetooth, web browsing, passwords vaults, and all the usual blackberry antics. The battery lasts for me well over 7 days without usage, and 3+ days with usage. It has great reception and I find it easier to navigate through, with it's simple and basic, but rather outdated menu system. What can I say, I'm a sucker for retro, even if that means 4 years.Are you substituting technology for reliability and simplicity? Yes, but it's worth it.
I've had this phone for about 3 months now, its I love it!  It's super slim, super sexy and has a ton of features in a small, stylish package.  It has a 2 megapixel camera, which takes beautiful photos I might add, the ability to take video movie clips, a mini SD card slot which will read up to an 8GB mini SD slot, SMS and MMS capabilities, great sound and call quality, and its unlocked, so you can use it with any GSM provider in any country. (AT&T;, Cingular, and Verizon for the States).  The keypad is great, much better than the staggered Razr keypad, and it has a beatiful, bright, crisp screen which makes it easy to see in sunlight.  Overall its a superb phone that has all the standard features of a phone, but does them the right way, plus many other multi-media and other special features.  A++.
This is the worst phone I have ever owned! I have it through T Mobile who is one of the best carriers out there. They have sent me countless replacements and they all have the same issues. Even when I went to the T Mobile store and said I was looking for an upgrade, the employee there rolled his eyes when I said what phone I had. I believe his words were, "I can understand why you'd want to get rid of it."The screen goes all white, it freezes, it restarts when it feels like it, shuts off, drops calls, has nearly no memory, etc. When text messaging, hope you don't get a 2 page message - you will get one part at the beginning of your texts, and you'll have to search around through all your other texts looking for the second part. It may be a few hours earlier, it may be days or weeks. And whatever you do, don't turn it off! When you turn it back on, it isn't unusual to have all the picture messages you've deleted back on your phone! (but with the even more memory available - figure that one out!) Now my screen is waving and about to give out, I've been through 4 chargers (including two for the car), and I'm ready to run this horrible phone over with a train!I gave it one star because the one good quality it has is the quality of the pictures (and videos). I have some fantastic pictures from this phone - too bad I can't text them to anyone since it has no memory!
i havent had a dropped call yet, the reception is good, includes the bluetooth feature and you can transfer ringtones, pictures and wallpapers from your bluetooth to the phone. this is the first phone from tracfone that allows you to do this, and the camera takes ok pictures but not the best quality, it does not have a flash. the internet browser works but tracfone has crippled it so it will only let you go to the tracfone sites and will not let you go on any other url such as [...]. overall if you just want a phone for emergencies or occasional use and really dont require the many features then this is the phone for you.
After reading the only two reviews available, I had to comment. I have used Tracfone for years and I think it is great. I've only had to replace the phone twice, the service is just as good as anybody else, it doesn't trash my small budget, and the service is not complicated. My usage is moderate, but I can't imagine using any other company even if my usage increases. They even have programs for automatically adding minutes, so I don't have to chase after a card at the last minute.
My tracfone worked great for about 3 weeks. Then one morning I received an "unregisterd SIM" message. I called customer service and I think that they said that it was a temporary problem in my area that would be fixed soon. I could barely understand the customer service representative so I'm not 100% sure. Anyway, my parent's have a tracfone and they live in the same area and theirs works. So I suspect customer service was just feeding me a line. I googled the problem and found that it is a common problem and that it is not worth the trouble to get it fixed, if you ever can. I'm trashing the phone and just considering it a lesson learned.
