i am not satisfied with my phone bec i can't maximize the features and i cant open my web. i tried to use the cd that comes with it but the serial number on the phone doesnt match. its not registered yet bec of this serial #. The silicon case i received is wrong, you sent me the one for 650, my unit is 600. i'l apreciate if you send me the right one. Thank you.
I've been using a Motorola V190 for well over 2 years and figured I need a similar phone as replacement. I wasn't disappointed - keypad and controls were similar, audio was great in a thinner package. While battery capacity was limited it made for a slimmer phone I could tuck in a belt holster without it getting caught in doors and narrow passageways. I don't use the camera much.
I didn't buy from this seller, but I owned this phone when it first came out.  It is by far one of the best cell phones I've ever owned.  It has great reception, the sound quality is superb, and is very very sturdy.  My phone was dropped down the stairs, dropped in a puddle, left out in the sun at the beach where little grains of sand got everywhere and it functioned just fine.  The material it's made of is really tough and doesn't scratch easily if you take care not to drop it often.  The only problem I found with this phone is that it has a really poor camera and tiny screen.  Everything else was above par.  Hope this helps!  :)
order took 2 weeks because the package came back to them from the post office damaged. at least they upgraded it to a slightly better phone for it, but it still shouldnt have happened in the first place
Shrink wrapped, shipped on time, excellent service!  And just a side note - it's cheaper to buy the Scrubs' seasons individually from Amazon rather than from someone selling them as a complete set!  Amazon ships them all as one order, so it's great!
Season two for Scrubs remains the single best season ever made for the series.If you could only own one season of Scrubs, this is the one to get!
I'm a big fan of amazon.com. I love the products and the sevice is 100% reliable. Thank You Amazon
I got this phone because my other phone was stolen & I wasn't able to get a discounted phone for a few months. I would use this phone again if that happened but it's not my choice for a phone.I did have a few problems with it acting possessed. It would start dialing numbers when nothing was touching the key pad. I would be on the phone & out of nowhere it would dial #666#006666 etc. I would turn it on & off & it would still be dialing randomly. I used this phone for a few months & this happened about 4 times which isn't terrible but definitely annoying. I like the full letter key board that opens up & I like the internet as well as the other Microsoft applications, but it's nothing you can't get from another phone with the same applications. I have AT&T; service and if you want to use the internet you have to get a different type of internet package in order to use it. It was about $30/month, which is about the same as the Blackberry package. I also had to work with AT&T; to get the phone working with texts which they were able to get going after I called customer service. I think this phone, at least at the time I got it, was primarily used in or from another country which is what I attribute these obstacles to.I would only recommend you get this phone if you can't afford something else, like a Blackberry, or if you need a temporary phone like I did.
Great, got it for my granddaughter for Christmas and it was a better price, no fighting crowds, price was comparable to any place else without gas and crowds. It's the only way to go when you have to get CD's or DVD's, no crowds, no gas, no traffic, comes to the door. It's crazy to go looking for it in 5 different stores when you can come straight to Amazon and spend 5 minutes.
Great show.  Always funny.  I honestly hope this has a longer run than 10 seasons.
I love this show! It has the kind of humor I can relate to, making fun of the everyday oddities of life.  The characters are full of human flaws so they are easy to relate to.  They address the many issues of not just the health profession but also of life.  I can watch this show over and over again, so it is well worth the purchase.  I like to watch the show to help me relax after work.  It's good for laughing, especially with others!
got a refurbed japanese model two buttons dont workat least erase the links and items from the previous owner
This product is a disappointment and more so the company I purchased it from. Requested to change phone to more coasty one, but didn't get responce. And I now have it sitting in a draw.
I had this phone a couple years ago.  The texting is nice on it, but its just another phone with cheap parts thats only going to last long enough for the warantee to run out.  The camera stopped working, the phone would randomly shut off or stop sending/ receiving messages, and the internal speaker broke so to talk on it youd have to put it on speaker mode.  Everyone else i knew/ met with this phone had the same problems.
is a used phone w/ some old #s still on it...and motorola no longer supports it so can't get software to download photos to computer.  seems to work OK but can't really recommmend it as better to get something fully functional.
This is my 4th razr in about 5 years.  They last about 1 year.  But they only cost about 80 bucks, or less if you can renew your cell phone contract and purchase through your service provider.  I get this phone because it is physically durable and fits in my back pocket.  I leave my phone in my back pocket and sit on it all the time.  Maybe that's why they break - they have to withstand daily squashings by a 150 pound person.  I use my phone strictly for making and receiving calls.  I do not use it for the internet or media.  There is no other phone on the market that fits in my back pocket comfortably.  My other Razr's broke for the following reasons -1. after 1.5 years the inside screen quit working, i didn't attempt repair, just got a new phone because I was eligible for an upgrade through my provider.2. I dropped the phone on concrete and broke the external screen - apparently it's made of glass, but it still worked.  after about 1.5 years, the battery wouldn't hold a charge for longer than a day, so I got a new razr.3. after about 1 year the battery stopped holding a charge for longer than a day.Then I switched to a blackberry pearl, which sucked.So I purchased this Razr, and it has lived up to my meager expectations.  Should last about 1-1.5 years.
I purchased this phone from Amazon aware that a lot of variability exists regarding the opinions of other purchasers. However, I have owned a Razr V3 phone for several years with no problems. I am very gratified that the phone I received was everything I desired. The phone worked flawlessly while I was in Europe. I also used the Modal sim card that Amazon provided free with the phone and the reception was superb with regard to my calls as well to my incoming calls.I was particularly impressed with the high quality of the aluminum casing of this phone, much better than my domestic Razr V3, which has a plastic casing. I dropped it a couple of times with no damage or problems. It is a sturdy cell phone. While it is designed as a European cell phone, it can be set for either a 24 hour clock or the English/US 12 hour am/pm time format. The supplied battery also worked well, and I often went several days before recharging it. My phone came with an English manual and an US charging unit. All in all, an excellent international phone. I just purchased another one to replace my plastic "domestic" Razr V3 phone.
The razor phone is a great phone, if you buy it from the store.(my first one got wet after having it for two years, with no problems.) I was trying to save money, and ordered it from here. It was a mistake. The first phone I was sent came in a brand new box, everything sealed, and it didnt even work. I returned it hassle free, the woman e-mailed me, was so polite, replaced my phone. I figured things happen. Im getting a new one, no big deal. Anyway, long story short, It stopped working after a month. Just STOPPED working. The screen went blank, I replaced the battery, nothing would work. If you buy the phone on here, your taking a 50/50 chance. I ended up having to go back to the store and buy a new phone, which if I wasnt trying to be cheap in the first place, I wouldnt have ended up wasting a hundred on garbage. So good luck to you. If you buy it, I hope your phone works better than mine did.
This is my second Razor. I love these phones. They are slim and very attractive. I love the black color. I am very satisfied with this phone. It was unlocked and was new. The price was reasonable also. It works great!
I bought this phone because I liked the design, and found the price irresistible. The phone has been nothing but a huge problem ever since I got it.Although it seemed packed like a new phone, there seemed something suspicious because it had both AT&T; and T Mobile symbols on it (on the cover and software respectively).- The battery, seemingly new, requires charging every two hours.- It gives "Insert SIM" messages even when there is a SIM inside.- The phone switches off unexpectedly.I am "tech savvy" enough to know that this is not normal behavior in phones.I feel cheated.
My biggest problem with phones is that I cannot figure them out. So all the fancy features are lost on me. RAZR v3 has video chapters on [...]  (under Electronics)explaining how to use it. From assigning photos to contacts to pairing it with a Bluetooth headset. I finally know how to assign different rings to people who call me, and know how to send a picture message.Some people commented that they don't like the pad - I actually really like it. It is wide and big. Makes it easy to type.I don't use it for web browsing, so I cannot comment on that, but photo and video camera are really nice. The smart key can be programmed to access video camera, so you don't have to loose time getting to your phone's settings to activate a video camera when you want to record something.It has voice feature so I can use it and dial a pre-recorded name right from my bluetooth headset. Something my previous phone didn't have.
I've already owned a Razr V3 for 21 months and this is pretty much exactly the same as the one I got from my mobile provider  except for a few things.  1) the software on it is slightly different and has some AT&T; specific things installed and an AT&T; logo on the back, 2) the color is different (old one gray, this one black), 3) my old one felt like metal whereas this one feels like plastic.  Maybe my old one just wore down the coating and this one isn't worn down yet and so the coating feels different, but it feels cheaper to me than my old one.  I guess time will tell.I had to buy a new phone when my old one's display went out and I didn't want to get locked into a 2 year contract, so got this one.  Unlocked is nice.  I thought about getting something fancier, but this phone works pretty well as a basic cell phone and I don't really want to be paying $40 extra a month for wireless internet right now.All the good things about this phone involve its small size and the fact that it's a flip phone.  It fits in the pocket nicely.  The flip phone means your pocket doesn't call people since the buttons are closed up inside of it when it's flipped closed.  My last one lasted 21 months being rubbed against other stuff in my pocket and the coating got chipped and beat up but the phone kept working.  In fact it's still working, but the display went out one day when I was charging it and never came back, so I needed a new phone so I'm not dialing blind and unable to read text messages.The bad points are that the software isn't particularly great and it's hard to find things and make it do what you want.  The address book is really limited and you have to enter multiple entries for the same person if you want to put multiple numbers in for them.  I can't really imagine browsing the internet or watching videos on this thing, though I guess maybe someone does it.  The camera is ok, but not particularly spectacular.It's really all about the compact size, flip-phone design, solid feel and functionality as a phone or phone and text-message only device.
Best cell phone yet.  Great antenna!  It picks up 3 bars where others only get one or none in the Sierra Nevadas of both California and Mexico.  Always reception like a land line. The best yet is it is unlocked and usefull anywhere.
While the phone arrived locked OEMforcheap has helped me quickly with codes and tech support. At the end I even received some refund for the troubles I had. Great customer service! Thank you OEMforcheap and thank you Amazon!
This phone replaces a RAZR V3 that i've had since they first came out some years ago.  The phone still works.  However, it shows the ravages of a hard life as my companion.  I dropped it in the snow and, dropped it everywhere else, but every time i dropped her, she came up fully functional.  I like the size, shape, feel and I am familiar with its features.  My only disappointment with this new phone is that the selection of ring tones is sadly deficient.  The tone that i have enjoyed for years 'Sky Blue' is not among those that come within settings, and overall the selections available are significantly fewer than what was offered on my original phone.  But I guess I'll get used to it. If any one knows if/where i might download this ring tone the info would be appreciated.  D. Colón
I loved this phone but the warranty is poor. I wear my phone constantly on a belt holder and apparently the phone got some moisture on it. I am not talking about getting wet but moisture from day to day activities. Apparently this phone has a indicator in it that turns redish/pink when exposed to moisture and the warranty is void.I ended up having to buy a brand new phone because Motorola would not replace.Needless to say I did not but a RAZR. I treated the phone the same as I do all my phones and have never had one quit due to this before or after the RAZR. In my opinion this is poor design/poor support and I will not spend the money for this phone again even though I love the functionality and setup of this unit.
I ordered this phone for my son who will be going back to college soon.  The first phone was received promptly.  It did not work--wouldn't even turn on--battery would not charge.  So I sent it back for a replacement.  Second one arrived.  Worked fine for 24 hours; then the outside screen went blank.  I am sending this phone back and canceling my order.  I will never buy Motorola again.  Totally frustrating and unsatisfactory.  I hope I will not get crappy service when I request a refund.
I bougtht this phone to take to my country cause it was unlocked. But it did not work from day one because of a broken LCD, since it did not have any warranty I could not return it and the cost of repair was more than 200 USD.Just lost money here. My advise, never buy without warranty this phones come with many defects even from factory!!!!
excellent seller that is willing to replace phone with no hassle. the first item i received was put together very poorly.  i was able to send it back and get a replacement right away.
This is a cool phone, easy to use and all the features are nice and easy. The worst part is reception. I had many phones before and never such a bad signal. Inside the building-forget about it in most situations. Trees, rain -everything is on the way!!!Do not recommend if you like to know that someone is calling you or texting right a way, and not wait until you will get a reception. !
POS phone.  Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.  Everything else has to be stored in an extremely limited phone memory.  There are many better phones for the money.  I am disappointed with Motorola and they have definitely taken a turn for the worse in quality.
There are plenty of reviews of the RAZR V3 on its product pages as well as this one so I'll just review this specific product- the International Version that doesn't have a warranty.I was a little apprehensive about buying one of these without a warranty- and still am- except I did have the Amazon protection for a month.So far (45 days), this RAZR works as well as those I've owned in the past.I've only found two issues so far:1. I can't hear very well on it. It's OK, but just OK. Nowhere near as good as my SLVR or Walkman.2. There are more dropout areas and some areas where reception is weaker than my other phones.But then, it seems like this was typical of my previous RAZRs.All-in-all, especially considering the price, and the fact that it is unlocked makes this a pretty good deal as long as nothing goes wrong with it.Of course, I paid less than the present price and there were no other options like there are now. For instance, Amazon is presently offering the US version RAZR in blue WITH a warranty for $5 less as well as the International SLVR L7 with no warranty, which I would have preferred if it had been available at the time, for under $75.00. (Both are listed on this page as items customers ultimately buy after viewing this item).I hope this helps for this particular item.
This is an unlocked phone but it wasn't the greatest. I thought that it wouldn't have any logos on the phone. But, it has an ATT logo on the back. It is actually a GoPhone. I inserted a GoPhone Sim card and every time I end a call, it makes a beeping noise. It's an ok purchase if you just like the Razor.
I received the V3 but it was shipped with a non-original battery. It says "Invalid battery" and wouldn't be recognized by the phone. I have to buy a new one.
The cell phone works fine; the connections are good; it has a nice design and nice features (looks very cool). I also hope that it will work in Europe, too, as I plan to use it there next month. The price is very good and I like that I can use it without having to be in any particular network. I got the cell phone in just a few days, in very good condition (it was well wrapped in the box).The only problem I had was when I had to charge the battery twice before actually using it because after the first time, it kept disconnecting the call after first minute of talking. Checking the internet, I discovered that the problem may resolve if the battery was taken out and after putting it back, recharge the battery.Overall, I give it 4 stars as it is really good for this type of phone.
Three reasons not to buy this phone:1. It may be unlocked, but it is not unbranded. It still says AT&T; every time you turn it on, in the menu, and on the battery cover.2. The battery loses its charge within a day.3. It does not ship with the advertised "European charger with U.S. adapter". It is simply a U.S. charger.This phone is simply a lemon, and reading other reviews I realize I am not the first person to say so. Don't make the same mistake we did!
I regret buying this. I only use a cellphone when I travel, so by the time I realized that this one is defective it was too late to return it. I've tried two new batteries and the phone is simply unable to hold a charge for more than 24 hours, even when it is turned off. If it is in standby mode I'm lucky to get 12 hours. (I'm not activating Bluetooth.) There must be some power management problem in the hardware.I was left in a lurch on a recent trip to Europe when I discovered that if the battery is completely spent,the phone cannot be charged with a USB cable.Apparently Motorola is stuck with a warehouse of defective Razrs and is dumping them on the Internet. It's disappointing that Amazon has let itself be a party to this.
I bought this phone over two years ago. During this time, I had accidentally left it in jeans which ended up going through a full cycle in the washing machine (detergent and all), dropped it about a million times, and have thrown it at various people and objects during several different ocassions. All this had done virtually no damage to this phone, and today it continues to operate as well as it did the first time I bought it.Keep in mind, that while the RAZR is a great phone for basic functions such as talking and texting, its video/photo features are primitive at best. It is absolutely nothing fancy and probably old-fashioned by today's standards. But if you're like me and are really looking forward to using a phone for what it was originally intended to be used, then this is a great phone for you. And it will last you through a lot of damage. I know that from experience.
Love it!  Wish I had known that the phone came with a mini travel charger.
The product has been very good. I had used this cell phone in one of my projects and it worked wonders. I will definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it....
GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS AS GREAT FOR NEXTEL AS IT IS FOR BOOST INSERT YOUR SIM & GO!
I purchased this phone for my son for when he is riding his bike in our neighborhood and playing at the park.  The phone is easy to use and is small enough to go into my son's pockets but......the service area coverage stinks! We can be standing in front of each other and I can call him on a land line and the phone does not ring.  On a rare occasion the call goes through.  If there is a problem be prepared to hold on the phone for customer service for at least twenty minutes.  The web site is hard to navigate through and it does not answer many questions unless you are willing to email them and wait for them to email back.  There is no warning when minutes are used for the month.  All in all it is just not worth the hassle.  I would not recommend this phone to anyone who really needs your child to be able to answer the phone when you call to check in.  Good idea but poor execution.
The Nokia 6101 sets the bar high with a VGA-quality digital camera with self-portrait and video capture and playback. Plus, there's an FM stereo radio built-in, and smart instant messaging software that tells you when your friends are online. With all this plus the great Nokia operating system with advanced voice-activated dialing and menu features, you'll be happy you chose the new Nokia 6101!The Nokia 6101/6102 is truly one of a kind. The phone fits both your hand and your heart, and is the only phone that smiles back at you. Weighing in at only 3.42 ounces, this handset surely has a lot to offer. The Nokia 6101's ease of use and its comfortable form factor make it rather impressive.Audio Messaging as well as Picture and Video Messaging are processed almost instantly because of this handsets EDGE capability. Nokia is also famous for their FM Radio which is also included. This flip also boasts the two full color displays.IN SHORT:EXCELLENT TOP QUALITY - CERTAINLY AN THE CHOICE FOR SIMPLE LONG LASTING QUALITY PHONE.- EDGE CONNECTIVITY - SUPREME LOUD VOICE AND RECEPTION QUALITY- GREAT CAMERA - GREAT QUALITY PICTURES- FM RADIO - CAN ONLY BE ACTIVATED WHEN PURCHASING A HEADSET (NOT INCLUDED)- LONG BATTERY LIFE.- MADE FROM STURDY MATERIAL - BUILT TO LAST. HAD IT FOR 16 MONTHS - HAD MORE THAN THE USUAL BEAT-UPS OF MY CHILDREN - NO PROBLEMS.
I Love The Nokia 6101 from T-mobile!!! I got it free with Activation from T-Mobile back in the day. It was my first phone and nothing came close to taking its spot. Its one of the best flip phones out there. I would definitely buy another one!!! I had some really great times with the Nokia 6101 from T-Mobile!!!
The first phone I got had problems with the soft key. I took it on vacation and when I came back I told 'Hassel Free' about the problem. They said this was not normal and to send it back and they would send me another one.They did. I got my replacement within 10 days and it works fine ! I have nothing but praise.Thanks .....
THE PHONE THAT I RECEIVED LOOK NEW AND WORKS VERY WELL.  FOR THEPRICE THAT I PAID FOR THE PHONE, EXCELLENT DEAL.  DEBBIE IN WV
I thought that this phone was a piece of junk. I mean, it doesn't even have a camera! I have a propel and my mom has this one in black. When Gustav turned off our power, my phone wouldn't work at all. But my mom's kept going! And when we go to a store like JcPenny in Lafayette, my propel and my sister's sony erisson lose reception almost instanly. My mom's just keeps on going. I'm keeping my propel for how stylish it is...but this little baby is going in my purse as a back up! I'll just get a cute face plate for it.
I just wanted a phone that will call and/or text people and the Nokia 6010 fulfilled my needs and wants! I'm glad it's unlocked because I am an AT&T; user and the cell phone was made for T-Mobile, lol. I laugh all the time because I remember when these types of cell phones (that didn't have a colored screen) were the "it" phones back in my days, lol.If you used to have or use a cell phone with a keyboard or whatever, it'll take some time for you to get used to but it's really no big deal. Because I went from the iPhone to Nokia 6010, yep... it's a big change for me. :)
I am completely satisfied with the cell phone and charger. They both work. I expected nothing less.
This is the 4th phone I have tried with ATT service and it has the best reception.  I have lost a signal twice since I started using it, but that is nothing like the other phones I have tried.  It is just a basic phone, but it is reliable and holds a charge well.
I washed my husbands other phone, which had more bells & whistles, but never picked up very well-never really liked it. Ordered this one as an inexpensive replacement, as we used to have a similar one years ago. Picks up great, good reception. Great basic phone, not a lot of extra stuff we don't use; heavy enough so I can hopefully feel it in his pocket next time I do laundry. Have had it about a month, no complaints for what we need it for: talking, occ. texting.
This is exactly the phone I wanted, and was so happy to have found it. However, the #3 and #5 stick BAD!!! I did send email to seller, but no response. I am not very happy with the phone, and find it hard to believe that it was actually new if the number stick. Unfortunately all my number are 359 or 581 so difficult at best.
The cover is plastic.The signal reception is noty as good as it is mentioned in the reviews.I returned this item try another cell phone.
if you are looking for a cell phone that is robust, has a great reception, extremely simple to use and long battery hours, this is the one. however it has no bluetooth, or IR, and you will have to buy the cable that connects it to the pc seperatly.the camera is not high resolution, but good enough for cellphone wallpapers. the nice feature is the side lights that keep on flashing if you receive a message or a voicemail. the cover and the keypad can be easily changed.
Awesome Product, i am fully satisfied with that nokia produce, i a, long time nokia product user, all though nokia realease this product much earlier but still it is worth.
Bought this phone for my girlfriend for her birthday on November 30, 2008. Phone makes a faint buzzing noise when opened and will not cease and is quite annoying. Also her texts do not work properly, the time stamp is often incorrect and sometimes she doesn't receive the text message until hours later. I am now having to purchase a brand new phone and thought I would let everyone know my experience. Would not recommend this item to anyone.
I ordered this phone and got a used battery, I had to send it back and get refund!
The first phone I received was obviously a used or refurbished phone.  The manual was dogeared and the phone had signs of wear & tear.  The phone's speaker volume was poor.  So I sent it back.  The second phone was functional, but the manual was for another phone.  The packaging was very worn and the cord had obviously been used.  I kept the phone since it worked, but this product is well below the typical amazon quality that I expect.
I loved the phone at first.It worked for about a month and now the screen nore the camera work!!the screen is black!! it won't do anything!!!Even the outside screen is black!!!  and I cannot take any pictures because the screen won't work!!i can call out and get incomming calls but cannot see anything the only way i know who it is is beacuse i set certain ringtones.  I can get texts but of couse cannot read them because the top half of the phone doesn't work!!!!!! i am very careful with my stuff so it was nothing i did. i really like the phone if it would just work right.
The phone works fine but the battery is TERRIBLE!!!!!!  I would have it fully charged before bed, and before the next morning it would be dead. I would have to charge it 5-6 times a day and who has time to do that.  I thought it might just be the one I had so I told Amazon and they sent me another...nope, same exact thing happened, the battery wouldn't last 3 hours (and that's with me not even talking on it). I even tried my old razr battery because it works fine and it did the same thing so it was just those phones. Do not get it, it's a waste of your time!
When I received this phone it was obvious that it was from overseas, the wall adapter that should've allowed it to charge didn't work. For the most part the phone seemed to work but it wouldn't send pictures or receive pictures. I took it to a retailer and spoke to AT&T; Customer Service who were unable to figure out what the issue could be. I ended up ditching the phone. What a waste of $$$$....
Not the fault of the seller, but this phone does not seem to have the quality of my old RAZR, which I used for several years before losing it. For one thing, it keeps dropping the bluetooth connection in my car, which is very annoying when you are making a call, especially in my state where making calls with a handheld phone while driving is illegal. The old RAZR rarely did this. I have to hang up, usually power down the phone and power up again in order to reconnect.Besides that, the battery runs down really quickly with no warning. One minute it looks fully charged according to the display, and the next minute it goes totally dead.
I was very pleased with this phone and I was happy it came with an adapter for US electric outlets, but I wish it would have come a couple days sooner.
I was disappointed with this phone because it has such a short battery life. It needs to be recharged every 4 hours !!!
The phone although in pretty good condition is obviously used, the keypad shows a lot of wear and tear and the battery cover is a different color than the rest of the phone.  Bought this from Adorama Camera.
I bought this unlocked phone for my wife whose phone broke after the warranty expired. I wanted to get a cheap replacement for her until her upgrade was available. The first phone we received was not unlocked and had to be sent back. The customer serviceperson was great. They sent us another phone and a free leather motorolla case. This other phone works on AT&T; networks, but many of the features are hardwired just for T-mobile. It is not very user friendly. Get it for a cheap phone, but not for something you want to use for texting or web.
When I added this to cart to check out, Adorama Camera charged me $16 for expedited shipping and not the advertised $7.95 for Standard shipping. I was lucky I checked the numbers before placing the order.
As this was a gift for my girlfriend who lives in South America, this phone seems to be great choice. It can be used anywhere in the world that is another good quality as you receive USA and international charger with it. Everything works great and she is so happy there are many options in it ( and a lot of memory for your video clips or photos).Hopefully, it will last for a long time. I can suggest this for any gift for your wife or girlfriend or fiance because it is a great cell phone for cheap price!
I bought this for my sister in law and so far she can only rave about it
I recieved this phone and within two days the keypad would not respond. I returned the phone. It took several weeks on some e-mails but I was issued a refund for the phone.
I've had this phone for a whopping 2 months now.Initially, the only problem I had was the typical 'sim card not lining up properly' once in a while issue, but that's pretty classic for most Razr's from what I understand.Now, for the last month, it's stopped ringing, and sometimes stops vibrating as well....Did I forget to mention that there's apparently no way to assign it to accept or send picture messages, because the server settings do not have a "SAVE" button?I know you're thinking, "But the phone's cute, it's pink! and it's SO affordable!"Please don't waste your time or money. Move along. Nothing to see here.
This is a great phone. The best reception I've ever had.  It looks good and works just as well.  I got it for my friend and she loves it!
Got the phone. It was indeed unlocked.But it was programmed as Cingular, which was not stated in the sales add.Can not use any of my cell service features because it is Cingular.But it works for the basic stuff, so I can not complain.For some odd reason, it has a low sensitivity (shows low signal compared with TMobile phone at same location). But otherwise I like the phone.Please include type of programming in sales add, so people can decide.
Pros:Battery Life (with the 1100 mah battery probably the best for a cell phone)Display brightness and colorKey spacing and tactile feelSignal sensitivity (much better than my other high end Nokia 6126, having a stub helps with signal reception vs those which attempt to hide the antenna)Smart Keys (make key functions for you accessible with one button - calculator, recent calls, etc.)Voice Dial (pretty good for a basic phone, but limited to about 7 contacts)Built like a tank (durable)Highly visible outside screen (even in bright sunlight)Not having to work in all the other gimmicks (camera, MP3) allows more focus to be placed on basic phone feature quality.Cons:Functionality of datebook limited (ex. can't repeat item for a limited number of days)Speakerphone not that loudCan't list multiple #s under one person's name in phone listings. (fax, cell, work, etc.)Graphics not that elegant but functionalUser manual really doesn't cover the more subtle functional capability of this phone.Overall, the best buy in a basic flip cell phone. A steal at $40 - $50.Obviously not for the person who wants a camera, radio, MP3 player, photo album, etc., etc., etc.Note: unlocked phones will only provide voice and text messaging services on any GSM network.  The service provider has to set them up to provide multimedia, web access and other services.  Many low end unlocked phones are last year's new but excess inventory for a service provider and will have their logo and service icons on the phone.  This is typical.  You also need the user manual for the manufacturer set PIN and other security #s to initially access the phone's functions.  User manuals can be found online at the manufacturer's web site.
I ordered this phone in spite of reading another review that stated this phone is not unlocked and doesn't work in Italy.  When I first opened the package, my heart sank as I thought that my faith in Amazon had been ill-placed.  The phone had a "Cingular" logo on the front and was an obviously reconditioned unit with one small blemish on the side.  When I turned it on, I saw the Cingular logo and thought "uh oh, locked phone!!"The story has a happy ending however... In Italy, I bought a Telecom Italia (Tim) SIM card, placed it in the phone, and began using it with no problems.  As I type this review, I am sitting in Umbria with the phone at my side.  Definitely a very economical way to call home and call within Italy...10 cents per min or so within Italy to other mobiles, and about 60 cents to call the USA.This is a very basic phone, and many of the menus have leftover Cingular features which don't apply (for example, their now-defunct MEDIA NET).  However, the phone is a nice size, makes calls, receives calls, easy to adjust the ringer.  Comes with a manual, charger etc.A plus is that this phone uses the same mini usb charger as my Blackberry Curve 8310 so I can just carry one charger abroad!I would recommend this phone for travel/vacation use.  For constant use, you might want a phone with more features and less Cingular-legacy branding.Hope this helps! Ciao!
The phone was not new and the battery was changed to a low capacity battery so standby time is about 24 hrs instead of 500 as advertised
I bought this for a monthlong trip to Europe, and it did everything I needed it to.  I bought a SIM card separately (the "free" SIM card you can get with it is a ripoff to use).  Basic texting and calling were very easy and straightforward.
The Motorola V190 is simple to use, has a clear sound and large numbers.  I am a senior citizen and not interested in having a cell phone as my best friend.  I just wanted a phone - period.  The V190 seems to be filling the bill nicely.  There are some features I haven't even attempted to use yet but the good thing is I do not have to.
I ordered this handset with a wee bit of trepidation, because of the earlier reviews.  I received exactly the model described, though, right down to color.It claims to be a Cingular phone, but I've used it with the offered Mobal International SIM card, and with a US T-Mobile pay as you go account.  Both worked a treat.  It's definitely unlocked, as promised.All I want is a phone that can work in most countries.  I have other gadgets to take pictures, browse the web, and play mp3s.  This one suits, and at a most reasonable price.  The sound and signal quality seem about equal to any other mobile phone I've used.  Like most today, it's made in China (sigh), but the construction quality appears to be decent.I also chose the V190 over other models because of the warranty, which is provided by a third party, and because I was in a hurry -- it shipped directly from Amazon.  Sure enough, it arrived right on time.  Maybe they'll restock.The only quirk I found was the date and time displayed when I booted it up under Mobal - US West Coast time, 3 1/2 years ago!  Finally I found the setup option to set time and date manually.  The phone didn't tell me (until I asked it) that the European network I was on, Movistar, doesn't support time and date.  But that's a minor point.I should also note that while this phone will work in the vast majority of countries, it's currently not usable in Japan and Korea -- but then this is true of most GSM triband and quadband handsets, because those nations have nonstandard cellular networks.There are plenty of inexpensive mobile phone options for stay-at-homes, but not quite as many for international travelers.  This one can handle both chores with aplomb.  Recommended.
I had to replace my wonderful 4 year old Motorola.  I was delighted when I found this Motorola one on Amazon--almost a twin to the old one which I had loved.  The price is Great! It is palm sized and fits easily in a purse or pocket, but is not so flat that it is easily misplaced.The phone is not loaded with expensive gimmicks that make it complicated to use, and get in the way of doing what a phone is suppose to do easily and intuitively. It is a no nonsense dependable unlocked phone--Without a contract!  A phone designed to do what a phone was invented for!Unfortunately it came with some processes programmed in for Cingular.  Since my provider (T-Mobile) does not support them, I would have preferred to not have Cingular logos and other items cluttering up the screen.
This phone was my first cell phone.... yes I was one of the last person in NJ to never have owned a phone before. I wanted a phone, not a gadget to surf the internet, etc. This is a good phone, working well and not to difficult to figure out as for the features, even for a first time cell phone owner. I bought my SIM card and minutes and everything worked fine.The SIM card Amazon provides as a UK phone number... so I prefered to buy one from the US!
I dropped my cell in the tub, and "rice-drying" method didn't help.Wanted a simple, working, UNLOCKED no-contract replacement.I am amazed at the simplicity yet power of this reliable phone!Battery is also amazing, I only charged it once a week (stand-by, or at 3-days interval afret heavy use!Amazon and its partners really rock!
Few bells or whistles and sometimes that is a good thing! No camera, but plenty of battery life and simple features. Good call quality. Got it for my wife, she is very happy. I think this one can take the abuse of the real world.
I have owned the Motorola V190 before and they are a good little phone.  However, this phone was listed as US Version when in fact it was Canadian.  No one at Amazon, AT&T; or Motorola in US or Canada could help me.  Therefore I am sending the phone back.  Also it was suppose to be black and it was all silver.
I got it when Amazon (3rd party - Blue Center Inc) when they have it for cheap at $58.48 including shipping, but I didn't get exactly as advertised.I got a silver color unit with Spanish or Portugese manual, and the phone is made in Brazil for South America market. Not the US version, and no warrenty card or things like that inside.The colour is not a big deal. But with one thing not exactly as advertised, I am starting to doubt if it is really unlocked and will it work overseas. It will be quite a few months before I travel to Hong Kong, and I feel the urge to find a way to confirm it is really unlocked.It works well for my Cingular/AT&T; simm card.If it is confirmed unlocked and works overseas, that would be a low cost worthwhile purchase, and I will give it more stars.
It may not have all the bells and whistles of newer phones, but this little dynamo handles the job well.
This phone is perfect for someone looking for a basic phone with no frills. It arrived in a timely manner and works great.
This phone is a very practical one, nice size screen and it fits nicely in your hands. I really like that.  The weak pionts on this phone are; its missing is a camera, you should have different fonts to choose from and you should have been able to put you name on display like the nokia cell phone.
I am sure the phone was fine, however, I had to return it because it was a Cingular phone and we are Alltel.  I went over the product description again and I surely didn't see where it specified what carrier was associated with the phone.
I am trying to decide if I order this phone if I will really receive an unlocked phone. There are conflicting reviews on this phone. Some say it is unlocked and others say it is a cingular phone. WELL, what is it.
I ordered the PEBL U6... It arrived quickly (1/4 star)... The battery compartment cover plate was missing from the package and the phone was obviously used or quasi-refurbished... Amazon's return and replace was quick and easy (1/4 star)...Second phone was sent next day (1/4 star)... But, again, the battery compartment cover plate was missing from the package and the phone was obviously used or quasi-refurbished... Amazon's return and refund was quick and easy (1/4 star)...The phone should be 0 stars... Amazon's service was excellent, but this phone has some serious issues from the third party.
Overall Rating:  Meh...I hated it least of all available 'out of contract' unlocked choices...still do.  Will keep until I find another militaristic-looking rubber-coated beauty that works well as a phone.  (Only better...)Looks are incomparable.  If they'da lost ALL the shine, they would have been perfect.  (And it fits in your pocket too!!!)  Good to excellent call quality.  Lousy menus, maddening phone book and battery life is a joke.1.  Slick looks with a cool rubberized matte skin and a sweet spring-open feature.2.  Hard to tell from the picture, but the hinge is chrome.  REALLY SHINY CHROME.3.  The screens and keypad surface are also extremely shiny and TOTAL fingerprint magnets.  Keypad is flat with ridges, sorta slippery and not the easiest to use.4.  Menu functions are virtually incomprehensible, with stuff buried in nonsensical places.5. Phone book difficult to use, especially multiple numbers under one entry.  (My sim from a four-year-old tits-up Samsung couldn't figure out how to do it, so it gave every number a separate entry with the same name.)  I gave up after a while and simply annotated each separate name with 'cell', 'home', etc.5.  Excellent call quality.6.  Battery life as delivered was a joke--bought a brand-new battery from my provider (paying $37 to avoid the 2-year-old dud batteries so prevalent on the 'net) but the phone still must be charged nightly, or the low power alarm WILL wake you up in the middle of the night.  (And I don't talk much.)In sum:  If you want a phone that works well as a basic phone and has a slick, militaristic look that can't be beat, buy this.  If you want user-friendly software and a 'feature rich' high-tech goody-box that must be strapped to your belt, look elsewhere.(But it'll only get shinier...)NEW SPARTA
This is a good cell phone model. It has pleasing style lines, folds compactly in an attractive package, and is sharp looking in its simplicity. It always had good signal capabilities and a good battery life with good stand by and talk times. It's also fairly compact, although not the smallest of phones, and well protected from falls and such. You will see some scarring on the case texture if dropped on a harsh surface but this applies to pretty much every type of phone. It tends to be more visible on this phone's finish but I have to say I do prefer this finish to the "cold plastic" feel of other phones. One thing to watch out for is that the buttons are hard to find in the dark and/or when not looking directly at it since the tactile feedback bars are somewhat recessed into the keypad, and the screen will perpetually be somewhat greasy from your cheeks unless you're compulsively good at cleaning it after every call (Get a case or use bluetooth). Overall this is a very comfortable, sharp-looking phone with an awesome 1-handed flip out (uses magnets to stay close, so it could double as a very inefficient money clip, heh).
i purchased the phone two week ago and all of sudden the phone is broken. I have yet to have dropped the phone, and it did not fall in water. the screen came in already broken and i just noticed it now..never again will i order from them because i have been ordering from amazon a really long time and this is the first time something has came into me messed up..10 thumbs DOWN!
Razr V3i is a good phone with easy to use features. The included pair of headphones work great with music and micro-SD slot gives additional storage. I am using a 2 gb micro-SD card and it works great. However, there are issues with the battery charging. When tried to charge directly with included charger, the battery never reached fully charged status even after 24 hrs of continuous charging. I have replaced the battery but the problem remains the same. I took out the battery from phone and tried charging with a desktop charger and this time it worked. Now I am using two batteries - one in phone and one on desktop charging cradle. Big pain, but this is only way to make use of money I have spent on this phone.
O.K. I was browsing Amazon looking for phone cases when I saw the SLVR!! I bought an Iphone recently and had to shelve the SLVR but for anyone that needs a reliable phone with decent video and camera quality don't hesitate on this! I used this phone for 4 years and it held up like a champ and could go for 3-4 days without charging.(Whereas Iphone needs a daily charge) I used this phone a lot on a day to day basis too.  I had also dropped this phone a number of times but it's resilient and sturdy enough to have never caused any damage.(Unlike my new phone where you if you drop it from 1 foot off the ground you run the risk of cracking the glass and then paying [...] at the crazy Apple store to get it fixed.)  All in all I would say that this was the best phone I ever bought and the only reason I upgraded was because I needed a GPS feature (GoogleMaps on Iphone). The Iphone is awesome, but you expect that because essentially it's a smartphone/small computer. If I had to choose the best phone I've ever played with(that includes camera, video camera, games, functionality, battery and size) then I'd say this phone is the best. I'm keeping the SLVR just because I will probably be using this phone again one day!
I let my infant son suck on my Nokia flip phone and afterwards it was stuck permanently in headset mode. I'm a T-mobile user, though not particularly happy with T-mobile, so rather than getting a new phone there and re-upping my contract for another year or two, I bought this guy instead -- $75.There's not much to say: pop out old SIM card, pop it in here, and you're good to go. Happy customer, end of story!I'm not really into phones, so I can't comment much on the advanced features. But it works, the sound quality is good. I have had the phone more than a week and only charged it when I first got it. So battery life is nice.That's it.Oh, PS: an easy way to get your phonebook off your old phone is to transfer all your contacts onto the SIM card. (This is not a problem if you have fewer than 200 friends). Then when you plug the card into the new phone, all the contacts are there. You may want to move some/all of them into your phone's memory so that you can assign them shortcuts.Oh, PPS. My phone has "English" spellings in the menus, like "personalise," so when I'm using it I feel a bit more Euro than usual. :)
I ended up getting the RAZR about 3 1/2 years ago.  I had it for two weeks and hated it--it was too cumbersome, I hated that it flipped and, quite frankly, it was just ugly.  My friend was the opposite--she got the SLVR and hated it, so we traded.I really never had any problems with this phone until it was on its last leg THREE YEARS later.  How often does a phone actually withstand daily use and abuse and still work after that period of time??  I never had it in a case and always carried it in my back pocket and very rarely carried it in my purse.PROSThe speakerphone and regular earpiece were always clear (unless there was crappy reception.)Small enough to fit in my back pocket without even feeling it.Battery lasted FOREVER!!  I didn't send 500 texts a day, though.  I probably sent about 20 texts and spent 3ish hours daily on the phone and would only need to recharge it twice a week.iTunes was a nice feature.The flat keys seemed difficult to begin with, but after getting used to them were much easier to use when typing quickly.Can assign the soft keys and middle arrow keys to be whatever shortcuts you want--I've had other phones that don't have this feature.  It makes life much easier.Lasted THREE YEARS!CONSOk, so the camera sucked.  But if you want a camera... buy a camera.By the end of the three years it started to reset itself in the middle of calls.
I purchased this phone to take with me on my move to South America.  Worked well for about 1.5 months, then slowly started turning itself off, locking up and requiring me to remove the battery to restart, sometimes would say it had no SIM, etc... then the battery got to where it would not take a charge.  The phone is in my closet and is now useless.  A few months before this one, I purchased a similar phone for my wife (a RAZR) and it has done extremely well... I think it is a crap shoot when you buy one of these "unlocked, no warranty" phones... it may be great or it may be a... well... you know what.
This is a good value product that completely cover what I was expecting from it. Is really an open cell phone. I have used it as a family back up phone and have worked well with 3 different local operators.The battery was not keeping full charge,but after a small conditioning recover a good part of its power capacity.Simple to use phone with a lot of features for this price.
THe produce is doing fine. I have not had any issues. I am satisfied for the money I paid.
My phone was not unlocked as I got it thru AT&T; (Cingular back then).  Overall the phone was awesome, much better then expected with great reception and sound quality.Highly recommended.
I order slvrL7 unlocked phone with camera, mp3. is came ealier than I expectd. it worked good with AT&T;,no warranty but they came in new. I like it.
Purchased as a replacement phone instead of going through local office. Bought at a fantastic price. Arrived quickly and functions just as well as the one it replaced.
I ordered this phone to use in Europe with a SIM card, and it works pretty well so far.  I just wanted a simple but not ugly phone, and this one was worth the money.
I thought this phone had everything I was looking for:  thin, inexpensive, has a camera.  While it is all of these things, it has some serious shortcomings.  True:  this phone is going on three years old since it was first introduced, but I expected better from Motorola.First, the good.  The form factor is really nice.  It's super thin and nice to carry in your pocket.  The camera is decent, especially for being VGA resolution.  The screen is bright, and the phone looks really sleek.But with the good comes the bad:  Due to its thin-ness, it can be uncomfortable to hold in your hand for extended periods, and it can be uncomfortable against the ear as well.  It might not be so uncomfortable if the earpiece volume were sufficient but that is not at all the case.  Even at the maximum volume, this phone is almost impossible to hear in areas with any significant background noise.  Just walking outside near a reasonably quiet street can completely overwhelm the earpiece.  This is unacceptable to me.  The keys are incredibly small, as well.  I have fairly large hands, and this is a small form factor phone after all, so this may not be the most valid criticism, but I find myself constantly hitting # when I want to hit 9, and end or the circle key when I mean to hit 3.  I have to use my fingernails to press the buttons.  It's infuriating.Finally, the phone I received was clearly a remanufactured item.  There is a deep gouge in the phone housing underneath the battery cover and a slight scratch on the side of the phone.  Also, it did not include a set of earphones, and the accessories looked to have been just thrown into the box; there was no protective packaging for the accessories nor the phone itself.In all, the phone isn't what I thought it would be, and I'm returning it, and the lack of sufficient earpiece volume was really the final nail in the coffin.
It works but I don't get great reception, the sound quality is only ok and the buttons are hard to push
This phone worked pretty well for the first few days and then started to display the error message "Please insert SIM card". This displayed whether I would turn it off and back on or not. My SIM card was already in place and I checked to make sure it was making contact with the surface responsible for reading my SIM card. I used to work for Cellular One, so I'm not new to this type of equipment. I believe this may be a simple hardware issue, but I'm not about to look into it. Just returned mine to Amazon.com and waiting for a refund to purchase a different product. I think this is all on the manufacturer so I wouldn't hesistate to buy my next one through Amazon but I wouldn't jump at the chance to buy again from Motorola.
L7 is nice, but it's battery only last 24 hrs. I have to recharge it everyday.
After reading the reviews here at Amazon, I thought i found a cell phone exactly what i was looking for.  I ordered the phone, it looked thin, cute etc. etc....Since this is an International version, there is no warranty on this product, the phone takes some time to get used to and as it claims in the specification, does not hold a charge for that long.  Mine holds charge for about a day or two.  I dont use much other features on this phone.  Overall call clarity is good.
It said that it came with earbud headphones.  It does not.It said it had iTunes on it.  It does not.The description raves about how the phone "shines as a music player," but the manual does not tell you how to put music on it.  After hours of internet searches, I found there is a program called Motorola Phone Tools you can buy for an additional $50.00.  And I'm pretty sure that this extra program you have to buy to make you "music phone" work is not Mac compatible.I feel lied to and am disappointed in Amazon for not regulating the reviews on this product.Why did I spend some extra money on a music phone if it won't play any music?  Will someone explain this to me?
This product worked great for my intended use. Which was international calling from the Philippines. The only draw back that I discovered was it will not send or receive picture mail.TerrieColorado
Good product. Bought for my mom. The only bad side to it is that it doesn't have a Spanish language mode. Besides that it gets good reception and its very practical.
I had previously purchased a slvr but when it arrived it was not what I had ordered. It was not black and it was not unlocked. It was quite disappointing. A short time after, my handbag with the phone in it was stolen. I then ordered this slvr. This time I got what I wanted and I am quite satisfied to date.
This is the worst phone I ever had. Can't see the keyboard cause its not lighted and thats the biggest problem I had with this model
So whoever allegedly "quality checked" these phones should be deported.  The phone is in Spanish, and spent over an hour and still couldn't get it to English.  The phones are refurb, not new.  I got 2, and each comes with its own cosmetic defects.So I did managed to make and receive a few calls from my pure Spanish guessing.  It's volume and signal strength is average at best.What a waste of money and time.
I bought this direct from Amazon, and their "unlocked" phone is technically unlocked, but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that, "branded" is a euphemism for "hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff."  I guess "branded" is shorter than saying all that.This is not a "clean" L7.  You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone, although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant "permission", while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate.
This could have been okay as a basic phone.. but this phone has some major problems.So you are better off paying a bit up and finding a better model without the hassles.a) There is no dedicated headset jack; I think you are supposed to use the micro-USB to connect earphones/mic. Good luck finding that while on the road if you don't have one. Using it as a music player with regular headset is ruled out because of this.b) The bluetooth connection is not stereo. So it is not useful for music -- I am not even sure this one will play music through bluetooth headset.c) The micro-SD slot doesn't want to read a 2GB card. I am not talking about SDHC -- but just regular SD format. I think I saw a mention of 512K limit somewhere. Good luck finding a 512K card.d) without a working SIM this phone doesn't want to do anything. Basically a power consuming brick. Not sure if all the GSM phones behave that way, but I find that annoying all the same.e) Don't be taken in by the Mobal card offer worth $20 talk time. Requires a credit card with you on the hook for any calls (you supposedly) made -- also $2.50/min charge for pretty much any number in the world -- incoming and outgoing. Pretty steep. If you are completely out of options in an emergency it may be worth it -- but a little bit of planning should save you 80-90%.
This phone started off as an ok, basic music phone.  The main problem with it was that it only plays songs encoded at 192 kbps or less. That means MP3s sold on Amazon (256 kbps) need to be downgraded to be played on the phone.  Even then some songs wouldn't play. Also, the phone doesn't have an MP3 jack, so you have to buy a converter.  After using the phone a couple months, it started acting up and wouldn't charge.  Eventually, I couldn't get the phone to charge and it died completely.  I got replacement batteries and replacement charging cables, but the phone remains dead.  Getting it repaired costs more than replacing it.
I bought this phone for me dad for his birthday.  When I received the package, only the phones and battery was in the box, there was no charger, CD, manual or any other accessories. What is even worst is when i visited my dad a week later the phone wasn't black anymore, the paid has completely pealed off and the phone was looking a mess.  This is unfortunate since when you make a purchase you usally want quality for your month. When I bought this I bought two nokia 5800 and todate I have no regrets for the Nokia.10/16/2009:  The phone is currently not working...Terrible!!!1
I like this phone, the most that i like is that you can record video, the only thing is that is a vga so the pictures an videos are not excellet. the phone hss a microSD slot but i tried insert a 2 GB memory and i didn't work so i put a 128 mb memory and works fine.
"The SLVR L7 is a messaging and wireless Internet powerhouse. Support is built in for sending and receiving pictures, text, graphics, sound, and video via messages."This is in the phone description but i am unable to send or receive picture messages. Whenever i try to send one it says unable to send.  When i try to receive one it says unable to down load  And i have no idea how to get music onto the phone.Other than that it's a cool phone. i'm just very disappointed about the messaging and music
Recieved the phone today, and placed SIM and battery in and powered on and got invalid battery message. It picks up the SIM card and network fine, but unable to charge it or read battery level due to Invalid Battery Error. Back to Amazon it goes.
My Gosh! I can't open the battery door. I press every button arount the body and I try to push the back door ahead. It still stick tightly to the body.
After reading the bad reviews, I reluctantly bought one of these phones, however for only $10 I decided to give it a shot anyway. I read the start-up instructions (very clear step by step with pictures) and did accordingly. I activated the phone using the tracfone website and I have to say that it was easy and fairly quick. The phone was activated in literally minutes and it has been working beautifully ever since. The phone itself is a good quality piece of hardware for the money and it has a bright and colorful screen and backlighting. Signal strength has been excellent (3-5 bars) just about everywhere I have been so far. The phone sounds loud and clear and it has more features than I expected. The airtime cards have been working smoothly and the minutes+expiration date rollover everytime you redeem minutes. I have not dealt with their customer service, but if anything goes wrong I can always buy another one for $10 and reactivate the number. Tips to keep cost to a minimum: buy the double minute card before any other cards. Do not setup your voicemail option, you will know the number of the person that has called without losing minutes or if you set it up, check the messages using a different phone, it does not take away any minutes that way (call your number, wait for it to go to voicemail, press star and then your pin number and you are in). Buy airtime cards at any major retailer, pharmacy, 711s and supermarkets, it is easier than doing it online and less aggravating. Do not give out the number to everyone, it can run into real money if used too much, this phone is meant for sporadic and emergency use only. Also, when you register online all you need is the long string of numbers that comes on a card within the package, your email address, your zip code and the zip code of the area where you will be using it most. All other info they request (name, home number, birth date) is not required and you can even skip it or lie about it. The only complaint goes to the ringtones, they are very 80ish style, very cheesy. Also there is no speakerphone built-in. Overall: VERY GOOD!
This was a great little phone (more detailed review in the next paragraph), I say was because I am a bit of a Tracfone new model junkie and tend to purchase their latest and greatest (in the last year I have been through the W376g, the V170, the V176.  I am mainly writing this because Tracfone is an HONEST company and will NOT steal your identity as previously noted by another reviewer who I think is rather disgruntled with Tracfone.  Because I have been a customer for at least 8 if not more years and have dealt with their customer service more times than I can count.  They never ask for your social security number...NEVER!  I actually miss this phone which I used for about a year...yes, it's basic, no bells and whistles phone, but the reception is great.  It is a tad slow to start up, but I keep my phone on all the time so that wasn't too much of a bother.  Great signal reception!  It is nearly impossible to get reception in our local WalMart, however, this little phone never had a problem.  Employees used to ask what kind of phone it was because their own fancy schmancy phones wouldn't work.  My current Tracfone (an LG225) does not get reception their either.  So that makes me want to dig out my c139 and reactivate it...It also never dropped a call and back then I was on the cell a bit more than I am now.  It's solid, durable and the battery time is awesome.  My heading does say I pay around $7.00 a month for my phone.  I should point out that my current phone came with double minutes for life of the phone.  I buy a 60 minute card every 90 days for around $20.00 and I get 120 minutes.  Most of the time I can find a promotional code where it will give you bonus minutes.  Another great thing with the tracfone is that you NEVER lose your minutes as long as you purchase airtime by the due date.  Even the best rollover plan out there for pay by the month cell plans only lets you roll over for 12 months.I will take the time to write my reviews on the LG225 and others, but the more I write, the more I think I will reactivate this little phone (and add that double minutes for life card!) because even though the bells and whistles are nice and fun for a while, what I really want is a reliable, solid phone.  And that is what this phone is.
If you have a child who you want to carry a cell phone, but don't want to pay lots of money for all of the extras (or if you yourself just want a "basic" phone), this is a good value for the money.  Large screen displays numbers very clearly.  Sound quality is good.  Battery life is a little short and the phone cannot be used while it is charging (that's a pretty big negative, IMO).  But overall, this is a good starter phone and serves the purpose.  If you just want a dependable phone to carry with you in case of emergencies, this phone fits the bill nicely.
I love this phone.  It's compact, different and pretty easy to use.  But please be aware that the functions are in Chinese when the phone arrives.  It took a good while talking with tech support before we could get the language switched over.  The amount of space for music and other files seems a little low as well.  But I would still recommend this phone.
I've own this phone for about a year now and now I'm looking for a replacement. I absolutely can't stand the phone.CON 1:Texting is ridiculously hard. There are 2 ways to text. Using an onscreen QWERTY keyboard, or using the onscreen writing recognition ability. The Recognition really is a great idea and fun at first, but I find that it almost never can accurately recognize a full word. I have to write in all caps in order for it to distinguish letters well. a o e u p all get mistaken. ! = i. So I have to rely on caps, which I don't like writing in. And even then it is prone to errors. Sure you will wow people when you show them the ability, but its kind of impractical to actually use. The other way to text is with a QWERTY keyboard onscreen. Howerver, the each letter is about the size of the stylus, which means you have to use the stylus in order to accurately text. Even a childs thumb would be too big to accurately press the keys. Which brings me to my next point:Con 2:The stylus. Yes the stylus inclusion is nice, especially since its almost required. It has a nice extending ability so that it fits in the phone but can be extended to better fit in your hand. Sadly I lost mine, which is really not that hard because it is kind of slippery and has no real grip. So i figured, no big deal, I'll buy a new one. Sadly, because the phone is not offered in the US, the stylus's are not either, so you can't buy the right one. I tried a few different ones, such as DS's, but none fit into the slot correctly. I found ones to order over seas but it would cost me almost [...] bucks for a 20 cent product.... So now I have to use the phone with my fingers, which is next to impossible. My main purpose of the phone is texting, which like I said is hard without the stylus, so I often find myself wanting to send long texts but too lazy to put forth the effort to do so.Cont 3: The Voice Dialing is too easy to activate. Its just a button on the side that you press if the phones open. Sometiems when I'm using my phone I accidently push it which starts up a loud and annoying speech. PLEASE SAY A COMMAND! PLEASE SAY A COMMAND! DID YOU SAY DAD? DID YOU SAY DAD? Its extremely embarsing when it goes off. It should really require a double click or something to go off.Con 4: The vibration is iffy. Sometimes I can barely feel it vibrate in my had.Con 5: Cheep. If I drop it, the battery cover pops off, the battery flies out, etc. And I really don't drop it that much. The clear screen has a large crack in it. The silver siding has peeled. My phone within a few months looked like it was years old. At least it has a protector over the touch screen! Plus now the flip cover flies open and is very loose.Con 6:Smudges. Most touchscreen devices are like this but the screen gets really gross looking. They should at least provide a cloth...Con 7: The charger. It comes with a wall charger, but I did something dumb and broke it... which I don't blame them for, however, again I can't get the charge in the us. I have to order it overseas... So now I rely on the usb charger which is a pain when I want to plug it in at night and talk to my girlfriend in bed.Con 8: Low battery. All I do is text. I don't call much, I don't play games or use the internet at all. I just text, and yet I have to charge the thing almost daily. The vibrations kill the battery. And I think the system itself is just draining resources and battery life.Pros:Copy Paste Select All abilities. Makes texting and typing easier.Texts open in separate windows, as do programs. You can keep several things running at once without noticing a slow down.Good calendar system.Excellent sound quality and signal with AT&T.; I've used 3 phones including this one in my area which has a weak AT&T; coverage and the other phones were not able to hold calls well and lost connection a lot. But this phone gives me signal in areas I never could before. And its always crystal clear. Its something I really love about this phone.Its cool. Every time I pull it out in public, I get, is that a phone? Can I see it? Thats so cool. They love the clear cover. And I love the attention. Sadly it does not function up to its appearance.
This is one of the best phone I ever had. I say had because a own 2 of them and both got stolen. But anyway, the features are great, 2mp camera takes pretty good pics in good light, but no effect, it also had macro mode, as alot of other 2mp camera phones, the BCR works perfect, never really got the barcode reader to work. The touchscreen is responsive and the flip is awesome, you barely notice the wires running up to the speaker. The volume on mine was pretty loud and battery life was ok, about a day and a half with moderate use. There are some nice games out for it, I personnaly recommend midnight pool. It also supposts multiple apps running at the same time, such as browser and a game. It runs linux OS which makes it the perfect OS for 3rd party apps. The reception and call clarity are both pretty good. The hand writing recognition is very accurate and you can adjust the speed at which handwriting locks in a character. Music can be controlled without opening the phone.This phone can do so much if you know where to look for how to do them ;D.All in all, I highly recommend this phone for anyone  who is looking for a good touchscreen phone for multimedia.
Wow...great phone.  Screen resolution is really impressive...and was rather pleasantly surprised by the fact that I could play movies using the full screen...not expected for a phone this inexpensive.  This version was the international version, so there are some down sides.  Due to the version/model number, there aren't good games available for free download that work...lots available, but they don't work after being downloaded...that's a drag.  But as for the functionality of the phone, camera, and music player...top notch.  Battery life is very very good as well.  The 2.5mm receptacle was a disappointment, but a $5 adapter took care of that problem.Overall, this phone is super.
It has terrible battery life. My cell phone last only 6 hours and I have to recharge it. I do not recommend this cell phone to anyone although it has nice graphic and easy-to-use programs. What could we do with short battery life?
This phone was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  She thinks it's cool and easy to use.  She enjoys it very much.
For me this is a really great phone for all my communication needs. It's also stylish, cute and small.
HAD THIS ON MY WISH LIST FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS SAVING $ UP TO PURCHASE, SOOOO WELL WORTH IT !
The sony ericsson w810i  phone that was advertised says it's new, but the phone I recieved via mail was used also there was some picture in the memory card of the phone. It was used and it was in an old box. I was so disappointed.The Vibecellular is good in delivery time not in the product quality. I advice you all not to buy produect from this vendor.[...]
The phone has come with the old battery. It was holding only 25% of charge and died after 2 charges. The seller didn't respond to my message. So after waiting for a while I have to buy a replacement OEM battery. The other consideration - the phone is actually a Cingular cell phone and it comes with a lot of software linked to Cingular network. The software can't be uninstalled or removed by firmware reflash. The seller should mention that fact in unit's description! After all the phone is just fine. The battery, seller and firmware are real disappointments.
Every time I buy a new phone I try to find one that tops my old phone in every way. I've had this phone for over 2 years now. Has always worked reliably with good reception. The only thing that prevents it from being perfect is that it's now out of date, the flash is a constant on LED that's blindingly bright in a dark place, and there is no 3.5 headphone jack. I'm looking at getting the HTC Fuze now.. Heard it's better if you're a geek like me who wants something to play with, but will miss the easy functionality and compact form of my trusty w810.
I've had this phone for a couple years and overall its a pretty good phone. It feels and looks well constructed, although I do not care much for the few orange color buttons and screen. The screen itself is a decent size and good quality. Sony Ericson phones are typically the best for talk and standby time, and this one is no different, with something like 8-9 hours talk time. I don't use my cell phone that often, and I frequently found that when I did pull out my old nextel phone to use, it was dead. This sony phone typically still has some juice left for me to make my calls.I got this phone for about $150 with a 2 year contract through AT&T.; I got the cheapest rollover minutes plan, which if you are like me, and you don't use your phone alot for calls, you will save up a redicously large amount of minutes, for up to 12 months. (you lose rollover minutes that are beyond 12 months).There were also 3 separate rebates that were supposed to take the phone down to $0, but as I'm sure they expect, it was so difficult, I simply forgot to send them in. You need the bar code on the box for each rebate and purchase receipts, and one had to be sent in within 30 days, and another in the fourth month, and another in the fifth month. Still $150 for this phone when it was new was pretty good, especially considering that it was otherwise selling for $400-500 when it was new.The phone sports a 2mp camera, and an mp3 player, two devices I really wanted in my phone. I bought a GB card for the phone and downloaded all my mp3's to the phone. The software for that comes for the downloading the files, is not very good, but it got the job done. The speaker for this phone for both calls and music is awful, especially considering this is a walkman phone. My 5 year old nextel phone had a far superior speaker. I don't like earbuds, so I didn't really test the ones that came with the phone. However hooked up with a pair of headphones, my mp3's sound pretty good. Strangely, the music volume always seems to return to a default level, and I have to keep raising the volume.The 2mp camera works well, and frankly I cannot tell the difference between pictures taken with it and my supposedly superior 8mp sony camera. Both devices take good pictures. This phone has about a 5 second delay between taking pictures though, which I found to be a bit much. It also takes video. With the 2GB card I purchased, even with all my downloaded music, I still have more then enough room for taking pictures and videos. Without purchasing a memory card though, there is very little internal memory, something like 30mb. You will need a memory card to take full advantage of the this phone's camera and music features.The phone is too small, and only comes about half way down my cheek. I miss my flip phone here, and am considering going back to one. The buttons are also a bit too small, however they are raised, providing good tactile feel.The biggest problem I had, is that in the first year my phone got a blank white screen. I contacted Sony Ericson and they said it was a software glitch. The phone was incapable of downloading the software updates and fixes, so I had to send it in. I got back in a reasonable amount of time, however, it was a refurbished phone, and not the one I sent in. Still, since getting back, the phone has worked fine.
Got this as a birthday gift in 2006. It's my second SE phone (first was the T68i).The entire time I've had this phone, never had "ANY" issue with it; no lock-ups/freezing...nothing. The phone simply worked like a charm. Great walkman phone, takes good pics (for a 2MP camera), and perfect size.The only reason I retired this phone, is I got another phone as birthday gift this year; and it's also a SE phoneI HIGHLY RECOMMEND this baby.
I like the product that I purchased, and I am very satisfied with the delivery time and the customer service. Thank you Amazon.com
This was clearly refurbished.  The pink plates didn't even match and some of them were worn and dirty looking.  It's also set with Cingular backgrounds and logos, I have T-Mobile.  Didn't like that either.  If they sell something for 100.00 and say it's new, it should be new!
Razr has been a good phone for us - this one is for my wife, it's her second RAZR, her first lasted 3.5 years, which is a long life for a celphone. She liked it so much she just wanted another one. Vibe Cellular was good too - they originally sent us the wrong color, but I think it was an honest mistake (sent the fuschia pink instead of the satin pink). I contacted them and sent the phone back, and had the new one a few days later. They threw in a leather case for our inconvenience, which was nice. Overall a good response for a simple problem; I think they handled it right. Phone has been great so far, no problems to report...
This phone seems to be more about design and look than it is about overall usability.While the phone is pretty compact it is too much so. Its easy enough to carry around but when I would go to use it is when I ran into trouble.First is it was a bit difficult to open. There wasn't enough of an edge to let my thumb open it up quickly.Second was the phones operating system. While I was able to get a bit used to it, it wasn't very intuitive and it would take me awhile to locate the correct button or menu.Part of the phones programing is an auto fill in feature when you are texting. It starts to guess the word you are trying to type as you are typing it. This was very counter productive and caused me to have way more errors than usual. I wasn't alone on this one, I have had friends that use the same phone and I get some of the weirdest text that make you go "huh?".Lastly was the keypad. Again, it's a very slim line phone but because of that the buttons are flush and near impossible to use to dial or text quickly.
It came okay but it's not all the same color. I love pink and I don't care much about the shades,actually I'm lazy, that's why I did not returned it.
Even though the phone is functioning normally, the phone has scratches and one of the side button on the hinges was not there.  The phone does not have any new phone look.The Amazon website should have mentioned the fact in their webpage, if it is a used one or a remanufactured one so that the buyer would have an idea in advance.  I have purchased this phone from Amazon (though we had local sellers of the same phone where we could have bought the phone with 100% satisfaction) just because I had very good past experience with Amazon and almost all the purchases we make through Amazon.I did not have time to return it as I gifted that to my sister hence I advise other users to check it atleast once after you receive the item.
I didn't really want to write a review for this, because I hate saying anything negative, ever, but I believe other consumers should be informed when deciding on a purchase.The phone is cute, I'll give you that much, but other than that, it has been nothing but a headache from the moment I received it. I purchased it from Amazon, not an independent seller, and it was listed as 'new' and 'unlocked'. It was, in reality, neither of those things. It took me forever to track down the subsidy password from AT&T;, just to unlock the phone. Then, there were all kinds of settings from the previous owner, so I knew it wasn't 'new'. Also, the battery would die after 6 hours, even with the power off. Replacing the battery only added two more hours to the charge.I contacted Amazon about the issues, of course. They couldn't send a replacement because they said it was out of stock, and I couldn't return for a full refund, because I had brought the phone with me to Germany, and didn't have the original packing, and the charger had been lost when my an outside pocket on my luggage ripped. I had to settle for a crummy $16 refund for choosing to keep the phone (I had no other option). So, I'm out $60 and I have a phone that is useless.I would highly suggest to anyone considering this phone to think long and hard about whether the problems are worth it with. To me, they aren't.
I purchased this item for my teenage daughter. Delivery was prompt, phone is in good shape..very good looking phone..and trust me that is ALL!!! It wouldnt take the sim card..and then all of a sudden it started working...camera wont work, cannot send text or receive them...battery is pathetic...it does not hold a charge..charge it overnight and get one minute of talk time...I am very dissappointed actually I had to buy another phone in its place..and the company would not replace it or reimburse my money  (around $69.99 , w/o tax& shipping)
I just got the phone today. I was skeptical the whole time after reading all of the reviews on here. I love the phone. The color is a little different than what is shown but hey I love pink and it's pink. It came brand new with everything still wrapped up and with the screen and keypad protectors all over it. Easy to install everything and very simple. The camera is alright and the texting is a little slow but it's a great phone for what I'm going to use it for. I think it's adorable and I'm happy with it. I will not be returning it. Not as of today...I guess we'll see how it goes in the next 30 days. =]
I like the phone and aside from the battery not working and having to purchase another one.  The only thing that i found wrong was the color.  I ordered a satan pink phone and they sent me a hot pink phone.  I guess you get what you pay for isnt that the old saying
Well I liked the phone but it wont keep a charge so I to spend another [...] bucks to order a battery on line. I don't know if the battery I ordered is any good.  I think its some kind of conspiricy to get more money out your pocket I guess times are really hard. Other than that the phone really worked great.
I love this phone and the fact that I can change the SIM card.  It works great!
Great phone for my daughter in Europe and USA.  Works great. Durable.  Standard mini-USB power connection. Thanks!
If your screen is blank, or dark blue, power your phone down by taking out the battery. Put the battery back in and get a toothpick. With the phone off, and the phone in the closed position, pinch the toothpick through and push down the power button till it goes on. It may take a few tries, but it worked for me, my screen went on, and I was able to continue using my phone. My suggestion would be to get your contacts off, in case it doesn't work again.Good Luck.
First, I'd like to say this phone is utterly the best value on the market for the features you're getting. A savvy shopper could find this phone for $200. And the Nokia 5530XM goes for $180 (difference is it has no 3G).This thing has wifi and it's an absolute Godsend. Nothing else in this price range has wifi. Maybe they have "mobile" internet, but then you'll be racking up a $30+ data charge each month. Another great thing about this phone is that it uses sd cards. That way, you can replace every once in a while and not have to delete anything. This thing also has a decent screen (twice the pixels of an iPhone despite being smaller). There's also rave reviews out there about the quality of the music. It also has a decent 3.2 Megapixel cam. That's better than the new Palm Pixi. This thing has all the features of the $500 phones. The key difference is that its 3G is slow and it has lower RAM at 128 MB (compared to most higher end phone's 256 MB). This number is acceptable at the price you're paying.Now for the bad part. It's with the deepest regret that I must support the account of the first reviewer. I completely believe this thing will break down on you. In the first few days I've owned this phone, it's freezed 3 times on me already. One time it was just when I was random browsing. Another time it freezed on me when I connected it to my laptop. Finally, one time I turned it on and it wouldn't recognize the touchscreen. The bottom buttoms were fine but the touchscreen stopped responding. However, I've read from another person on the internet with the same experience and (despite constant freezing), it didn't stop working like the person's did above. I don't think this phone will last much longer than 2 years.Overall, it's a good phone but it's rather unstable.
phone died in 5 days. 4 and counting attempts by nokia to repair  SAME ISSUEif you find anything wrong. RETURN for REFUND immed if possible.Purhcased at NYC flagship store. I had the phone working for 1st 5 days. When the battery started to discharge, i tried charging. It didnt charge at all. Store gave me new battery saying battery was at fault. Again same issue. It wudnt even turn on with the charger connected - so clearly its not just battery problem. By the time this battery discharged , the 14 day return period was over - pretty sure they knew it.Then started the saga of sending to nokia service center - PALCO. Already sent 4 times. each time had to ship back same evening or next day. Same problem for "repaired" "replaced" and "repaired again" phone.First they claim its "repaired", then 2nd time they claim "cannot be repaired...so replaced"...why did they send it then?but the so called replaced also had same issue - how can this be co-incidence?again sent...they claim repaired....but same issue.When i call....they dont agree to send me a courtesy phone since its clearly their mistake and 4 attempts are enough to figure out im being cheated.They wont give me refund or replacement.They wont even agree to send me a email saying they take responsibility to resolve the issue.5 is not my lucky number....i have no hope it will get resolved.looks like they will continue playing ping-pong till end of 12 months.WORST set of people.Bottom line: NEVER BUY UNLOCKED PHONES- even if its nokia flagship storeNEVER BUY NOKIARETURN WHEN YOU CAN
I ordered Nokia 5800 from Bigtime Wireless and it came fast all the way to Nepal and the phone works great. The Nokia 5800 has great features and I highly recommend the phone and the seller. I am buying another one soon from Bigtime Wireless.
This is a good cheap international phone.  I used it in the UK.  It is pretty much a basic mobile phone.
How does this company have 97 percent positive reviews?  This phone cost me $19 new and I was trying to find another one.  What a rip off!!
I recently purchased LG KG800 Chocolate.  I liked its presentation and its reception is really good.  Only one thing which might be a problem with users is that its navigation buttons are too sensitive.Overall I liked it.
I bought this phone last year on Amazon. I liked the sleek design, the color and I was very attracted to the touchscreen.  The phone works quite well, talk time is good and standby time is great.  I had no problems with syncing it to my computer.  The bluetooth works well too.  The phone can take some good banging as this has dropped from me several times with the battery flying out, and it still works fine.  The one and only con I would give it (which is a major one) is that there is no other option for navigating around the menu in the phone except for the touchscreen.  Some other phones have a touchscreen, but still have buttons that you can press to get in the menu and work the phone.  This one only has the touchscreen, so if that screen goes bad...you can forget even having a phone because you won't be able to make a call, send a text, play a game, change your phone settings....nothing that you can usually do while navigating around in the menu.  This is the problem that I am having right now.  I sadly dropped the phone in a puddle of water a while back.  The phone still works fine, functional-wise, but the touchscreen has freezed and no longer works, so I can't do anything with the phone.  This is the major problem as I think that they should have also put in some buttons so that you can still get in your menu.  Now, I have to look for another phone to buy.  I like LG products so I will stick with this brand, I will just make sure to buy a phone with menu, select and navigation buttons.
After a few months, the battery last only one day. FOR ANY LG CELL PHONE
Sorry amazon, this is my first dissapointed review at amazon. there are 2 d&g; as anne said, black and gold which is the limited edition one and the mass production one, i just bought this one but unfortunately its not in a perfect or new condition some dirt on it, the color is faded and is almost gone from the side buttons, doesnt close welland a white label inside the body trying to cover the original fone information, the assemblying is very poor, i love motorola, never had this problem, please be aware of thi, i think it's refabrished or something, missing features, buttom line DONT BUY IT FROM HERE i would sell mine for 10$ without shipping however i just got today.:S
It's really great.  I used the phone in India and it works really good.Thanks,Suguna Reddy
dolce gabana cell looks great and operates easily. problem i have is battery does not hold up well. constantly charging battery. followed all instructions for charge up.
This is a great phone but will not work on AT&T.; Have been waiting on return slips for over a week.After 4 phone calls to customer service. How long does it take to e-mail return slips.Do not buy from these people.
I received my RAZR V3i cell phone and am completly happy with my purchase.  I've read the other reviews and could not disagree more with this seller.  Delivery was very fast and I inserted my SIM and off I went.  I would buy from this seller anytime.  Thanks.Cell
This is a gorgeous cell phone but requires a sim card so I had to send it back as Verizon doesn't do sim cards.  It is lovely to behold and it greets you with "Doice Gabbana" upon start-up. I never was able to take advantage of the other features but am sure it would have been wonderful.
I am highly disappointed with this product. I have had it for approximately a month now. It rarely stays connected to the Bluetooth, it vibrates even when you turn off that feature, it cost too much to have such limited features. I feel "Robbed."
I am very happy with this phone.  I bought this phone to go on a trip to China and Hong Kong.  I was skeptical at first.  I read a lot of reviews before making the purchase.  When I received the phone, I tried my AT&T; sim card and it worked.  When I arrived China, I put in the local sim card and it worked like a charm.  My second stop to Hong Kong, the local sim card again worked like a charm.  Now that I am back in the US, the phone works like it supposed to.  Also, the phone charger is the same as the Razr V3, so I can use my own charger instead of the European charger with a US adapter which came with the phone.  The only negative is the user manual is in German.  I had to find an English one online.  I have not figured out all the details on the phone yet.  I will definitely recommend this phone to anyone who likes Motorola phone, and does not text a lot.
Worked OK except the small outside screen wouldn't light up, and plastic on outside of a second one I bought came un-glued. Have sent the one for replacement but haven't recieved it yet. Probably should have sent other one back also instead of glueing it back together. Would not buy this phone again!
Very happy with this purchase. The phone does not have all the new bells a whistles, but for phone conversation, taking pictures, battery life and reception are great. The phone is constructed well and feels it is made well. One thing I am happy to report is that all my old USB chargers from other Motorola phones I have owned all work on this phone also in an emergency I was actually able to use my car charger off my garmin nuvi GPS.
I loved this phone so much, I got another one when it was time to renew. It has a great camera so you can get a quality picture instead of a VGA. Fits your hand and ear better than a RAZR. Works Great.Approved by YODA.
The phone features are good, pretty standard for most motorola phones today, just put in you sim card and you're ready to go. The only thing I'm having trouble with is sending pictures, for some reason they don't even send out at all. It could be possible I need to take the phone into my carrier's store and have them set it up for me.
Nothing too exciting just a regular phone. Works fine. it is very simple and a nice color. The best part is that it's a world phone!
This phone feels great to hold, looks great, and the MicroSD slot provides lots of flexibility in its use.  It can be used like a usb stick to hold data, photos, mp3, and even play back mp3s as ring tones.
Phone, camera, video - all acceptable.Standby time, and talk time - decent.trying to put music on this is AWFUL.I cannot tell you how many times I was told that I cannot use a Universal Serial Bus, I needed *the* motorolla version USB.  After buying the stupid kit for the USB - it still didn't sync.  arg.  I managed to stumble on a method to put music onto the memory card, and just put it into the phone.As a phone. No prob.  As a music player - AWFUL.  I figure that is worth 3 stars.
this phone is by far the worst piece of junk i have ever purchased.mine has been replaced 3 times and my wifes 4 times while still under warranty.i have replaced the battery with a brand new one and it still does not stay charged.it freezes up on me all the time and it always says my memory is full even when i clear out all my messages.i will never purchase another motorola again and strongly advise others not to as well.
I just got this phone for international use. The first thing I notice was that the charge lasts about 8 hours, because after a full charge the phone was on low battery in the morning. This may be due to the battery needing a few full charges to get to normal.But one thing that will never get to normal is the amount of scratches on the thing, which leads me to believe that this phone was used. Even the outside screen (that shows the time) is unbelivable scratched up. Then on the inside, the buttons have several deep scratches that have taken off the paint and are down to the metal.Very obviously this phone was meant for Europe - the charger has outlet prongs that are not found in North America, and the videos the phone comes with are in German.Other than that, I have not gotten the phone to work for me with a new SIM card. I am in Mexico on Telcel, but I have known people who have the same phone here with no problems with the service.I guess once I get it to work it may be worth the [...] I spent on it, despite the fact that it looks used.
This product is nice and okay but not as friendly as I expected like other cell phones especially my Sony Erickson W580I that I lost!  Why is it they were in Thai language when we are using this in America!  We are english-speaking people and not Thai nor Chinese.  I was really very disappointed and would like to return the item once I found another that will fit my taste.  If they were manufactured from China or Thai (notice the keys!) Doing texting, if not set your, text would be in Thai!  I will not recommend to friends --- anyways AT&T; offices told me they no longer support this type of Motorola phone and stop selling them!I look so awkward with this phone!
i REALLY wanted this cellphone. i wanted it SOOOO much that i bought it w/o sticking to my own caveats & while ignoring my apprehension--an apprehension that turned out to be TOO TOO valid. amazon has this product tagged completely wrong. i bought it, ya. i had to return it, ya. it is NOT cdma. it will NOT work w/ metropcs. it IS the most fabulous cellphone i have ever owned--but i left it unused & owned it in any proper way for the life of a mayfly before i needed to return it. i informed amazon of its miscategorization when i returned it; they uncategorically refunded me. i wish amazon had then looked into my sorry charges a bit & removed it from the list of cdma/metropcs compatibles. they didnt. so now i am informing YOU, dear emptor, so you wont have to go thru the same as did i.
Product as described, fast delivery, and great phone for the price, thanks a million, i will be a loyal shopper!!!!!
I purchased the Motorola PEBL U6 pumpkin orange phone for my Granddaughter for Christmas.  It was the perfect gift.  It works very well, good reception, no problems.
I enjoy the phone and it worked great with any sim card i purchased overseas (mainly Italy).  Very decent battery life and user friendly.
I break my phones without blinking so when i broke my LG vu, I was done with buying expensive phones. This phone is great. It's unlocked so all you need to do is put in your simcard and your phone is ready. The hardware is great. It looks adorable and the slide to flip action makes me happy ^_^. I only use my phone for calling and texting so i didn't mind that the internet won't work. Saves me the extra bits it would cost if i accidentally presed the web button.If you broke your phone and you don't want to buy a used phone. get this one. great price for a working phone.
I came to the N73 looking to flee the crashy performance of my T-Mobile Dash, and it answered all my hopes and dreams. The N73 is stable, and rock solid, but on occasion can be slow, and every once in a while you'll find yourself damning the Espoo-dwellers who designed it for including a Pop-Port (instead of mini-USB), miniSD (instead of microSD), no US 3G (yes, the title says it has 3G, but more on that later), and no WiFi. But let's break it down. (Forewarning: I say T-Mo Dash, but I'm using AT&T.; Yes, I unlocked the Dash, don't bother asking me about anything relating to T-Mo).The camera is awesome. Yes, it's only 3.2 MPixels, and it's low-light performance is OK (it gets a bit noisy, but I've seen Nikon's with noisier pictures). The LED flash is more useful than you think, and the Carl Zeiss lenses are fantastic, but what really steals the show is its auto-focus. This means you'll be able to make sure your pictures are in-focus, and even macro focus'd (which can land you some decent, but understated, depth of field). On the bad side, there's no optical zoom (so you'll never have real depth of field), the flash is good, but it's not godly, there is NO WAY AT ALL to turn off the artificial shutter sound (so no incognito ever), the front facing camera is AMAZINGLY bad in low-light (you need sunlight for a clear picture), and no built-in geotagging (an app is available from Nokia, however). Other than that, it's one of the best cameras I've ever used in a phone.Reception is Godly. I'll get great reception in places where other phones scratch their heads. Just as a warning for everyone in the US: THIS PHONE DOES NOT HAVE 3G YOU CAN USE! The original N73 (-1, -2, -3 and -4, models RM-133) has 3G using the 2100 MHz band, which is only useful in Europe. The phone sold here, the N73-5 (RM-132) has had this feature removed. What this means: No 3G in the US, and no 3G in Europe either. And before you bring up T-Mobile's use of the 2100 MHz band for their 3G network in the US: they use AWS, which requires the use of both a signal in the 2100 MHz band and the 1700 MHz band. The N73-5 supports neither, and the earlier N73s only support 2100 MHz. No love there. However, by some magic of wonderfully optimized technology, the EDGE radio in my N73 seems faster than that of my T-Mo Dash. The web browser is faster, sending e-mails seems faster, hell, I can even pull down Internet Radio and broadcast live on Qik (though there are a LOT of delays involved in the use of Qik, so if you're buying the phone for that, I suggest another phone).S60's a great OS, but it's got some flaws. For one, the e-mail client is downright simple. And that's bad. No support for HTML messages (you'll just see the tags), in-line images are a no-no, there is NO way to change the size of text (so everything is in big letters), and when you hit the send button, you have to wait until the message is sent before you can pen another (well, you can cancel, but either way: you have to watch the progress bar when you send e-mail). On the plus side, you can easily switch applications in S60 (just hold down the Application button, or press it once to bring up the Apps menu), but it seems stupid that I can't read my e-mails while one is sent in the background. WM5 and 6 can do this. Also, the mail client will only ever download headers, never message contents. What this means for you: you need to wait for your message to download to read it. On the plus side, you can select several messages and have the phone download them all at once (Hold the pencil key and click on the messages you want to select). Same goes for marking messages as read.On the upside, S60's IMAP support is wonderful: this means Push E-mail without needing an Exchange account (Push GMail anyone?), and the ability to subscribe to folders of your choice.S60, like BlackBerry OS and Windows Mobile, have some special hardware keys. In this case, S60 has the Pencil key, the Apps key, the Multimedia Key, and the C key. The Pencil key has to do with all things input related (like switching between predictive text modes, or different languages), and if you hold it, you can select text for copying and pasting (WM6 and the iPhone can't do that), and yes: C/P works in ALL applications. The Apps key is used for switching running apps (hold the button) or choosing an app to run (press it). By default, apps are quit when you hit the hang-up button (much simpler than in WM6). The Multimedia Key is basically another four shortcuts for you to have access, even if they aren't multimedia related. The C key is a universal delete button (not a universal "back" button like in WM6 or BBOS), so whatever you have highlighted will be DELETED, keep that in mind. I bring this up because knowing how to appropriately use these buttons elevated any S60 smartphone from being a phone with a fancy UI to a true smartphone, and allows you to take full advantage of the device (C/P is SOOOOOOOOOO useful when you finally make use of it, including copying and pasting phone numbers from an phonebook entry into a text message for somebody).Other advantages of S60 include it's compatability with various devices (bluetooth GPS devices work flawlessly, every time. WM6 can't say that. It also works with Bluetooth keyboards, which the iPhone can't do), it's damn stable (you may on occasion have to reboot it, but it's so fast and so easy to deal with that it's hardly worth mentioning), has phenominal battery life (admittedly, some apps like Qik will really take it out of the phone, but you can listen to the Internet Radio all day and still have some power left over in the evening), an easy to use UI (it's not the prettiest, but people won't be all "I don't know how to work your phone"), and its Mac compatibility (out-of-the-box syncing support with iSync, Nokia Media Transfer makes manipulating files on the phone easy, including syncing pictures, videos, music and installing apps). Granted: 90% of the apps for working with your phone are for Windows, but everything you *need* is in Mac OS, and Nokia is developing more apps for Mac OS, as evidenced by their recent release of the Nokia Maps Loader (which allows you to download maps and load them onto your phone, with the choice of either downloading the entire country, or just a few states). Definately consider getting a Bluetooth GPS unit, as you'll be able to use Nokia Maps (It doesn't have all the awesome text-to-speech features of a good Nüvi, but it gets the job done! The Maps application and the maps are free, but there is a fee to use the navigation feature, though it is competitive relative to the GPS fees from cell carriers), geotag your photos, geocache (Geocache Navigator says it's an N95 app, but it runs fine on the N73, and it doesn't even complain), and even keep tabs on your walks, runs, or biking stats with Sports Tracker (very cool application, and free, did I mention that?).I'd give the N73 five stars if it wasn't for the lack of WiFi (which would make up for EDGE), it's poor e-mail client, it's rather small amount of RAM (you'll hit the RAM wall if you upgrade the firmware or you use the browser a lot), and for the fact that Nokia never seemed to think that having numerical shortcuts in the menus would be a good thing. At this point, spend the extra few dollars and grab the N82 or N95 if you can. They have an updated version of the OS, WiFi and GPS, which will be so much more useful than you could imagine at this point (plus many apps only work on the new OS).
The N73 it's a good cellphone , good camera, flash , but it's a quite bit slower than other N series cellphones , main menu appears very slow , and sometimes it need to be restarted to work fine. I was listening music when suddendly this phone hangs on  and maintained a extrange sound , that action caused me to remove battery , wait 5 minutes and this N73 comes back to live again (maybe needs an Nokia firmware update)
I bought this phone over the Nokia N82. If I had $$$ to spare I would have bought the N82. However as I have no use for wi fi and GPS I chose the N73. I am not dissapointed at all!!! This is an EXCELLENT phone, I just took a 4 hr flight and it was a breeze. I listened to my MP3, watched music videos on the MP4 Real Player, I played Roger Federer tennis, Need 4 Speed, Soduku, etc, read a section of a book and reviwed some Excel and PDF files I had downloaded. The camera pictures are awesome for a phone. For some reason some of them come with a bluish cast which I fix easily in Photosohop (I fix all my SLR pictures as well so no big deal). The FM radio is handy and I keep all my meetings with me with the Lotus Notes synchronization. Plus, for less than $300 I am not that worried about carrying a phone in my pocket at all times.As I said if you like this and have the $$$ I recommend the Nokia N82 but that doesnt mean that the N73 is outdated or underpowered its just that it has less features than the N82 but no big deal.
This phone works great in all ways except daylight viewing of the display.  The display is barely readable in the daylight, but must be shaded by the hand to do so.This phone gets close to the same signal quality, great, as my last Nokia (6010).  It has great battery life talk and standby.  I have been able to use all of my previous chargers for this phone too.This is a great basic phone for those that want a small phone with bar-phone signal capabilities and really good battery life.
Before I start the.. well, I've already started. Here's a typical moment when I want to text.1. Press the red call button.2. Press the center button.3. Go to address book.4. Go to Names.5. Click on someone's name.6. Click options.7. Click "send message"8. Click "Text Message".9. Type my message.10. Click send.11. Click "Exit".How about texting on my Palm Centro broke which broke and forced me to use the worst phone ever made?1. Press the Texting button the phone.2. Press the center button.3. Click New with my finger.4. Type in friend's name.5. Text.6. Send.Sounds hard? Nope, it's not. The best phone ever made (Palm Centro) makes everything looks like a snap of the finger.What if I have to call someone because I'm in an oh-so hurry and I haven't called this person recently and all I have is the worst phone ever made (The phone that I'm reviewing.)1. Press the red call button.2. Press the Center Button.3. Go to Address Book.4. Go to friend's name and press Green button.Sounds easy? Nope, with this phone's incredibly small and difficult and hard buttons, you'll never have anything easy.. except calling someone you've recently called which can happen by pressing the green button and clicking a name.This phone, was the worst phone ever made. I don't even recommend it for buying for your son or daughter as their first phone. It can't do anything, and it will embarrass them.
I BOUGHT THIS CEL PHONE FOR MY 13TH DAUGHTER.  IT IS NICE, SMALL, AND HAS LOTS OF FEATURES THAT YOUNG KIDS LIKES.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
Do not buy this product. The company is a sham. There is no customer service (only an email address); no individuals to reach by phone; no management team or leadership described in their site; no advertised phone number -- even in the fine print -- that does anything more than return you to the same email address. No responses to cancellation requests. No responses to ANYTHING. This company is a poor example of a communications company that does not offer good service in any way, whatsoever. (Though it seems more than willing to send anyone who asks investment information!)I purchased two phones for our twins. One worked -- for awhile. The other, scheduled with minutes and so forth at the same time, never worked. Repeated attempts to reach Firefly failed to produce a customer service representative that could address the problem. In disgust, I tried in December to cancel the service -- the only way through an email to them; no response, no cancellation. I finally -- at yet another cost beyond the $10 a month fee for NOTHING -- cancelled my credit card just to stop Paying Firefly Mobile. THis is a bad deal, a poorly managed company, with a product that is a great idea but has no team to support it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. it basically STINKS, and you will be ripped off, as apparently others have suggested in these reviews.
I've had this phone about 6 months and I'm already looking to replace it. It looked very nice when I first got it, but very quickly the reflective coating started to chip off and has gotten much worse. Half my phone is now black. It's like chipped nail polish. Also, the face has cracked twice (I don't drop my phone, this had happened just from being in my purse). Also, the middle buttons have fallen off. The phone works ok, but it looks awful now. Also, the metallic finish is nice looking, but in the sunlight, it is impossible to read the screen, so you can't see who is calling you unless you open the phone, which of course answers the call. This is very inconvienient for anyone, like me, who feels the need to screen their calls. I am forced to either answer a call when I don't know who it is, or let it go straight to voicemail and then see who called. This happens even if I'm in my car, or outside in the shade. Only when I'm inside or it's dark out can I see the screen on front. Don't buy this phone, you will be unhappy in the long run.
From day one these phones were a problem.  They were listed as new but when I turn them on there were a history of use.  I informed the seller and they were willing for me to return them but I decided to just accept a free leather case being that they looked new.  BIG MISTAKE!  Within 3 months I had to purchase 2 new phones. Problems include dead LCD, batteries not holding charge, phone turning off in the middle of calls and the list goes on.
My wife needed a familiar quality phone for use in Europe. The Motorola family's GSM line work great.  We have three different styles and the Rzr is her favorite.  Choosing an older model allowed me to get a great deal.  Thanks Amazon.
y order the phone for my job and it is very good.thanks for helping me.
I`m very satisfied with the  phone.For a long time i`ve been wanted to buy it, and finnaly I did.I recieved it in a box unpacked, all new...:)Once again great phone.
Worst! Worst! Worst! I wouldn't buy this phone for a toddler if I had to... I'm serious! It's reeeeeaaaally slow, sluggish, less than a half MB of available memory, the volume goes and comes, has to charge every day, if it goes off for whatever reason, then it's hells to get it back on at times, I'll type a text message then have to wait and watch the letters come up one by one seconds after like an old typewriter... and I can go on but I wont. I am not trying to pull down the phone, but I really can't find any whistles to lend it. It's really horrible. Buy at your own risk, but if you should ever ask my opinion, I'll tell you plainly- NO! Oh, there is one pro (lol)--> the design is not bad, cute. Lol.
This phone is not worth the money. Lousy reception. Alot of places I cant get a signal where my last phone could.This came with an adaptor since its not a regular plug. Text messages take SO long .Just not a good deal at all.
Poorly made, the seller never mentioned that the key pad was written in Indian or Farsi...
PRODUCT ADDVERTISED AS MOTOROLA RIZR Z3 ULOCKED GSM QUADBAND CELL PHONE-BLACK. EVENTHOUGH THE PHONE IS TAGED TO T-MOBIL'S OPERATING SYSTEM AND WILL NOT LET ALL MY ATT NETWORK WORK.CALLED SELLER AND HE ADVISED THAT I CONTACT T-MOBIL FOR HELP/ THEY COULDN'T.
The add for this phone said it was an European model, so I checked online and and it appeared the European model was the same as ours.  When I received the phone everything was in Chinese and the music player, which was the main reason I chose the phone, was practically useless.  Unless you wanted to make playlists you coould only play one song at a time and the tunes were only listed by song title  ---- there was no navigation between artists, albums and genre etc.  I returned it immediately and won't do business with this dealer again.
Had this phone for a little over a year and a half, it was ok at first but then it's flaws came through. Being a slide phone, it's never going to last especially given the fact the slide is not spring assisted also it was extremely slow and froze quite a bit even after firmware upgrades. Finally the display went out so I bought an N82, infinitely better phone. All the features of the N80 plus more with none of the drawbacks. If you're considering buying this phone, do yourself a favor and check out the N82.
I bought this phone for my wife over a year ago.  I believe that it's truly bullet-proof.  She has never had a phone that lasted over a few months - she drops it constantly.  Once, the phone slipped out of her shirt pocket into an ice chest and lay there, under water and ice for 12 hours before she found it.  She shook it off, dried the battery compartment and it fired right up.  I don't know about the ease of using it in sunlight, like others have commented, but I can say that this has been the toughest phone I've ever seen.  I would definitely recommend it.
Along with the LG shine in box thought I would have gotten head phones. The manual does not have enough details in english you have to learn the phone by going through the menu one item at a time. When lndoors it gives trouble to pick up service.Thats all the best part is I LOVE MY LG SHINE
This is a great looking phone.  The one I have was from Poland.  Aesthetically speaking, it's hard to find fault with the phone.  It's very shiny.  Only negatives about the phone are that the screen picks up fingerprints like crazy and the numbers are a bit hard to press. The number pads are flat and on the same level.  They aren't elevated or separated from each other very well like my previous phones.  I kept worrying that my fingers would accidently press an adjoining number, and I have pretty small fingers.My cell needs are really basic.  I just need to be able to receive and make calls, and text.  You're not going to be able to connect to the web with this phone unless you contact your service provider.  The cell also comes with a current adapter since it's a foreign electronic.  Overall, it's a good phone to have if your needs for a cell are pretty basic.
Excellent.  Seller was great to work with and the phone is wonderful.  Very pleased.
The phone is good looking and the product is good.Amazon's customer service is excellence - five stars.
I purchase this phone for my friend and just have it almost 2 two week .The phone start having trouble when you push it up to talk ,the power went off and i have to turn back the power again ,just happen very often .Phone look nice but i very disappoint the way it happen.I would not recommended buying this product .
While I wouldn't say this phone is bad, I don't love it.  When talking, I often hear feedback, or myself echoing back.  Also, you can't set the alarm, turn off the phone, and have the alarm go off.  Therefore, the battery drains faster if you want to turn it off at night.  The joystick is hard to use to maneuver through the menus.  I do think the camera works fairly well.
Weak. Overall poor performance with voice, text and total functionality.  "coolness" of shine-- not worth it. LG phone not good
She loved it.  Glass, Steel, good weight, good camera.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I am more about features than style.
I really liked the phone I just needed a differant bands to get better service.  But it was cute a little heavy but seemed durable and worked very well.  The camera was great too.
This phone has a high point that is the style, full metal body and LCD mirror screen make it kind of attractive but it would be all. In the other hand this phone is very simple, does not have to do list, the calendar is really hard to use, the scroll bar is not good at all and has no precision. The signal is not strong and it is "finger prints addict" and gets scratches with anything. You can not send a message for more than 5 contacts at the same time.  The camera has a really poor zoom and not good quality. The battery life really sucks!!! I have to charge it every day and it takes too long to be charged. USB CABLE NOT INCLUDED and really hard to find. If you want this phone just to talk and you dont send lots of messages it would be ideal for you in functionality and price. I had it for 5 months and changed for a Nokia.
It might have just been me, but when I put the sim card in, the phone could only make phone calls. I apparently had to configure setting with ATT before I could use the itnernet+texting. If you're buying this phone, I recomend talking to your service plan and making sure that it will be able to work effortlessly. Otherwise, it's kinda hard to use. Also, if you live in america, I'd suggest just getting the ATT lg phone. This is the international version and when you buy it, it costs around 130-140-150 dollars. Mine cost me 147 dollars. The ATT phone that you get from the store, without contract, is 160 dollars. I returned this phone right away because it just wouldn't work. Buyer beware I guess =[
The Shine is an attractive phone that take good looking pictures but thats about it.The reception is very bad you also have to set your own mutimedia and internet settings.Mind you that AT&T; and LG can not help you with the phone because the phone is the International Version.This phone is a waist of time.
I read the reviews around the web, and all signs pointed to get this phone.  It may be nearly two years old, but its miles ahead of the average junk phones people seem to like in the states.  I have T-Mobile and i was able to easily find the carrier mods on their website to get the features working right. Why waste 300- or more on the newer and bulkier models, or the touch screen accident prone phones.  Trust me and get this.  <also comes in a nice black and orange color>
I've been using a Sony Ericsson W880i for a month now. I upgraded to a 4GB memory stick (works fine), I use a Sony Ericsson H970 bluetooth stereo headset and am on ATT network. Here is a quick summary of my experience with this product:Pros:1. Walkman - create playlists on the phone, good sound quality (better than my ipod for sure), good user interface, superb stereo bluetooth.2.Bluetooth - implementation is so good it blows away any other product I have owned. It is super fast to connect and works flawlessly with the integrated blutooth in my car and with my Sony stereo bluetooth (H970).3.Others - I get access to my office email, gmail with no problems. It automatically synchs wirelessly every 5 minutes, text and MMS also work great.4. Design and Build quality - fantastic! I got an W890i also and the W880i just looks and feel better. Trust me. The W890i was much cheaper looking and feeling. This is a fantactically designed and built product.5. Camera is decent for on the fly use. I would not use this as my primary digital camera, but it is totally OK for taking a quick picture or video and sending it via email or MMS.6. Very very stable OS, never crashes or locks upCons:1. Not suitable for writing long emails! However, I need my phone to mostly read, I write short one liners if needed.2. The keys are small, but I am completely used to it after a month.3. 3-G works only when I am in Europe, in US I can't use ATT 3-G.4. No wi-fi and np 3-G in US means browsing the web is pretty slow. I try and use the mobile versions of web sites. I also use the Opera Mini Browser which is a free download IF I need to browse the web.Overall, I think this is a really excellent product. Based on my experience with this phone I am more likely to buy a Sony Walkman phone again. Just remember that this phone is for people who want a phone with an MP3 player and lightweight email access and web browsing. If you're a heavy email or web user then this phone is not for you.
Got this phone because of its size. Opened the box and was immediately unsatisfied. The phone is cheaply made, the buttons are insanely small. And to top it off, unlike what I was told by various stores, this phone can not be used on AT&T;, it doesnt accept the correct signals.
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.  In addition, I was unable to activate it with my carrier due to there being no acceptable number on the phone under the battery.  I give it a one star for prompt delivery, but even that did me no good.
A really nice cell phone with out all the extra goodies I'd never use. Alone with Virgin Moblies pay as you go plan, it only costs me $20.00 every 90 days and they will automatically charge you credit card so you don't even have to worry about missing a deadline.  I love it.
I bought this phone when I lost my previous phone in an unfortunate water related accident, and I needed a replacement ASAP despite the fact that I was nearly completely broke at the time.I got this phone for about [...] bucks, so I wasn't expecting it to move mountains.  However, I found this phone to be nearly unusable.I'll start off by saying that my cellphone needs are very basic - I send a few texts and make a call every now and then.  I sometimes use the alarm clock or calendar, but that's about it.The biggest problem with the Marbl, though, is that it's so SLOW it makes the simplest task irritating.  When you open the phone, even if you just press the menu button, you have to wait 5-10 seconds for it to open.  To scroll through your contacts or any other list is slow and choppy, and it's hard to control where the highlight lands. Texting is slow - even using T9 it just takes a long time for each word you're trying to type to actually show up on the screen.As far as sound goes, it's okay.  It sometimes sounds tinny, which was irritating to me, but it was definitely acceptable for the price.  The ringtones that came with the phone were few and not very interesting, but you can always purchase better ones.The appearance of the phone is fine.  It's small enough, very simple.  It's smooth and easy to slip into a pocket, and it's very lightweight. It does, however, have a cheap feel to it. The battery door does stay on securely, which is a plus.  The buttons are easy enough to press and they aren't too close together, so you're much less likely to press the wrong one.The interface, however, leaves much to be desired. The screen is small for the size of the phone, which is okay.  However, the appearance of the screen is not great.  The text looks awkward, the included backgrounds are few and are stupid (cartoon style ants, flies, or ice cream? no thanks).  The color theme options are all unattractive.I don't really use mobile web, but I did try it on this phone just to see how it worked, and it was so slow and difficult to use that it is not even worth the trouble or money to attempt.All of this could be forgiven on such a cheap phone if only it were more user friendly, but it's sluggishness just renders it unpleasant to use.So, I guess the bottom line is:If you need a prepaid phone for only a few bucks, this phone is at least basically functional.  If you only need to make a few calls and send a few texts, and you don't mind using a very slow interface, you might be okay with this phone.  However, if you are able to shell out a few more bucks, I think it would be worth it to upgrade to any of the other available Virgin Mobile phones.
This was my first foray into the wireless phone market.  It almost ended my experience prior to beginning.  The phone is too...ooo..ooo slow.  So, for us beginners who need to find the screens to figure things out ... there is no patience left.  Bootup ... SLOW...  I ended up buying a used Kyocera Cyclops.  Yeah.  Now I am in the world of wireless phones.  Recently I purchased a Slash as a gift.  That is once again quite a step up from the Cyclops.  There is no need to put up with junk like the Marbl.
I'm rating this phone from the perspective of it being disposable.  I paid $9.99 for mine from Target (sorry Amazon).  I expected to use it for a week or so until I got my multifunction Eten M700 - after which I'd discard.  However, I really like this phone's small size and use both.  I use a simple wired headset (which cost as much as the phone!).  I get two hours of talk minimum out of the battery.  The battery charges very quickly and it lasts at least two days on standby.  I forgot my charger on one trip and bought a second $9.99 Marbl from Target (again sorry Amazon) just to have a second charger and second battery.  If you're not a big talker, this is the cheapest cell phone package out there.  This is my back up phone - I pay less than $10/month for this service. Nobody pays less for cell service!
I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.  I bought this for my little brother and it was awful.  First, the charge doesn't even last 24 hours, even with no use.  With texting, or limited phone calls you'd be lucky for it to stay charged for a few hours.  I bought this for my brother would have something to call my parents and I in emergency situations, and it already failed him twice because it had lost its charge since unplugging it in the morning (I pay for the minutes so I know he barely uses it). I would bet that 30-45 minutes of talking would run down the battery completely because it seems to go dead while sitting closed in such a short amount of time.  When the battery goes dead, you can't just plug it in and turn it on like every other phone I've owned, you have to wait a good 15-20 minutes so it can charge enough to be unplugged and turned on and then replugged into the wall to finish the charging process.  Also, when the phone shuts off and you turn it back on, you cannot receive texts for about 30 minutes while it 'searches' for missed messages.  Also, this phone is HORRIBLE for texting, there is a 2 second lag every time you hit a key thus making it very frustrating to navigate the menus, let alone type anything.  Along with the lag, the phone's menus are awkward compared to other phones I've used, and the phone cannot seem to even handle connecting to "My Account" to add money/minutes/texts.  Another thing I've noticed is that the alarm clock feature on the phone sucks, it's default setting doesn't even have a sound, no snooze, and the phone only rings for about 5 seconds before the alarm shuts off, and doesn't sound again.I've had a lot of experience with cell phones, and this is the WORST one I've ever used.  I've always gotten the free phones with my cell phone plans, and even had one of those huge ancient Nokia TracPhones about 8 or 9 years ago and that was better than this.If you're going to buy a phone I'd recommend the LG Flare, it's only slightly more money miles better than this one.  However, Virgin Mobile isn't the greatest service provider, they're customer service is horrible, and a month after I got the phone for my brother they raised their prices on texts and minutes.
Battery doesn't last 24 hours w/o charge.  phone works, we just use it to make calls, no games, music or other extras, but the battery just drives me bonkers.  and replacement batteries cost more than the phone.  Virgins customer service is astoudingly bad.  the website is so desperate to look hip and with it, that it is nearly unnavigatable.  Calling them 4 different times has resulted in 2 positive contacts with helpful reps, 1 transfer,hold,transfer,hold,disconnect and 1 total stoner "dude" that hung up after listening to the problem.Giving up and getting a differnt phone
I have been using this phone around one year and a half. But if i compare to my previous nokia 9210i this phone could not take overall advantage over my previous nokia. The following point are the advantages and disadvantages of this phone compare to my previous nokia 9210i:Advantages over nokia 9210i:- An internal memory is large enough for me to use (128 mb) which I could have more contact and install more application as I need.- The screen color is improve to 16 million color which is very to view the picture.- The sound device has been improve (the quality of the sound).- More feature: Vibration, Camera, Radio, Bluetooth and wireless lan also included.- The connection to the computer is improve by the USB port.- The battery life is long enough for me to use (4 days fo ra single charged).- The phone has a strong connection between its part when I open its cover.Disadvantage over nokia 9210i:- The size is smaller than nokia 9210i.- The keyboard is too narrow and very hard to type a message.- The port of the louder speaker is put behind the phone, so it is very difficult for me to listen to the phone when i open it cover and have a conversation.That is my expereince for using this mobile phone.
First phone Amazon sent me wasn't packaged correctly so the phone box inside damaged.  Now if that had been it, I would have been ecstatic but no, it turns out the model of the phone that Amazon sent me was the recalled version that Nokia originally recalled back in 2007 when the phone was released.  Amazon sent me another one, same problem again...sent it back, got a refund and pre-ordered a N900
The E-90 and the last 2 unlocked phones I bought from Nokia do not enjoy the quality of prior phones.  Nokia knows about certain design flaws that make actually talking and hearing on their phones impossible.  My E-90 cost me the biggest part of $1000 US Dollars, but stopped working in less than 18 months.  Nokia said that there was a change in design that had corrected that problem, but though they knew about it, they did not feel any responsibility to fix it. "Would I be interested in buying a new phone?"  Hmmmmm....  The prior Nokia Communicator had a joy stick that got stuck which also did not meet their minimum requirements for a design flaw; so they wouldn't fix it.  The Nokia I owned before that had keys that disolved and came right off; before I lost all my keys, I called to them about it, and they said -- in less than 1 year -- that is was cosmetic that their keys wouldn't stay on.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot to recommend their latest phones, but one thing is sure.  Nokia doesn't care anything about customer service and about maintaining their good name.  If they did, they wouldn't abandon people who have such a memory about being repeatedly burned.  Go buy the latest Samsung, better gadgets, REAL full qwerty, much cheaper, other qualities the same or better than Nokia.  Samsung to release sometime in 3rd qtr or 4th qtr 2009.
I've had my mocha e90 for nearly a year now, and I like it very much. The battery life on wifi is excellent. I can surf the net for three days before needing a charge. Other features use more battery power. The font sizes could be bigger. Even at 125% I find it difficult to read. Also the camera button requires a lot of pressure, not to mention time, to actually snap a picture, but the picture quality is fabulous. I like the size, weight and feel of this phone, and it really is a beautiful design. The sound quality is nicer than my e61. It's not a replacement for a little net book, but as a smart phone, if you don't mind the larger size, I recommend it.
N72 came with all required things ( charger, ear phones, manual, cd, pc cable etc), it was unlocked & worked well with new subscribers in asia.
Excellent merchandise. Quality product. The best Nokia phone I have purchased till date. Quick delivery too. Very highly recommended.
Love this phone!!! I have always been an avid user of nokia phones and switching to this one was very easy.
I received the telephone within one week.The phone was absolutely brand new and worked like a charm
Made the mistake of buying this cellphone from a private buyer who did not want to accept it back.  I sent it back regardless and then they didn't want to credit me for it, but Amazon came through with their buyer guarantee and I did not lose my money (except for mailing it).  The cellphone was and bulky.  Archaic.
I ordered this phone for my wife who has wanted one for some time now.. I have bought it as a surprise. So to make sure everything is in working order I opened it, and installed a sim chip out of a phone I purchased in Puebla Mexico...and to my happiness it worked fine.. My carrier in Mexico is TelCel..So if anyone is looking for a phone that works with TelCel..This one does. The phone is everything I hoped for, and the price was great. Also I was pleased with the shipment time... Five stars all the way
Despite this phone's lack of functionality, it has sophisticated style. Unfortunatley, style cannot compensate for poor performance. The reception is wretched. Rural, suburban, urban it makes no difference; be prepared for dropped/missed calls, late text messages and conversations full of "can you hear me now?" Please note that this is an international version which I believe greatly influeces this phone's performance.  The reviews of others indicate that I am in the minority with regards to reception complaints; furthermore, many users were from nations outside the US. This evidence leads me to conclude that the reception problem is due primarily to the fact that the phone is a international version.
This phone is pretty solid.  The interface takes some getting use to but it performs extremely well.  The touch screen is so-so on the response but it's not a deal breaker.Overall, a good solid phone.
better than expected service:- one day earlier delivery- fast- good condition- best price on market
Very unresponsive, slow, and fragile. I regret purchasing this phone. After using it for a few frustrating months, it is already broken. The screen, which responded poorly to touch from the beginning, has now stopped responding at all. Overall a highly dissatisfying experience, though the phone is physically appealing.
I currently have a iPhone with AT&T; and was wondering if I were too purchase the Prada phone I would be able to use the same SIM card provided by my iPhone?
GREAT QUALITY - CERTAINLY AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE RESPECTED V3 RAZR.- 3G CONNECTIVITY- DUAL CAMERA'S - GREAT QUALITY PICTURES- MICRO SD MEMORY CARD SLOT - FOR ADDED STORAGE - YOU CAN PLAY YOUR FAVORITE MP3/VIDEO ON IT AS WELL AS STORE PICTURES- BEAUTIFUL SLICK CLASSIC DESIGN  OF THE MOTOROLA RAZR.- MADE FROM STURDY MATERIAL - BUILT TO LAST. HAD IT FOR 12 MONTHS - HAD THE USUAL BEAT-UPS OF MY CHILDERN - NO PROBLEMS.
Disappointed. Phone randomly shut itself off. Great features when it worked. Returned RAZR V3XX and exchanged for another Motorola phone.30 Days and I still don't have a phone. Poor turn around time.
great customer service with co. i ordered from, answered questions before purchase. nice & friendly
All the reviews state what a wonderful phone the Dash is, but there are some problems it has.1. I'm not sure if this is common, but it the silver faceplate on mine came off rather easily. I've fixed it with superglue, but still a possible manufacturer problem.2. The Jogger Bar (a touch sensitive bar on the side of the phone) is nearly invisible to those who didn't know it existed in the first place. If you don't leave the phone locked when you pocket it then it will turn the volume up by itself, call people, answer the phone, etc. This feature can be turned off and that is what I did once I realized how.3. With the text messaging a slip of fingers can cause the type to turn in to Chinese lettering. This happened to me and I spent hours trying to figure out how to fix it the first day I got it. For those of you that have friends and family with this phone and this problem should choose to pop up, all you do is press alt then cap (both in the lower left corner of the keyboard). That changes it back to English or what ever language is set to the device.That's it for the problems, but there are some really nice features I enjoy.1. Texting is set up like chat where you can view previous messages to and from the same person. It really helps after you get in to conversations with 4 or 5 people at a time.2. The screen is very easy to see even outside during the day.3. The back is rubberized and it doesn't slide easily off of dashboards.These are just a few of the Pros and Cons of the HTC Dash.
ive had it for a month and it works great didnt come with the case so now its all scratched up great battery life great music player great texting loud enough speakers didnt get to go on the internet much because wifi not as strong as a laptop....
it has so many functions but its speed is not as nice as its functions. and sometimes it just freezes.wi-fi is not stable.it only accepts SD upto 2GB and it is not enough.as a bottom line, it is very versatile and functional, but not superb.
I have had the C168i for two years as a replacement for a different phone I broke.  Note that it is a "goPhone" but you can use any monthly ATT service with it just by putting your SIM card in.  My friends make fun of me for my boring looking phone, but they have since gone through 4-5 $150-200 phones while my $20 "crap" phone is still going and going...This phone is perfect for someone who doesn't need a camera, videos, bell and whistles stuff, but wants a sturdy reliable phone with a long battery life.  It is also very inexpensive.Also, I attest to the main review that this phone is a "TERMINATOR" phone, meaning it is EXTREMELY resistant to almost all forms of physical harm.  I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional.Great battery life as well.  My battery has NEVER run out on me.  EVER!  And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it.Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting. The only complaint I would make is that entering new contacts into the address book is somewhat difficult and counter-intuitive until you learn how to do it.You won't regret buying this phone.
I got this phone just as secondary cell phone. It is really lightweight and very cheap. The receiption is good.But most of the time a windy noise is heard when somebody is calling to this cell phone.
so i got this go phone when i lost my old phone. first, it's a flip phone, which is a huge plus point. obviously, it's not a very high end phone, but for what i paid for it, it's actually pretty excellent. good reaction time on all buttons, easy to configure, there isn't much that's confusing about the menu. it's no iphone, but it'll definitely do, and i know for a fact that it's much better than the free phones that at&t; provides. i had one of those at one point, and it was terrible. it took so long to react to anything i pressed that i was never sure if it had actually registered. i'm happy with this. i'll be able to use it for a while, and i don't have to resign myself to a terrible phone for cheap every time i pick it up.
The phone works great.  Inserted the SIM card charged up the minutes and it works good.  Good sound and easy to use.
This is a very nice fashion phone that I have owned for about a year. And when I said "fashion phone" that's mean don't expect it to do everything, such as e-mail, web browsing, IM, etc because it can't! it's not a smart phone, but it's a very stylish phone, you definitely won't find any one with another one like it and everyone who see it will comment on it unique design. Aside from that the performance is pretty ok in term of a phone that answer call and everything.
I purchased this phone some days ago and I must say I am very pleased with it. First off, I would like to point to the fact that Amazon.com sells it at a measly $107 when its original price is almost $300. True, that price was set at its release but $107 is STILL the lowest price anywhere (compared to this same phone being sold at nearly $200). Now, with regard to the phone it is one of the best purchases I've ever made. Call quality is above average. I will not say it is awesome because it's not, but it is very reliable and clear. This phone is extremely good for media. It can take unpaused video and pictures, and hhas a very decent music player. The camera can be set up to 2.0 MP and it is perfect for pictures on the go and still have great resolution on them. It even has a LED light included for pictures while in the dark. I must say though, even though the camera is awesome (it is)it doesn't perform nearly as well in places with few light. The LED light will only help if there is extremely low light, but I always find myself in a limbo between not enough light for a picture without flash and not enough darkness for a picture with flash. Despite that, I still find myself constantly taking pictures XD. Another cool feature is the fact you can increase the memory storage by adding a 2 GB SD card. I bought mine with the phone and find it perfect for lots of music and pictures. Overall, a great purchase. If you are looking to buy a great phone which is very cheap, look no further. If that still doesn't convince you think about this: it is unlocked AND ready for amazon prime shipping. That was a deal maker for me :D. Enjoy!!
There are only a couple of things that I can categorize as a disadvantage to having this phone:  you can't use it with the Motorola Phone Tools software, and it won't send picture messages.  The pic messages hurts more than creating my own ring tones, but other than that, I think this phone is awesome.  Even though it came with the European wall charger, it came with an adapter so it wasn't even a big deal.  Plus, you could always use that old RAZR charger laying around; works just as good.  Sure, it came in chinese, but I knew that when I read the other reviews and actually enjoy texting dumbstruck people messages in chinese.
The phone is fine, sound great, other features fine, holds memory card, takes fairly good pictures. Only problem is I have t-mobile and I can't access t-zones for account information and downloads, I can't dial voicemail automatically using their 1+send option, and I can't access the web. Took it into the store and the rep told me that sometimes with unlocked phones they aren't able to get web access. Yeah, it's more likely t-mobile is making it harder for you not get a phone from them, but still worthwhile to know.
I like this phone because it is neat and has good features. I left it by accident in my car and the heat caused the screen to go white. Fortunately I removed the battery and cooled down the phone. When I put it back together it worked perfectly. I also dropped it once and it was surprisingly sturdy although I plan never to let that happen again. I plan to have this phone for a while! I would recommend it.
I bought this phone after someone had suggested it.  It looks good, and has simple features.  It does not charge!  I tried even buying a car charger and it still charges off and on.  I bought it in Sept and I have yet to get a full charge on it.  If you are thinking about buying this phone I suggest going with another one.
I got this phone and realized it wasn't what I specifically wanted. I had the RIZR Z3 before from Tmobile, and this "International Version" had some really odd features that were just unnecessary. That was the first turn off, but I ended up returning the phone specifically because it did not accept picture messaging. The reason I love the Z3 is because I'm really simplistic, I don't want a phone that can get on the internet or do anything else super high tech. I just want to be able to call and text friends and family. And if the phone couldn't accept picture messages, that's something pretty simple that it should be able to do, so I ended up just buying a replacement keypad for my old phone as well as a new battery and am just revamping it.But the sellers were super helpful and made the return process as painless as possible! Great job guys!
A nice phone for people on a budget.  It's not super fancy but it works well.  The phone shipped quickly and looked relatively new at arrival.  The only problem is that the camera glitches occasionally, but that can be fixed by restarting the phone.
The phone and camera works OK, but you can get these features for less with other phones.  The web is slow due to processor and will not download Opera, Google maps, many other useful tools for general web use.
My wife and I both got RIZRs.  The wheel fell off hers.  The wheel stopped working on mine.  This happened after the 1 yr TMobile guarantee, but well before the 2 yr contract.This is the first time I've had a phone fail to last a 2 yr contract.  I intend to go back to Nokias.
i could not have had a better buying experiance.this phone was exactly what i was looking for.its simple to use,i especialy like that you don't have to open it,unless you're texting.so here are the pro's and cons.pros:works well with motorola phone tools 4good internal memorysimple to usegood battery lifecamera takes good pics lots of featuresships upscon's:comes with an european charger(i chucked mine,my old razor charger worked fine)the micro sd expansion slot is only good for 1GB (it would'nt even read my 4GB card,so don't bother trying)thats pretty much it
It's nice to have this phone. But the charger came with the phone is not working. I should return it but it's time comsuming. Forturnatly, I have the older charger for my old motorola phone. So I can use that charge. Other wise is perfect phone.
My ordered was processed and shipped quickly. I received it before the date that was expected to arrive.  Great little phone for the price.  Thanks for everything.
Cute phone, just didn't like the charger.  Euro phone, so you have to have the adapter.Other then this, the phone has great features.
Great Cell phone, right you need for a few dollars... Almost all functions in one phone for a short price!!
I have had this phone for about a month now and I think this is a great little phone. I love the size and the feel. The only thing that bugs me is that some of the features are in Chinese! I thought this was the European version?? Thankfully I am not too interested in games etc. That definately took away a couple of stars from my rating of it.
I was buy the cellphone, but I was having a really problem because Amazon don't sent me the bill of this product in the box.And I have to pay another tax in my country.In all shop's, they have to give me the bill, because is a law.So, I'm upset.
I ordered this from Amazon via Hassle-Free Cell on Monday and had the phone Friday using standard shipping.  It was new and even had a fresh battery (manufacture date 8/2008); although manufactured for SE Asia the default language was English and everything works great.  I liked my old Razr V3 but it was a little bulky; I loved my moto Pebl but it bit the dust after a nasty fall.  The K1 combines the best of both those phones, plus adds a music player.  It has a nice solid feel with a rubberized back and a very crisp, high-contrast display like the Pebl and unlike the Razr.  One of the things I like about Motorola phones is that accessories using mini-USB work for all their phones, as far as I know.  This includes Phone Tools software, stereo earbuds, chargers, etc. so I didn't have to buy all that stuff over again.  Call volume and quality is very good and the music player sounds great, although it is a bit quirky and limited and doesn't have external music player control buttons like the CDMA version.  The player doesn't recognize a lot of the MP3s I loaded on a 2 gig card, but maybe I just need to wipe it and try again.  Like the other Motos I mentioned, the soft keys can be programmed so that there is ready to access to the things I frequently use, like the calendar and alarms.  In picking a phone I didn't really care about the voice recognition feature, but it works so well that I use it all the time now.  I don't have or need a data plan, so I can't speak to the browser feature, which is no doubt very primitive compared to a smart phone.  Overall this an excellent phone for calling, and at a very reasonable price.
Love the phone(second KRZR I own).Charger doesn't work,waiting for replacement.Speakerphone doesn't work well,barely can hear it.
The phone came without US mms settings but were easily downloaded from the Moto site..It now works great on the ATT network.The phone came with a foreign charger and the wrong US adapter. After contacting Amazon, they immediately sent me the same thing for exchange.I ordered a charger from Ebay and am very happy.The phone is chargable from the mini usb port so I was able to use it until the charger arrived.I would give it a 5 star if not for this problem. Also hope I don't need the warranty.
1. Very bad key pad design. Guys with big fingers wouldn't operate it properly. Around the ring pad, there are six keys squeezed together, so very difficult to work on them.2. Vibration is too weak to feel it.3. Charge up is very slow. Need over-night to fully charge up.4. ....When I was wondering if I should return it, the phone cannot be charged up any more. Therefore, I returned it without any more hesitation. Because I ordered many accessories with it, and I cannot/or not worth to return them, so it still costs me a quite lot except for all those inconveniences.
I never take the time to write a review, but this time I feel I must go the extra mile to do so, as Hassle Free Cell Phones certainly did for me. I am living and working in Vietnam and needed an unblocked cell phone I could use here and in the USA. I found a KRZR K1 on Amazon and purchased it on my recent visit home. When the phone arrived it didn't work. I sent it back and they sent me another one. The second phone worked but would not ring when receiving a call. I was 4 days from returning to Vietnam and didn't have time to send the 2nd phone back and wait for a replacement. I thought I was just out the price of the phone and would have to wait till I returned to America next spring to buy another one, or pay the inflated prices here in Asia. I called Hassle Free Returns and explained my situation. To my surprise they sent me a replacement and 2 extra batteries overnight express. I got the replacement the day I was leaving for Asia. The phone works perfectly, and I love it! I also love Hassle Free Cell Phones for providing such great customer service. I will never hesitate to buy from them in the future, they stand by their productsMotorola KRZR K1 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Black). Oh yeah one other thing. They told me to keep the phone that didn't ring as a back up. I think that is incredible.
Overall: After a bit over a month of usage, I'd call it OK.PROs: It works. It has a camera and video player.CONs: The video player is not what I expected. Key pad is small. The view on the tiny screen is so-so.Okay, I admit, I haven't used the phone a lot yet or gotten greatly familiar with it. I was looking for a phone that I could use in the U.S. and abroad, where I am living and working now, and I was looking for one I could use to record video/audio without having to lug around another device. (Is there a device out there for under $300, let's say, that has an unlocked quad-band phone--not one that comes with the purchase of two-year cell phone plan, a PDA, and a decent video camera all in one?)Video record--20 secs at a time:The big disappointment was the video record. I was looking forward to having it available when I'm out and about and want to record something unexpected happening, which is fairly often in Nairobi. It records for only 20 seconds at a time. One time it didn't even capture the audio. And, when I converted the videos to my computer, they were the inky dinkiest little things I ever imagined. I can only pray that the audio will at least record--there are times when all I really want is to record some sound...Russian:The phone, books, and keypad came in Russian. Now, of all the languages they could have chosen, Russian was a good one for me, since I have a Masters in it. I can see how that might be a bit tough though for someone who doesn't know a language. Maybe they should provide some quickee instructions with the phone on switching the phone to English. Just a thought... The keypad in Russian is a little annoying. Maybe someday I'll be so familiar with the keypad that I don't need to look, but, alas, I have just gotten into txting the last couple years living in Kenya, where it's really cheap. So, some of the Russian letters that look like English letters throw me off at times.Keypad:I am coming from a simple Nokia phone whose keypad was very nice for my fingers. I do not have big fingers, but the KRZR keypad is too small and hard to use for my taste.MP3 Player:Plays quite well...nice...I like it. I will look forward to using that in my car in Kenya...much easier than dealing with CDs (even if I had a CD player in the car). Not sure how that will suck the battery power--will have to find out.MicroSD card--no more than 2GB:I did see this somewhere later, but, do realize the phone supports no more than a 2GB card. I got a 4GB--doesn't work. The 2GB works great.I haven't tried the phone yet in Nairobi, where I will be using it extensively. So, basically, the jury is still out... Just wanted to give you my initial thoughts.
Phone showed up a little ahead of time. Worked great except couldn't send or receive pictures. I went to AT&T; store and since it was unlocked they couldn't do much. I called AT&T; cust. service and they spent 45 min with no luck. He said the server that the phone was connected to was Canadian and maybe motorola could help.  I went to Motorola online and they had a download to fix. The online called my phone, I answered  and it was fixed.  The phone works excellent, looks slick and I am glad I bought it
I was so excited for this item.  I have been living abroad for about a year and have the crappiest cell phone in the world (Motofone).  I ordered this and had to sent to my mom, who was planning to visit me in Europe in a couple of weeks.  The phone arrived and when she opened up the manual to try to figure out how to use it, it was in Russian!!!  As my mom said, "Luckily, the pictures were in English." haha.  When she turned on the phone, it was also in Russian, but once she inserted the German SimCard I had purchased, we were able to work our way through (the SimCard changed the language to German).  After that, I only have one complaint, the keys have both standard and Russian characters, which really is no biggie.  I have loved every other aspect about the phone, but will have to get a memory card, as the phone does not have enough memory itself to store texts, songs, etc.  Also, the camera isn't the greatest, but I didn't purchase the phone for the camera.  I just wanted something reliable which would allow me to see who called, who I called, allow me to send text messages, wake me up, etc.  This phone does all of that.  So I am happy about the phone itself... just not about the Russian.I would highly recommend when buying the "International Version" that you check with the buyer to see just how "international" the phone is.  Maybe I was dumb, but I thought "International Version" meant that it would work all over the world (like a quad band phone).  When my mom tried to use it in the Netherlands, it didn't work, but it might be because she didn't know how to use it.  It works just fine in Germany with a German SimCard.Great phone, but just make sure it is in the language you want or that you speak the language it will come in.  I think the sellers should do this, but I guess it is a way to get the phones of their hands and trick the customers a little bit.p.s. If you accidentally get a Russian version, just insist that they send you a new one and refuse to pay more for the English version.
I will start by saying that the phone looks beautiful but not what i expected. First, off I want to say that they sent me the instruction and everything associated in Russian, not tooooo happy about that. My advice is to do your homework in regards to the seller an read the reviews. I should have listen to my gut but live and learn, right. Hope this was somehow helpful
"Excellent! Ordered on 4/7/09, rec'd 4/10/09 - In perfect working order, packaged well, shipped fast. Exactly as described. Buy with confidence! Beautiful phones! I could not be happier! KRZR K1 by Motorola for $105 (I bought 2) - Exceptional products delivered in record time, in absolutely outstanding condition. More than I hoped for, better than I expected. I will recommend them to friends! One for me, one for the wife. A lot of good solid technology in a small package. I'm very pleased with everything the phone promises and delivers. My wife likes the small form factor (we had RAZR's) and the intuitive commands. Great phones! <Sidenote>: no toys, no accessories, not even a memory chip, but compared to $280 through a carrier, $105 is worth buying all that on your own dime." You're only going to upgrade all that stuff anyway, so it's well worth it!
This phone is very slim , cute ,and easy to use. it is a flip phone and can be opened easily with one hand.  Setting up this phone was a piece of cake. It came with an adaptor plug which can fit any A/C plug.  The only negative is that it didn't come with a driver CD and a data cable. A big plus was that it was unlock and was able to accept any SIM card. GREAT PHONE.  MILTON
The product is good. I had one so I bought another.  Did not get what I paid for.  Instead of a new phone, I believe I got a refurbished phone.  One key did not work and sometime the screen displayed is not the option I selected from the menu item.  Even though it suppose to be under WARRANTY, there's no registration form or any indication it is or will be.  I believe phone is good but not from this vendor.  Unfortunate, because I had good experience with other purchase on Amazon before.  This will likely be my final Amazon purchase.  Thank you for reading.
If I could give this zero stars, I would. Worst phone I have ever owned. I will NEVER purchase another motorola phone again. Not only is the battery life so pitiful that I had to purchase a car charger to make sure I had battery life in an emergency but the battery alert cannot be turned off without turning off the phone. So, guess who has to get up in the middle of the night to find the phone somewhere in the house- the battery alert is so LOUD (not adjustable) that it wakes up the whole house. And it goes off every minute or 2 for the hour it takes for the darn thing to die. Also, one of the reasons I believe the battery life is so poor is because the image on the front of the phone lights up every 30 seconds- very distracting if you sleep with your phone near you in bed, and also a huge and pointless waste of energy.
this product was everything promised. I had been using the cell that came with my prepaid account for four years ... past the average shelf life. It had no bells and whistles. Nice to finally have a phone with modern conveniences at a reasonable price. I am a real cheapskate - so shelling out even $100 for a phone I would use with a prepaid account was a stretch. Am glad I bought it.
The product was as advertized. It was a gift I bought for someone. So far, the person did not report any problems about the phone. I think it is a good buy.
It is a excelent product, fast delivery. work great. Thak yoEste es un excelente producto, un rapido envio y trabaja genial. gracias
This phone is fantastic. It takes care of all my needs (phoning, scheduling, keeping track of people & data, etc.) while traveling around the world. It's sturdy and doesn't damage easily or initiate functions by accident. Easy to use and fun to use.I love it, and this is the second Razr V3 that I've owned.My only complaint is that it creates a completely different entry in the phone book for different phone numbers for the same contact. My old Razr V3t kept them all in the same line.
I've had this phone for almost a year and really did like it in the beginning. The sound was excellent, the button placement and size made dialing and texting fairly easy. I was very happy with it. Then it started to fall apart... the connections from the screen to the "base" started to go wonky. The screen just randomly goes black and seems to like to stay that way. If I squeeze and push the screen in just the right way I can get the picture to return, but that seems to be working less and less. Most of the time I am unable to see who is calling, what a text message says and I can't hardly use it to text to anyone. The rest of the phone is in great condition, but what good is all that when you can't even see it... :(
great phone even in a market where 2 years makes the last model seem laughable. i have yet to find a phone that has such a good feel to it, -not too small to use comfortably, yet still nice and thin. i only wish that the ringer could be turned up a little louder.
I have been a Razr user for the past 3 years. The new phone I received worked just as well as my previous one. It was unlocked for sure! It has worked with my SIM card as soon as I put it in. It has been the same case, for my father in India as well, after I gifted it to him. He is quite happy with the phone's functionality. He was noticing that the batteries need charging every two to three days, which apprently is unlike his previous phone (a Nokia I think!). That seems to be the only concern.
The RAZR we purchased is so perfect, I will never buy a non-unlocked phone again! The phone is brand new, and at the low price I can't believe we didn't do this before. The company did send a dead-battery originally, but they made up for it by overnighting a replacement.
I bought this phone because it looks like a nice phone.  I had big problems with the phone.  It did not work properly!! The phone would not hold a charge-the battery would die after making two phone calls!!Unfortunately, I had to return the phone and get my money back.
This Cell Phone is amazing, has everything that you are looking in a phone, great quality camara.Now i am using this phone with a 4Gb memory card and works great.I recommend this item
I had own one of this from last 2 years, almost when was on sale on market.Till date, I haven't found one cell better than this. Iphone, Blackberry and Nokia are more expensive than this, but are almost, the same funtions:Internet AccessEmail configurator (even you can add a Bcc for all your message in configuration)SMS and Multimedia Message.Speaker phoneInternal and Micro Memory (till 2 Gbs!)very light.All the tools you could need on work or traveling. And the better thing it has is the Camera, witch can be comparative only to the betters models of Digital Cameras. This is the more amazing cell on market.!!!
The screen on this phone was shattered within 2 days of purchase. The only unusual wear and tear is that the phone was carried in my pocket instead of a case the first few days because I hadn't been able to purchase one yet. Also, now the phone randomly starts the Roger's music player. However, the phone arrived with everything listed in the ad and in the condition advertised.
Well I'll start with this. I liked the phone at first. But now that I've had it for a year and a half I absolutely hate it and can't wait to get something different. There are a few reasons for my utter hatred.1: If you look at it wrong, the screen cracks. I've replaced the screen 4 times and it is currently cracked, but I refuse to replace it again. It is incredibly weak, and unfortunately no one makes a good phone case so there is no protection available.2: The memory card slot never worked. I didn't get the warranty so I couldn't get the phone replaced. So, no music for me and it will only store about 10 pictures.3: There's a 40% chance it will not work indoors. I've traveled to many places, and this seems pretty consistent. It's not an issue with the phone company because other people with the same carrier and different phones do not have this problem.4: The volume and speakerphone are not loud enough. If you use this phone outdoors or in a noisy area, it is very difficult to hold a conversation.5: Shuts off at random times. During calls or while it's in my pocket. It doesn't matter.Overall, it looks like a nice, compact little slider. But this phone is poor quality through and through. Avoid it at all costs.
its really cool with lots of fun features. i like the look a lot and it is really easy to use. there are some features i dont like, the side buttons which are normally used to adjust sound make a status of your phone pop up that includes battery life and memory status. it has music capability but my speaker does not work... and i have never used it but i found out it was blown after my first test of trying to listen to music. it slides decet but scrapes on itself and ruins the blue backing on the edges. Im probably just a little rough with my phone but i reccomend going to a store to get a closer look.
New Sony Ericsson W850i Precious Black GSM cell phone "No Locks"Sony Ericsson W580i Unlocked Quadband Phone (Black)Looks niceGood featuresGood sound...In another words - would be completely satisfactory - if it would work:1. Cannot stand any magnetic field: you cannot use holster with magnetic clip. Good luck finding another one.2. Don't get wet in rain. I don't mean don't drop in water. I mean that a light rain kills it. You can be still dry but the phone is dead already. On the second time it didn't recover at all.3. Reboot it time to time. Some times it just hangs up or refuse to connect with the handsfree unit. One will value this feature a lot once failing to answer an important call.
I am still finding out cool things this phone does 1 month after receiving it!
Looks good, but does not work good.  I have heard others rave about their phone, so maybe I just got a defective phone.  This phone did not come with a headset.  What use is a walkman phone without a headset?  The battery does not remain charged, it has to be charged everyday.  The phone just shuts down on its own, and it deleted everything that was stored on the memory card.
I like all the extra features on this phone...great MP3 player, love the pedometer feature for running, great screen.However, in its main role as a phone it is sub-par.  The speaker developed an anoying buzz after about a year of use.  The keyboard is tiny if you have to type in a lot of phone numbers.  Finally, the internet button is on the front so I accidentally connected several times per week.  It got so bad that I bought a $4.99 data plan because I was wasting several dollars per month on accidental connections anyway!Also, the charging/headset port fails a lot.  I have to jiggle the cord to get it to charge and it often doesn't recognize when I plug in the headset.  I usually have to un-plug and re-plug a few times before the headset works.Finally, the phone locks up a lot and sometimes won't turn on.  I often have to pop it open and re-seat the battery to get it to recover.Overall, cool phone but quirky.
I bought this phone in June, 08. Benn working great till last week. My screen cracked all of sudden without any injury, pressure, or fall. At&T; did not cover it as it is considered physical damage. So I payed 55$ to change the LCD screen... Plus i bought the leather belt pouch to keep the phone safe from everything.  I cooked, we ate, sat down to watch TV when finished was getting ready to go to sleep and took my phone out of leather pouch - GUESS WHAT?? LCD Screen id broken again. no fall/no temperature exposure, no pressure on the pouch. What is this.. do i have to pay money again. Don;t buy this phone. it is fragile.
I bought this phone two days before, and when open the box, i was shocked that, The box dont have a headset (It usually come with walkman product).and in product description , they clearly mentioned 512 MB card is included), but it is not included.If supplier doesnt mention clear details. dont buy.
This phone is packed with features that we like, great camera, holds tons of music. We have had so many problems that we have had to exchange it 4 times now. The worst problem that we have is that with the charger. It wont connect. Problem is you also hook it up to the computer and headset. Won't hold a charge and very difficult to charge or connect to the computer or headset. Not happy with this phone at all!
well i bought this phone since my old one didnt have a camera. its an excellent phone and has great features. but i bought it used and did not know that the old owners SIM card was deactivated, which meant i couldnt use the phone and it was completely useless. now i have to go find a NEW one. guess i should've looked into it a little more before i bought it.
I have owned this phone for over a year now and know it in and out. This is the best phone I have used so far. SE put together a lot of good things in this upgrade to the M600.This phone is intended for the business users who want to have fun once in a while with full set of multimedia features.PROS:1. Shape, Size, Form - This is a very well constructed phone with solid feel. The front has brushed aluminum along the border. The battery cover has a velvet texture which feels nice. This is not a big or small phone. Its perfect in shape and size, just a little thick (0.7"). It isn't too heavy either and feels solid. Taking into account that it has a QWERTY keyboard, its very compact compared to other QWERTY phones.2. Full Touchscreen - The screen of this phone is gorgeous. It has bright and vibrant colors. Photos, videos, fonts are crisp and clear.3. QWERTY keyboard - The 'rocker' style keys on this phone are amazing. It takes a little to get used to but once you're at it...its great to type on.4. UIQ 3 - The OS on this smartphone is UIQ 3 which is very simple and easy to use. Yeah, it crashes but not that much. The user interface is intuitive and slick. There are tons of applications (both free and paid) for the platform.5. Wifi - This phone supports wifi 'b'. It supports several security standards which are easy to use and configure.6. RAM - It has 128mb on board RAm which might be less compared to what other smartphones have these days but it is sufficient for this puppy. You can have many applications open at a time and running simultaneously in the background. It supports multi-tasking as well.7. Camera - It has 2 cameras. The major one is a 3.2mp camera with auto focus and flash. It takes superb pictures with great clarity. It supports video as well. It has a dedicated camera key as well. The secondary camera is a VGA camera used mainly for video conferencing.8. Speakerphone - The speakerphone on this is loud and clear.9. Battery Life - I disagree with reviewers who say that this phone has pathetic battery life. (After over a year of rigorous use) I do not have to charge it for at least 2 days with normal calls and internet usage over wifi.10. Internet Browser - This comes with Opera Mobile 8.65 browser out of the box which gives full html browsing experience (sans flash). A new version of Opera Mobile (9.5 beta) makes browsing much better and is amazing as it has widget support as well. I even run widgets on my phone built for Opera's desktop browser. There are several other browsers available for free too.11. Youtube Support - It plays youtube videos out of the box. Clarity is good not stellar and sound quality is amazing (dependent upon youtube quality as well)12. Bluetooth - It supports full stereo bluetooth with A2DP and AVRCP profiles. You can transfer files (any kind) and sync over bluetooth to other devices as well.13. Email - It has full email support with Microsoft Exchange and Blackberry support built-in. You can download attachments and attach files to emails to send them easily.14. Business Users - It has full support for VPN, Blackberry features and Microsoft Exchange capabilities built-in. These work flawlessly.15. Multimedia - It supports several audio and video formats and also has fm tuner built-in.16. Memory - 160mb on board memory and an expansion slot which supports up to 8gb of memory stick m2 card. Enough for normal use.CONS:1. No 3G Support in USA - This phone is built for Europe and functions completely in Europe.2. Triband GSM.3. Wifi 'g' - No support for 54mbps wifi.4. Support - Weak support from SE. They stopped bringing out new firmwares.5. Non-flush Touchscreen - The screen could be flush with the outer cover for easier functionality.6. UIQ 3 - I am listing this under 'Cons' as well as the platform is dying. There are very few developers working on this technology now to bring out innovative applications.
Very strange phone this, the loudspeaker is terrible. Crank it up to hear music or speech and it distorts horribly. Good features, texting is good, earphones sound ok but overall not a nice phone.
Very Good Battery Life compared to other phones, charges very quickly.  Great Sound, clarity and super easy to use.  very Rugged also.  No complaints!
So I'm reading some reviews on the Treo 750 and it seems all the negative reviews are by people who are completely incompetent with technology and using Google.  Let me first warn anyone who is technologically handicapped, do not buy this phone.  You will get lost in all the OPTIONS, that are available within the phone.On with my review:Windows Mobile can do basically everything you want, just not in the prettiest manners.  Upon receiving my Treo 750, it came with Windows Mobile 6.  It worked well but had some slight bugs, so I upgraded to 6.1 which also has bugs but none that bother me.  6.1 is definitely snappier than the bundled version of windows mobile 6.  You WILL NOT find the upgrade on Palm's Website, you'll need to Google this.Call Quality: 8/10Calls are crisp and clear. I have no problems hearing the other person in a busy street, and they have no problems hearing me.  Although the speaker phone is slightly distorted at higher volume.Battery Life: 8/10Windows mobile devices and any other smart phone/pda (ie. Iphone, Blackberry) are known to have battery life that doesn't last.  This is because of the processing power in these devices.  The Treo has a 312mhz processor.  My first Pentium II computer had a 300mhz processor.  Seriously, what do you expect?  My experience with the treo is that it will last me an entire day with heavy usage, but when I have it on standby (meaning not using it for anything) the battery last for at least 2 to 3 days.Overall Design: 7/10It's a little thick but this phone came out in Dec 2007, so it's not surprising.  The curves on the side make it feel thinner than it really is and makes the phone feel very nice in your hand.  The rubbery feel of the body is nice, and not slippery.  The small keys take getting use to, but once you do, you type extremely fast.  The screen is nice, bright, and big, but I wish it was at least 320x320 instead of 240x240.Usability: 8/10Windows Mobile is a powerful operating system, there are programs to do basically anything, but it isn't all in one place like you have it on the Android phones or Iphone.  There are thousands of free programs and others are paid.  I personally don't need any programs that you need to pay for.Cons:- Windows Media player will absolutely not goto the next song in the play list unless you have the ringer set to on instead of vibrate.- In 6.1, the screen is still enabled when you press the power button to view the time while in locked mode.-Interface isn't fun to look at.-Lacks wi-fiConclusion:I'm waiting for version 6.5 and 7 of windows mobile to come out which drastically changes the way Windows Mobile looks and also includes a app store.  If you can get this phone for under $200, i would say do it.  If you like to text message, the threaded sms is great.  Few bugs in the OS but doesn't affect the overall usage.  And the amount of software available for windows mobile is overwhelming.
I read reviews all the time and this is the first one that I have ever written simply because I am so angry about how horrible this phone is. If I could, I would give it 0 stars. I have had issues from the start. Currently, the Express Mail doesn't work, no connection to pop mail account, short battery life, dials wrong numbers, ringer works intermittently, syncing doesn't work, system "thinks" slowly, internet connection (not range issues) spotty. Pathetic, horrible excuse for a phone. Beware!!!
I bought this product from Hasselfree. It is not working anymore. I have just stopped using it.I am currently using my old nokia 6600. This phone is biggest mistakes I have made. They touch screen goes blank and you have to remove the battery to get it back. You can not attend the call. The voice quality sucks. Battery life is very short. I will just not to buy electronic items online because you never know if they are new one. I believe my item was defective from the begining. I just realized it a little late. But I have decided not to buy anything from this vendor. This is cruel that you spend some good money to buy junk.
I've had this phone two years now and it is a workhorse for email, calendar, use of corporate web forms and on top of that its a great phone.  The bluetooth works seamlessly with my hands free car kit.  With Active Sync, all my contacts and calendar items syncronize with Outlook at work.  Email is pushed instantaneously.  AT&T; service where I live is excellent, so that is not an issue.I use the keypad very hard for email when out of the office.  A virtual keypad like on the iPhone would never do.  I've tried it and its not for me.  After two years there are some keys that aren't as responsive, so I am now looking at the Treo Pro.I had a Treo 650 before this with the Palm OS, but after a while, I really got used to Windows Mobile.  I later upgraded to WM 6.0 and everything works great.  Oh, and Windows Media is fine to play MP3s.The blue coating on the phone is very comfortable.  It almost feels like rubber.  It hardly shows fingerprints and it doesn't slip out of your hand.  This phone is pretty tough.It is nice that you can swap batteries in a snap.  Battery life is less than the old 650 but far better than my coworkers who have iPhones.  I can go a weekend without a charge under normal use.I would definately buy another, but now that the Pro is out, with Wi-Fi, I'll probably upgrade to that sometime this year.
As everything Microsoft does, the operating system of this telephone really sucks!!! I previously owned a treo 680 (palm) and was happy with the processing speed, functions and OS overall performance. When I purchased this model I thought I was upgrading, but I was really downgrading. Phone is reaaaaaaaaally slow in comparison to 680. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this telephone if you have a palm treo.
I finally switched to Windows Mobile after years of PalmOS (Treo 270, 600, 650) and I was sorely disappointed.The user interface is horrendous. It does not folllow any logic. Besides, the phone started to slow down after a few weeks just like my PC does after a new installation of Windows.I sold the phone as quicly as I could to get a Blackberry. Sorry Palm!
I just love, love, love this phone. This phone is ideal for people who do a lot of texting. There are too many features to mention. I refer this phone to all my friends and family.
great phone. could have been made better with built in wifi. Windows mobile 6.0 is good
I have the 755 already and this phone is a great purchase for use while traveling, since it's unlocked.  Windows software is a plus.
I purchased this telephone mainly because you can edit MS Word documents.  I currently carry around the Palm Tungsten and my cell phone and wanted to lessen the weight in my handbag.  I love this phone!  I've had no problems with it, the keyboard is easy to use.  I returned the Centro back to Palm because that keyboard was TOO small - must be meant for the very young.
This is still one of the best PDA / business cell phones on the market for two reasons: easy one handed/touch screen operations and the external antenna hookup...which allows for easy to use hands free car kit operations. Plus it charges the battery and boost signal strength all at the same time. Why can't other manufactures figure this out and produce more phones with the external antenna capacity??
The phone shipped to me by Buy Accessories was packaged in an old shopworn box with a broken seal. The phone was used although I paid for a new one.  Finally, it was marked "Vodaphone" and the charger was made for European electrical outlets, not American.  The person who packed the phone for shipping had to have known that it was not new.I have purchased various items from Amazon and their suppliers, and this is the first time that I was NOT happy with a purchase.  I would not reccommend Buy Accessories for future purchases.
I don't really like this phone. It worked great at first but after 30 days it kept frezzing up on me . I will have to try and return this phone or try to have it repaired.
This is the worst phone I've ever owned. It drops calls all the time, it takes 30 seconds to connect when trying to make a call. Combined with Verizon it makes me want to stop using cell phones entirely. I wonder how both of these companies stay in business.
I bought this cell phone 1 year ago and everything went all right untill last month when I found that the touch screen went all white and I couldn't do anything with it. I sent the phone to HTC's RMA department, they said the LCD was brocken and repaired it for no warranty. I received the phone back and 3 weeks later my screen is once again white and can't do anything with it. I really don't recomment this brand because I always treated the phone good so I don't see I am responsible for the fail.
I purchase this phone for my wife, close to a year ago. She called me and stated she dropped her phone in the toilet (no folks, it was before use). I told her not to turn the phone on (too late). She had done the unthinkable. I just knew I would be coughing up a few hundred dollars. So, I told her to remove the battery, leave the cover off, attempt to gently dry what you can, lay the phone on it's back, wait 3-4 days and put it back together. People the phone works. All functions are a go! Samsung G600, I'll call on you anytime.
Good phone, slim, easy to carry ... Does not weigh much and is slider ...!! 5Mp Camera are good attributes for a good price ...!!!
Good phone, good features for a Boost phone. Camera is ok for web-size pics. Don't expect quality; max resolution 640x480. Phone is good for a about 9-12 months industrial use IF you don't drop it.
Outstanding features available with Boost Mobile Service and the Motorola i855e include:Nationwide Boost walkie-talkieMulti-media messaging and text messagingWireless webColor screenDigital zoom cameraJava enabled games and appllicationsHands-free speakerphone with voice-activated dialingGPS enabledReal music ringtones600 entry phonebookYou can get immediate access to Boost or Nextel subscribers at the push of a button with unlimited nationwide Boost Walkie-Talkie, for a low pay-as-you-go daily fee.An all-around versatile and in-demand phone!
While many people have said that they do not like this phone because of the small keys, as a female I have not found them to be too small and I have average size hands.I do text, everyday, perhaps not as often as others, but nevertheless, find the texting not to be an issue.PROSI love the camera, my phone came with a USB connector, it is so easy for me to transfer pictures.  THE FLASH is amazing!! it is so bright, i like using it as a flash lightThe mp3 player has amazing speakersI bought this phone so i would have a good camera, mp3 player all rolled into one for me.One thing i dont' like is that it won't take really big memory cards (8gb) i think its limit is 1 gb.Overall  i have been pleased i have had it for about 5 months now.  One thing i don't like is that it doesn't display the date, just the time, but that really isn't that big of a deal.
The phone I was sent, is not an international sim lock free Motorola V8, but a Motorola V8 from the telephone provider Orange in the UK with a UK power adapter ! It has probable been 'unlocked by the seller' It has an Orange back plate on the phone and an Orange operating system. It cannot connect to the internet, as it always wants to go via Orange UK. For the price I paid, I fee ripped off. This information was not disclosed in the Amazon advertisement for the phone. If it was, I would not have bought it.
Pretty good cell phone, mostly well designed except for the cover for the headset/charger port, which is flimsy.  Also, I don't like that the headset/charger port are one connector.  And I don't like that the headset connector is not a 2.5mm but some kind of Motorola design.  Had to buy a special OEM adaptor to use a cellphone headset with a 2.5mm plug with this phone.
Some people need to learn to read the review on the website they're buying their products from.  Apparently a few reviewers went to the Motorola website and just assumed that everything listed on the spec page would be included with the phone sold from this site.The review clearly states it comes with 512MB of NON-upgradable memory.  It clearly states there is NO SD or MicroSD expansion slot.  It doesn't mention a touchscreen.This phone does everything the review states.  It's over $80 less than one bought directly from Motorola and you'd think people would understand why that is.We buy these phones because we don't want to be tied to long-term contracts.  This in turn means some of the phones more advanced or even desirable features will be missing.  The phone is capable of 2GB of storage, but only if you buy one directly from a carrier like AT&T.;  The benefits of doing so include getting more memory and few extra features, the drawback is you will be tied to a 2 or 3 year contract, with the full price of the phone (usually inflated to several times the actual retail cost) due if you decide to break it.There are three choices.  First you can pay the full retail price for the phone and still only have the features listed here, the memory listed here (512MB), but you'll get an English manual and maybe a free USB cable.Secondly, chain yourself to a long term contract with penalty clauses for leaving early, but you'll probably end up with a phone that has more memory.  If you're using a phone as media player, this may well be your best choice as long as you know there are far superior alternatives.Finally if you only intend to use the phone as a phone with perhaps email, texting, photos and few other things thrown in, don't want to tie yourself to a contract and you're happy downloading a pdf copy of the manual from Motorola.. then you get the cheapest version, but also the version with the least available features activated.
I've owned my Razr2 for almost two years and I love it. Now that it's time to get a new phone, I've been looking around to see what replacements there are for my Razr, and frankly, there's nothing out there that I think is better. This phone is very well designed and it's easily my favorite cell phone ever. No, it is not a 'smart phone' or Blackberry, but it's slick, plays music, is easy to text on, easy to play games on, and has an SDHC mini expansion port. The screen is very nice and has reasonably good resolution. The camera takes decent photos, especially considering this design is over 2 years old. I'm still not sure what I'm going to replace it with once mine breaks; there doesn't seem to be another flip phone out there that is as sleek and nicely designed as this one.
i think this phone is very good, i got it about 4 months ago and i'm really happy with it, the menus, the camera, contact list, everything is very good... the only thing i don't like so much is that the battery's charge only resist like 2 or 3 days ... mi hope was that it resist like 5 days... about the memory, it has like 512mb, some people care but i don't...very good phone!
its a good phone for just a phone but they should have made it better i enjoy it thx...
I order unlock cell phone MOTOROLA V8 i got the phone works for a week and after that wene lock I email whith company BUT NO SERVICE THEY IGNORE ME VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.VERY BAD QUALITY OF MERCHEDICE
The phone is very good . But the price is little bit more then other web .
Phone was what I wanted except the colour was not dark pearl grey which was what I wanted.
I think it's a great phone, but spanish speaking users will suffer big time.. there's no spanish language in the phone menu...Plus, all the manual that came enclosed with the phone where written in russian or some language from an ex-URSS country.I bought the cell phone thru Amazon and not from any of the other parties that offer the same phone.
I am a very loyal customer of sony products, so it pains me a bit to feel the need to write this review.I have had terrible issues with dropped calls and poor reception with this phone, though in all fairness, that could have been due to the carrier.My real issue with this phone is the quality.  I have had issues with the buttons no longer fuctioning and cracking.  I have gone through several batteries that refuse to accept a charge.  The phone frequently likes to shut itself off, quite randomly, and sometimes rather frequently.  I am all around very irritated with this product.
I liked Sony Ericsson phones, I had another one prior to purchasing the w580i and enjoyed it while it lasted ... but the key words here are "while it lasted". Because after only a little bit over a year the 'back' and 'up' controls no longer work. Which of coarse makes operating the phone nearly impossible. A lot of people had the same problem with this model apparently, go on-line and see for yourself. I can't believe that I bought this phone on March 25 2008 and now here in the first week of April 2009 I have this problem. Whatever happened to making products that last? Besides screwing patrons your also screwing our planet with so much early defective technology that litters our world. AVOID BUYING THIS ONE!Other than that, I liked the phone and all its functions, including its design and I did pay only a penny for it with a two year contact from AT&T.;
I have been using the phone for 2 months. I will write about the phone, instead of the services which was my focus in my first "impression"Overall:It's a great phone, if you need only music player, camera, and phone. And the price is reasonable.Pros:(1) It's a great music player. Wish the playlists can be more easily edited, but I have no complaint about the sound quality, and how I can control. The canal earphone fits me pretty well. Playlists might be more easily edited if I use Sony's software, but I don't use it. I just connect the phone to my PC using USB cable, and drag and drop the mp3 files to "music" folder. By the way, I have no problem using 4GB Sandisk MM, if you're curious.(2) Sound quality as a phone is good, but not exceptional. If I use the earphone, of cours,e it is great. The screen is gorgeous. Probably it is not for people typing messages all the time, but I can occasionally write messages.(3) I have no complaint about the camera, but to be honest I don't use much. Pictures looks OK, except for really dark shot (which is unfair claim I think).Cons:(1) It's not exceptionally sturdy, but I think it's a bit unfair. I think it is average among similar phones from different manufacturers. I am using the plastic case as well as the screen protector. I don't want to imagine dropping this phone without the case...(2) The other similar "mystic green" SE phone looks sexier to me. But that one is not with the genuine Walkman functions (of course you can update the firmware and make the other phone work similar to the Walkman phone). If the functions are the same, I would have chosen the other sexier looking phone.Below is the edited version of what I wrote as "my first impression", which is mainly services.(1) In the product name, it says "US version with warranty", but if you read the description carefully, Amazon says: "This phone does not come with a warranty.". At the end, the seller told me that it is under proper warranty for a year. But Amazon wasn't clear about it.(2) The charger that was initially shipped was not definitely US plug. It has a European plug but a converter is included, making the charger (plus the converter) unnecessarily big. I asked the sellers and they kindly replaced by the true US charger. The service of the seller was excellent. I will definitely consider buying again from them.
Switched to prepaid minutes with T-Mobile and researched to find I could buy an unlocked phone with SIM card (didn't like any of the T-Mobile phones available). Must purchase a SIM card to use with this unlocked phone.This phone is quite cool, except for the fact that the screen could be larger.  The randomly changing screen saver is a beautiful, along with the mysterious side lighting.  Very fun.  The phone has an AWESOME mp3 player; with supplied earphones your music sounds like a symphony.  Without earphones the music is loud enough to hear but is tinny (as usual).  You will need to purchase a Sony memory stick card, which is different from the familiar micro cards we are used to in cell phones.  Without that you have little space for mp3 files.  The Sony memory is limited to 2gb but is enough for me. Purchase the Sony micro stick along with the phone from the same seller to save on shipping costs...The camera takes nice pictures and videos, and even has a feature to turn the photos landscape, which is good because the screen is rectangular.  Really a beautiful, sturdy phone.However - after purchase I discovered that prepaid T-Mobile offers no data plan to access the Internet unless you purchase their Sidekick phone - which is no longer sold on the T-Mobile website at all.  So, this Sony phone has many great apps and free games from their website that I am unable to access because I have no Internet capability with T-Mobile. Sony also does not let you download any apps or games through your home computer...must be directly through an Internet connection to your phone. This phone will take and send video and picture messages and text messages though.  Just think everyone should know of this limitation.  I thought I did all my homework but somehow missed this when researching prepaid cell phones.  You can sync up to your home computer to transfer picture, video, and mp3 files, which is quick and convenient.Sony customer support was nice and helpful.  T-Mobile support is off-shore but helpful, although time-consuming.Would probably love this phone better with a different service provider where Internet was available through a data plan, but I will keep the phone because of the other positive features.
Well, the love affair is over. I did not require much in terms of a phone, beyond making and receiving calls and texts. It did that. The main outstanding feature of this phone is the constantly changing, beautiful and seasonally appropriate graphics. Now, all that is gone and I can not read the screen.Unfortunately, about two weeks ago, I noticed a little blemish on the screen (it looked like a scorch mark). This deepened into a dark patch, obscuring any display on the upper right hand corner of the screen. Then last night, the screen went almost completely dark and nothing I have tried restores it. There is a very faint glow (maybe 5 % visibility) so I can't read texts nor the numbers in my address book, or caller id.I am very disappointed. For the money, I expected these features to last.
I've had the phone a few days now and am enjoying hearing people.  They can hear me too!  I guess I really needed to replace that other phone, but my network insisted it was "working".  The large bright screen is easy to read also and the back lighting on the keys is a super asset.  The documentation is out of date, but Sony answers the support phone quickly and misunderstandings were quickly resolved.  The buttons are smaller than I'm used to, but give a satisfying click when properly pressed.  Music works only on the media card, not clear in the doc, and is gorgeous.  My set came with a USB cable and stereo headphones which handle calls too, as well as a charging cable.  Had another Sony a while back and I find the menu system superior and easy to use. I was hoping for a good usable phone and a decent mp3 player and got more than I had hoped for.  Really nice equipment.
We purchased this unlocked phone because my daughter's phone was dropped and no longer working right three months before the end of the 2 yr contract period.  This phone is very similar to the Walkman she had before but with the added bells and whistles of color changing and screen animations with day/night changes and seasons changing.  She loves the phone - and best of all - she has not come to me with any problems.  The phone was about 1/2 the cost of the ATT Walkman and lives up to its advertising.  Can't ask for more.
This phone is sleek, has tons of functionality and is sturdy (landed on it in my pocket while wrecking my dirtbike... works wonderfully).  For a list of features and an in depth review I'd check one of the c-net or other tech review sites, but as far as price-quality ratio it's a winner.
I just recently bought this product, and have used it for about a month now.  As far as features go this phone is loaded with many cool features you don't find in just any other phone such as the light effects. The phone is also very stylish and fits good in your hand, pocket, etc.  But where the phone lacks is in its performance.  The phone at times can be Extremely Slooooow! Especially during text I text allot and this phone is way to slow for my liking.  Over all I am satisfied with my s500i and i recommend this phone to anyone looking for a functional but feature full phone just get used to slow texting!!!!
Wow, I like it. I had a sony before, so it is easy to operate. I love this model.
it is working just fine.  The plug-in charger it came with was a european plug, you sent me a U.S. adapter for it, but it does not work together very well.  If there was just a standard u.s. plug-in battery charger (not adapter), that would have been nice.thanks,Brenda Kent
A good quality, sleek design, simple to use phone and above all, good value on amazon.
This phone works great. The battery life is amazing and the ringer volume can be set quite loud so I never miss a call. I also use it as a mp3 player and it is great as I have a 1gb memory stick micro in it with all of my favorite songs. The camera is good too. The slider feels sturdy. The green and black give the phone a unique look as well. It is also smaller than what I thought it would be. It is the same size as the w580. But this one is better in my opinion when it comes to looks and the placement of the buttons.
The general functions are good and I like its appearance. However, I found it is not availabe to connect this phone with my laptop.
This is a very nice phone.  Not only it's pretty, it's very easy to use!
I  BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY GIRLFRIED BUT I USED IT FOR A DAY BEFORE I GAVE IT TOO HER..ITS A CHEAP FEELING PHONE AND SO FAR MY GIRLFRIEND HAS HAD IT FOR A WEEK SHE AGREES IT FEELS CHEAP. I HAVE HAD A SONY PHONE BEFORE, THE W800 WHEN IT CAME OUT WHICH I LOVED BUT THIS A VERY BASIC PHONE AND DOESNT FEEL SOLID.NOTHING EXCITING ABOUT THIS PHONE. THE SIM CARD ISNT ALWAYS RECOGNIZED BY THE PHONE WHEN INSERTED WE HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT FOR A WHILE WHENEVER WE TAKE THE CARD OUT. OVER ALL I DONT THINK ILL WILL BUY A SONY PHONE FOR A WHILE BECAUSE IT DOESNT SEEM OR FEEL LIKE A THEY ARE STURDY PHONE NOW DAYS..I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED.FROM NOW I WOULD STICK WITH A GOOD NOKIA PHONE.HOPE THIS SAVES A FEW PEOPLE. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY I DID
I have had my original blackjack for a year and a half now. It is the best phone i have ever owned and it never gives me problems. It is extremely durable as i have a tendency of throwing my phone when angry and it still works fine.(just a few scratches). Keyboard is great and the internet browser is superb. Many apps are available if you look online and includes Microsoft Word which is convenient. Only complaint would be low camera resolution in the dark due to no flash.
I needed a new phone that I could organize myself with. This is perfect. It hasn't let me down. The Qwerty keyboard is something to get used to but when you do its great. There are plenty of good security measures to use on this phone and I don't feel the least bit limited. Great phone, great buy.
I have only had this phone for about a month, and I have had nothing but problems with it. It always says "No Sim" so I cannot make calls or send texts. This phone also seems to be pretty slow compaired to past cell phones I have had such as the blackberry pearl. I am not happy with this phone.
hello, i think Nokia is the best to make cellphones, but the best products of nokia are expensive, so this nokia 5610 have the basic , if you want A better cell , buy a N SERIES ( 95,96,96,ETC).
I bought two of these to replace phones we already had that were having problems. We had more problems with these than I've had with any other phone. Phones would intermittently turn off, drop calls all the time and were difficult to program. Each of the phones we purchased had different language settings (neither was English) which only made everything that much more frustrating. Replaced these phones again after 6 weeks of constant trouble.
The phone never worked at all !!! I purhased it to us in Africa but couldn't use it. It was a waste of money. I wish I could return it for a refund.
I use the Boost pay as you go plan. I only use my cell phone for around two minutes a day, so the plan is absolutely perfect for me. Texting is 10 cents as well - to send and recieve - which can get surprisingly expensive quickly. If you're a textaholic, go with Virgin's monthly texting plans.Anyway, the phone isn't great, but it is so better than some of the other entry level prepaid cell phones I have had *points to Tracfone, ATT GoPhone and espically Net10*. I see people complaining that the phone seems easy to break. Here's the solution: Be gentle with your phone! If you can't, get one designed for "rugged" use. And if any of the covers break for this phone, you can get a replacement cover on amazon for around $4.The screen, yes, it kinda sucks. It's grainy and the colors seem washed out. Does this bother me? Not really. If you're one to look at your phone a lot, espically for web related stuff, stay away from this phone. But if you just need to talk and text (sometimes), it's perfect.The calling quality is decent, and far exceeds most entry level prepaid phones (I'd definately prefer it to the blue Samsung cameraphone that Verizion's prepaid service uses).The only issue I really have with this phone is that the button layout is somewhat irritating. The directional pad buttons are surrounded by other buttons that activate various features (see picture), so it's easy to press the wrong thing. But I paid $20 for this phone, so I do not expect it to be without some flaws.I do like this phone. It's a prepaid phone that I'm not ashamed to pull out and use. Go for it if you just need a basic prepaid phone!
Regarding the phone, it touts all of these great features, "Multi-media", Wireless Web, Color Screen, Picture Viewer, Java Enabled Games and Applications, GPS Enabled.  That's great...but the quality of the screen is so grainy that you can't even tell what most of the icons are, the screen always looks faded and it looks like one of the first color-screen cell phones that came out.The phone is obviously very breakable, as the battery cover (the entire back of the phone) pops off and is a flimsy piece of plastic that anyone could easily bend and it would snap without any effort.  If (or more likely when) I drop it in the parking lot the whole back and battery will most likely fly in opposite directions...can't wait!  And the plastic cover for the charger/earphones is waiting to pop off any day!Seriously though, for the price, currently $29...it's a deal.  It's no iPhone, just a mediocre cell phone with a great price and some nice features.  Quality of picture vs. price is my biggest complaint.  I would have gladly have paid a few extra bucks for a better picture quality phone screen...and do not let the picture of the phone on this website or boostmobile.com fool you, the screen is not that crisp, not easy to read and some of the icons leave you wondering what the heck does that mean.  I'm actually thinking of taking it back and exchanging for another phone.One last thing, boostmobile.com says this phone has bluetooth, it does not.
If you download the INSTAMAPPER software and put it on the phone, you can track this phone.  Try doing that anywhere else for just 16.99 for the device...not going to happen.
I purchased this phone unlocked for my girlfriend so she could use it with any service provider.You have to constantly wipe off the front of it because your makeup & everything else makes it look nasty.It was a great phone for the first 7 months untill she dropped it on accident.The upper corner of the mirror cracked when she dropped it,And now sometimes when she slides it shut it will just completely shut off.I highly advise you to buy a case for it or keep it in something because once you drop it, its all downhill from there.
This phone is incredible really. Just buy it. I got it from another store for 990$ when it was released. It was worth every penny.
Product exceeded expectations, whith no competitors for the price. It's easy to operate, intuitive and friendly.Already proved to work in USA and Europe.
The firmware loaded on the phone is buggy and several features, including VOIP and the Download! application, simply fail to work.  Nokia has a firmware update application (PC only) on their website, which solves these problems.  The list of fixes is extensive, so I wouldn't bother configuring the phone before flashing the phone to the updated firmware.  You can back up your settings to a memory card or a PC if you already configured it, then restore the settings after you flash to the new firmware.  Otherwise a lovely little phone.
I had been eyeing this phone since last fall, but kept looking for something better and newer. I didn't find it. Finally, as my old Nokia 6682 was falling apart, I decided I'd better get this. I have had the E51 for 3 weeks now and I am kicking myself for not having bought it sooner! I was primarily waffling between this and the E71, but I prefer the numerical keypad and the sleeker design. I am not sorry I chose the E51. It can do just about everything the E71 can, and it is a really good looking phone too.SETTING UPCopying all of the information from my old Nokia to the E51 was a snap -- when I first turned on the new phone, it asked if I wanted to copy info from another phone. I just activated bluetooth, told it what I wanted to copy (I chose only contacts and messages) and it did, except that it has dedicated buttons for contacts, email, and calendar. Since I am not setting up a mailbox, I changed the dedicated mail key to open up a text message (short press) or take me to the messaging home screen (long press). Each button is customizable (tools > settings > general > personalization > one touch keys). All of the buttons are a little firmer than on previous Nokia models that I have had, so I have to remember to push them a little harder when typing text messages. But the plus side is that buttons are far less likely to get pressed when it is in my purse or pocket. (I don't always remember to lock the keys.)3G WORKS IN NYCWith all of the trouble I have been hearing about 3G and dropped calls, I purposely chose this phone to avoid 3G. It works like a charm and I have great signal strength. While the specs say that the 3G will only work in Europe, the phone showed that it was operating on the 3G network during a recent trip to NY. When I left NY, it went back to not being on 3G.WI-FI - FAST!I don't use an AT&T; data plan, and the availability of wi-fi was a key reason why I got this phone. The wi-fi is blazing fast. It's so amazing, I can barely believe it. The screen is small, however, so if you have trouble with fine print even with reading glasses, it might not be ideal for you. The images are sharp, the screen quality is excellent, and I have no trouble with the sound. (When using the built-in speakerphone, the speaker is on the back of the phone, so just turn it around to hear better.)CAMERA, SO-SOThe camera isn't that great and has no flash, and probably not as good as the one on the Nokia 6682. But isn't that terrible for a quick snap of something you need to remember. (If I'm going to an important event and want high quality photos, I carry a camera.)MUSIC & FILE TRANSFERS ON A MACWhile I bought this phone primarily for its business functions, I decided to put some music on it. It was easy transferring files from my Macbook to the phone, and unlike the old Nokia models, the Macbook can browse and copy files to and from the E51 via bluetooth. I copied about 10 songs and made a custom playlist on the E51. The phone comes with a stereo wired headset if you want to use it to listen to music.USING MICRO SD CARDSAnother note, I had difficulty getting memory cards to register but one intelligent phone guy at BestBuy figured out what I was doing wrong -- when inserting the memory card, slowly keep pushing it all the way to the left until you almost can't see it anymore. It will click again and the phone will make a beep. It's deceiving because you get a premature click when the card is inserted even though it's not all the way in. I've read that a lot of people were having a problem getting memory cards to register, and my guess is that they are not in all the way. (I bought the Kingston 4GB class4 card from Amazon and it works fine.)Good luck in your phone choice. I really adore my E51. It's sleek, slim, looks beautiful in silver. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it already, and it does everything I need it to do.
I got this and used it with my T-Mobile Flexplay plan and it is the absolute best. You cannot buy a phone through the major U.S. carriers out there that can even compare with this phone. I owned a Blackberry Storm before this, which was supposed to be a very high tech phone. The features were OK but the phone just had too many problems. After using the Nokia E51, I think I will be a Nokia smartphone user for life. No problems and there are more and better features on this phone compared to the Blackberry. If you are a business user, this phone is perfect. The battery life is also very good and lasts a long time even when I use it constantly to surf the web via wifi. I get compliments by people telling me how "sexy" this phone looks with the silver chrome. Overall, i would definitely recommend this phone to anyone.
This is an excellent phone for the price and quick replacement when I had to return my company's Blackberry. I was recently in London and it supported  international calling with excellent clarity. It supports 3G spectrum. If you've own previous Nokia phones then you'll know how easy it is to navigate this phone. This is a simple smart phone which handles well. I have very few to no missed calls. It doesn't replace the blackberry, however it came in handy.
The phone has a good look, but it keeps rejecting my sim card. The on button is difficult to press and can't figure out how to get mms to work.
this phone does morethan its size there is onething that i want to share with you all and that is this phone is gps capable you can download google maps on it .but it wasnt stated in the discription on here so yes it is us 3g with at&t; and gps capable very fast phone when browsing the internet
I'm been using this phone for like 6 month and I'm satisfied with the purchase. The call quality is good (and it comes with headset). S60 is easy to use. You can view PDF, word, ppt... but the quality is not that good. You can also synchronize your calendar/contacts/.. from outlook through the PC Suite software (download the latest version from their website, the one in the box is old) with bluetooth. If you use wifi then there's a lot of applications available: Gmail, Google Maps, IM... I dont really use it to surf web cuz the screen is too small and it isn't easy to use a keyborad to navigate, but the browser does display real html pages as you see on your PC.Cons:1. Screen not big enough2. When I received the phone I found there's slim gap around the thing that covers the camera len. After a while my len is covered with dust and there's no way to clean it. I don't use the camera anyway. But I think Nokia should pay more attention to details like this.
I always wondered why most of the new phones out there dont last more than a day in autonomy. Packed with so many useless features that drain your power out before you even know it. If you like battery performance and want to use a phone with great Autonomy, this is the phone you need. Essential features for a professional and business use, on top of a reliable power source. You get a least 5 Days, with a reasonnable use. If you are a big traveler and dont want to worry about carrying you charger everytime, you will love this phone.Strong Built, 3G capable, GPS, 2MG camera, wi-fi,  music/Video player, nice shortcuts keys, Very light a stylish for a smartphone .... too many pros to list hereI recently switch from my samsung Omnia because that thing was dying on me all the time. 24h of autonomy and absolutely no more, it was a pain.Also it took forever to charge up. Bought at 400$, It was draining power like a beast and running multiple useless applications on the backgroud.I sold the OMNIA it and now Im happy with my NOKIA E51.This phone phone cost less than it should, make a smart move and im sure you wont regret it.
The phone looks and works great.  It is very light.  Its Wifi capabilities are very handy, its computer software very easy to work with.  Good shortcut keys to facilitate most common actions.  Good memory space.  The only complaint is that it heats in calls over 20 minutes, sometimes cutting the phone call connection.
I bought this product as replacement of the Google phone G1. I wanted to downsize a little bit after owning every gadget known to men...The E51 does everything well, is very light, very easy to use and very stylish. The only negative for me is the lack og compatibility with the different 3G networks offered in the U.S. Whether it's T-mobile or Att, the E51 is not compatible with their 3G networks.
I loved my nokia e51. Notice I said loved.  It was beautiful and had great battery life and good WIFI, etc.  About 10 months after I bought my phone (which had worked perfectly) I had dropped it a very short distance and my key pad stopped working.  So I sent it back. It was under the standard one year warranty.  They sent me a new nokia e51. Well This new phone would not register my SIM card which I know for a fact worked. I sent this phone back and got another new nokia e51.  which suffered the same problem; so, I sent it back.  AND they sent me another new nokia e51.  I know this story is beginning to make the nokia e51 sound like the worst phone ever, but I promise there was a reason for it. This one still had the SIM card invalid message. So by now due to conflicting schedules I am over my one year warranty, but still suffering problems. Nokia had decided that since the e51 is not working well with me, they will trade out my model for a new (possibly refurbished) nokia e71 model. I will keep this updated, but I love nokia. My first phone (2002) was nokia and with customer service that just is perfect and nothing but helpful I will continue to use Nokia.  Their phones are great and offer many many applications and programs and their customer service is just amazing.  SO shop nokia. It was worth my time.
A great phone.  Looks awesome and has great functionality.  Saved me on a recent trip to Japan where my other phone (Nokia E71) did not work.  Only drawback in the phone is the lack of a full QWERTY keyboard.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with it.
Elegant phone full of features camera great pictures  wellworth the price Im very pleased
this phone is to expensive, in my country of trinidad and tobago is way way cheaper like US$150
It has all of the important features of its larger cousins...After having it for a couple of months I decided to upgrade to an E71. Well I've used the larger one for some three months again and I'm switching back. My reasons:- The E51 is really compact for a smartphone... I think this is very attractive.- I didn't use the qwerty keyboard as much as I thought I would. As a matter of fact, I found it too crowded, and hard to use without looking at it. It was also hard to use it one handed. Since having a good tactile feedback is one of the reasons for not switching to a touchscreen device, I think the numeric keypad is much suited to my needs.- The E71's screen is larger, but still not as large as I would've liked it to be... I think the small extra in real-state is not used well enough, and thus sub-utilized.
Like others have said, this isn't a phone for those with large fingers. If you're looking for a business phone with a qwerty keyboard, then this isn't your pick. Nonetheless, the phone is elegantly built, with lots of features.Pros:1. Lightweight, can easily fit into your shirt pocket.2. Great design with adequate reading space unless you have vision problems, that is.3. Very low price (bought mine for US$197) for a business class phone.4. Good battery life (but watch out if you want to use the wireless and Bluetooth together all day).5. Great at multitasking. At times, I have 5 programmes running. Just a few taps and you can switch between each of them painlessly.6. Supports up to 8 GB TF Micro SD cards and yes, it takes the SuperHDC ones too. Can't run out of storage space here.Cons:1. Prone to Symbian viruses. Like all Symbian based phones, better get an antivirus. You never know what may hit you.2. Should come with the ability to charge using the USB Cable (Hope Nokia fixes their darn old habit of not allowing the phone to charge via the USB cable.Great product. I'd recommend it to anyone needing a business phone.
The first phone had a defective microphone inside, however Amazon sent me a new phone next day air. Wow. I do love this phone. It is slick, functional and Nokia is my favorite phone for overall quality. This black e51 does everything good, maybe it tries to do too much. It could be a little bit louder on every phone. Headphone power is good but not my ipod. Speaker is ok, but not loud. It could use a 3.5mm headphone jack like the rest of the planet. The wifi works great, but the menu is a little confusing, and the mail section with yahoo won't let me go on wi fi. It must be just for cell companies. You can just go to the internet and go to yahoo but it takes longer. You can turn off the cell internet to prevent overcharges that's nice. Please understand I do love this phone I'm just being critical. Trust me you will baby this phone, and want it back in your hands when others look at it. Unless I'm just obsessive compulsive. Great screen clarity. The music is clear, and makes great ringtones too. It looks basic yet modern and is high quality throughout. Amazon's quick response made me a loyal fan. You will not get the same treatment from best buy or any other electronics big store.
This phone does everything Iphone's/Pre's/Storms offer and more (from a functional perspective). It probably requires a bit more tech savy than the other mentions, but once set up everything works smoothly. I got IMAP emails from the office, Exchange calendering, GMAIL, Internet radio, VOIP to work perfectly - over wi-fi when @ home, or GPRS when on the road.An excellent buy - highly recommended for the more technically inclined.
This unlocked Nokia E51 is a very slim but powerfull cellphone. Full applications as bluetooth and WiFi for internet navigation and many others like games, voice commands. Nice metal body and very light weight.
A great cellphone BUT.... The problem relies on Nokia warranty. In sub-dev countries, like Brazil (unfortunatelyit`s my country :( ) warrant does not work. Mine worked just 5 months and died. I sent twice to Nokia Tech Service, but Nokia returns with a "Lost Warranty" due to humidity exposure. But I live in a tropical country, humidity is usual (Nokia Consumer Service absurdly told me not to use the cell phone at kitchen!!!!!) . Bad example from Nokia. If you need a reliable cell phone, try BlackBerry, or Samsung.
Who likes to be simple and slick, this phone is for you. I had 3 and i keep buying the same over and over again. 1st one was swimming in the pool with me, worked for few days after then died, 2nd phone has similar water damage so half of the keyboard was not working and third was lost. If you like candy-bar phones this is the only way to go. Battery life is good not like the Nokia Music phone or even blackberry 8830. Feature rich (pdf, docs, excel, games, etc), has wi-fi, plus its Symbian and thats all i have to say about competition. Great value for the price.
Having gone through a variety of phones - smartphones, dumbphones, windows phones, heavy ones, light ones etc, I didn't think I'd give 5-star to any phone.But E51 really deserves 5 stars. It's awesome because:- Thin and Light- Intuitive- Good phone features- Acceptable data features- VoIP that actually works- Strong signalThis is my first higher end Nokia after many years, and they rock! I'm so impressed by the E51 that I've already decided my next phone will be a Nokia e-series!
If you are looking for a compact mobile with all the latest technology and without burning your wallet, this mobile is for you. I have been using it for about 2 months and I am happy I made this decision. It has 3G, Wifi, Triband, email, Browsing, Music, GPS and all other stuff. I am not sure if you can expand the memory upto 8GB but mine works with a 4GB microSD card. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Good stuff.
This has to be one of the best phone in the market...still! I like phones small in size, so i don't have to juggle stuff in my pockets, and this one fits in nicely. Its got wlan, making internet access two clicks away while i am on campus or at home. It has decent battery life, though the size does limit the battery size. But above all, its simplicity conceals its power making it a very decent companion. I bought a second one after i swapped my old one for an n810 with my brother...a year after i had bought my first one. Why? Because nothing else did the same stuff better :)Again, if you don't mind large phones, this might not be the one for you, but if you would have a small powerful phone, this is something you should definitely look into!Update : 29Sep2010The phone is working great after about 2 years of use, though the battery is kind of killing me. It has swollen in the middle, and after reading some reviews on the net, i replaced it with another battery. There seems to be some other problem with it now, it randomly drains instantaneously... and then charges up again pretty quickly probably a short circuit. One possible reason for the short circuit might be something i noticed; the rubber buttons (top and side) have begun to erode rapidly... i suspect the nokia engineers did a fabulous job in ensuring this so you would go out and buy a new phone... the trouble is i can't seem to find a decent nokia device after this. I am going to get a t6 screwdriver and see if i can replace the kit myself... not gonna let you go that easy :)And Nokia customer services has not answered my emails on the swollen battery issue... for now i am sticking to my E51!
Good all around phone, not for a committed Blackberry user though. I have had no problems with connections, and its download time is great. I will buy a wireless keyboard and a phone caddy.
I have always purchased a Nokia and went out to try a Samsung Blackjack. Well, to keep it simple, the Nokia e51 is a great phone that has excellent signal. For example, with my Samsung, I could not really use it inside my room but with this phone no problems also reduced my dropped calls.The phone feels really solid in my had and the quality build is nice. The side buttons that are a bit hard to press, like the volume button and off button. But thinking about it, one of my older Nokia had the problem of side button being to easy to press so I had to always adjust the volume.Another thing I was impressed with was the battery life on this phone. I know this is because the screen is not as big as many other phones. Specially phones with touch screens which sucks the like out of it much faster.This phone has many features as the more advanced Nokia but in a compressed version. This phone is perfect for someone that does not like bulk and pretty much use it regulary meaning, text, calls and occasional email.Great phone!
I have had this phone for a little over a week and its by far the best phone I've ever had. I previously purchased a Nokia N75 from AT&T; and i must say that was one of the worst decisions i ever made. The battery on the phone would die with a days use. the battery on the E51 lasts for ages!!! i charged it fully when i received and didn't have to charge it for 5 days and i txt quite a bit. its also really fast when switching from application to application i never realized how sluggish my N75 was until i bought this phone. i was easily able to connect to the wireless at my house it was quite fast. also, when i first ordered the phone i thought it looked ok, but when i received it i have to say it surprised me how simple and elegant it was. it also felt very sturdy compared to my old flimsy N75. All in all i have to say this is one of the best decisions I've ever made i'd definitely buy this phone again!!
I am very dissastisfied with Nokia. I spent $300 on an E51 a little over a year ago. The phone screen died after the warranty period. I sent it to be repaired and it was sent back with a note that it was unrepairable. I called customer service and was told it was unrepairable because the e51 is not manufactured anymore. A $300 phone should last longer than a year and if nothing else be repairable. I will never purchase a Nokia phone again.Matthew Lattimer
This product is for the ones that are not used to a PDA where you have to write with very little buttons and that same time it has all the features of a PDA phone.
Exacty what I expected and wanted! I am very picky when it comes to cell phones... I don't want flip phones, I don't like full keyboard phones and I wanted a flat and compact phone with business applications and tools. For decades I am a convinced and happy Nokia user - It just never dissapoints when you know what you want!
Such a great phone. My job keeps me going from office to the field, where my pda is prone to damage. The organizer, microsoft office file handler and other applications help my pda stay save. The interface  on screen constantly shows my next scheduled task (synchronized to PC),  just pressing a button to call it from sleep mode. The three configurable buttons takes you to the application you want, added to six possible selections on screen. Email transmitting and reception is easy, as well as web browsing.thanks
So I purchased this phone as I wanted a phone that was unlocked and was quad band. It was also really important for the phone to have wi-fi and bluetooth. I have never used an s60 based phone. I have to say I'm pleasently suprised. The phone was designed very smartly. The shortcuts make sense, and you can modify them. The side buttons as mentioned by other posters are REALLy hard to use, but they rarely are.The OS allows for great customization and the use of any software you want. A little know how is nice to have but not really necessary.Skype works through Fring, with a native Skype client in the works. The browser has been thoroughly though of and works very well. The email client works great.The pictures do not do this phone justice. The phone really does look great. Very thin, and very professional feel to it.I would highly suggest this phone to anyone that wants a phone just as capable as the iphone without all the hype.
Got the phone in the time promised. Slipped the SIM card in and the phone was up and running in a couple of minutes. Found my home wireless and connected effortlessly. The FM radio is great, and could be listened to over the included wired headset. I like the layout of the main screen, the feel of the keypad, and well laid out controls. Took some pics with the built in camera, and they came out sharp as a tack. Another Nokia winner!
Fantastic in every way except 2.  It won't sync up with my 2006 BMW's bluetooth (known problem - I should have researched better) and it doesn't get my AT&T; text messages, annoying the people who I don't get back to.
I had this phone for almost a year. Phone performs perfect as a phone. As an intertainment device is rather dull. Speaker sound is mediocre. Camera quality is low, similar to iPhone. I replaced it with Nokia E71 this January - definetely an improvement. Though most of functionality of E71 exists on this phone and it is smaller and a lot cheaper!
There is a lot of great technical stuff written about this phone on this site, not going to repeat.Five stars is for almost perfect products... this phone has to fix little moles, for example the lack of front camara, the speaker is on the rear, connecting to WLAN with hidden SID is very, very painful,...If you can live with those and other shortcomings buy it, this is a good product.Appart from this, the phone is performing as expected.Amazon service was excellent.
Bought 2 Black Nokia E51 from Amazon and overall am very happy.PROS:+ Over good build Quality.+ Thin and Light, but has a solid and durable feel.+ Excellent call quality on Normal, Blue tooth and Loudspeaker use.+ Candy bar form, No moving parts, no mechanical issues (slider etc).+ Lot of Bang for the Buck:  + Unlocked Quad band, works worldwide.  + WiFi, Blue Tooth, Infrared.+ Lot of 3 party applications (Free and Paid).  + For VOIP, Chat, productivity and other applications.CONS:- Buttons on the side have poor tactile feel. Practically Useless- Keypad needs getting used to and patience, for text input usage.- Amazon pricing (Dropped $20 a week after purchase), that's $40.00 for the 2 phones.- Small Learning curve for S60 OS 1st timers.- Not much of Protective Cases available.- 2.5mm Headphone Jack (3.5mm could have been ideal).- Camera and image quality could be better.  - For Outdoor/good lighting use only  - Photos for computer use only (Printing not really??)For the current price of US$200.00 (as on 04/15/2009) from Amazon, Highly recommended.Oh and about Amazon, still a very reliable and efficient Internet merchant. Congratulations!
Awesome unlocked smart cell phone! A steal at this price for all the features it has! It has built-in wi-fi so you can web-browse for free at wi-fi hotspots. I can check my email on yahoo or browse the internet and never use up my minutes on my pre-paid T-Mobile plan. This phone also has a video player, mp3 player, 2 MP camera and FM tuner too. Who needs an over-priced IPhone with all the extra fees? The only item that is missing on this "almost perfect" cell phone for me, is a built-in camera flash.
First of all, price alert: As of Mar 29 2009, Nokia's online shop lists this at a discount price of 239 USD though it's on back-order.And now the review.Pros:* Good voice quality, good reception.* Though thin and sleek, the metal casing feels very sturdy.* VOIP works. Native Skype would have been great, but I'm using Skype through third party (Fring and Nimbuzz, both free) which is good enough.* Decent applications, e.g. messaging, calendar, web browser, document viewers. I've never thought that I'd actually use this for web browsing, but it is doable despite the tiny screen.* Most importantly, this doesn't break my wallet.Cons:* Keyboard is not the greatest thing for typing. I know, it's not designed for that, but decent applications means that a better keyboard would be very useful.* Camera is OK, not great.All in all I'm quite satisfied with the phone.
After researching many other phones, I purchased the Nokia E51 and I am delighed with my choice.The phone offers excellent call quality, good battery life, a good solid feel, and all of the features I need in a smartphone.After a disappointing experience with the Nokia 6126, I was a bit hesitant to buy another Nokia but with this phone, Nokia has definitely redeemed themselves in my eyes!
This phone is awesome, it does everything!! I bought it for my brother and he was more than happy. You can play tons of games football, Mario, tennis, surf the web wherever you are, google maps, radio, even the ringtones are fun! Worth the price.
Overall the phone is pretty good for what it is. A budget wifi capable smart phone. The look style and feel of the phone is great, the headphones broke within a couple weeks and were not very good to begin with. The button never worked well and one speaker quit in about a week. The jack ended up breaking off. The ear pieces never fit well and the volume was not very loud. My next complaint is about the speaker in the phone itself. When the volume is turn up to an adequate level the speaker vibrates against the printed circuit board and creates a buzzing noise. I had to take the phone apart and place a small piece of thin rubber between the speaker and the board to get it to stop. Works well now. I would still recommend this phone if you want to save money and you want to have the wifi capability to go online occasionally.
A great phone for the ATT network. Love the sync capabilities and the wi fi without the bulk of a comparable phone.Lots of software available and easy to navigate.If you love Nokia phones, you will not be disappointed.
I won't list all the nice features of the phone - there is enough other reviews on that subject. My own experience with the phone has been great as well. Until it broke down. The phone just died and won't turn on anymore. When connected to charger the light and screen backlight come on for a few seconds then turn back off. I am sending it for repairs - will see if Nokia honors the warranty Amazon promised. By the way it looks like I am not the only one having this problem - just google for "E51 won't turn on"There are a few other negative things I have (or had - while it worked) to say about E51 in no particular order. First if you need input for non-latin languages, that is not going to be easy because apparently it requires re-flashing the device creatively with localized (for the country where the language is used) version of Symbian - which obviously voids the US warranty and too much of a hassle.Second, as somebody noticed, the dust accumulates behind the screen quickly and I see no way to remove it.Third, custom voice recognition is not supported - so you can not train the phone to recognize your voice (or language) for voice dialing. You have to pronounce names of your contacts with English accent or they won't be recognized. This is ridiculous - even my old 6230 allows me to assign any voice tags I want.Fourth, the camera produces pictures with annoying green tint which makes it almost unusable. There is no tint in "night mode" but then you loose quality. This problem has been discussed in various forums many times with hope that the "next" software release would fix it. Which obviously hasn't happen in a couple of years the phone has been on the market.
Love the phone but Amazon pricing sucks.  They dropped the price a week after I paid for the phone.
[Note: my review is not about the seller but the device]I will not repeat every comment others made but I will say this: it works on the right frequency for high speed data if you DON'T live in the US. If you live in the US this phone is not for you. In addition (and possibly not coincidentally) this phone will eventually get into a mode where it will drain all the battery as it keeps talking to the network trying and failing to receive SMS. So you get no SMS and you soon (within hours) have a dead phone. I sent it in twice to Nokia (at my own expense) to get it fixed while it was under warranty but both times the problem re-appeared within days. Needless to say Nokia doesn't care - in fact their comment over the phone was that this device seems incompatible with my carrier! So much for US version. I wish someone had pointed all of this out when I bought the phone.
I try to stay on top of technology without sweating the details. I shop, I blog, and I keep up with my TLA's. (three letter acronyms)When this phone was released, I was understandably excited. I bought the display model from CompUSA before they got it out of the box for $699 in August of 2007. (it's an N95-1, the "real" original N95)Here's what I've figured out since then:1: You MUST have faith in Nokia and flash the firmware as it gets released (but not when it's still beta). Every time I do, I find new bells and whistles that I didn't have before.2: I have T-mobile service with the $4.99 t-zones plan which is supposed to include POP/IMAP/SMTP email capabilities. This works great... and so does the FULL http internet!! After much research, I've concluded that only Symbian phones are exempt from the proprietary blocking that WinMo, Mac, and Crackberry users are constrained to. That means you get the $40 internet capability for $35 less than the next guy. Multiply that by 12 and your phone is paid for. Do the math.3: No other Phone OS comes close to Symbian. It is, however, turning into more of a fanatical club lately, like the dorky Linux club and Apple marketing suckas club. Once you're in the club, you're a lifer. I would be in a bad place if I had to go back to the chalkboard and learn to run my life using a different platform, mostly because the competition simply cannot do what I have come to expect out of a phone.4: Components vs convergence. When you're "decorating" the living room, you shouldn't buy the $1200 home theater in a box. When your DVD laser gets dirty or wears out, you need to spend $1200 to replace the thing, and then you've got all these extra speakers, you know what I'm talking about. So why do I entrust my entire mobile device consortium to one device? Because all this stuff has to fit IN MY POCKET. I've never owned an MP3 player. I've never owned a point-and-shoot camera. I've never owned a Garmin GPS. And I rarely need to carry my laptop anywhere. It's all there, and if I had owned these devices, I could have easily sold them to pay the asking price at the time. There's no spare room in my pants for extra electronics if you know what i mean.5: You CAN make the GPS work faithfully. After much fussing, I found myself in the Chicago Nokia "outlet" store talking to a sales rep about the issue and learned that out of the box, the phone uses GSM data to triangulate the GPS position (in addition to, or rather, PRIOR TO, using the GPS antenna) which is why people are crying endlessly about it taking 5-15 minutes to find a signal. It's right there in the user interface, it's just a little tricky to find it. You have to turn off the GSM/GPRS data location awareness and it's good to go. Now I find GPS signal in 3-15 seconds every time.6: I carry mine with an 8GB Kingston microSDHC card inside and have never had any issues with data loss or recognition. I suspect the new 16GB will also be fine as it is the same class as the 8GB.7: I used a PC program called "Fixtunes" to lookup my music and assign metadata/album cover art on the fly, and my phone shows the album art while it is playing... a small but worthwhile chore for any music collection.8: Compatibiliy: For bluetooth, I have a Sony HWSBTA2W receiver for the home theater, a Scosche UBRH bluetooth receiver for my car, a Cirago BTA-6210 micro dongle for my laptop sync, and a Nokia 5310 for my Girlfriend. The only device that ever gives me a hard time is the girlfriend.
I was excited about the N95 at first, but within minutes of charging it and trying to get my sim cad in I was absolutely disappointed.  The battery cover is way flimsy...it broke almost immediately.  The software probably needs to be updated out of the box as it was slow and clunky.  Overall this phone had avery cheap flimsy feel.  I returned the defective one I received.  I believe that for $400 I shoud get a battery cover that does not break in 5 minutes.
My 2 cents:I'm not a phone junkie and have only owned about 15 phones ever, from the free cheapos offered by the network companies, to the $500+ "smart phones" of old, but this one takes the cake for audio quality coming from its speakers.The best part is the 3-D audio effect it can produce for your ringtones and music files - it is truly like a mini boombox that's situated just behind your ears. Many times I'm left to wonder where the sound is coming from, even when I'm holding the phone right in front of me.Put in an 8 gig micro SD card, slap on a good pair of cans, and you can throw away all your iPods and digital music players.I have since moved on to the Nokia N85 Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot - U.S. Version with Warranty (Copper), in which its OLED screen blows the N95's old TFT screen out of the water, as well as most other phones I'm sure.But audio-wise I think the N95 is better, and for a phone that's several years old, it can still hold its own on the other fronts as well - AWESOME photo quality and very decent video quality.Although it's fat almost like a soap bar (as opposed to a "candy bar" like other phones), I very much like how it feels in my hand - gives you a very secure feeling (I feel like I'm always about to drop my N85).The soft rubber of the back has a very nice feel as well (although prone to marks and scratches because of its rubbery material).The feel of the buttons is very firm, tactile, and responsive, but prone to wear like most phones.On the downside, the Real player sucks - you'll have to install a third party player to enjoy all your different video files.Overall, highly recommended.
It was necessary to update the OS when we got it, but that was not difficult.  Had it for over a year now, and it's very useful.  No touch-screen, but that's not a big deal.
I was very happy when I receive a mail of Amazon Costumer Vote, the possibility to change my old Motorola to this high end Smartphone, let's start:This phone comes with lots of extras that's make it special.First the Camera I am not a fan of cell phone cameras but believe me that really work like a normal digital camera, the lens are make by the same people that produce the sony's, and with 5 MegaPixel are not bad for a cell.Second is the GPS that like camera its works to!!! I install a Garmin mobile in it and BOOM! That become in a normal GPS with the possibility of put thousands of maps in it.Third the Wi-Fi connectivity its is fast and useful when you don't have a laptop very close.The dual network make it more  attractive to me and the miniSD memory even more.That's are the principles reasons I recommend the N95ThanksVerdict 4.5/5
I have been using N95 for the past 3 months. So far great experience, except very few flaws. I would give 4* rating.Lot of people explained the pros. I would like to point out few cons.You may feel little bulky initially, but the size is right for the holding and for the pocket. It will take few days to get used to it.Camera is excellent, but the picture clarity on low light is bad.T Mobile reception campared to my old samsung blast phone is lacking. You may have to wait few minutes to get connected after you come out from an elevator. Sometimes I have to soft reset to get signal. Little bit frustrating.If too many aplications are open you will feel the delay in opening applications.Speech synthezier (hold camera button) option is hopeless.My skyfire browser and amaze GPS software works charmingly.I have updated the firmware to latest one available. That was easy through nokia software provided.Overall great product. As always nokia keeps their standards!!
I have used it in Europe and in the United States, works like a charm. Wifi makes it possible to use VOIP and access the email on the go. Fast, upgradeable, nice collection of Symbian software out on the market, and the GPS navigation system is good. It has a 5 megapixel camera, which I do not really use (I am into real photography, lol), but I can say that it takes great pictures -for a cellphone, that is!.
I ordered this phone for the camera , it is unbelievable, but the phone does so much I could not go back to just a cell phone. I discovered the mobile web like google mobil, maps,calender and miniSphere. The phone is well built, shipping was very fast and it was on sale. I put an 8 GB micro SD card in and it works fine and I have plenty of storage. All in all it was one of the best purchases I have ever made
Great phone!!!!, great dealer!!!!, seriously!!!!!, responsible!!!!!, I'm pleased with my N95 and I don't ruled out make them a new order!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought this last Dec as a gift for my wife. She is not into high tech phones but when she saw my gift, she was so happy. The camera itself is fine, quality with the calls and even using the bluetooth. I have added an 8gb micro sd, im assuming it will not work but it did work. Now it becomes a Nokia N95 8GB.....
Hi,I got this phone around 2 weeks back.I must say this phone has an excellent call quality and amazing reception capabilities. The display is also excellent and the best part is you can download themes to make change the appearance of your display from several sites free from several free sites (e.g. mobile9)The software is also quite fast. you can use micro sd cards but be careful which one you choose. I had a 4 gb sdhc transcend and my phone just kept crashing. then i realized that the problem is with the micro sd card and not the phone so i bought a 2 and 4gb  micro sdhc sandisk card and everything works just great.You can download free applications from websites such as mosh free of cost or mobile9..check out ownskin where you can make your own themes in a flash..There are several applcations available free of cost just like the iphone without paying as much.Believe me you wont be disappointed..Go and buy it.. I have been using this for now 2 weeks and just been so pleased..Dont forget to update the software from nokias website..it greatly improves the phones performance and the entire experience.
i had this phone for 2months now.. and i love it.. i bought a 8gb micro sd card for it on [...] for only [...]... and it works perfectly... call quality is perfect... speakers are great... battery life is good, better than the nokia n95-1... the only problem is the signal.. sometimes im loosing signal... you can also buy extra battery on ebay for $[...]... i recommend this phone to everyone....
this is one of the best fon that i had, i love it, the camera is great and the video is amazing, so if you are looking for a phone this is the one for you.the price is great, in mi country (Nicaragua) the phone price is $700, in amazon i paid $330,amazing.
Itz really very nice phone this is the lightest phone I hv. It really work very goods.great value for this price.
This is really the best phone I have ever had. I made a swith from a blackberry curve, I have to say that this phone is awesome. I really don't have any complaints.
this phone is great.it comes in its original box with all the accessories,1 gig micro sd already in the phone and ready to be loaded with your favorite music.super small charger, very convenient for travel.headset that i havent tried because it has a 3.5mm headset jackso normal headphones are compatible.lets begin with the battery life.the battery on this thing is like the energizer bunny.no joke. i use my cell phone heavily. data intensive crap.i text all day from the time i wake up til i go to bed, instant message a lot, email, all the joys of todays technology.this phone keeps kicking. oh and the charge time is significantly shorter than my htc shadow.the camera is good, but the videos are fricken crystal clear.the audio is great. the secondary camera on the front of the phoneis the same camera that came standard on the 5300 music express.[which compared to most phone's camera was pretty impressive itself...]i haven't yet received the 8 gig microsdhc card yet so i cant comment on how it handles those but all the reviews i have read have said the phone handles them fine.for those of you who love hotmail and cant have a phone without ityou can download the windows live app and it puts your email inbox in the messaging center, which is great integration. yahoo mobiles doesnt do that.the ram on the phone could probably be better, but it doesnt slow it down.its a very powerful phone.this phone is 3g capable however i see no need to use it as gprs and edge come in really fast on this phone making web browsing a breeze.one of the high points is that it has a flashplayer in the web browser.videos on web pages load up pretty fast too reducing wait time and angry browsers.the phone is *slightly* bulky but it is very easy to handle.its surprisingly lightweight and natural to hold.unlike the nokia 5300 the sliders are on the sides of the screeninstead of spaced out on the back, its very sturdy and well built.the phone is very professional looking but it is loads of fun.also it comes with quickoffice which reads edits and created documents that are compatible with microsoft office, which is great for a college student or a business person.this phone has proven to be a very solid investment.
This phone has so many features other phones don't. The camera is 5mp but i feel like my N72 used to have a better camera and it was 2.something. Other than that its very loud, has a navigation sys,and has a unique style.Would def recommend to someone who likes phones with diff features.
well for a cell phone its a nice catch, but sony sould review his product in order to compete with pocket pc, like htc, i know that his market is mostly for the young people, but it would be a nice improve to their products. the cell phone its complete it has nothing to envy to other cell in the same range.
Great phone, sound is great and easy to use.  The only thing that is missing on this phone is the CAMERA, would have been a perfect phone with the camera, otherwise very happy.
I bought two mobile phones, one does not work the mouse, the other goes off when you try to call. Not recommended.
I recieved this BB8800 last week. Believe me, it looks like used phone. It looks as if somebody used it for a month and put it back in the box. Was disappointed. It was shipped from adorama and i returned it in a week. I would not buy it from adorama again.
Best Amazon purchase so far.  Appreciate seller advertising the cell-service so I could purchase the one for Sprint.  Love it!!!
got the phone with broken system can not even be turned on but nice refund sevice
It is impossible for me to review and rate this item as I have not received it as yet.  I have been buying from Amazon since 2004 and am truly disappointed with this.  I really need the phone and it is proving quite inconvenient waiting for so long to receive it. It is one month now and I really need it. Getting the money back is not the issue right now, I need the phone.
maybe this is not the best looking phone but it last forever. I have mine for over 2 years, and it survived so many drops on the concrete-no problems at all.Battery last for days, I usually charge this Nokia once a week. I don't use internet though, just phone calls, some messaging, occasionally camera.Speakerphone is loud with good quality, and camera just average.One of the best options (I know several phones don't have)-I turn off my phone for the night, but alarm still wakes me up, and Nokia asks for snooze or for switching to phone on mode. Awesome-it saves battery and no text or phone calls can wake me up).I recently upgraded my phone to LG CF360 (2 days of battery life, phone must be on all the time for alarm), buy after a couple of days I came back to old Nokia 6085.
We have had this phone for about 6 months and it is great.  Never let us down.  All the features seem to be placed in places where they make sense.  The other net10 phone we had was stupidly set up, but this one is set up well.I would recommend this phone to anyone getting a new prepaid phone, mostly because it is so much easier to use than the cheapest ones they offer at places like wal-mart.
i love this little phone.. i actually got it under a regular cell phone plan back in 2006, battery life is excellent, it comes with some pretty ringtones, like the crickets chirping.. i switched plans over from cingular to verizon so i couldnt use it anymore, but it's my favorite of all cell phones AND it's absolutely gorgeous!! buttons work nicely, it's very glossy with a steel grey color.. silver rim with a nifty design then another silver rim around the outer screen.. gets good signal too, hell i might buy this one just to have a bill free worry free cell phone..
Battery has to be recharged every day even if not in use & the sound quality is not good,if i had to describe this phone in one word it be lemon~
Not only was the reception not good but the battery didn't last very long,me & my dad had one & we had to charge the battery everyday within 24 hours even if we didnt't use the phone.worst phone i ever had,so buyer beware!
I owned this phone for 2 years before finally upgrading. It is the most basic phone I have ever run across. 2 years ago I got it in a pinch because I was so ready to dump AT&T; that I grabbed the cheapest phone i could find. I never dreamed I would keep it for 2 years. I guess the main reason I did hold onto it was because I really never had any real issues with it. True, it won't show the time and your remaining minutes on the screen at the same time (one or the other) and the alarm feature stunk (1 of every 2 times I set the alarm it went off at some randomn time waking me up at 2:12 in the morning... don't count on the alarm, it surely doesn't work very well. And all this time I thought it was maybe a malfunction of my phone, but it sounds like other people had the same trouble). Otherwise it's pretty decent. The sound quality is good, the reception is spot on- even 2 floors underground in a parking gararge. It's cheap, and with 300 minutes, it's actually free. So you can't go wrong, IF, you don't want much out of a phone.
The 1600 is Nokia's entry level phone with few frills over its ancestors.  It's the same screen size, menu structure, and candy bar factor that made them famous, though they obviously have other, fancier phones now.  Quality, signal and battery has been good.  The older set often complains about the small screen and buttons.  The alternative is far more complicated user interfaces and more, smaller keys or touchscreen.  There really isn't a phone made for old folks.  Sorry.Now, NET10.  Some people love them.  I did too.  They're great if you never have to deal with them.  Best analogy I have is a slumlord.  You pay your rent on time and they leave you alone.  But if you need something from them, forget it.  First thing I tried to do was port my old T-Mobile number.  That got wedged up.  I was never able to get a handset to work with the phone.  I asked them, via the customer service Web form, if this phone used standard 2.5mm headsets or if I needed the Nokia one -- I tried three off-brand ones and none worked.  The cut and paste reply had absolutely nothing to do with the question.  So I thought I'd buy another identical phone and try it.  The form on the website to move service from one NET10 phone to another gave an error that did not apply, saying that I entered the phone number wrong.  Not only was the phone number correct, but you don't enter it at all -- it has it in the system and it merely shows it to you.  Trying to add it as a new phone with a new number, it assigned the same number as the other phone, making both the new and old phone inoperable.  Automated diagnostic stuff on the website couldn't fix it.  Their overseas operators only have a few scripts and none apply.  I've worked customer service for a cell company before and it's not pleasant.  I know the turn over rate is high and you usually never get to see the phones you're supposed to be supporting.  But my employer at least allowed me to engage in dialogue with the people I talked to, even though I had to read a lot of required script.  These guys only get script.  Clearly they were told that if they improvised anything, they'd be fired or punished.  So they have humans they're using as robots.  I have a profound distaste for NET10 for that alone.  That's just uncool.Customer service and the website runs you in circles.  NET10's idea of automating common customer service requests via forms on a website to save costs is a brilliant one.  Someone should actually implement the idea.  NET10 sure didn't manage to.I've spent four days and countless hours trying to get NET10 to perform one of the most commonly required services -- transfer service from one phone to another -- and have failed miserably.
It works well for the price. Consider it for just basic phone use. Forget about customer service. It stinks!. However, calls and gets calls for a modest price. That is it.
I've had this aloha phone from virgin mobile for about one year now.  I was sick and tired of being ripped off by companies and their ridiculous contracts.  First you are quoted one price and as the months go by, your bill keeps getting higher.  My  sister told me about virgin mobile. Can you believe this phone only cost me $10.00 ( mind you, even 30 minutes were included). First when you get the package, you, yourself can activate the phone on your computer at home. You choose your plan and you are set.  True, the activation process takes about an hour if your not familiar with the process. If you need help, virgin mobile customer services reps can be reached. I find that it takes about 5 minutes to get one on the phone but they are very helpful and will walk you through the process. This simple phone is not extravagant, not beautiful, just  simple looking.  But I will tell you that I've never had a dropped call. I hear my caller, loud and clear and have no problems with a poor  connection. I also use the text and data pack.  I can go on the web and read my e-mail, check the weather, surf the web, etc. It doesn't have a camera and the screen is small and not big like other cell phones.  But it is a basic phone, and the thought of purchasing a $100-250.00 cell phone is hard to bear when I'd rather spend that money on food for my family. This little baby has been good to me.  When I'm low in minutes, I've set it up directly to my bank account and can have minutes on it within 1 minute.  If you are sick and tired of being sold into getting the best, most expensive cell phone, I can assure you that you will save money.  I pay about $70 for 600 anytime minutes and unlimited night/weekend minutes, 1000 text messages and 20mb of unlimited virgin internet access. (I'm still learning about MB). The best thing is that if I'm strapped for money, I can change my plan and buy less minutes.  As opposed to a company with a contract who will be more than happy to turn off my service and then charge me a reconnection fee.  Yeah, its simple but there is a certain beauty to simplicity :)
This is an awesome phone...., it obviously looks amazing and the flip is pretty sweet.  As for the internals of the phone, very simple and typical mobile phone. I would not recommend this phone if you are going to use the Internet or like putting mp3 ringtones for select contacts. How to get files on this phone is impossible, 5mb of memory roughly and without a warranty on the phone you won't be able to update software on it.  Few lame games and funky tunes they call ringtones with your basic phone tools are installed. (calc, alarm, calander,note)...the soft keys (upper most buttons inside phone) are customizable). Left hard keys with phone closed *volume* bottom left hard key is camera...which is ok, nothing amazing( still nice to have) and right hard key is *voice dialing* once setup.. Best software feature I think is the outside analog clock...other than that it's your average phone just revamped for eye candy.(I have tried bluetoothing/motorola tool software to put my own mp3 ringtone and nothing works) if you know how. Let me know. [...]
The price listed for this phone is $234.00  Is this a joke? The same phone goes for about $80 brand new and unlocked here at Amazon
First, this is not a Chinese version as P.Suranyi stated in his review. The only difference is it has europian style power adapter. They solved this problem by adding USA/Europe/China adapter in a package. So there is no different between U.S. and Chinese version. Second, I was affreid to buy a phone and found out that it has Chinese fonts only. As soon I turned it on everything was on English. I ordered this phone for my brother who lives in Russia. He is so happy to have this phone.  Great phone for great price.
I am totally disappointed.  I have a feeling if I had bought this phone in the store I wouldn't have the problems I'm having.  However, I ordered it directly from Amazon because I needed an unlocked phone and they are a lot easier to find online.  The phone arrived with what I thought was a weak battery.  The phone charges super fast and then half way through the day it dies.  So I purchased a new battery only to find that the same thing is happening.  So, I'm guessing the phone just sucks all the energy out of any battery that is used.  I really would love to return the phone but I purchased the unlocked phone while I was in the states because I live in the Caribbean and needed a new phone that will take any sim card.  And you can get better quality and less expensive phones in the states.  Needless to say I won't be buying online again.  I also thought that because I was purchasing directly from Amazon that I would not get a bunck product....WRONG.  I really do like the phone, the looks etc...but due to the battery issue and other little querks I feel like I got dupped.
This phone is a great phone. Great memory, Great storage space, it is great for its price and its about $200 EURO over here!! There also a chip to go with it that increases its storage space which is already amazingly big for its size without the chip. This phone is a must have. The only Neg I have about it is the paint on the Top fades away very quickly giving it an older look after only a few months. But if your not too picky about the looks, it a great phone.
Phone arrived promptly and worked fine initially, so my first diappointment was only that what looks so nice and glossy in the product photos turns out to be cheap plastic, put together in a crude way--the phone creaked in normal operation. There is a metal version of this phone that is nice, but this is NOT it . . . only looks like it in the photos. I would have been somewhat disappointed but not angry had the the phone worked for more than two months. Never dropped it, but it started going haywire and then died entirely. Whole purchase price wasted. Double thumbs down from me.
Received the phone in good condition used it to make a couple calls and suddenly the display went blank.I thought buying from amazon direct i would have gotten a quality product I'm very disappointed.
I've owned this phone for over two years. I'm finally upgrading to a Windows Smart Phone (HTC Touch Pro 2) but have felt some sadness moving away from this beautiful and functional phone and decided to write a review about how much I've liked the phone.First, this is a slick, high quality phone both aesthetically and in build quality. Everything just feels solid and well made, including the responsive touch pad which makes texting as easy as possible considering it doesn't come with a QWERTY pad. The hing is one of the best I've seen on a flip phone, and even after two years of constant use it is still solid and not wobbly at all.The LCD screen is very nice, even by today's (end of 2009) standards. It's crystal clear, and make texting, operating the phone, playing games, etc., fun and not eye straining at all. The front screen, while lower resolution, is useful for taking self portraits (in camera mode when the phone is shut, it displays what the 2.0 mega pixel camera is pointed at!) and displaying your own custom images.The phone has a built in mp3 player (compatible with mp3s and WMA files) that is better than average for a phone based player. The phone can also play music over the phone's speaker, which sounds surprisingly good!The touch screen buttons on the front of the phone are well placed and easy to use for changing tacks or pausing.Voice commands works fairly well, but certainly not perfectly. I find it recognizes what I'm saying about 75% of the time.Phone call clarity is the best of any phone I've ever used, and better than friend's phones I've tried that are new.A few complaints:1) To use the phone as an mp3 player requires a mini-usb to 3.5mm adapter.2) The phone occasionally freezes up and needs to be reset by removing the battery.3) web browsing is pretty poor on this phone, but I never used that functionality much so it didn't bother me.4) The Micro SD only supports up to a 2GB card. It will NOT support SDHC cards!Overall I've LOVED this phone and it's held up remarkably well over the last 2+ years. This is a high quality piece of hardware that's stood the test of time.4.5/5 Stars. A real gem.
I have had this phone for 4 years now, and have had no technical difficulties of any kind. The only reason why I am getting a new phone is because after 4 years the plastic on the front cracked and is chipping.Over all this is a great phone, I've dropped it and its been fine. I do recommend it.
I have been true to Nokias ever since I started using mobiles and every time I get a new one I am pleasantly surprised. 5310 is no exception to this rule.5310 offers everything I expect from a Nokia - sleek design (slim and fairly light), nice colours (nothing too flashy), sturdy materials and easy to operate software.The screen is just the right size to use the internet and the connection is just OK to suit my needs that is checking information such as weather, movies, rates of exchange etc. I wouldn't recommend it, however, for reading long newspaper articles, however, the letters are a little to small.The musical part is well done (the mobile even comes with a pair of small loudspeakers which is a very nice idea in theory but nothing very practical in everyday use) and I can't help but appreciate the handy controls on the outside. This Nokia basically made my ipod a fashion accessory - why carry a mobile and an ipod if mobile offers most of ipod's functions?There is also a camera - good enough to take pictures which will show on the screen to let you know who is calling and snapshots but their quality is only a little above acceptable so don't throw away your camera before you check it out thoroughly - and a radio, a nice addition (headphones, naturally included) although you should be prepared to recharge the battery quite often if you're addicted to listening all the time.In short - if you're shopping for small, sleek, light mobile phone with all the basic functions plus some added musical ones, this is your perfect choice. It's hard to get anything better for the money.
pretty good phone, works well for listening to music.the speakers on the phone are impressively loud.I've had the Nokia n81 8gb for a year now, and the phone's performance isn't so great anymore, if i want to open applications(camera, games, picture gallery,...) i have to wait several seconds before the app opens.
It is a slider phone, instead of a flip, so I can have it open on my car's dash and it's slim to fit in any pocket. The buttons are small, but we are all used to that by now. Sure it also has the obligatory camera and video, but it is 2.0 mega-pixels which is better than most. It provides support for "PictBridge technology" so you can print your photos without the need of a PC, but again, 2.0 mega-pixels is good for the internet, built not great for printing out.It is a Walkman that shuffles the songs with just a shake of your wrist. With the "TrackID" service, you just identify any song that you can hear by just recording a bit of the song (using the microphone, like at `Starbucks'). This features costs $3.99/month!!! Later, you can send the file for recognition. It gives you the name, artist and album right to your phone. That's cool.You have FM radio access and a slot for extra memory for songs, pics, video, etc. The ear buds are actually good quality and are attached along with a microphone (for hands free or finding that bit of song). It has all your high-speed mobile internet access, web browser, email, messaging, Java support needs and plenty of the basic games and is "Bluetooth" compatible. You need to buy UNLIMITED DATA USAGE from your server which can be about $20-$40/month!If you like listening to music while working out, the integrated motion sensor counts your steps, your calories and monitors your running speed, distance and time. Your workout results are stored in your phone so you can monitor your progress. This is free, thankfully.There is even a calendar, place for notes, an alarm, a calculator, stopwatch and timer! There are plenty of good free ring tones and more you can buy on-line. There's more you can BUY!But what I like best is this phone has one of the cleanest, clearest and brightest (adjustable for night) screens available. Great phone, but the extras will cost you!
I got this in pink and mainly got it because it was cute. Big mistake.  The numbers crack within the first month.  The music button is sensitive and gets quite annoying when in your pocket it goes off.  I've had it for a year now (which is the only upside that it lasted that long) and it does occasionally freeze, drop phone calls, and i can now barely hear what the other person is saying with the volume all the way up. Its also not very durable.  If you get this phone get a warrenty.
I've had this phone for two years now!  It has been a pretty solid device.  Call quality is very decent and I can count on one hand the amount of times I've experienced a dropped call.  I love the fact that I can be logged into AIM and Yahoo IM at the same time all while receiving SMS and email from yahoo, gmail, and hotmail.  The inbox is great and I love how they put it all in one place.  The music player is fine and it plays MP3's, WMA's and AAC files.  It doesn't have a standard 3.5mm earphone jack.  It has an adapter so that you can plug in your earphones.  The SD Card slot is conveniently located so I can swap out in a pinch. (None of that battery cover opening crap)  Unfortunately, this thing eats the battery like a kid eats candy.  You'll have to charge it every day.  The phone is also a bit big so it won't fit in your pocket very well.  But it's solid though.  I've dropped it a few times and it's taken some hard spills.  The slider still works great.  The phone is very durable.  The screen looks very good and can be very bright if you want it to be.  Texting is nice, but now I've had a problem with it missing some of my keypresses lately.  It wasn't like this initially and it doesn't happen unless I am texting fast.  I'm guessing it's because my phone is a bit old now.  This problem started a few months ago.  The internet is pretty quick on it and I've hardly ever been without 3G reception.  Youtube videos load really quick.  All in all, this has been a great phone that has served me well.  If you are looking for something cheap, reliable, and full of features, I can't suggest a better phone.I'll be honest, I really want a new phone now.  I was thinking about getting an iPhone but I am leary of the call quality issues in comparison.  So I'll stick with this for now until iPhone comes out for Verizon.  :)
I have used HELIO OCEAN and HELIO's SERVICE PLAN for over 2 years.Immediately Dropped Calls went away! Ieven had signal when now one had signal in the remote mountains of Monatana! Thought the phone itself is abit on the bulky side, it is a durable good phone and I have had nothing but good things to say about it.
The best 3g phone I've owned uses both sprint and verizon networks so you get the largest coverage area. You never get dropped calls. The slide out qwerty keyboard is a great feature to make your texting and browsing experience a joy.
MORE THAN JUST THE CAMERAYES, THE CAMERA: Enough has been said of the camera. It's all true. I can take a photo in pitch blackness. The infrared will shoot across a room to auto-focus & the bright Xenon will illuminate the room to take excellent, quality photos in complete darkness. This is no exaggeration. It has replaced my actual camera so I can carry less. I record all of my YouTube vids with the phone, too.It's not just the flash. It's not just the 5 megapixels. It's not just the lens cover. It's a lens that can handle the megapixels and an autofocus that makes it worth while. Most of us aren't trying to take poster-sized photos. For best results, I reduce the initial size of the photo (to 5x7 or so) so it doesn't have to be edited down.OTHER COOL FEATURES:TV-OUT function that comes w/wiring. Plug the N82 into a tv and see the webrowser, photos, movies, MSWord docs, Excel docs, PowerPoint, PDF files, etc. Record video and see it on the screen simultaneously.(If you purchase a collapsible bluetooth keyboard and mouse, you'll have a 'laptop' that is more portable and has a larger screen than a Mac Air, fits in a jacket pocket and uses any modern tv's screen.)MEMORY: Comes with 2gb memory card. I added an 8gm sdhc Ultra to mine. It's fast, no delay. It can take 16gb card. 128mb RAM. Never get 'memory full' warnings. Dual ARM 11 332 MHz processor w/ 3D graphics hardware acceleratorGPS (comes w/ Nokia maps as well, but download Google Maps for free. It's better). At cost, you can add voice-guided directions as well.DOCUMENTS: You can view MSWord docs, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF. With an upgrade, you can even edit them.ZIP: Creates, opens, downloads and sends ZIP foldersWiFi that is very easy to configure. UPnP to wirelessly connect with other wireless electronicsVIDEO CALLING: This feature doesn't work in The States, but it allows you to take self photos/videos and see yourself as you shoot. In a few years when video calling reaches us, your N82 will be ready....Bluetooth, Podcasting, FM radio, currency/measurement converter, world clock, photo editor, video editor, NGage gamesThis is not a slider or a flip. It's a solid piece and that means it's very sturdy. Sliders come with flex cables that are subject to damage. Just Google "flex cable" and add any slider phone.N85 & N86: These newer models are sliders which look cheap. One of them has an 8mp camera, but no Xenon flash to accompany it.OTHER OPTIONS - WINDOWS MOBILE OR APPLE OR PALM: No other operating system offers as many downloadable apps as the Symbian systems. This means you can download Symella and download music, video and files to your phone like LIMEWIRE. You can download Handwave and direct your phone w/o even touching it. You can download Nokmote, Rockandscroll or Rotateme and direct the N82 by motion. There are countless more free apps available. It's just more expandable than any other operating system.Touch screens are gimmicks. They require a greater range of motion, usually two hands and make your screen dirty. A cursor only requires I move my thumb a few millimeters whilst iPhoners are using two hands and strokes. Cute, but not practical.CONSSMALL KEYS: The keyboard is the size of my thumb. Although the keyes are are spaced, Braille-touch is still near impossible because even my pinkie finger can touch two keys at once. Ridiculous!NO QWERTY: The T9 is both predictive *and* teachable. After a short while, you'll teach it most of the odd words you're going to use. I can key in my name by touching the same amount of keys as I would on a QWERTY, but w/o the range of motion and the bulk of a QWERTY.SPEAKERS: Considering this unit has two speakers and is an upgrade from the N80, the sounds isn't quite as clear, good or powerful as that of an N80. There is an equalizer, boost & surround feature, none of which improve the sound. The sound is good, but not what it should be and is an obvious step down from the N80. That 'said,' the N82 offers a 3.5mm jack. The headset sound is stellar.3G: The N82 doesn't come w/ US 3G frequency, unfortunately.CONFIGURATION: If this is your first smart phone, you should know that, because it's not released under the umbrella of a carrier, it will take a lot of configuration. You won't be able to just pick it up and do all of the things I've listed here w/o downloads, upgrades, input. These are not simply calling phones. They aren't for teens who just want games and music. Know this.SMALL SCREEN: The screen isn't as small as you may think. It's bigger than most and as large as some PDAsLOOKS: This stealth phone definitely flies under the radar. No bling. No wow factor. I like to think of it as a high end, understated Benz whilst the iPhone is a mass-marketed, gold-laden, flashy Cadillac. Of course, the iPhones aren't even remotely in this phone's league. The upcoming N97 from Nokia has more features, but it is larger, is a 'slider,' uses a touch screen and doesn't have a Xenon flash. Oh, and it's $300-400 more expensive.CARRIERIf you pair the N82 w/ T-Mobile in The States, you can enjoy unlimited web usage and downloading. If you go w/ AT&T;, you'll pay as you go. Although AT&T; offers 3G in The States, the N82 doesn't carry US 3G frequency so save money and spend all the time on the web w/ T-Mobile.If you opt for PDA like a Blackberry with any carrier, you will have to pay an additional $25/mo to be able to access the Internet. Nokia's smartphones are more expensive to purchase because they don't come with service in The States, but they are cheaper to operate because they can be configured to us the Net w/o hefty, monthly PDA fees.This phone runs circles around almost anything you'll come in contact with. The best part (to me) is that it's feature-packed but stealth, tasteful, compact, sturdy and doesn't shout "trend follower".
Very good all round phone with impressive camera as I expected which is the strongest feature of this model, in my opinion, because of the xenon flash. Wifi is really easy to activate and video quality is really good with mp4 or 3gp capabilities. the 3.5mm headset jack is relly convenient for listening to better music quality using top of the line headphones. GPS is useful also although I havent fully relied on in since I have a GPS navi in my car. Keypad buttons are tiny but at least tactile...i find myself using my fingernails when typing or dialing. Another thing i liked was the independent ports for the headphone, power, and usb. Some cel phones use the same port for each of those and allows the user to just do one thing at a time whereas the N82 lets you talk on the headset, charge your phone, and access or transfer files in the computer all at the same time. Screen is rather small in today's standard especially since videos and internet are utilized. But then again its a candybar style so screen size is limited. All in all I still give it 5 stars and im more than satisfied with my choice of purchase and Amazon has been nothing but great with this transaction. Fast shipping, friendly, great price and very accomodating.
great phone, nice cam, 2gb included, tv output, many functions, many software, many gamesthe cam is kinda slow but takes amazing pics, videos are great also3d games are great, this cell has an 3d chip, even quake has opengl acceleration, but there are few games that use thisthe bad, is slow on many thing, menus, contacts, etc, even with 128 mb of ram that sucks, now if you update it maybe that is fixed, i havent update it yet
This phone is all I wanted.Very easy to navigate. I am big Nokia fan, so moving from my old one into this Nokia was pretty much painless. I wanted it primary for making calls, sending multimedia messages, taking photos and the Wifi.Takes great pictures, that can be edited right in the camera. Pictures are easily attached to your text messages, the phone will automaticaly resize it for you.
I went from an N95 to this phone and I am not disappointed. From the great camera to the available applications, it works very well. Battery life is excellent and I have dropped it a couple times on hard surface with little obvious scratches. Signal quality is great anywhere you find yourself. The only thing I don't like as much is the predictive text feature. T9 is better and easy to use.
Pros: xenon camera flash, 5mp camera, excellent receptionCons: Key layout and size pretty much makes the phone a pain to use, no US 3G bands, small screenOverall, this is a good phone, if you have small fingers. The size of the keys and the layout make the phone a complete pain to use. Other than that, its a decent phone.
I do not want to write about my N82. As you can read from others, it is a great phone, maybe the best on the market. However, how is the customer service?First, I am very pleased with the service hotline. Within seconds I had someone to talk to. But how fast are they if there is something wrong with your N82??I had several pixel errors on my display. I send my cell phone to a Nokia Customer Service Point. Before sending you have to fill out an online form and send this piece of paper with your cell phone. Once shipped they repaired it and shipped it back on the second day after receiving - UPS NEXT DAY AIR! I do not know how expensive this is, but it is fast and I had my phone back - 3 days after they received it.One last comment: The VOIP client is not working very well. If you need to know more, leave a comment. This is the reason why I only rate this phone with 4 stars, because I use the VOIP client daily.
I bought the n82 a month ago. It's a good device,+ Excellent screen resolution+ Excellent Camera 5mp w/xenon Flash!!!+ GPS, Wifi, bluetooth+ It's nice to play games or view videos on TV using the A/V cable :)- Battery life :(- 3G is useless on USA or Dominican Republic [Where I live]
Greetings, Thanks for its sale the article I arrive in perfect state responsible company, I am going to make next purchases with I widely recommend it to you in the community of amazon
I was attracted by its wonderful function/camera and had read lots of articles with good comments about this cell phone. After my loved Siemens SXG75 got stolen at a gym last month, I ordered this one as a replacement. While the phone was on the way, I visited a retail store and took a close look of the N82. And I found that the too small key pad is difficult to press by my already thin fingers. I asked the store clerk how to dial numbers on this phone. He said that people usually have to press the keypal by nails!! It is a sufficient reason to cancel the purchase. Therefore, I finally returned the parcel for a refund.
I loved the V3i so naturally I wanted to upgrade to the V9 for the sleek design.  Though stated by the seller as unlocked/international version it came as a branded AT&T; phone with proprietary buttons and AT&T; software/splash screen.  It still works with T-Mobile.  It was also REFURBISHED as I found out when I opened the package, the phone did not align properly without correction and was a bit loose in the hingers,  there were also well over 100 numbers stored to the phone memory that was not deleted before it was sent to me.  I chose to keep it anyway because my older phone was broke and I really needed another phone.  Overall a good phone but not really worth the price for a branded refurb.
I experienced the same problems mentioned above.Cover is extremely delicate and will crack with surprising ease. Surprising = one day you take it out of your purse and it's cracked?!Keypad malfunctioning. One day, it just stops working. I replaced the phone due to this problem very early into my purchase. Today, same thing happened, but it happened 2 months after my 1-year warranty expired.Skip this one or buy a 3-year warranty.
I really liked this phone when I first got it, but I find it is too delicate. The first time I dropped the phone, the cover cracked. The phone still worked without any trouble so I was happy with it. After a few months, the keypad stopped working. I had to send the phone to Motorola for repair, which took a while. The phone was working when I received it, but a few weeks later I had the same problem. This time I was told the phone had water damage. They explained that just by using the phone out in the rain or while exercising and sweating, the moisture could get inside the phone and turn the white sticker under the back cover red. Since this is all they look at for water damage, they are not repairing the phone again. If someone is going to buy this phone, I recommend getting full coverage that would include accidents and water damage.
Absolutely WONDERFUL product! Fast shipping! Brand new phone with instruction book. Amazing quality...bought it as a replacement for the $500 Motorola V9 "lemon" I bought from AT&T; a year and a half ago. I love this phone and am VERY happy with the seller who offered this great product at such a reasonable price. Thank you so much!
It worked great when I got it, but then it started freezing and had to be reset all the time. Every time my mom called and left a voicemail my phone turned off. Then it got to the point where it stopped charging. I'd have it hooked up to a charger for 10 hours and it'd turn off within an hour of being charged because the battery was dead. Every Samsung phone I've ever purchased has died on me
I've gone through two phones in a year. With the first phone i had when you made a call the only way you could here the other person you were talking to was on speakerphone. That makes it a little hard when you are in a pulblic place. I sent my phone out for replacement and received a new one.My second phone lasted 8 months, one night i turned it off and the next morning it would not turn back on. Sony makes some great products and i prefer Sony with my electronics, but after three differnt phones I'm staying away.
I had two of them. The reception was good. Probably the best among all brands. The keys were small but still adequate. With add-on memory card, my wife could take as many pictures as she liked. Everything seemed good until one year later they all broke one after the other for no reason. The manufacture warranty expired after one year. Somehow I managed to have the first one fixed but not the second one since the warranty expired anyway. The sells representatives told me that the price to get it fixed was worth almost 1/2 of the original price, so I forewent the option. The thing both of my two cell phones broke one after the other right after the warranty expired is just too much coincidence. My wife's and mine usage of the phones cannot be simpler enough. Even after Sony received the phones, they cannot find any exterior or moisture damage. If they cannot last long enough, how good are they anyway? Don't get me wrong. My wife is still using the fixed phone for three years now. So, the problem right after the expiration of the warranty is a mystery to us.
I have the red phone, but I LOVE my phone! I was just looking for something to listen to music, because I don't want an ipod. The only con I would have to say about this phone is the keys. For someone who texts alot, this is not the phone for you. I don't hardly ever text, so it's awesome!
This is the worst phone I have ever had. If you care for just the beauty of a gadget and not for your money, your call. Otherwise, forget about it. I could have given it a zero rating if I could.
First I'll mention the pluses with this phone. First its very cheap. It has a very strong body, stronger than even my Nokia. The vibrator on it is also fairly strong (most phones have a weak vibrator that I rarely feel).Now for the bad stuff . . .1) It has port covers that look very fragile (for battery, etc). None have broken after 2 months use, but I've been very careful.2) The battery drains *very* fast when you have low or no signal. For example, despite not using the phone, spending 8 hours at work in a no-signal basement literally drains 50% of the battery. The phone feels very warm to the touch whenever in low/no signal areas. A fully charged battery will die in under 24 hours if your phone is in a no-signal area (ie go camping, spend time in subway, basement, etc.) I keep my phone off 50% of the time for fear I'll be stuck with a dead battery (happens all the time with this phone). I have to charge this phone almost daily, where on my 4 year old cheap motorola phone I haven't once replaced the battery, and it still holds a weeks worth of charge!3) The 'airplane mode' is very useful. I use it to turn off my phone to prevent the battery from dieing in low/no signal areas.4) The top LCD that displays time is horrible. I can't see it outside even on a cloudy day, and it doesn't update the time unless your phone has a signal. It also displays the last time you checked it for about 1 second before displaying the current time (requires a button push).5) The GUI is absolutely horrible. It takes 3x more button clicks to get anything done compared to all my other cheap phones I've owned. No customizable hotkeys.5) My four year old ultra cheap Motorola cell phone can run Java 10x faster. The Flare takes minutes to load up a simple Opera browser.6) You have to read the same message twice for it to stop telling you that you have new messages.7) Internet sucks on it. Virgin had me go through this 3 phone call multiple day process trying to get it to work, and finally they said 'its a known problem and engineers are working on it, call back in 72 hours'. Well, I've called them once every 4 days for an entire month, and they kept saying the same thing. Two months have passed, still no internet. On very rare occasions, say 5% of the time I try, I can get a connection. But its *very* slow. Way slower than on my 4 year old cheap motorola phone.8) No SIM card. Doesn't work with any phone backup software I've tried.Garbage. I'm buying a new phone.
This is one of the best virgin mobile phone I have ever bought!I just bought it because I needed a new one.When looked at the picture it looked OK.I didn't think it would be over the top great.I opened the package it looked shiny and nice.It is loaded with cool stuff and graphics.I had this phone for since septemberor october of 2008.I reccomend this phone to all ages.I was very satisfied with this product.
For the price, this is a very good phone! I have the Black Flare but just got the silver limited edition one and it's really nice!  The phone is very sleek and it looks really nice.  I have read about numerous problems people were having with the internet- I actually prefer using this phone for the internet because of the high quality graphics. It's nice and loud and what's really nice is there is an outside light that blinks red when you have a new message or call.  It's small so it fits in any pocket really nice and it's lightweight.  The only downfall is I wish it had a camera but I paid $19.99 for the phone and you can't go wrong with that price.Highly recommend 5/5
I just purchased the phone.Did NOT want to .  Using it under 2 years my other Virgin Mobile phone just quit on mePhone is cheap, light weight plasticTO ME A REALLY LARGE PLUG IN CHARGER  It gets really warm & SO CAN THE PHONE while charging.  I think that is a safety issue  You ARE FORCED to move a piece of the plastic in order to input the charger to the phone  WHOEVER THOUGHT THIS STUPID IDEA UP instead of just having an open spot to connect the charger  SOMETHING MORE TO BREAK & MORE UNNECESSARY WORK TO DOComes with only FEW terrible ring tones & wall papers  You have to go to Virgin to hopefully find ones of interest to youGraphics on it are goodNot enough games, other decent extrasYou are supposed to get WEB access on it.  THE INSTRUCTION BOOK GIVES NO INFORMATION ON THISVirgin has no posted info or prices for this use.
I thought Virgin Mobile would be great. I was wrong. It took forever on the phone to setup with customer service. They have this minute pack drama you have to add every month and convert. The phone charger runs hot even though the phone is nice, so don't keep the charger plugged in. When you cancel you need a pin. That is my fault, at least they texted it to me. Avoid Virgin Mobile if you don't want a high maintenance pre paid cellphone plan.
This phone is an amazing piece of electronics and would get a five-star rating if it didn't have a few quirks.Pros*can support additional memory up to (and maybe beyond) a 16GB micro sd card*with additional memory, this can make a great substitute for an mp3 player*takes ok pictures for a cell phone*can listen to music without headphones*takes a standard mini headphone jack so you can use your regular noise-canceling headphones*quad-band so it can be used literally anywhere in the world just by inserting a local SIM card*good battery life*excellent sound clarity, even on speaker phoneCons (the first two are the biggest in my opinion)*makes a slight chirping noise when the 'buttons' are pressed*hard to get rid of the notification 'ding' after every call or text*lack of a cover makes it easy to butt-dial if you forget to flip the switch to turn off the keys*accessories are hard to find (custom cases, etc)*not 3G capable (not an issue for me but might be for you)*can be slow to load playlists if you have a lot of music on the phone
This cell phone looks great. The display is very bright and colorful. The 2Gb of memory is good enough if you enjoy music and the 2mega pixel camera  is ok. I would give 5 stars to this phone if wasn't because of one major problem: It's incredible slow. It takes so much time to execute many single tasks like searching your phone list for example. Even navigate the menu can be painful cause sometimes it takes a while to change from one option to another (I usually click lots of time and it suddenly goes beyond the point I wanted.) Seriously, if you don't have patience don't buy this phone. I have, many times, wanted to just throw this phone at the wall. Anyway, like I said, if you don't mind, it's a good phone.
Pros:- Excellent build quality, much better than Nokia's and Sony Ericsson's plastic toys.- Really good voice transmission, I'm able to talk in noisy environments, and the phone filters the interference.- Excellent MP3 quality, much better than previosuly used Nokia 5310 and Sony Ericsson W890.- Standard slots and connections: MicroSD card, micro USB connection, 3.5 headphone jack.Cons:- The menus are not great when comparing to both Nokia and SE. They're not as intuitive as the others. However, they're not slow, and I've not run into any bug yet.- The camera is mediocre, but this isn't a cameraphone. If you need that, you should buy a Moto ZN5.Overall, I think it's a great purchase for someone who looks for a phone with a great call quality and an excellent music player.
Revised review: Chose this phone because it was Consumer Reports' top pick for T-Mobile and it supposedly worked overseas; in addition, it has a wide range of features and looks great.  Unfortunately, this phone is excellent in the short-term and rubbish for the long-haul, so I am amending my review.  It stopped ringing after 8 months and it is perplexing as it makes other sound effects to notify you of voicemail and text messages.  It locks up for no reason too; basically, just a thorn in my side until it was replaced.  I am not sure what went wrong, but Motorola needs to take this back to the lab.  If you surf the net, you can find that countless others have had the same problems with this phone.
I've had this phone for about 5 months now, it was ordered from Amazon, from this page. Out of the box there is a noticible lag when entering any input. After reading reviews and web searches, I flashed my phone with improved firmware from the dev community. This worked fine for awhile, but eventually the lag slowly and steadily increased.Just to be clear, all other considerations normally reviewed: the phone reception, features like music player & camera, etc. - all these things are absolutely irrelevant when pressing any button (including answering a call) takes 10 or more seconds to register. The phone in effect becomes worthless. In my opinion, this is almost worse than a bricked phone. If it were truly dead you would get a new phone & move on. This issue is intermittent in varying degrees and is a never ending source of frustration.I do not have any music or files stored, I do not have any memory card in the phone, only normal contacts are stored on the phone's internal memory.If you are looking for a phone replacement, do yourself a favor and keep looking.
My only complaint is that it has speed issues. Not sure if it is the processor or internal memory or the board itself. It is so slow that i very often miss calls because it will not recognize in time that I have hit the answer button. Even with text messaging you have to wait for the letters to load.
I like this phone both as a phone and a music player.  It holds a lot of songs, pics, videos, etc.  The camera takes wonderful pictures.  The only gripe I have is that it definitely lags.  Sometimes, if my music is playing and I get a call, it takes awhile before it "answers"  because of the lag.  What's cool, though, is that you don't need an adapter for mp3 speakers.  They plug right in.
It has a very slick look, different from other phones that I've had. (about 5 different ones, Motorolas, Samsungs, and a Blackberry). The only flaw is the fact that the programs were not Mac compatible, but after looking online, you can find ways around. It just won't include all the programs (i.e profiles, themes) that you can upload on to your phone. Definitely good for tech savvy people.
It works really well except for the fact that you can't just scroll from one text to another.  You have to open the text , go out to the inbox, and then open another one.  Freezes for about 3 seconds when you're doing somethign and then someone texts or call you. 4/5
The cellphone works great, its slick and music sounds awesome and with built in 2 Gb what more could you ask for?Oh i know! service, they communicate with you and keep in touch so that you don't feel lost.I definitely recommend this product.
I bought the international version to be used in another country and all I had to do was to insert the SIM card to get it to work perfectly. I hhaven't had any problems at all with it. Highly recommend it.
The music quality is top notch, comparable to Cowon D2, Sony S639 (only slightly lesser bass). Call quality is also superior to vast of phones, and it is loud enough to hear even in a train station. The problem, it lags - whatever I clicked, it took 2-3 sec to respond. Yes, I am used to it, however, I really wish it can be more responsive.Turning camera sound off does improve camera speed - goes to camera option - picture setting - choose sound (including "None").
I recently purshased this phone and it is exactly what I expected, everything you read about it is true, and works wonderfully. I do reccomend it and especially from amazon.com because you will actually get the new phone not a refurbished one.
To start the phone was very easy to set up. I'm rocking on some tunes right now as I'm writing this review. I dropped a 4gig card in it and began downloading albums, no problem very simple if you follow the included instructions. The phone does lag at times but this has not been a major issue. Texting, mms, and phone calls all work like any other phone. I read cnn news daily on the phone which works great for me. Overall for me this was a great buy.
I got this phone free when I signed up with T-Mobile, and have since replaced it.Overall, I found this phone disappointing. My main problem with it is that it does not have an actual keypad-- rather, it has a flat surface that is touch-sensitive. I found this clumsy and awkward to use, and never got used to it.The phone itself is a bit bigger than you might expect. Annoyingly, the keypad lock doesn't cancel when you're getting a call, so you still have to fumble with the hold switch when you're trying to answer the phone.My phone gave me repeated error messages quite often because it had trouble synching to the network. The display also quickly became faulty, and the backlighting unreliable. Possibly my model was just a bit defective.The firmware gets very laggy if you don't turn the phone off every few days, and start-up is always very laggy, even when the phone is new.I did not use this phone for its music playing capability, so I can't comment on that.A few nice things about the phone: You select recipients of texts by checking boxes down your address list, which makes it easy to message many people at once. Also, the phone comes with a leather sleeve and a good pair of earbuds.For the reasons named above, I would not recommend this phone.
As other reviewers have indicated, the processor sometimes freezes up, which means that when you press a button, there can be a lag or delay before the phone processes that the button has actually been pressed.  The delays can be as short as a second or two, or can last for close to a minute.  This is particularly frustrating when a call is coming in and you press (and press and press) "answer", but the phone does not answer the call and it bounces into voice mail.  This doesn't seem to relate to using the memory to store music, since I don't have any music stored on my phone.  If I had known that I wouldn't be able to answer many incoming calls and would have problems using the buttons to make calls, I never would have bought the phone.  Super frustrating.  I'm sending it back to Motorola to see if they can fix the problem, but since a number of people have commented on this, I'm not expecting any miracles.
I payed for the phone this summer, good looking surface, really cool features, but way too SLOW! The basic features don't work at all. The phone would take 5 minutes just to call someone or pick up phone calls. Furthermore I had a bad experience with the company that sold me the phone. they sent me an email expressing their concerns about my feedback, but never got back to me! I would recommend getting another pone.
i was a little scared when i saw the manual and the CD in some weird lanuage .. but i managed to switch it back to english. Not a high-end phone for the features it speaks of. really goes slow with everything. Whether it is changing song, changing profile, opening camera, browsing contacts .. but you get used to it.love the design, voice clarity, battery life.
Found this must have phone with a great price.  My son loves it and the transaction was easy for me.Great job.
I bought this phone more than a month ago and I am very happy.The battery is very reliable. I only charged it three or for times since I got it.The lock is on the side which is another smart option, because it cannot get activated in my purse by accident.The way the buttons react is a bit different, but once you get used to its rhythm, it is fine.I like the fact that only the active buttons are lit and the fact that if you received a missed call it gives you a sort of a soft bing until you see it, so there is no way you really miss your missed calls :)It has Tetris game, which is great!The earpieces are very comfortable for the ears and you can use them with your laptop, too.Finally!The phone calls are of good quality, too. A really nice phone!
Given 1 star for the easy access to songs/artist/albums/shuffle, and another for decent battery life and the mini usb/usb charging capabilities.It's all down hill from there.I must warn all of you, the phone I bought from hasselfree(or whatever they changed their name to) came shipped to me as a Russian phone.  Russian text on the keys(just looks lame).  I feel like a complete idiot for buying this phone.  However, I was desperite and needed one fast and thought, "why not for 100 bucks".  This might not bother some, but the listed images reflecting the item purchased is not correct.Firmware updates are not available from Motorola.  T-Mobile updates are not available.  You'll have to do some research in order to find the correct settings for your phone.  Took me about a week.  My previous phones were all synched seemlessly intergrated.This phone also has TONS of lag when browsing through menus.  Doesn't matter what type, but I have found that, bluetooth will only add to the delay.The other thing I was gonna add is fact that the phone is in RUSSIAN.What's really weird about this phone is the speakerphone.  While playing music, it's great(for a phone) but during a phone call, it's average.  The speakerphone volume changes, why?  I dunno.  But it does, and it disapointed me as soon as I tried using it for a phone call.  Couldn't find any setting to try and tweak it.Bluetooth connections with headset pieces are sad compared to my last two phones, z6 and samsung.  Lots of digital static as if the phone was 20' or 30' away even though the ear piece and phone are less than 4' away from each other(cell in pocket/bluetooth headset in ear).I've used this phone for a more than 4 months and haven't had too many problems.  The cell phone's reception compared to the two previous phones is a 7/10.  I used to get a solid reception in my bedroom, now I have to go outside and stand infront of a planter in order to NOT drop a call.Though the expandable memory and internal memory sound like a plus.  The phone's internal system just added to the lag.  I kept everything on the SD card.  Thought this phone should have been called the lag.  Even with a brebone system with 1 mp3 on it, the phone still lags.  Really sad because this phone really looks cool!9/19/09I just added the data plan, omg... one thing to say... NEVER BUY A RANDOM UNLOCKED PHONE ever ever ever... Saving a few bucks just isn't worth the headache... buy the real thing.  Hasslefree or whatever they call themselves now asked why in an automated email... "what can we do to help you?"  full well knowing the crap they were selling.  This phone is just 100% pure jacked up.  EVERYTHING needs to be reset to a factory default that isnt available ANYWHERE!  You're going to be the one researching/plugging in everything... on your own.In all, screw this phone.  It looks awesome!  but yeah... most guys/girls that I know don't twitter their junk to a outdated cell phone.At most, this phone is worth 40 bucks...
This is a good unlocked cell phone for the price, it feels great in your hand does what it claims to do,if U R looking for a phone to use in the U.S & overseas, this one will do the job
Wow...so many annoying problems. Although the phone has "fixed" itself now it was very very annoying for a while. First I could not receive calls then people could not dial my number, then people had to dial my number plus area code. Second every text I received was duplicated, triplicated or multiplied up to 10 times! As in I would receive the same text multiple times. I called my carrier and wondered if I was being charged, i was not charged so the phone was just buggin alot. They said it was getting used to the "network" it took 4 weeks for it to get used to the network. I hope this doesnt happen to anyone. Other than those problems the phone is fantastic, solid build, great camera, awesome UI.
thanks to a lot of comments from people, i've made my choice and am selling my t-mobile G1 (black) for this phone. It looks very sleek, and it has a decent amount of memory!Its AWESOME. I cant wait to get this phone! :D
Hi I ordered this phone but it didnt say what's in the package. Can anyone tell me all the stuff it came with???
I have this phone for about three month now. Although there is not much negative to say in general, the biggest problem I have is the battery. It says on the product review that the standby time is 470 hours. Listen to this! Standby time = life of battery a pathetic 12 hours. Yes that's right. I have to literally charge this phone every day. This is however not a problem with the battery because I went an bought a new rechargeable li-ion battery with same Volts as original @ 3.7V and same capacity @ 1000mAh. Would you know it, it is the same problem. Empty after 12 hours of standby. So I am convinced it is the phone with the problem. I am getting me an I phone.
WELL WAS AN EXCELLENT, PRODUCT SATISFY MY EXPECTATIVE AND I RECOMMEND AMAZONS TO ANYBODY THAT EXPECT QUALITY EVEN ON SHIPPING OR SALES OFFERS.
I've been using omy Motorola Razr everyday for over a month now, and it is everything that I thought it would be. Of course, it is no "Storm" or "iPhone" but it is very solid user friendly phone. If you are looking for just a cell phone with only a few "toys" built in it, this is the one. If you are looking for lots of apps and you do a lot of texting, look elsewhere.
I discovered this phone's existence online.  Once again, thanks to Amazon's unparalleled customer review knowledge base, I got the skinny and knew what I was in for.  I wanted a phone with a screen that was READABLE.  Due to limitations in technology (LCD) and biology (my need for reading glasses), the screen of my little Nokia is only visible when cupped in my hands in a darkened theater.  And even that low-budget phone has too much JUNK to wade through.  (I don't care to do Internet shopping by phone, thanks though)  The Motofone F3 does what a phone is supposed to do - it lets you TALK to people quickly and easily.  It's Electronic Ink screen is amazing - you REALLY CAN read it in broad daylight.  Why isn't any other phone using this technology?If you're interested, please do read the reviews.  These phones are not marketed in the USA it seems - I guess we are collectively just too hip and sophisticated for this quaint little thing.  Mine came "unlocked" as advertised - I just transplanted the SIM card from my old phone and I was ready to go.  You have to choose your preferred language, and if you want a manual for the dozen or less functions, you can download it easily from Motorola.Some of the negative reviews are gut-busters.  Did these folks even READ about the phone they were getting?  Maybe it was a gift, I don't know.  "Box was opened!"?  That's because they're pulling these from South America or India and unlocking them for you!  "Has a crappy interface!"?  It does look like Etch a Sketch, but hey, I don't care to have all my friends' avatars on my screen.  I can speed dial about 15 numbers.  And you CAN send and receive text, if'n you really have to, though I don't think I ever will.  (So counterintuitive... that's why God invented keyboards!)  "Phone has no color screen! / no MP3 player! / no camera!" etc...  Well, if that's what you want, you don't want this phone.  I told all my higher-tech friends that I just got two "Third World Phones" - and my wife and I love them.Note: apparently some folks did not get "unlocked" phones or had other technical problems.  I was lucky in that regard.  (May have been a different vender.)  Also make sure your phone plan uses compatible technology.  Amazon has a little chart at the top of the page to help you with this too.  Thanks Amazon, and Vibe Cellular, for letting me make an informed decision.  It's the cell phone I've always wanted.
I own this phone.  It's a great phone, assuming that you only want to make calls and send/receive simple text messages.However, it is NOT a quad-band phone.  This listing says "QUAD BAND" in the title, then describes it as a dual-band (which it is) in the page content.  This is misleading.
It's not the phone's fault if it comes to you in a locked state instead of unlocked. Nor is it a problem of the phone if it arrives used. That's a problem with the store.Happily, mine came as ordered. I went to wikipedia to look up how to turn on automatic key lock and turn keypad tones off and then I was set. I am a carpenter and have destroyed many phones with dust and general abuse. This one withstands the abuse. I does what I want it to. It's cheap enough so that if something happens to it it's not that big a deal. It seems dumb to me to spend a lot of money on stuff you do not need, that locks you in a contract and will be obsolete in a few months anyway and don't forget the handset insurance.
This is a amazing PHONE.Its nothing more than a "phone" so don't expect anything more than what a average home phone has in it. So play with you coredless and if you hate it dont buy this.The F3 makes excelent calls but thats it and thats why I wanted it to go with my t-mobile unlimited package.The talk time told is wrong tho 3 to 4 days of standby and the battery is dead or 5 hrs of talking. Its still a good amount of talk tho.
I've had the Motofone for about a year as my sole work and home phone. I'm a telecommuter and on the phone a lot - and that's an understatement: last month's bill was 4,500 minutes. This is The Phone for that kind of usage:- Loud, clear sound- Even on speakerphone - better than our office phones- Lays flat on a desk - perfect for dialing passcodes while on speaker- Very strong battery life- Dual antennas that pull signal where iPhones and Blackberries cannot.- Plays well with T-Mobile.- Pretty much drop-proof (so far)- And tiny: A little longer than a credit card, but Hershey-bar flatThe downside is that this phone lacks every other conceivable feature. Texting feels like telegraphing. No music, no web, no contact lists (just phone numbers on the SIM card itself) and an internal non-network clock that seems to lose 5 minutes a day.But again, the sound is absolutely perfect.
I have AT&T; service, got this phone as a replacement for my LG VU phone, which went bad, this phone beats any other expensive phones I have used so far, like the VU or Razr. The good thing about this phone is it provides all the features that you most likely would need. The screen of the phone and its battery life are among the most outstanding features I liked othere than the price!
This is a great phone for the basics of a cell phone such as sound quality on both ends and battery life.  It does not offer any extras but that is fine with me.  The only problem is that the touch-tone does not work.  It cannot be used as a touch-tone phone and many services needed require this such as voice mail, calling cards and others.
I bought this phone as a very simple replacement for my wife who only wanted a phone to make and receive calls--that's it!  And this phone is great for that.But ... it is only has 850 and 1900 band frequencies--not 1800 which is what my wife needs in India.  We thought we were all prepared with her  "International version" Motofone F3 and an Indian SIM card purchased before she left; we tested the Indian SIM card with the Motofone and it worked great. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that did not mean it would work in India.  It worked here (in the US) because it roamed to a 850/1900 MHz network.  But in India, the SIM card needs a 1800 MHz network.  My wife now has to get another phone to use with her Indian SIM card.
This product works fine, BUT BE WARNED: IT'S A PHONE AND NOTHING MORE!!!No camera, a very rudimentary address book, very rudimentary text messaging, monochromatic (black & white) screen, etc.If all you want to do is make phone calls, this phone is great.  If you want to do ANYTHING else with your phone, this is not the phone for you.
Great phone.  Call quality great, like plugged into the wall.  Pencil thin and light.  Incredible value. Really like and highly recommend.
I bought this phone for my 70 year old mother. I happened to have an extra "family plan" line on AT&T.; I have only had the phone for one day, but here are some observations and "tips": 1) came in a Moto box that looked opened but the phone appears new; 2) I needed to call AT&T; three times to get everything working right. First, I had to verify the SIM number and provide them the phone's IMEI number. They asked if this was an AT&T; phone, and I just said no, it's an unlocked international phone and they had no problems with that. Finally, voicemail did not work out of the box. Apparently, phones pull your VM number from the SIM. I manually input the seven digits to call VM but that did not work either (nor did "123"). So, I called AT&T; again and they tweaked it, so there was some kind of infrastructure change they needed to make. Also, you need to find your own manual online (very easy). This phone is made for developing countries and its interface is weird (I'm familiar with RIM and Win Mobile 6.1)--more pictures and just different. However, now that it's all setup, reception looks better than my Blackberry Bold; numbers are very easy to see; and you can program numbers 2-9 to auto-call family members. Hopefully this helps!
Who would have thought one of these cell phone companies could actually make a "cheap" phone?  Well this phone is great.. It lacks all the great bells and whistles... but it works... Good Job Moto!!!
I ordered this phone based on some of the reviews and the fact I didn't need a phone that had the latest technology. I thought the phone was neat because of how slim it was, and the fact it was really affordable ($35 shipped). However, sadly I am disappointed:Pros:-Slim and sleek!-Voice quality is great!-E-Ink is an interesting display method.Cons:-Battery time is not what it is supposed to be (more like four days with about ten minutes of talking time).-Tells me that my SIM card is not inserted at times; thus, I have to take out the battery and reinsert my SIM card (older phone never had this problem).-Don't receive calls when it's claiming the SIM card is out...missed quite a few phone calls because I didn't notice it's false claims.-When you take out the battery, the time and calender date is wiped; you'll have to reinsert them.-Oh, and the strangest thing about mine is, is that it won't ring when it's set to vibrate and ring. I just won't...it'll sit there and vibrate but no ringing. Once again, missed a few calls due to this problem too.Overall, this is phone with a great concept; it's simple, E-Ink supposedly uses little battery power (thus you can actually remove the battery and the display will still show what was last on the screen), and it's really affordable. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to it's full potential (battery-life problems, SIM card problems, and the strange no-ringing problem); I really wanted to like this phone, but I'll be requesting a refund on this one....
I bought this phone because I wanted a cheap replacement for my broken phone till I am eligible for upgrade.Pros:This phone is ultra thin - unbelievably thin. It has just the basic stuff one needs from a phone. No useless additional frills that most of us never use. You can make calls, see time, use it as alarm clock - thats it.Talk time is really long - power saving features like e-ink.Cons:The interface is ancient.The address book is very hard to maintain and use.Messaging is very hard - even to take small notes.End of the day, I couldn't use this phone. It was too ancient for me (I am 25). I found it really hard to put my 250 contacts in it, take small notes etc. So I swapped it with my husband. He is a computer science professor. And he TOTALLY LOVES it! He is very proud of this phone - its simplicity, talk time, power saving using e-ink etc. This phone does exactly what he wants from a phone - BTW, he has 4 people on his address book.
I bought the Motofone F3 when I had broken my Samsung Blast after a camping trip. I have to say this is one very sturdy phone. I am a very clumsy person so when I say this phone is sturdy what I mean is, I have already accidentally dropped it down a full flight of concrete stairs, stepped on it in the dark, closed it in a door (long story) and accidentally kicked it across my kitchen. All that and the F3 still works like a tank. The only complaint I have about it (and this is a pretty minor one) is that the light for the face of the phone is actually the small LED lights that light up the buttons, so the display light is really dark. This is ok for reading it since it has such high contrast and large characters, but since it is so dark it does a very poor job of doubling as a makeshift flashlight. Other than that this is one of the best phones I have ever had. I recommend it for anybody that is a Bull-in-a-china shop like me. :)
Simple, slim and sleek. features are easy to understand. Now i don't have to flip to use my phone everytime.
I was looking for a simple  mobile phone, nothing fancy and this is the one . I liked it, it does everything I was looking for in a really simple fucntion mobile phone. The handfree speaker is the best fuction of all. Loud and clear sound. It very much replaced the Onstar sytem in my car .
Looks like I am another victim of being sold a locked Tigo phone when I purchased an 'Unlocked' phone.  Phone appears to be just what I was looking for, a barebones phone... I just can't use it.  I will be returning it.
For under $30 this phone is perfectly designed to make/receive calls and that is it. If you are an avid texter or prefer to use your phone as an accessory to taking pictures, playing games, or listening to music than this is not for you. On the other hand, I wanted a cheap unlocked phone that I can use to TALK. If I want to take pictures I have a digital camera, games are on the computer, music I have on my MP3 player. The sound quality is great, reception is better than average, battery life is good enough, screen is easy to read in any light and shows the called id just like any other phone would. You can read and write text messages, change between 10 or so ring tones, lock the phone, scan through address book and use the alarm clock. Overall it's a unique phone for a non gadget minded person.
The best phone to price ratio I have ever seen in a phone - great for a second phone to take into hazardous environments.  I could imagine successfully using this as my primary phone as well.I recommend it heavily.
I almost didn't buy this phone because of some customers claiming that their phone arrived locked; Luckily mine didn't. I've used the phone for 2 days and so far I LOVE IT. I have used many higher end phones this year, Ive owned an N95 and a BB curve. Both of those phones where great except for the fact that I never used half of the features such as the camera, cell games, or internet. I simply wanted a tough phone with a good speaker made for making calls. If that's what your looking for this is your phone. The main downside for me is that it looks like a toy phone. The screen is col even without the flashy graphics; I like the fact that I can see the screen clear in bright sunlight without a glare.Bottom line the phone is good for making calls, its tough, light weight, and I love it.Oh and just so you know, your friends will make fun of this phone lol
I just received my Motofone F3 today, for those that get one of these your going to run up against a lot of problems if you don't have an activated T-mobile sim. At first, I had many problems with the F3 because the phone restricts most functions when you have an unsupported sim or no sim at all. Infact if you'd like to change the speaking from Spanish to English you need to use an activated T-mobile sim to even get to that setting screen. Originally I used a Tracfone sim because I have like $100 into my account and the sim card is %100 not compatable with the motofone :(The web is very little help when it comes to error codes or even telling you simple things like when you see a blinking X in the upper right corner your getting an error because of you having an invalid sim, you must have a valid sim to enter number codes or to get rid of the blinking X. Again the blinking X happens when you try to press number buttons without a valid sim". Program codes are in the ENGLISH manual that can be found here:[...]If you get a "NO SIM" message with a "3-070" right below it then you have an invalid sim.I was on tech support today and was told there is physically no difference between an international motofone and one intended for the US, They all have Quad bands built right into them. Also tech support stated AT&T; and cingular might work with the phone too, but others like Tracfone or NET10 do not!There are many comments about the visibility in direct sunlight, but very little about dark nights. If you have moonlight or some kind of lit up sky you will be able to read the screen at night from arms distance without using the backlight. I do not know if the backlight can be switched off but it drains the battery noticeably and is always on.The alarm clock is very easy to use, in fact it and the clock is the only thing you fiddle around with when you don't have a sim card. The alarm is really kind of cool sounding and starts out very low with a short vibrate, and the volume progressively increases every 2 seconds or so.The phones battery does not seem to last more then a day if you fiddle around with it like every 5 mins or so.The phone is slimmer then its Tracfone look-alike and it is wider too.If you don't have T-mobile service you can order a sim kit on ebay for under $25.If you don't have T-mobile and have ordered the ebay sim kit and want to change the phone speaking to english while your waiting for your sim to come in the mail, all you have to do is borrow your friends T-mobile sim and install it into the motofone, you will then be asked which language you want to set, 1 or 2 or 3. 3 should be english. This setting is remembered even if you pull your buddies sim card out or remove the battery.Overall, its a damn good phone, I've had it a day now and dropped it already, the phone still works great. Remember to post your comments on whether or not AT$T works or others work on this. I %100 positively can tell you that Tmobile works on the international phone, and Tracfone or NET10 doesn't.
The telephones were advertized as unlocked telephone to be used internationally, both telephones did not work in a foreign country.I am highly disapointed.
I bought this for a trip to Mexico. I worked well there, mostly did texts back and forth to the US. Since then, I've carried it as a backup. I originally paid 30 bucks and got $20 in free airtime. I've only spent maybe $20 on airtime. That includes $6 for a mistake that was caused by the phone falling under the armrest of the car. After that, I learned to mash, and hold, the star key to lock the keypad. The phone almost always has a signal, better than my others. It's just way to expensive($1.75/min) to use as a primary phone.
The phone that is labeled as international version is not working internationally. I sent the phone to my mother in Africa and it can not even identify a sim card.I called and said I have no any packaging materials with me and I want to return it but I received very discouraging answers. This is not my faulty. The problem is advertising things that do not work. I am seriously bored
My original phones' signal reception was much better. I was not able to make any call using this F3 phone. I guess it will work only if signal quality is very good. Keypad was getting hung many times - which made me reboot it very often resulting in losing previous settings (date/time). Looks like 10 years old technology or may be my phone piece was just faulty.
I bought this phone online. I liked it because of its looks and its so called "ease of use". When I finally got it I was so dissapointed. Looks can be decieving indeed, hehehe. Its not as "cool" as it look online. This phone seems to be from the 80's but slimmer. The screen display is like a flash back from the calculator screens of the early 80's,the font are so big that it cannot even display the whole phone number in the screen. Even the fonts are weird, they are like written by a toddler. But I dont do much text messaging so I can live with that ugly screen display/font. But the signal of this phone is terrible too so I cant even use them for regular phone call. Dont buy this, it will just be a waste of money. Even a third world country will consider this phone a piece of crap.
This is a base model this phone really sucks you can't see who's calling who you called and you can't retrieve missed calls, text messages.  Save your money don't buy this.
I was looking for a basic phone for calls and text while I find a real phone, which is unlocked and international. I have T-mobil international plan, but the phone didn't work in Europe. It doesn't have an out box in text messages, it is hard to read and write text because of the large font words often appear partially. If you are in an area with no reception it may take sometimes as much as 10 minutes for the sim card to work. Sometimes for no reason my sim card couldn't be recognized so I have to take the battery out remove and re-install the sim card for it to start working again. Sometimes the phone just "lights up" reading "t-mobil" on it. All in all, it's more like a somewhat sophisticated child's toy than a phone.Please do yourself a favor and don't get it, I could write long-long essays how bad it is and even super-tech guys gave up trying to figure it out.I on;y give it 1 star rating because i couldn't submit "0"
It is small but the user interface is really bad. If you text at all, you will hate it. I would not recommend, not even if it is free.
This phone only abilities are a basic phone call and text message without media. This phone should only be bought for short term not long term use. Its battery life isn't long after charge with talk and stand by time.  This phone is only good for immediate survival use to make a few phone calls and thats it.
I expected a bit more from the cell phone.  I thought the screen view was better,especially at night.  I also thought it would take the rings and all the numbers from my sim card.
The Phone came on time , Good, But there should be a law that states that the amount of packaging that goes arround a product should not be too much. I am sure we can leave a smaller carbon footprint by using smaller cartons.Bad PointsThe phone is a basic phone, ot too amny functions or capabalities to expand the phoneGood Pointsand ,very lightcheap
The Cell is not what i expected, i would recommend expending more money if you want something decent and cheap. The phone is way too simple for me is hard to use it. No graphics :( but overall the service was great ;)
It was one of the worst purchase I had ever made. This was a complete rip-off. I had seen this phone before and expecting the same phone but the one I received in the mail was nothing but a piece of plastic and it's definitely not the original phone that you could buy from At&T.; This is a duplicate phone perhaps imported from China or Mexico. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It's described as: Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Cell Phone--International Version with No Warranty (Black)by Motorola. But I guarantee you this is not from Motoralla.
Sound quality good, screen is absolutely unreadable.  Buy any other phone except this one.  I own one, thought of giving it away but didn't want to offend anyone else, not even an enemy.  I decided to bury it in my back yard, please don't tell the EPA.
This comodity was not as I expected, how'er I'd already purchased it and so I'll make the best of it.
the phone is not what I spected very deffical to use and read, I dont recommended.
This is really a cheap phone!  Spend some extra money, but don't buy this one.  I only used it for a week before I decided to throw it away.  Yes, it's just money wasted if you decide to buy it.  This phone makes you feel like gooing back in time, at least 10 years ago, compared to a common and simple Motorolla Razor phone! There are just too many bad things that can be said about it, that it's not worth writing them all out here.  So please just take my word for it; you are better off with the phone you have, even if it's all broken or a few years old...
Good looking phone, that where all the good things about this phone ends. Bad connection, Bad sound quality and within one week I bought the new phone the battery would not last for 2 minutes talk.
Oh what a POS.  I bought this phone thinking that I would get something simple, reliable, and no hassle.  I got none of that.  Went 0 for 3.The bad:The phone would constantly lose cellular reception, and it would not automatically pick up.  I would have to turn the phone on and off.  This alone gives this phone a 0 out 5 stars.  But that's not all.The letters are blocky, so how do you send and receive text messages?  2 years later, and I'm still haven't found out.Phone constantly needs to have the settings redone.  How many freakin times do I need to tell you what time/date it is?The good:There's not much covering for exterior, so if I put a single shot of BB through it, it'll probably render it unusable, which is a whole lot better than that being "usable" but being a piece of garbage that frustrates.  Not it'll be just a piece of garbage.I haven't explored further into this trash, but if I did, I'd probably find other things to go off on it.  Oh an also, the date format is in Euro/Australian form (whatever, I don't what standard they use, but it's not American).
The phone arrived with a deep crack on the front.  The crack runs through the display and about 1/2 through the numbers.  This is not a slight scratch, but a crack in the plastic.  The product description doesn't mention that the phone is used and in poor condition.
This phone is not unlocked regardless of what they say.  It's a very strange phone, unlike anything I have seen before.  Maybe very very simple with weird voice prompts but is really a terrible phone, terrible functionality (even simple) and almost just unusable.
Worst phone ever to buy..............not even for a child..........should be taken off the market :-(
I bought this phone cuz my dad need one for like a month. But the phone was HORRIBLE. IT WAS TERRIBILY HORRIBLE! Its the WORST phone out there in the world. In my opinion its not even worth a dollar. Because it just a piece of trash.
HORRIBLE PHONE STAY AWAY FROM IT.  COULDN'T EVEN SAVE YOU IN AN EMERGENCY!!!!!!! I WAS SO AGGRAVATED I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE.  IT IS SO CHEAP.  I WAS BETTER OFF GETTING MY SON HIS REPLACEMENT PHONE FROM GO PHONE AT&T; ...IT WAS CHEAPER AND BETTER QUALITY!
the kick slider is the best feature about the phone.  i only really use a phone for talking, and this feature makes speaking much better.
Bought this for my 13-yr old son after he went through three phones in six months. The reception is very good and battery life is outstanding but most importantly it is unbelievably durable. Numerous drops, scratches and other usual disruptions have had no effect on this phone. Then tonight my wife did the laundry with my son's phone in his jeans pocket; a full wash and dry cycle later (the phone fell out of the dryer when it was opened and was so hot I has to let it cool for an hour before playing with it) I wiped off the battery then charged the phone and it works just fine!!! If you are looking for a phone that has good battery life and can take a beating this is highly recommended. Not the coolest phone but extremely functional and durable.
This phone is a awesome little workhorse.  It is a slider, so it doesn't make a loud snap when you shut it like a flip phone.  This phone is easily worth over $100 used.  I have owned mine for a year and had no issues.  I bought one for my mom's birthday as well.  They can be found used online almost anywhere, and most people can't complain about them!  I Love this Samsung A737 slide phone.  The SGH-A737 by Samsung and at&t; is a good deal!
I will not lie, in the first year this phone was amazing.  Great battery life, very very easy to use, and pretty good sound quality.  Too bad its basically a rock after only 2 years (if that) of use (and I'm pretty easy on my phones).First, while I used to only have to charge the phone once a week, I now have to charge it every other day, if not more.  The battery life is completely shoddy.  Its pathetic.  Even if I only talked only 2-3 hours that day, the phone will die right there in the middle of the call.Second, you'll be lucky to get a call or text to go through, from senders or the receivers end.  I've had people text me and call me, and the calls and text won't arrive until hours later.  At first I thought it was a service problem, but my brother lives in the same area with a cheap 30 dollar phone, and his calls and text go through crystal clear.  I also have the worst time sending calls and text.  I've had to call people 5 times or more because the call wouldn't go through or the call would drop as soon as the person answered.  The same goes for text, it takes a good three times before it goes through.Third, the sound quality is awful.  The person on the other end can just about never hear you, and it sounds like their calls are breaking up all the time.  So texts are the way to go, if you can send them.All in all, this phone is just not worth it in the longterm.  Like I said, this phone was amazing for the first year.  But when the second year came around, this phone became just pure hell to use.  Don't waste your time.
I chose this phone hoping to carry one less device, by installing a 4GB Micro SD chip and using it as an mp3 player.OVERALL RATING 2 stars (average of my phone and mp3 ratings)A737 AS A PHONE: 3 stars.As phones go, it is good enough. Other reviews complain about durability and battery life. So far mine is not broken, and I agree that the battery life is short. That will put me in the habit of leaving it connected to the computer overnight to recharge (using a USB cable). It's nice to be able to charge it from USB rather than carry an AC charger when traveling. Indoor use is better than my previous phone (Sony Ericsson T610), which did not work well in my home.A useful feature that is not listed in the manual is "AIRPLANE" mode: it disables connection to the network, so that you can use the device on an airplane, for example to play mp3s or backup the phone's address book to your laptop.I don't have the data plan. If you're going to pay the exhorbitant monthly fee for data, you should get a smart phone that makes better use of it.Many features that require a data plan clog up the interface even when you don't have a data plan. For example, if you press the AT&T; logo (select button), it pauses, says the connection failed. You then have to press OK, then Back, then confirm that you want to exit from the browser, 3 different button presses just to cancel the unavailable feature. This button is prominent on the phone and I had to learn NOT to press it from the main screen. I wish that the phone knew or learned it had no data plan, and kept data-dependent features from getting in the way.On the other hand, there is a convenient configurable menu on another button from which you can select the features you actually use. That does soften my complaints in the previous paragraph - except for the AT&T; logo button starting the browser.A737 AS AN MP3 PLAYER: 1 starAs mp3 players go, it's nearly unusable.I have a nice pair of standard earbuds (Koss "Plug") plugged in through an adapter, and they sound decent when the music is playing, but not as good as on my inexpensive but old Creative Zen Nano Plus mp3 player.There is a LOUD *POP* at the beginning and end of each songs - that means two loud pops between tracks. It usually cuts off the first half-second of the song. Every time I push buttons to navigate the menus on the phone, there is the same LOUD *POP*. Between songs, there is a pause - sometimes short, sometimes long, and sometimes it is stuck until I push some buttons.The volume control has only 5 steps over a wide range from too quiet to too loud. I have to use step 4 even though it is louder than I prefer, because step 3 is much too quiet.I would like to play songs in a Music folder in the order they appear when sorted (my songs include a track number), as I can do with my Zen, so I can play an album in its intended order, or arbitrary mp3s in an order I have chosen. The only way to do that is to create a playlist for each folder. Without a playlist, you can play by Album and by Artist only.I was hopeful when I saw that I could rate each song as it was playing, but this feature is useless. I played two hours worth of songs and rated each of them. The ratings are available on the phone, but I can't transfer the ratings back to my mp3 library with any of the three mp3 transfer mechanisms - Windows Media Player, the included Multimedia Manager (which has a column for displaying the rating but apparently no way to set it), or the mass storage USB setting using File Manager copy.The battery life for playing music is poor: perhaps 3 hours, about the same as talking on the phone. If you play a lot of music on a flight, you won't be able to use the phone when you land.MISC COMMENTSThe phone came with a charger and nothing else. I had to buy adapters to connect to USB (to charge, and to transfer data), and to use standard 2.5mm (1/8") stereo headphones. You will probably want to buy a lot of accessories to make the phone practical. They would be cheap except there is high postage, and no one seller has them all.Contrary to some reviews on Amazon, I CAN use 4GB Micro SD chip in this phone; the Kingston chip works fine.The 1 megapixel camera will sometimes come in handy when I don't have my real camera with me. The quality is on par for mobile phones, but not comparable to using a dedicated camera.The AT&T; plan I have includes SMS text messages. People can message me by emailing 10-digit-phone-number@txt.att.net, which is convenient, but I cannot reply to them without a data plan, except using SMS to their phone.The alarm clock and address book applications are fine. The included PC software works, albeit with a non-intuitive interface and text and help file written by someone who does not know English very well. The Multimedia Manager takes much too long (average 2 minutes each) to transfer mp3 files to or from the phone.The three included USB modes support the Samsung PC software, Windows Media Player protocol, and accessing the MicroSD (if present) like a USB memory stick. There is a choice to "ask me when connecting" - but it greys out all but the Samsung PC software, so this setting is useless.SUMMARYThe phone is ok for basic phone features. With the exhorbitant price of data plans, if you're going to pay that much monthly, you should invest in a phone that can make better use of the data features. The crippling problems in the MP3 player render it nearly unusable for that purpose.
I purchased this phone for two reasons. First, I needed a phone because I couldn't keep a good case on my Motorola Razor. And second, my wife needed a new phone badly. My razor was about a year old, so I would buy me what I was looking for (no flipper or slider; but had full key board). This is what I came up with. My Wife keeps the Razor in her pocket without a case anyways. She was happy. I was really, really happy. This phone performs so well and looks so professional, I want it's premium model when It's upgrade time, even if I have to pay some. It does have a bug here and there but MOST of those can be worked out - seriously. I have AT&T;, you HAVE to call and get your ring time extended from 20 to 30. Seriously, to have plenty of time, that has to be done. And the phone itself is awesome. All I can say is keep your upgrades up. Keep it updated.
I just bought this Palm Centro a week ago. For now I am impressed with the versatility the phones gives me for making calls, handling contacts and appointments.  And cause it's based on palm OS I installed a couple of apps I used to had in my TX.  They work just fine.I read a couple of reviews where the guys were complaining about locking a freezing.  I experienced it a couple of times receiving calls, but cause of my expertise with palm devices, I decided to make a hard reset and voilá!! everything is working just fine for now.  I installed callrec (wonderful app that records every call you make), Agendus Pre, BTToggle and a coulpe of games and everything is wonderful.Pros:- Very versatile device- Sound is good- Good speaker- Handful of useful apps on the market- Basic apps very useful for starters (agenda, contacts, voice dial, Calc, Documents to Go, Pocket tunes, voice recorder)- Voice command that lets you make a lot of things like calling contacts (you say the name of the contact and it understands it very good), opening apps.  Very cool feature.- Qwerty keyboard feels fine, but not for big hands, my hands are a little big and I can use it just fine.- Bluetooth- micro sd slot- Good stuff for your moneyCons:- Plastic pen, feels a little fragile (I already ordered a metal pen for 1$)- Back cover feels little loose when holding the phone.  Makes a little noise when you press it too hard. This factor does not interfere with phone functions.- Battery life not so good, I can estimate a 4-5 day in standby mode.  In constant use, two days top.- No wifi (should this be a con?)That's what I can say.  So far I am satisfied with this smartphone (really smart I think).  I give it 4 stars.
i kept getting alerts every 3 or 4 minutes saying that there was some error with my mail system,  and i did not have email on my plan .. it took many calls but the folks at [....] were patient ... i did a hard reset and they helped me do it without losing my info .. so all's well that ends well...
LOved it. Even after the second one broke I bought another one. I would buy this at At&t; rather then other companies. Also i just wanted to mention the fact the Palm Centro has a touchsreen keyboard too. Just press the options buttons go right then go down to Keyboard and tap it. Wala! Touchsreen Keyboard, although easier to use with the sylus than bare hands.P.S the only fault that I have with this phone is the freezing.
Freezes often and cannot be relied on.  Freezes when I need to make a call, calls are coming in and you can't answer them, even when I added additional memory card.  Palm has helped me reset this phone over 11 times and it still freezes.  Then Palm recommended renaming the back-up folder. It still freezes.  Then Palm tried to trade my new Centro for a refurbished Centro, but at the $300.00-new-Centro-price.  I refused.  Google "Centro Freezes" and you will find a lot of sites and blogs about this unsolvable, unfixable freezing problem with the Centro. When I call Palm, no one answers the phone except an answering machine;  voicemails do not result in returned calls.  I will never buy another Palm product again.  By the way, everyone I know who has a Blackberry is infinitely satisfied and happy with it.  Guess what I am replacing my Centro with?
When I bought this phone my main concern was the keyboard (I have experienced the 650 so knew about the good quality), but although the keyboard is "compressed" I can easily tap all the letters with minimum to cero problems.Also, all of my friends could (it takes just a little practice, some times a little patience also).The best thing is all the applications available that I can easily install in this phone.It never resets, never gets frozen.I can just give it a: two thumbs up!
The phone has two severe hardware problems:1. Freezes often on incoming calls - often needs reset to work2. Resets on its own especially during writing SMSsProblem 1 has been on the net for at least 13 months with no solution from Palm
maybe that's how long phones are lasting these days but it's not right. I only use about 250 minutes a month and have taken excellent care of it. It's always in a case when not in use and it's never been dropped. For the past few weeks the phone has gone mute a handful of times and now it's frozen.
i bought this device due to the database capability where i could copy and paste into the notes field.but the software crashes often and i could not re import the backed up file.there is virtually no tech support and the knowledge base is non existance.the sync locked up and i could not get it back up until i disconnected the battery for a few days.i got it to sync back to the PC software database. i will have to look for an alternative.
I've had this phone for about two weeks now and used pretty much everything on it and I'm proud to report that this phone was well worth the investment. I am a big time gadget geek and I had been watching this phone for the last year. I flew out to Chicago and checked it out in April at the Nokia flagship store and was a little turned off by the keypad so I waited patiently for more reviews (and newer phones) to come out before I would make my final decision. Excited by the new phones that Nokia had in the making, I later found myself disappointed by the fact that none of the new ones include a xenon flash, which is a huge downgrade in terms of picture quality, which is my primary interest in this phone. After all was said and done, I spent my points on my credit cards and finally sprung for one of the black N82s. I couldn't be happier with my choice.Pros:-The phone is very responsive with little or no lag time between menus and applications. This is due to the huge amount of available RAM on the phone and fast processor.-Photos come out amazing for a camera phone, and it's actually now the replacement for my standalone digital camera. It's great having a camera wherever I go without having to carry extra stuff.-Web browsing is effortless and the standard browser has great speed, at least for me, but I've updated the firmware to v30 which has increased battery life significantly and speeds up performance.-The calender application works great, though it's a little slower to put in entries than my old phone because it's a little more complex.-GPS works fast, and I can usually get a lock-on in less than a minute, even without network assistance.-Uploading photos to web couldn't be easier and geo-tagging is a cool feature to see on my Flickr account.-Tons of available apps for the S60 OS-Mp3 player works great, albeit very simple, but is sufficient at playing music well.-Decent build quality, though I wish mine wasn't made in China.Cons:-The phone is a fingerprint MAGNET! Be prepared to wipe the phone down regularly to keep it smudge free, especially if you have oily fingers.-The flash almost always produces redeye in my photos. I don't know if it's because of the timing or position of the flash or what, but I have also yet to try the redeye reduction setting. So far though my pictures are coming out great except for this one aspect.-The GPS does not work as well as my standalone unit, but in a pinch it's a great feature to have.-Battery life could be better. I'm somewhat of a power user and I have to charge the phone every day or it will die on the second day.-Yes the keypad is a little on the small side, but I still find it to be very functional and I can text just as fast witht his phone as my last phone. The raised buttons have a very tactile feel. Just keep your nails trimmed and that should help with the button presses.Conclusion:For what you pay, this is the most feature laden phone in it's class with a nice balance of size and functionality. The screen size is sufficient for most uses and the phone works well as a PHONE, unlike the iphone that I want so badly for them to make right. If given a second chance, I would have had no hesitation to buy this phone when it first came out. Now that the price has gone down this phone is a bargain, and until they come out with an S60 phone with a xenon flash and Nokia reliability, I can see myself keep this phone for quite a while. Theres only a few things I wish that they can do for the next generation and that includes the xenon flash, 8mp camera, gps, wifi, touch screen, qwerty keyboard. Until then this is the best that they get without spending an arm and a leg for the even higher end phones.
All you need to know...YES, THE CAMERA: Enough has been said of the camera. It's all true. I can take a photo in pitch blackness. The infrared will shoot across a room to auto-focus & the bright Xenon will illuminate the room to take excellent, quality photos in complete darkness. This is no exaggeration. It has replaced my actual camera so I can carry less. I record all of my YouTube vids with the phone, too.It's not just the flash. It's not just the 5 megapixels. It's not just the lens cover. It's a lens that can handle the megapixels and an autofocus that makes it worth while. Most of us aren't trying to take poster-sized photos. For best results, I reduce the initial size of the photo (to 5x7 or so) so it doesn't have to be edited down.OTHER COOL FEATURES:TV-OUT function that comes w/wiring. Plug the N82 into a tv and see the webrowser, photos, movies, MSWord docs, Excel docs, PowerPoint, PDF files, etc. Record video and see it on the screen simultaneously.(If you purchase a collapsible bluetooth keyboard and mouse, you'll have a 'laptop' that is more portable and has a larger screen than a Mac Air, fits in a jacket pocket and uses any modern tv's screen.)MEMORY: Comes with 2gb memory card. I added an 8gm sdhc Ultra to mine. It's fast, no delay. It can take 16gb card. 128mb RAM. Never get 'memory full' warnings. Dual ARM 11 332 MHz processor w/ 3D graphics hardware acceleratorGPS (comes w/ Nokia maps as well, but download Google Maps for free. It's better). At cost, you can add voice-guided directions as well.DOCUMENTS: You can view MSWord docs, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF. With an upgrade, you can even edit them.ZIP: Creates, opens, downloads and sends ZIP foldersWiFi that is very easy to configure. UPnP to wirelessly connect with other wireless electronicsVIDEO CALLING: This feature doesn't work in The States, but it allows you to take self photos/videos and see yourself as you shoot. In a few years when video calling reaches us, your N82 will be ready....Bluetooth, Podcasting, FM radio, currency/measurement converter, world clock, photo editor, video editor, NGage gamesThis is not a slider or a flip. It's a solid piece and that means it's very sturdy. Sliders come with flex cables that are subject to damage. Just Google "flex cable" and add any slider phone.N85 & N86: These newer models are sliders which look cheap. One of them has an 8mp camera, but no Xenon flash to accompany it.OTHER OPTIONS - WINDOWS MOBILE OR APPLE OR PALM: No other operating system offers as many downloadable apps as the Symbian systems. This means you can download Symella and download music, video and files to your phone like LIMEWIRE. You can download Handwave and direct your phone w/o even touching it. You can download Nokmote, Rockandscroll or Rotateme and direct the N82 by motion. There are countless more free apps available. It's just more expandable than any other operating system.Touch screens are gimmicks. They require a greater range of motion, usually two hands and make your screen dirty. A cursor only requires I move my thumb a few millimeters whilst iPhoners are using two hands and strokes. Cute, but not practical.CONSSMALL KEYS: The keyboard is the size of my thumb. Although the keyes are are spaced, Braille-touch is still near impossible because even my pinkie finger can touch two keys at once. The rice grain keys require a vertical touch w/your nail Ridiculous!NO QWERTY: The T9 is both predictive *and* teachable. After a short while, you'll teach it most of the odd words you're going to use. I can key in my name by touching the same amount of keys as I would on a QWERTY, but w/o the range of motion and the bulk of a QWERTY.SPEAKERS: Considering this unit has two speakers and is an upgrade from the N80, the sounds isn't quite as clear, good or powerful as that of an N80. There is an equalizer, boost & surround feature, none of which improve the sound. The sound is good, but not what it should be and is an obvious step down from the N80. That 'said,' the N82 offers a 3.5mm jack. The headset sound is stellar.3G: The N82 doesn't come w/ US 3G frequency, unfortunately.CONFIGURATION: If this is your first smart phone, you should know that, because it's not released under the umbrella of a carrier, it will take a lot of configuration. You won't be able to just pick it up and do all of the things I've listed here w/o downloads, upgrades, input. These are not simply calling phones. They aren't for teens who just want games and music. Know this.SMALL SCREEN: The screen isn't as small as you may think. It's bigger than most and as large as some PDAsLOOKS: This stealth phone definitely flies under the radar. No bling. No wow factor. I like to think of it as a high end, understated Benz whilst the iPhone is a mass-marketed, gold-laden, flashy Cadillac. Of course, the iPhones aren't even remotely in this phone's league. The upcoming N97 from Nokia has more features, but it is larger, is a 'slider,' uses a touch screen and doesn't have a Xenon flash. Oh, and it's $300-400 more expensive.CARRIERIf you pair the N82 w/ T-Mobile in The States, you can enjoy unlimited web usage and downloading. If you go w/ AT&T;, you'll pay as you go. Although AT&T; offers 3G in The States, the N82 doesn't carry US 3G frequency so save money and spend all the time on the web w/ T-Mobile.If you opt for PDA like a Blackberry with any carrier, you will have to pay an additional $25/mo to be able to access the Internet. Nokia's smartphones are more expensive to purchase because they don't come with service in The States, but they are cheaper to operate because they can be configured to us the Net w/o hefty, monthly PDA fees.This phone runs circles around almost anything you'll come in contact with. The best part (to me) is that it's feature-packed but stealth, tasteful, compact, sturdy and doesn't shout "trend follower".
Good phone, camera is excellent. Easy to use. Only bad thing is the weak battery.
I'm so happy with this cell phone, it's to easy use this cell phone like any other nokia, install programs, update the software,personalize it is fast, secure and easy.It has a great 5MP camera with the xenon flash that give you an excellent picture, the software is to fast, and it has others great accesories, like the connection WLAN that is very common find one to be connected on Internet, the GPS, bluetooth are others accessories very necessaries.I give it five gold stars+++++
Amazing phone, great camera, great music player, nice video player (i got some issuses with the videos format, but just do some research, best video format mpeg4 640x480 pxls, 800kbps, 25-30fps, audio acc 44100hz, 128kbps (thank me for the tip)).You dont need an ipod or an iphone, or a camera, this phone is all that and more.Im really happy to own one.XD
This cellphone has the best camera in nokia n series. The Flash Xenon is amazing. The price is really good for a Nserie. WIFI, CAMERA 5MP FLASH XENON, MEMORY EXPANDABLE TO 16GB, buy it is no perfect. The buttoms looks and feels very cheap xD.!  SkillBuy
this phone is wicked cool unlike the n95 that is clumsy big the n82 is sleek and sexy and the wifi works smoothly a with a thirdparty software i added it let me play avi movies that why i give it a 10 out of 10 you gotta get this phone
With $338, I have owned a 5 mega pixel camera phone which is so great. Everything works perfectly. The phone is very easy to use. It's system is pretty much the same like my old Nokia 3230. The key pad is small but I am not a text-lover so to me, it's not a big issue. If you are looking for an all in one phone, N82 from Amazon is really a bargain. Good luck
I recommend this phone over the K850i. Both phones compete, and both have a 5mp camera. The sony, however, is prone to breaking, records 30fps in QVGA (which is poor) and has no-tv out. It also comes with only a 500mb card. The Nokia N82 comes with a 2GB card, records 30fps in VGA (DVD quality) and otherwise functions better. It's a little creaky, a little light, and it feels more like a toy than a nice cell phone (unlike the Samsung innov8 which feels like a work of art in your hand, but costs twice as much). Overall, recommended.
I got what I was looking for and the product matched the description provided on the site.
The N82 is the best value for feature set you can ask for. It can do everything, even talk skype to China (over WiFi).  But in the end, with a heavy heart, I had to return it. The keys were too too small, it was just unbearable to use.
El vendedor cumplió con los plazos establecidos y con la entrega del producto esperado. El teléfono estaba adecuadamente desbloqueado y funciona bien fuera de USA.La única crítica: el tamaño de las teclas-
Nokia N75 Unlocked Smartphone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)
I have bought this Nokia Handset Recently after along gapBut Symbian is now aging Lady. I dont like the Software I think at the Same price i could have Bought TMobile G1 from ebay. and that could have nice Purchase
I owned this phone in the past and i loved it, so I bought it again from Amazon. The black N82 they(AMAZON) sale is the CHINEESE VERSION. ITS ALL PLASTIC AND DOSEN'T COMPARE TO THE REAL N82 MADE IN FINLAND. IT LOOKS AND FEELS CHEAP AND ITS NOT WORTH 320$.
I actually returned the phone.Camera not good when zooming.Could not set up outlook email.Crashed on me a few times.Not worth the $$I have always bought Nokia but I am not happy with the N series. N82 feels too cheap for the money you pay.  Camera poor.
1) I bought this N82 2 weeks ago. After 3 days I openened the box and try to set the Sim card and the card holder is broken... is a small aluminuim part, very difficult to put in the same place again.2) I Installed the soft Nokia suite, no friendly, I connect the unit trought USB cable and explore the unit with difficulty.. no friendly menus. many choices with no use..3) Next day, I was exploring my Nokia N82, learning for features and menus, and suddenly... FREEZZZZE!! Had to open the phone and take off the battery and turn it on.. ??? Why this happened?4)Yesterday I was with a friend and my cell felt down 1 meter in the carpet floor..then lost signal: Show a message: X Disconected! and freezed!! No way to turn it off!I open the phone, take out the battery, the sim card looks ok, and put another sim card and same thing. After 1 hour of fight, I coud get set the sim card again and show signal ..finally.5)Battery only last 1 day. Suddenly turn off, batery off!!6) Camera very Good, video good. There is NO 5 Megapixel, maybe the file size, but quality is not 5 Mp. Anyway is better than blackberry and motorola.7)Font size, very small, again, I hope they have the chance to choose font or size, I can not see font clear is too small..is for younger people, not for a 45 yo professional with glasses.8) I will return to use a Blackberry and give this unit to my 17 years old son to hear music.If you believe this will be a great deal, well is not. Do not buy it, maybe a bigger nokia will be better..
I was struggling whether or not to rate this 3 or 4 stars, based solely upon the context of when I bought it and now.  I bought it from Amazon almost a year ago, when the N96 was just being talked about.  Very satisfied with Amazon's price at the time and considering the only other option was an iPhone I decided this was a better deal (and no two-year contract).Pros:1. US 3G compatibility and wifi.  Wifi is definitely the faster option if you're at home, but it's nice to access data on the go.2. The camera, once you get used to it, takes good pictures.  Not as good as a digital camera, but pretty good all things considered.3. The storage capacity is excellent.4. Speakerphone and call quality is good, although I had to recently replace the earphone speaker, even though the phone isn't even a year old.5. Despite the earphone speaker, I've dropped the phone many times and at least the construction is durable.6. Standard headphone jack if you want to use this as a walkman and the playback is fine despite the awkward UI.Cons:1. No qwerty keyboard.  I thought I would be fine with the standard keyboard, but it gets annoying after a while with a lot of web surfing.  At the time it seemed standard for a consumer phone to not have a qwerty keyboard, so in that context I don't want to be too harsh (why the N96 didn't have one is a mystery).2. Due to recently replacing the earphone speaker I'm concerned about other 'quality' issues with the phone.  Nothing else is wrong, but it makes one wonder.3. 3G connectivity with At&t; is okay but not super fast.  This is partly the phones older technology and a result of all the iPhones in the Boston area that slow down the network.  My connection is faster the further I am from the downtown hub so I know its both.4. It's music menus are obnoxious, the playback of mp3s is fine, but the UI of the music player isn't great.  This phone is not a good replacement for a Zune or iPod.The N95 has a lot of other features not covered since I do not use them I decided not to comment on them.At this point with Nokia looking to release the N97 and Palm with their Pre, the Nokia N95 is looking more dated.  However, it will last for a while and at this lower price it might be a good option for someone looking for an all-in-one phone.
If you one of those people who likes high tech smartphone and willing to use these sweet gadget and all its features to its limit, then this is the right phone for you. Why do I choose this phone?1. It's Nokia2. Symbian OS3. 5 MP camera (one of the best camera phone to date) + 1 cam (front).4. Games, video, music, radio, internet browsing, Wi-Fi, you name it!5. 8 GB internal memory, that's more than enough for me.6. Good reception, and the speakerphones are loud and clear.7. It's slider phone...um its actually dual-slide. I loves slider phone.8. GPS is a great bonus. You need internet connection or data plan tho.9. Crisp screen display10. On sale when I bought it in gold box lighting deal.Why not 5 stars?1. The main issue for most people with this phone is the battery. Well, we need to give credit to Nokia by giving more juice on N95 8 GB battery after the original N95. But, still...this phone drains battery's power like.... leeches. So, be ready to buy xtra battery.2. It's not the sexiest thing, but I'll survive.3. No memory slot, who doesn't want xtra storage?4. No lens cover...it's Carl Zeiss optics for cryin out loud!5. It can be slow sometime. Especially out of the box. Update your firmware is recommended.I recommend to get this model instead Nokia N96, do some research before you choose the right smartphone for you. If you rather have qwerty keypad, Nokia E71 is the answer (you can't go wrong with E71, unless you demand superb camera). If you willing to wait a little bit longer and you happen to have xtra bucks in your pocket, and don't mind to spend at least twice the price from N95 8 GB, then N97 (get the white one...umm sweet  ^ ^) is hard to resist.
Since you're reading these reviews, you probably already know what these N95 phones can do. What I'm going to start off with is mention a couple of things that you would expect that this phone can do, but can't. However, even with the "can'ts", this baby still gets 5 stars!  First, you've probably seen the YouTube vids of this phone in action. If so, did you notice that it has an accelerometer -- kinda like the iPhone, where the image automatically rotates to adjust to the way your holding the phone, horizontally or vertically? Well, some versions of the N95 have this. This particular one does not. Still, it has an accelerometer. It can MANUALLY be set for horizontal or vertical viewing -- but it does not automatically. If you have a bit of patience and a little bit of hacking/programming skills, this feature can be added, but bottom line, it's not already there.  For the top 0'the line, "king of the hill" phone that this is, I wish it had a feature I've only seen on Samsung's Instinct. Let's say you're driving along and wondering where a nearby Walmart is. You pick up the Instinct, squeeze a button and say "Walmart". In about 6 seconds, a list appears of all nearby Walmarts, with phone numbers. Pick one and call, or press the "car" icon, and voice navigation kicks in. Seamless. Beautiful.  The N95 has a great GPS, but you just have to enter the place or address you're looking for... no big deal. I've also had it say "make a u-turn" or "turn right" just out of the blue, while driving -- probably 3 times over the many times I've used it... but that happened with my TomTom on occasion as well. Voice navigation is free for 6 months, then it's $10/mo thereafter if you wish to keep it.  It also has voice commands, so I can simply say "Joe" or whatever, and it will dial "Joe" for me.  There's a small learning curve for the texting and url entry, etc, using a T-9 keypad as opposed to a qwerty keyboard, but it's actually not that bad if this may be what's keeping you on the fence. Again with the "youtube", watch soem of the T9 speedtexting videos -- it's incredible how fast some of these people can type on a T9!  The web browser is fast, but I installed Skyfire and Opera mini. Just having the freedom to install other programs is a big PLUS in itself. You can purchase a program called "Coreplayer" that will play just about any video you can throw at it. Even without it, Skyfire will deliver up just about anything as well, and it's free.  If you google "N95 Applications Software", you'll see tons of stuff to choose from, and there's lot's of N95 forums if you really want to get deep into what all this phone can do.  Check "N95 Video Clips" or footage on youtube to see the quality (be sure to click "watch in high quality") videos that you can record, edit, and send straight to youtube from the phone. Yes, straight from the phone. These would be considered excellent for any video camera, but simply amazing for a cell phone. It takes great photos as well. I installed a program for $12 (I think), that allows you to take several photos of a landscape or whatever, and the program will stitch these into a panorama beautifully.  Oh, and the built in stereo speakers are a marvel themselves and I can also hook this directly to the TV to either play games or watch videos from the recorder with almost hi-def quality.  By the way, this thing even has a feature that allows you to make and recieve phone calls. Imagine that!  Yep, 5 stars...
I am a girl geek.  I have had my phone for about 1 week now.  I have had a wonderful time in downloading and upgrading my information into this phone.  I truly wanted the phone for the capabilities of making calls, having my music downloaded and the GPS function.  The camera feature is just an additional bonus which I will use, but not necessarily as much as the aforementioned features.I am still working on getting all of the function capabilities phased in slowly as needed.  I have ordered and received a case specifically made for this phone (protect your investment) and a LCD screen guard.I love this phone and I love having made a selection based on some of the reviews previously provided on this site.Thanks
this phone has everything. the only problem I have is that it's just too bulky
The phone is in really good condition. It does not have any problems like the ones others shared ex wobbly... Well, I heard that some problems will start in few months after, but now I am really satisfied with the phone. The camera from the phone is so convenient that I don't need to take my camera with me.The only problem I have is ...T-mobile. T-mobile's signal is not really good in some area so it will consume the battery fast. How bad is it? It only got one bar out of 6 bars or none. Sometimes I went to the area where there's no signal, I will just turn my phone to offline which will save my battery.After all, the main problem is T-mobile. I can use the battery for 3 days at least. Frankly, I am not a heavy user. I don't play games, music. Choose wisely if you want to have a music phone or game phone.
I think this is the best Nokia N series ever....if its not surpassed by the new N 97.If you are looking for a beautifull phone loaded with features and all that you can possibly think of in a average budget. This is the phone to get..much better that the Iphone in many ways. Besides its very reliable.We have 3 of these in the family and everyone just loves this model.I wont go in features as there are soo many reviews on it,but i can tell you it has capability for more features that you need.Very good buy and the right time to buy going by the current pricing
Great phone overall. Built more solid then N85. The only reason I changed it for N85 is  camera seems to be a little worse than N85 camera and also N95 is kind of on a bulky side...
The call quality is good. Speakers are amazing. Photo quality is good. It finds m wireless connection quickly.The screen resolution should have been better for watching youtube. The buttons are too small.
I've owned several cell phones, all nokia and this is the best one to date,so much so that if I have to change phones for some reason I want the same model.
I bought this phone for my daughter's 15th Birthday. It was all she asked for! All the features are Great. The Phone itself, the cameras (2 cameras), multipmedia sound, bluetooth, wifi, I honestly liked it so much that wanted one for myself. It was unlocked and we had no problems using the local simcard.
Pros: Size, color, US 3G, excellent reception, crystal clear calls, Nokia maps, Google maps (downloadable), bright large screen, large easy to use keypad, 5mp camera is excellent.Cons: Call volume could be a bit higher, so could MP3 playback volume. No card slot.I don't see where all the bad reviews for this phone come from. I've had mine for a month and haven't had a single problem. It's not slow, it never froze, never reboot, etc. I guess maybe update to the current firmware and you won't have those problems. Battery life is ok; maybe 2 days of making calls, using bluetooth, messaging, and a few pictures. The camera takes excellent pictures and video. If you are thinking about buying this phone and have second thoughts based on bad reviews, just go buy it and use your PC to update it to the current firmware. You won't be disappointed.
Overall, the phone is excellent!The best part for me is the big screen where you can easily read or see messages and photos and watch videos, search the internet and use the navigation system with great clarity. It gives you the option to select the Image Quality from a Small "MMS" size up to images of larger size that could be used for prints up to 11x14 inches. Same thing with the Video Quality, from MMS size to TV quality, with which you can also play the videos and images you have taken from your phone directly to the television.It's also amazing that you can play mp3's with a "surround" option. The phone has its own sound system, it seems like.What I dislike about it is that it uses the Nokia PC Suite to transfer files between the phone and PC. Nokia needs to develop a better software. PC Suite, to me, is very close to rocket science where everything is convoluted, especially when you're not familiar with the software.Nonetheless, Nokia N95 8 GB is an absolute must-have.
This is a great phone but there are certain qualities to it that may make it a hassle.First of the good things:attractivegreat screen qualitygreat pictures (w/ out zoom)lots of featuresmusic player w/ regular headphone jack, opposed to one strictly for cell phonesawesome speaker quality, especially for playing music(may have forgotten to mention some things)The bad:quality is crappy when you zoom w/ the camerabulkyslider is sensitive so you may answer calls when you don't mean tofreezes sometimesthats it! or at least all I can think ofBut overall this phone is great! no major problems yet. if you don't mind a little bulkyness then get it...
I was very excited about making my next Nokia N-Series purchase, and I purchased the N95. When it arrived, I started to enjoy the N95's great features (5MPX Carl Zeiss Optics), Music player..etc. The same day, I noticed it had about 5, and yes [5] dead pixels on the bottom screen. It wasn't really that noticeable, but once you activated the camera in a dark setting..it was visible.So I called up Amazon, and asked them about this issue, so they sent me a replacement device. When this replacement came in, I was very excited too, I kept on saying "Amazon is really great since they sent me a replacement at no charge", but then out of no where..this also had about [4] dead pixels. So after all of this, and paying a lot for this device, I got really upset, and asked Amazon to refund my money completely (which they did).I was not at all expecting any of these problems AT ALL from a Nokia Flagship phone..but I was very disappointed. So save your time and money, and don't purchase this N95-4..it's not worth it to pay this plus of a money and receive these annoying problems.
This phone is probably the only phone in the word that has been reviewed numerous times in numerous sites.  So, I will skip the review part.  It has great features and works very well.  It is a true workhorse.  Even though it doesn't bug me, the only downside is that it is slow at times.  Not a a big deal but wanted to point out some flaw.
This phone is very cumbersome and hard to use. It has great voice clarity and the speaker is good but that is about it.The GPS & Nokia maps do not work. I downloaded google maps but even that freezes. I get nothing on Nokia maps but a large picture of the earthMany apps that you can use on the Blackberry & Iphone are not available on this nokia phone.Yahoo mail DOES NOT work at all. cannot set up any email application and then when I access Yahoo Mail from the web, I get an error when opening any email message.Texting, writing email to someone is very frustrating with lack of qwerty keyboard. Forget about typing an email (if you can even access the email) more than one or two sentences unless you have at least 30minutres to fiddle with getting right letters and the procedures to get to your email.youtube videos are also horrible quality and freeze.Better to either wait for N97 or get a Blackberry Bold or Iphone. This phone is certainly not worth the $500 maybe $300 but nowhere near $500.This phone may have a nice form factor and look 'nice' but the applications & software are beyond horrible
I have never reviewed any item I have bought, but am so disgusted with this phone that I feel like I need to warn people about its quality.  The first phone I had of this kind literally started falling apart.  The center button fell off because it is just glued on.  I live in a humid climate that seems to make it not want to stick.  Also, many of the buttons on the phone work only when they want to.  My phone also randomly calls people in my phonebook.  I am now on my second phone because Motorola did honor the original warranty.  Apparently these problems are very common in this phone.  I am on my second one, and the same problems are starting to happen again.  This is a very good phone for about 2 months.  After that, it falls apart.  DO NOT BUY!!
I have been used this Z6 seen it just came out like last year. I bought the very first model and it work nice up to now. I upload tons of songs on it and it works just fine. I am a super careless person and not to mention, I dropped my phone on the hard surface for more than 10 times and it still works up to this very moment. I have no idea why people rate this phone 1 star because this is the longest lasting one that I ever have.
Unfortunately I own this POS!  I should not have fell into the trap but I did.  It randomly shuts off even with a full charge on the battery.  It also makes phone calls on its own to people in my phonebook.  This thing is possessed.  I have complained about it a couple of times and was basically told to deal with it or I could buy a new phone.  If I could rate it a zero I would.  BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY.
This phone has delivered as promised.  No quality problems, good reception both in the USA and abroad.  Good tools built in.  Only down side is that you can't plug in standard head phones for the MP3s or calls.
I am glad that I have had such good luck with this phone considering all of the other reviews. I have been using this phone for about 10 months. I have dropped it a few times on cement and it is still going strong. When I drop it it freezes, so I have to restarted.The thin plastic over the buttons is starting to wear off, and the silvery metal underneath is starting to show.The phone feels solid, and the slider is great. I would recommend this phone, but considering all of the other reviews, if I had seen them before I wouldn't have bought this phone.I have added pictures under the customer pics on the home page.
I bought two of these phones, one for me and one for my husband. They have good options for us, the camera and video are easy enough to use. But my husband's phone and mine are like day and night. His works fine. Mine is a dud. They were both purchased at the same time from the same place. Mine freezes up all the time and I have to shut the phone off to "reboot" it. Also I have problems with my answer keys and a few others. And it has ended my call at various times and without warning, just bloop and it's dead. I finally got so frustrated with it I went back to my older Nokia and my shiny new Nokia 2760 is sitting on the desk collecting dust. My husband's phone is still working fine but it does have a few key glitches too. To purchase this model is like playing Russian Roulette, you may get a good one or you may not.
This has to be the worst cell phone on the market!  It don't understand how Nokia can put out such a piece of garbage!  I just purchased one today and I've spent 2 hours of my day trying to figure out how to turn the volume up so that I can hear who I'm talking to.  The volume on this phone is very, very low.  The user manual says absolutely nothing about how to turn the volume up or down but it has lots of info on the extras like instant messaging and how to download wallpaper and such.  Who cares?!  I need information on the basic things.  And the menu on this phone?  It's a nightmare!  It's very confusing and makes no sense whatsoever.  It appears that an item is highlighted and when you press CHANGE, it's something totally different than what you selected!  A couple of times, the darn thing froze up while I was going through the mess of a menu!  I couldn't even back out or turn the phone off!  It was just frozen!  I'm taking this raggedy piece of trash right back to the store tomorrow and getting a refund!  I don't care if you are on a budget, avoid this travesty of a phone!  This bloody mess should be taken off the market right away!  Nokia should be ashamed of themselves.
it's a gift for my wife and she love it. it's small, practical and easy to manage. the technology is 3G and is very light. for a special gift to a special person this is the best.
I really appreciate your interest in solving my problem with the recent purchase of this cell phone. When I made this purchase, I asked for an unlocked one. You sent me a locked one. When I turn on the cell it says on the screen "Restricted phone. Enter a code". I'd be very happy if you could help me solve this problem. Thanks.
This is my absolute favorite! It is slim and light, fits in any pocket (jacket or jeans), and the battery is enough for a week (if you don't talk all the time, naturally).However, I use it mainly to take calls and I don't use any functions apart from calling and txt messages. It allegedly has a radio and camera but I have never tried to use either and I don't think I ever will. You can browse the internet with it but although the screen is fairly big and bright I would not recommend it too seriously unless you need a weather forecast or currency exchange rates. It does have games as well but if you're choosing your mobile to play games, how 'bout getting a life?Very decent materials, after three months of using not a trace of wear and tear. Nokia software is a league of its own but then if you had one Nokia you move on to the next and you don't look at others. And you don't need anyone trying to convince you how good it is. I have always asked for the cheapest Nokia there was and I have never complained.This is a phone for adults - you won't impress anyone with it. If you think your sex appeal needs some accessorizing, you may not find this one your perfect choice. In other words - if you need a phone, it is the perfect choice. If you need a lot of other stuff as well, it probably is not.
This is a great phone. Reception is very good. The screen is great, and it is easy to see in direct sun. It is small and light and the buttons are easy to use. The battery lasts for nearly a week.
This is a great little phone for the price.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish, lightweight cell phone with basic capabilities (I only use it for sms and calls) and who want great battery life to boot.Pros:1. light weight2. small enough (and slim enough) to fit comfortably in your pocket without creating a bulge3. the menu is very easy to use and intuitive4. fantastic battery life (seems to last forever)5. comes with free handsfree unit (plugs into side of phone)Cons:1. Not very loud earpiece (can be a little tough to hear when you're in a loud environment)2. when clicking through the menus at a rapid pace, I notice that I sometimes have to slow down and wait for the phone to react to the selection I've made (the lag isn't really bad, but it can be a little annoying)
What I like about the phone: It is very slim and lightweight and doesn't make a large bulge in my pocket like my last phone.  I sometimes forget that it's even in my pocket.  The design is nice and stylish too.What I don't like about the phone: The phone is slow when navigating thru menus.  It also creates a long (1 second) tone whenever the first button is pushed when making a call or when already in a call.  I think this is due to the same reason that makes it slow to navigate.  It's like it gets hung up on a command for a short time.  It could use a faster processor or whatever it is that cell phones use.  It's more annoying than anything, and cuts out the audio when the 1 second tone is sounding.  i actually sent back the first one beacuse of this, but the replacement still did the same thing.The phone is simple and just does the basics.  The screen is color, but not as high resolution as some fancier phones.  But that's all I need right now so it works ok for me.  I haven't had any problems with volume like other reviewers, it's loud enough for me.
This phone works just like it says it does.  It's a good, simple, reliable phone with minimal bells and whistles.  The battery lasts, the interface is quick and intuitive, and it's well designed hardware.The only issue I've noticed so far is that the volume control is difficult to find.  Aside from this, it's been great.  Once I found it, it's been no problem.
This little phone is good at being a phone.  You need to figure out how to control the volume during calls (see manual), and then the volume and audio quality is very good.  The camera is very basic but works well enough.  The device is very thin and light yet has a great battery life.
the nokia 2630 is super. the tecnology is 3G, is practical, very light and my friends love it. it's the best thing i purchase in a long, long time. 1 to 10 i give 100.
This was a great phone for someone who just wants a plain phone to have w/o all the bells and whistles.  However, the buttons are small, and the volume could be louder, especially for older people, as myself.Overall thou, Nokia is a great company, just wish the buttons could've been a bit bigger, and the volume control.  Actual screen is really small too!  Again, great phone for a young kid, getting their first phone, the one where the kids can call up just to tell Mom where they're at!And Thank You Amazon for being such a great company!
I bought this unlocked phone because finding a wired headset for my 2610 is now near impossible and AT&T; says I must wait a year+ to get a replacement from them.  Quality of calls was average using the phone by itself or with a wire headset.  Once I paired this phone with a Plantronics bluetooth headset, it's true strength showed through.  Great quality calls in both directions.  People I talk with say it does not sound like I am on a cell phone.
If you are in the market for a "keep it simple" cell phone, the Nokia 2630 is an excellent choice. The "candy bar" slim and sleek design is very user friendly, and after a couple weeks of putting the phone through basic usage,IMO,you can not go wrong with purchasing the Nokia 2630. Amazon.com has a great price on it, too.
Now I kick myself for not paying attention to one of previous reviews. This phone is not usable.I had several other Nokia phones. Most of them are reliable. That was the main reason I decided to get another one. However this 2630 surprised me. I can't hear anyone talking over phone. Volume is extremely low if speaker off. I had to turn speaker on and put the phone next to my ear to have any conversation. This is already after I turned volume to maximum. Bluetooth volume is OK but it drops call from time to time, about every 5-10 minutes in my case.Other than volume, the phone looks pretty sleek and camera resolution is not great but ok. Given this phone can not perform even basic functions, I'd definitely recommend against this phone.Pros:- Sleek look, light-weightCons:- Can't make phone calls without speaker on- Bluetooth drops connections all the time
This work okay with AT&T; PAYG service.  The battery life is not as good as my old Nokia 6010, but I don't talk more than an hour and a half on rare occasions.  The Nokia 2630 did freeze up on me one time after I talked for an hour and half and the phone had the keyguard turned on.  I had to remove the battery to reboot it.  The number keys are little too close together and I have mistyped a few numbers.  I'm having problems using the web service, when I entered a url address into the Goto web address text field, it give me a Stop! error and said I need to subscribe to packet data first.  I was able to go to web some websites on my old phone.  The phone is really thin, about half of the 6010, and there is not rubber cover over the headphone, service port, and charger port on the side of phone, definitely not waterproof.  The audio is very clear and it gets good receptions.  Menu navigation is a bit tedious, but you can change the navigation keys around and change the Menu to List mode, instead of Grid.
All I want in a phone is that it makes calls that it can text, and that it have bluetooth. I take about two pictures a year, so the camera isn't very important to me. I liked that this was little and feel it's a little fragile so I have to be careful, but I really don't like the flip phones. I was really glad to know about the shortcut to make a button to raise & lower the volume. Over all it's a fine phone. I am happy with it.
nokia 2630 is good basic phone, with limited features and the devices is thin. I like the style of this model and great battery life
The cellphone it self is in good condition , but it was supposed to be unlocked and it was not, I had to pay extra money to get it unlocked, also I was not able to find a place in Amazon where I can tell this to the seller until now and it is too late to ask for my money, even so, I would have to pay a new shipping which I shouldn't since I didn't get the expected produce since the beggining, it is really desapointing.
Smart, friendly, allways with the Nokia Menu and nices tones, good price, received in few days with 2 amazon shipping.
Nice and convenient phone. Since it's unlocked, works with our family plan.Good price too!
Only use for few months the screen doesn't display at all . And I was told it is an oversea product can't get warranty in US.Don't buy it any more.
While most of the official online reviews I read about the phone are positive, if you look carefully, you will find hundreds of user comments on various sites about people who have the same problem - the phone keeps shutting itself off in the middle of calls, web browsing, or any other activity.  I had the phone for 1 year and it worked perfectly.  Literally one week after the 1-year manufacturer's warranty expired, everything started going wrong.  I tried to resolve this with my carrier, T-Mobile, who sold me the phone and they refuse to do anything since it is beyond the 1-year warranty period.  The phone is hardly usable.  I cannot make phone calls, view email, or browse the web without the phone freezing and/or turning itself off.  I purchased a new battery and that did not help either.  If you get a Dash that works, it will work well.  If you are unlucky and get one that is a "lemon", then you will be very disappointed.
All the reviews state what a wonderful phone the Dash is, but there are some problems it has.1. I'm not sure if this is common, but it the silver faceplate on mine came off rather easily. I've fixed it with superglue, but still a possible manufacturer problem.2. The Jogger Bar (a touch sensitive bar on the side of the phone) is nearly invisible to those who didn't know it existed in the first place. This feature can be turned off and that is what I did once I realized how.3. With the text messaging a slip of fingers can cause the type to turn in to Chinese lettering. This happened to me and I spent hours trying to figure out how to fix it the first day I got it. For those of you that have friends and family with this phone and this problem should choose to pop up, all you do is press alt then cap (both in the lower left corner of the keyboard). That changes it back to English or what ever language is set to the device.That's it for the problems, but there are some really nice features I enjoy.1. Texting is set up like chat where you can view previous messages to and from the same person. It really helps after you get in to conversations with 4 or 5 people at a time.2. The screen is very easy to see even outside during the day.3. The back is rubberized and it doesn't slide easily off of dashboards.These are just a few of the Pros and Cons of the HTC Dash.
My 1st smartphone. I was expecting wonders. Having read all possible reviews I bought right away for a total of "huge" $5 including shipping 1 new battery + 1 car charger + 1 wall charger on [...]. One less problem.The phone itself works perfectly well but:1. It has less feachures then any regular fiftydollar phone. For example: no timer, or NORMAL alarm (the one installed is just ridiculous), or a stopwatch, or basic games, no notes at all etc.2. Digits are amazingly small and completely invisible even for my petite fingers and perfect eyes.3. All the window's features are just not there. All you have is just indications that they are supposed to be there. I presume I have to spend forever browsing for unknown downloads and to pay fortune to have Windows Word and Excel.4. Loudspeakers are not of the best quality. And many other small inconveniences which could have been easily avoided by the manufactuter.As a regular phone it works well if you get used to ajusting the volume on the side all the time.
I purchased the Motorola U6 Pebl to replace the one I had damaged awhile back.  But, before ordering this I had been given a replacement from my carrier. The replacement was a simple LG silver flip phone. Sorry to say it did not hold a candle to the PEBL. The feel of the PEBL just seems to fit naturally in the palm of my hand and is small and accurrate.  I really love this phone and the features it comes with. Bluetooth, photo, easy texting features. This is truly the best phone I believe Motorola has developed. True love........
This is a very basic phone with no camera and no bluetooth capability.  That would have been fine for me except that this is also not a very rugged phone.  I myself have gone through about three of these over the last five years.  My kids have gone through even more.The reception and sound and ability to store small bits of music is good.  It has always worked well in international travel.  I have the Motorola software to install all this stuff onto the phone.  These are the reasons that I give it two stars.Last year, I finally switched over to an LG CU515 phone, which has a camera and bluetooth, but very limited capability of transferring the photos to a computer.  OK so far.My son's V180 phone broke again recently  - it stopped sensing the battery level correctly and would not charge.  And then, when I tried to fix it, the screen went black (or dark blue).The most common killer of this phone is when the display stops working, usually manifest as just a solid dark blue nothing.I am staring at a bag full of some NINE, count 'em NINE dead V180 cellphones - and these don't include the four or five that my oldest daughter have managed to destroy.  Almost all of these have bad display screens.  Several have vibrators that stopped vibrating, probably the second most common defect.  Not charging or sensing the battery has happened at least once before also, so this is not unusual.I have used this bag of parts to try to fix these problems by using parts from this bag of dead phones.  I succeeded today, as I took a previously  malfunctioning phone from my son, one where the vibrator had quit but where the display was still functioning, and took out its electronics board and put it in his current phone with the bad battery charging.Fixing a dead display, however, is almost always hopeless with the V180, and I have never succeeded except briefly.  Today it dawned on me that the problem is probably not with either the color LCD screen or with the display driver in the electronic board that is the heart of the cellphone.  No, the problem is almost certainly in the plastic connector BETWEEN the electronic board in the body of the cellphone and the LCD screen.  The plastic connector contains the multiple thin wires that drive the LCD screen.  And it has to flex each time you open and close this clamshell cellphone - flex without breaking the wires.  The phone vibrator is glued and soldered onto this plastic sheet wire connector on the LCD cover side of the phone just beyond the hinge of the cover.So the whole wire connection between the body with the electronic board and the cover lid with the LCD screen and vibrator gets stressed more than it needs to be.  The weak point is probably that the vibrator is glued right on top of the connector wires.  Each time the cellphone is opened or closed, the tiny wires in the connector get flexed - in time, microscopic cracks probably build up.  Each time the vibrator fires off for a phone call, the stressed points probably get vibrated wider.I wish these phones were better - I don't think Motorola makes them anymore, so I'm not sure where these phones are coming from, especially when they are supposed to be "new".
I also called to verify if the phone was the U.S. version after reading the review that stated it came with a European charger.  The customer service person at Amazon assured me it came with a U.S. charger.  However, when I received the phone, it came with the European charger.  The phone is also European, words are not spelled in the American way and the phone displays military time.  This is not a big deal to me, but I would have preferred a U.S. phone.  I ordered a new charger and the phone works great.  This is also the first bad experience I've ever had with Amazon.
Due to another reviewer stating they had received a European model, I called in first to verify that this was the US version and was assured that it was. However, when it arrived, it contained a European charger. The scary part was that the Motorola sticker on the box actually stated "euro simple pkg". You'd think that this would have caught someone's attention.In addition, after working with both the phone specialists (plural) and customer support, Amazon was reluctant to return my money for these phones. Their site states that cell phones are only eligible for replacement and a refund option is not provided. The phone specialists apologized and emailed me a return RMA and UPS sticker. I promptly returned the phones, both the original and the replacement. I received email confirmation of receipt of both returns. Both emails, however, stated that no monies would be refunded due to replacements sent. There was no second replacement/third phone involved. They now have the phones and were stating it would be 3 to 4 weeks for the refund to be researched. Finally, after contacting a supervisor, my refund was processed.On the upside, I placed another order for the silver razr v3 and it was the correct version. It arrived promptly and worked great out of the box.Word to the wise!
Got the phone.  The phone seems okay but I couldn't charge the battery to find out. The charger has European plugs and won't work without adapter. No way for Amazon to send new charger so you have to buy one or wait weeks for refund or new phone.  This is the first negative review I have ever posted for Amazon product.
I have just received it, and I am very upset. Half of the front and half of the back are Blue, the bottom part of the front and the bottom part of the back are VIOLET. Probably this has been assembled using parts of 2 different phones. Very very upsetting, and awfully looking.
I received a US phone, as promised. BUT, it is not new, as promised. It is several years older than the current model. It has the AT&T; logo on the outside and Cingular software on the inside. My guess is that it a refurb.I wanted a RAZR V3 because I like them. I have two before this one. This phone is older than either of the phones that I had. I wanted an unlocked phone to take with me to Europe.Amazon sold this phone from their own inventory. It was not sold by an outside supplier. Shame, Amazon.BEWARE
Just got the telephone, and not working!I have warranty, try to contact but 2nd day nobody responded!
Phone was supposedly new. Got no more than a few bars of signal strength out of the box, then with in a week or two, quit working completely.  No bars, could not receive or make call.  Seller did not responde to email.  Made no acknowledgement whatsoever.  Save yourself the grief and money and shop else where!
This was a replacement for a lost phone. I love the Razr V3 it's compact, feels good in my hand has all the features I need and is easy to operate for someone who's a techno-phobe.
I ordered this as a replacement and haven't been disappointed.  Phone was quickly shipped amd arrived in great condition.  Set-up was very simple; install battery (it charged quickly), inserted SIM, turn phone on and it worked perfectly.
The advertisement clearly states this is the US version, however, its an eastern european version.  I also believe this product has been refurbished because the casing color does not match ( two shades of blue ), and the bezel on the front fell off after a few weeks of light use.  Never again.  Very disappointed.
Sent a used phone that had a different color back on it where the battery is located.  Also had logo's on the screen page and an older charger.  Was not a new phone.  This was the second phone we received as the first one was an AT&T; phone and had no ring tones to chose from. The first exchange went well but when shipped a second rate phone the 2nd time we were mad and very frustrated.  The phone won't hold a battery charge and nothing but problems.
I recently had a 13 month old AT&T; phone break on me. I went to the carrier and was told too bad out of warranty. So before having to pay over 200.00 for a new phone I looked around and found this razr v3. It came ready to move sim card and make calls. While the packaging says new I have my doubts. It didnt look brand new coming out of the box. But had stickers and such so what the heck. We couldnt be happier for 2 reasons. The price and now no contract when it expires next year. Plus my wife thinks it is one of the best phones she has ever had. Its a cingular branded phone (sign of age) (older model). but the razr is a solid phone and has a very large user base. I reccomend this phone
I sent back two of these hoping to get the right phone but instead ending up with two refurbished Cingular phones from Italy.  (Both phones had the now defunct Cingular logo on them and despite changing the language settings certain menus still appeared in Italian.)If you can find a new Motorola V3 at best buy or the like, get it there.  As a former owner of a genuine US version, I can say it really is a great phone for the money.I am a HUGE Amazon fan and have been shopping with them regularly for over 5 years.  This has been my only bad experience with them so I'm confident this product is/was just labeled incorrectly in their system.  Customer service was prompt and polite when returning both shipments and because of that experience I can still feel confident shopping here.
The Item a Motorola Razr3, was quickly despatched to my address in the USA. when i received it in the Caribbean about 3 weeks after, i did not use it for another 2 weeks, I found the following problems, there was a message of Invalid Battery, the item ran hot, and the colour was not the metallic blue advertised. I have spoken to both Motorola and the seller and I have returned it for an extra $5.00us for a replacement.. Im looking forward to receiving. I truly love these Phones. Overall I was happy with the service
Great customer service and thats important when ordering over the internet.  Make sure to verify that it is a US version, otherwise great website
I am wonderfully happy with this phone.  It arrived in perfect shape.  I put my sim card in and it immediately worked.The only issue, albeit a small one, is that, because I didn't purchase it from my service provider (Centennial) I can't download any ring tones or anything like that. (By the way, any help on that would be appreciated).  I'm very glad that I made this purchase.  It's the first cell phone that I've been happy with.
The phone meets all of my needs. Decent camera, easy to operate, good volume and it works well with our car's handsfree bluetooth system. Unlocked phones don't tie me to a specific carrier and contract.
Shipped and arrived very quickly.  Working great with T-Mobile prepaid SIM card, one of the most economical way to carry a cell phone if you do not use alot of minutes every month.
I'm really happy with this entire transaction.  The price on the phone was excellent.  I received the phone within a matter of days after placing my order!  GREAT SERVICE AND NO HASSLES!
i boucht this item, for my grandfather, an he's so glad with the cellphone. i think so that the price of this is very expensive, and the ship either,  and the seller is so slowly, clumsy to ship. but thanks to UPS arrived so quickly
I wanted a phone that had good battery life, a reasonable form factor and was dependable; I have a camera and mp3 player, so I don't need them on my phone as well. My previous phone was a terrific Sony Ericsson W810, but lost the battle with the washing machine...The unlocked Motorola V197 set up with no problems with my ATT sim card and connected easily with Motorola Bluetooth. I have had no problems and the battery life is very, very good, as is the reception. If you want a phone that is simply a phone, I can highly recommend this one.
I bought this unlocked Motorola V197 cell phone in conjunction with a Motorola Bluetooth hands free visor clip, for my driving.  They work great individually and together. After examining my own needs and reading the reviews of others, I took a chance on this phone.  Reviews indicated it had a long battery life, good reception and initialized easily with a Cingular/AT&T; SIM card.  Yeah!  Set up was easy.  (Thank you!) Reception is surprisingly better than my old phone, a big plus. The speaker feature of this phone was required and the hands free function of a Bluetooth seemed like a nice bonus.  The Bluetooth has turned out better than expected.  It's easy to use with good transmission and reception.  It was a good choice for me.  Amazon has always been great.  Their secondary sales vendors have also proven to be consistently superb.  Thanks Amazon.
No it doesn't have a camera. I'll use a real camera if I want to take a picture. What is more important to me is that it is a good quality phone, with great reception and sound.  Also it has a voice call feature that's easy to access and actually recognizes my voice and calls the number that I intended (unlike my Razr which always seems to have problems with this feature).  Thus I've actually backward upgraded to this phone.  Oh and it also has bluetooth, speakerphone, and mp3 ringtones capability, added plusses!  Want a good basic easy to use phone with no complaints?  Then get this.  Got mine used, and unlocked, off of ebay (unbelievable price too, half of what you see here) and I'm VERY happy with it.
I needed a cheap, basic cell phone to replace the recently-deceased free phone I got when I signed up for Cingular (now AT&T;) four years ago. After reading some of the scathing reviews of unlocked cell phones here on Amazon, I was completely confused and wary, but decided to go ahead and get this phone. I'm glad I did, because it's turned out to be a perfectly acceptable brand-new and unlocked cell phone.  The battery lasts many days without recharging,  the calls are clear, and the manual was in English.The phone was sold and shipped by Amazon. The bad reviews on unlocked cell phones seem to be tied to third-party sellers who import phones of dubioius origins.  This is not one of those phones.
I ordered this phone just as a back-up to my current smartphone but I liked it so much that I used it as my primary phone for a few days. Size is nice and compact, fits well into any pocket. The battery life is phenomenal and that is expected because its a 1000+ mAh for a very basic phone. The features are decent and the bluetooth pairs very well with my external bluetooth devices such as the Motorola speakerphone in my car. Menu and options are basic and quite easy to use. Screen resolution is so-so but then what do you expect from a phone at this price. Overall, even though I went back to my smartphone a few days later (only because of my dependency on its features) I highly recommend this phone to those who need only voice + text. This is an excellent device and I will be more than happy to use it again if I ever need a back-up phone or if I go out on one of those rough outdoor adventures.
wanted to replace my V551 with a phone without a new contract.this is cheap and is working so far(3 months).. and also out of country on a different SIM card. happy with it. I am not a power user and the features are adequate for my routine usage.Cons: no video recorder..
Pros1)It worked as expected for T-Mobile(Unlocked)2)Small & easy to handle3)Lot of talk time for single charge4)simple for just talk,voicemail & textingCons1)Frame is not durable2)Speaker phone only two star. Not clear
This item came in an appropriate box with a new phone, new house charger,and a new owner's book(in english)......and new looking battery.The folk's in my local AT&T; store told me that I had purchased the best "basic-use" phone available....I was only in the store to"buy minutes".
After endless hours with AT&T; after my phone died, I purchased this replacement cell phone.  Next time one of my plan phones die, I'm just going to buy one of these and save myself the aggravation.  Speaker phone is nifty. I want a phone to call someone, not to play games, take picture, text, or surf the net. This phone works great.
Very basic phone. It only holds about 60 text messages and doesn't have a camera. However, I bought it to replace a very damaged Nokia and it works just fine, is well built, and has the few features I need (alarm clock, calculator, etc).
My Nokia bit the dust and I didn't want to get another one tied into a carrier so this one seemed to be what I needed. The "Moto" is easy to use, has good reception and for those who want the 'net on their phones this one gives you that capability. Battery life is more than adequate for my use since I turn it off at night. If you need a phone that doesn't make coffee this is the one for you.
Good batterie life,basic no picture messages,good reception.I have an ipod ,I did not care for playing music in my phone.
This phone is one of the best I have ever had. Reception is great, Ring tones can be heard, good battery life and blue tooth that works. Speaker phone is a little weak on volume. Setting up the web sessions was a bit of a problem but with a few website visits and phone calls I got it all working. The manual is not that greatest for helping in setting up the phone. Overall it is a great phone and it is wonderful, having a unlocked phone, where content is not controlled by the service provider. International travel with my phone will be much easier and cheaper.
Put my AT&T; Sim in, powered up and that was it.  Better signal than my expensive Tilt and friends iPhone.  No whistles or bells but a real phone!
I was delighted with the phone for about 6 weeks. Then the screen began to develop a V-shaped dark area in the middle of it. It is almost useless now, and without a warranty, I suppose I am just out of luck.
I used this phone in France during my recent travel there and never had any problems. I bought a local sim card (SFR la carte) and it worked just fine. Although I didn't use many of the features this phone offers I would recommend it without any reservation.
I bought this phone for my dad to use overseas. He already had a sim card and he wasn't interested in any phone with any fancy bells and whistles. This phone was perfect. he took the phone, put his sim card in it and was back in business.
Living in a rural area with limited coverage, and being retired as well, has changed how I use my cellular phone and how often I use it. Knowing that the closest cell is about 4 miles away and signal strength in my residence is virtually nonexistent has reduced my dependence on mobile communications. I do like good audio quality and adequate signal strength away from home, and the V197 is capable of both. A week without recharging, and the ability to charge from one of my laptop's USB ports are nice bonuses (I have docking ports for the laptop on both the SUV and touring motorcycle). My netbook does my messaging, my Nikon camera and Samsung video recorder take care of pictures, so all I really need is a dependable cellphone, and the V197 is a more-than-adequate performer.
I was skeptical when I ordered this phone. Almost seemed to good to be true, but I was pleasantly surprised. So much so that I ordered three more. One for my wife and two as gifts for this Christmas. All four phones arrived new, in a factory sealed Motorola box, as advertised. This phone feels solid, is well built and accepted an AT&T; SIM card without any problems. The new Motorola Bluetooth (H715), also ordered from Amazon, connected without any problems and the sound quality is very good. The battery life is good, a little shorter when using bluetooth, but still good. The volume is more than adequate, considering I am tone deaf. As other reviews have mentioned, the ONLY thing lacking is the speaker phone. It works, you can hear the other person but the speaker seems underpowered. It is still usable, but won't be your first choice. One of the things I like is NO antenna stub, considering it is a flip model. It fits well on a belt and is easily used with one hand. If you have kids and want them to have a phone but don't want to take out a second mortgage to buy it, this is the ticket.The other benefit of this phone is traveling. Being a quad band, you can take it almost anyplace in the world, buy a prepaid sim card at your destination country and you will save a fortune in roaming fees. Additionally, the cost of making and receiving calls, minute for minute will be measured in pennies, not dollars.Now, if you are wanting to use your cell phone to track the space shuttle, take photos, figure out Einsteins theory of relativity, video conference with someone in Siberia, make a fashion statement or listen to music all day long, you won't be happy with this phone. However, if you want to make quality calls, receive quality calls (with or without bluetooth), send and receive text messages, and do other basic things all mobile phones do, you will be very happy with this phone, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE ($42.99). I have had mobile phones since they began making them back in the late 1980's and for an unlocked phone with bluetooth capability, dollar for dollar, I don't think you can find anything better.
This is a great phone for the price.  I just popped my SIM card in the slot and everything went well.  I haven't tried it overseas yet, but it has great reception in my area of NW Alabama.  I have tried two other phones that did not pick up the AT&T; cell signals nearly as well as this phone.  It doesn't have a camera, but I didn't care to have one.  I just wanted a quad band phone with great reception and this phone fit the bill.
Needed a world band phone for a trip around the world via Singapore. That meant four GSM bands and easy change out of SIM cards. The phone always found a service where radio waves could penetrate. Reliable use and long battery life, 120/240 VAC charger.Less expensive and less hassle than renting a phone. Works at home with home SIM card for T-Mobile.Used it for simple meeting planning and possible changes to airline plans. Didn't need something always stuck in my ear, have a good camera, don't play games or music with a phone, prefer laptop for typing and browsing. Bought phone tools app, didn't use it.
I bought the phone in US and took it to India for a short visit.  Used a SIM card in India, and the phone was working fine.  It has all the features that are useful in India, and I believe this phone can be as useful in any other country.  This is truely  a global phone and Motorola should focus on making such high quality phones with the kind of pricing that customers can value. Excellent product, a good phone.
I chose this phone because I was looking for an inexpensive unit with Bluetooth that would work on the ATT network and let me preserve my current plan while I consider options for future phones (am not ready to commit to an iphone and monthly additional charges at this point). I found the Motorola on the list for most popular and thought the price was just right. Am very pleased with the phone, and my only caveat is that the menu layout reverses the left-right order I have been used to on my previous phones (mostly Nokia). But this is a minor irritant. Otherwise - an excellent option, and a lot better than paying for an extended warranty to one of the carriers!
I bought this unlocked phone so I can use it here in the states and on my trip abroad. I just replaced the sim card and Im set. It did not dissapoint me. The signal is very strong, the phone features are very functional. The screen display are good and the phone size is just right. The phone is not flashy like the new models of phones out in the market now, but this is what I just needed in my trip abroad (Asia). I dont want "snatchers" and pickpocketers eyeing my only means of communication while im abroad. This phone is not their type, lol. For the price, this is a very good phone.
This is a good basic phone for calls & text messages. It's an intuitive device, so you can get going right away. I needed an unlocked GSM phone for an international trip, & it worked great with a SIM card from China Mobile.
We buy minutes when necessary. This is a practical solution to seldom used but a safety comfort when traveling or separated by appointments or shopping. My wife uses the phone with ease and confidence. Me too.
i received this product within a week of shippment.  i left for Africa a few days later and have used the phone several times without flaws.  it is a great phone and i have no complaints at all about it.
Excellent phone. Speaker is loud enough and sound quality is great. Excellent value and price. Battery life is rather good. Reception is also very good. This phone is rather robust, which is a good thing in Iraq.
I purchased this phone to use as a GSM phone in England and France and it performed perfectly. Unfortunately, it got stolen toward the end of the trip.
When I took the phone to Poland, I was able to buy a GSM simm card for the equivalent of less than 2 dollars and had service for the month.  I bought more service but it was lost when service ended at the end of the month.  When & if I go back to Poland or another country I should be able to buy another card. (Motorola V197 Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM and Bluetooth--International Version (Charcoal) )
Received in original box, snap the SIM card and called mamma. Very good phone, excellent battery life. I need a phone, not a gadget.
Bought this unlocked phone to use with a Go-Sim card on an international trip.  They worked great together! I was able to keep in touch with family for minnimal outlay and costs abroad.  My husband will use it next month on a trip to Thailand and my son & daughter-in-law will use it when they go to Japan.  I am very pleased with my purchase!
I was impressed with this phone. It is sleek, well built, and the price is really unbelievable. However, every four days the phone must be charged. A single charge should last longer. If the battery life is extended, then it will be an exceptional handset.
Purchased phone for overseas use. Worked great in portugal purchased local phone card when i arrived at airport. Sound was clear and reception was always good practically every were i went. Battery life was also good. Basicaly charged the phone every third day for light to average use.If you are looking for non expensive phone for comunicating without all the bells and whistles this is it.
If you want a camera-phone, look elsewhere. This phone was designed to be just a phone, and it does exactly what it's supposed to do.I have been a Motorola user for years because of three things: (1) their phones are reliable, (2) they have great sound quality, and (3) I like their intuitive menus. I bought this and the Razr V9x at the same time. I really wanted to love the Razr and appreciated it in many ways, but this phone beat it hands down on sound quality. Besides, the Razr is heavy, hot, and has shorter battery life.If you want to travel to Europe and use a local sim-card, this phone is the perfect choice: quad-band, unlocked, light weight, blue tooth, user-friendly menu and inexpensive. I rounded out my purchase by getting a car charger from Zenith Mobile for $2.88 and a sandwich carrying case from Cell Phone Shop for 4.59.
This phone served us very well during a recent trip to Africa and Europe. Just pop in a simm card for the country you're in(we used a Vodaphone simm for all of the Europe portion), add some minutes and voila!. This came in really handy in Africa. The Motorola V197 is a good, sturdy, basic phone. No camera, etc... but it held a charge well, and never failed us. New in carton as advertised. Very pleased with our purchase. Now we can go anywhere!
I was preparing for my European vacation and from past experience, I knew that it'd be a lot easier to have a phone that I could use in Europe and just buy local prepaid phone cards to avoid the roaming charges.  I found the same unlocked phone on another site for a lot more money.  I was sure that I could get it elsewhere for much cheaper, and for sure, I found it here on Amazon!  The phone arrived in great condition.  It's very simple, and only comes with a charger, but that's all I need.  I needed a small phone that I could make emergency calls or receive text messages from my friends, and this served the purpose very well.  Thanks for having this phone available for such an affordable price!  It worked well for me in different European countries with less headache and problems than having my regular T-Mobile cell phone with me.
I bought two of these phones to use in Europe and they worked perfectly.  When we arrived I bought a local SIM card, put it in and then refreshed it as needed.  Better than renting.  You could buy an inexpensive phone wherever you are but this unlocked phone is a better, more cost effective solution in the long run.
It is a simple quad band, good for use overseas.  I use a CDMA here in the US so I buy this when I travel overseas.
I was looking for a basic cell phone to send with my daughter to Germany and after a good bit of searching I landed on the V197.  It has all of the standard features and can be purchased for a very reasonable price.  I paid around $50.  I've never been disappointed with Amazon and buy here with confidence.  If you are looking for a basic Quad Band GSM cell phone you won't be disappointed with this model.
This Motorola V197 satisfies the need of a traveler to any part of the world. Clear reception and good battery life + bluetooth.
I was using an AT&T; (formerly Cingular) Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) phone until my little nephew murdered it by dropping it on a tile floor from high-chair height.  I wanted to get the same service (don't need a monthly plan) and I was looking at the phones available on the AT&T; site, but I wasn't really impressed with the phones there (the lower-priced ones didn't seem to have much actual phone time before recharging was needed).  So I checked Amazon and came across this one.I read all the reviews and was impressed by the comments.  I read the product description and the phone seemed to meet my needs.  But the question was: would a PAYG SIM card work on this one?  I knew that if I had a phone with a monthly AT&T; plan it would work on this phone, but info about PAYG SIMS didn't make it clear if they would also work.  I asked around on various forums, and folks said that it would.  I called AT&T; and got a foreign tech rep who talked at cross-purposes and was no help.  So I decided to take a chance and purchase this phone.  Joy of joys, the SIM card fit, the network was recognized and I've been able to make and receive calls, with my charges showing exactly as they should.  The only problem that I had was that my address book did not transfer over (must have been stored on the actual phone itself rather than the PAYG SIM card on my old phone), but that can be reconstructed.  The Motorola V197 gives its user the option of storing the address book on either the SIM or the phone.  If it's stored on the phone, then the user is also able to take advantage of voice-activated dialing, which is a nice feature, and a lot more information about the contact can be stored rather than just name and phone number.I haven't tested out all of its features, but one that I really like is the fact that it has a volume-control button the outside of the phone, so volume changes can be made while talking without pulling the phone away to make the adjustment.  There is no camera, which I sort of miss, just because I found that it came in handy every now and then, but it's not an essential feature nor was it a deal-breaker.  The product description on Amazon's page actually provides more facts about the phone than is included in its instruction book (oddly, there is no "specifications" page in the MotoManual giving the user the hard facts), so I'd recommend copying and pasting the Amazon product description for your future records.  Other than that omission, the manual itself is quite clear and easy to use.So, for me, this phone fits the bill and I'm quite happy with it.  I would recommend it for anyone who needs a replacement for their AT&T; PAYG phone.
This was a replacement phone for myself after going thru a couple of RAZRs that kept breaking the face and the hinges fell apart. I love this phone! It seems very sturdy and the outside screen is very visible even in bright sunlight which is another problem I was having with the RAZR. No camera, but I knew that before purchasing and not a big deal to me. Just a great, basic phone for my needs.
The Motorola phone fit my need exactly.  I wanted something reliable and inexpensive.  It's got all the features I need.
Basic communication phone with bluetooth that works well. Good quality. Priced right, so that if I drop it in the lake, it's easily replaced. Reception and sound quality is good.
This is a great basic phone. It has great reception, it is sturdy and I'm happy with it thus far.
I bought this phone about a month ago. It took me about two weeks to get around to setting it up with AT&T;, and it worked fine for about 4 days.Then it stopped. I tried recharging it, taking out the battery and re-starting, checked that it was dry, everything short of sending it to Motorola for a $75 repair job (on a $40 phone -- seemed a bit out of whack).  I took it in to an AT&T; dealer the other day only to discover that the SIM card is "corrupted" probably by whatever defect caused the phone to foul up and die.I should have paid more attention to the "no warranty" part of the product description.
Bought a new car with bluetooth built in. Needed a bluetooth phone. This one is absolutely great. No garbage - just the phone. Popped in the SIM card from my old phone and bingo! Super hands-free!!!
This phone easily replaced my older, broken phone and has been easy to program and use just as I did the older version.
I got this to replace my aging Ericsson travel phone, and I am totally happy with it.The form factor is nice, a small flip-phone that easily fits in a pocket or holster; no external antenna to snag on things: really convenient, just flip it open to talk, easy to use Motorola interface, long battery life, and included charger works on 120 or 220 volts (needs plug adapter, though, it only has the two-blade American plug).  It also has Bluetooth and voicedial, which we did not use (I like the capability, though: I use it all the time on my mobile in the USA).  If you just want a phone to talk on, this one's for you.  In Ireland and northern England reception/coverage was always at least equal to other members of our party.We use prepaid SIM chips, local for whatever country we are in, and just swap them out as we travel: they cost about [...] bucks/euros/pounds and come with that much prepaid credit: easy to recharge if more is needed, but we don't chat a lot, just calls for reservations and coordinating things, mostly.  Incoming calls are usually free with a local card, which allows use of long-distance callback services such as Tellestial offers for talking to the USA, which is convenient when we aren't in a WiFi area where we can use Skype.We have a Virgin chip we use in the UK, but had to buy a new SIM chip in a shop on arrival Ireland (Virgin does work there, but at much higher roaming rates.).  We have been to several countries, and I have usually bought SIM chips ahead of time on Ebay. Guy in shop recommended Meteor as best deal for Ireland, and it worked great.
Hey the phone works with my old sim card ATT / Cingular phone its a great back up phone replacing my phone out of contract so I did not have to pay $200 for a new one!so yes its a good phone for price!
I am very pleased with this phone. I purchased it to replace my tmobile G1 because I no longer need a data plan. For me it's very easy to use and has excellent battery life. I would recommend this phone to anyone who doensn't need all the bells and whistles.
It is a basic phone , and delivers on the service , good sound , battery life of 6-7 days ,I switched from my old nokia, i have used it for a month now and no complaints
Maybe I am spoiled by the new technology that I have now, but this phone is pretty old school, bare bones. It is color, has multiple ring tones, decent reception... depending on the country you're in. I just used it because of my recent trip to London and Dublin, and it got the job done. I did like the texting capabilities. I will hang on to it for my next trip, it's a decent phone for just being a tool to call people and text, but not much else. GREAT BATTERY LIFE!
I went to the UK for 2 weeks with this phone.  I purchased a T-Mobile pay-as-you-go Sim card in London and everything worked great, even had coverage up in Orkney (on the main island).  Wouldn't have minded having a camera on it, but I only needed something for calls and texting.  Good basic phone for traveling.
great phone for price and specs.  just wanted a backup phone at little expense to replace plan phones.  very easy to use and plan to take out of country on trips.  easy to use and good reception.
I'm very pleased with the purchase. Everything went fine and the phone is just what I expected.
Have no problem with reception, good clear reception. I do not like the way the center keys are in black which makes them hard to read. The bluetooth seems to cause other problems when it is on, outgoing calls connect but neither party can hear each other until I turn the phone off then back on to reset system. This happens fairly regular when bluetooth is turned on. Overall I guess this is an OK phone for the price if you don't want to take pictures, surf the internet, etc. I paid $48 for mine, which isn't bad at all for all the features it has plus bluetooth. Good bang for the buck!!
I wanted a phone for mainly talking, and capability to text as well.  This one does that perfectly at a great price unlocked.
fast delivery, product as expected, the good - range, bluetooth.  The bad - bluetooth, speaker, phonebook.  Speaker is much worse than other phones.  Bluetooth does not synch with the phonebook.  Phonebook does not synch well with handsfree devices since v-193 phonebook relies on very limited (about 4) recordable phonebook names vice text to speach recognition like most other phones.  All in all, you get what you pay for.
I prefer a plain old phone to the newer versions.  I don't need a camera or internet, so this phone is perfect for my needs.  I had the earlier version of this phone, the V195 (had three of them) and when I needed a new one, I got this one.  No complaints.  Just a good basic phone.
The V197 is an excellent basic phone.It has excellent radio reception, good sound, and good battery life. This phone works fine with AT&T; (formerly Cingular).
This product is without any doubt an excellent option to buy. In fact, is very easy to add ringtones in this cell phone. And finally, the most important is the price
Phone works great if if would hold a charge for more than 2 or 3 phone calls. Admittedly my phone calls are often marathon length, but the battery on this phone goes dead before the end of the day even if I don't make any calls. I charge this thing 3 or 4 times a day. I'm afraid that when I use the charger in my car, this stupid phone is going to run down battery in my car and leave me stranded with a car that won't start and a phone I can't use!
I bought this for my mom who is a cell phone novice.  So far, it works well, I like it
Its good worth for buying.  All the features are good, easy to use. Except for speaker sound is not too loud
This is a cheap phone and it does feel cheap as well. But it works and survived a couple drops on the floor already. Don't expect much. Only has limited memory which fills up after 20 to 30 text messages. If you are in the market to get the cheapest phone possible that allows you to make phone calls, then this one is fine.
I don't want much. I don't care about cameras, bluetooth, internet access, etc...I just need a phone. Motorola's V197 seemed like a great answer...It suited my needs well initially...it seemed durable, had more than enough features, and worked well. But then I discovered that reception inside my house was nonexistent...I have to go outside in order to talk to someone. I've had little problem with this in any of the phones I've owned for the past ten years. So I'm a little miffed that I can't talk inside on a phone purchased in 2009. To make this worse, I found that the battery life is absolutely terrible. I took my phone for a two day trip and decided not to pack the charger. Two days and a new phone...what could go wrong? I hardly used it and the phone died just as my trip was ending, forcing the use of payphones. This is a so-so phone if you just want to talk and text. I was hoping for simple things, and the V197 couldn't even remotely deliver them!
Very disappointed, this phone can not be used with a Verizon service even though it states it is a Verizon phone.
This is my first review ever.  This is also the first time I have ever ordered something from Amazon that was not what I expected.The phone does work.  It was also new, as stated.  Works fine.  This does not appear to be a US version though.1.)  The included manual has a table of contents going up to page 100+...  The last page of the manual cuts off at page 80-something.  It also says in the back to contact Motorola-Asia for assistance.  Not a deal breaker, but this may indicate the level of detail of the seller.2.)  I say this does not appear to be a US version because I have two (2) used U.S. Razr v3's in my briefcase right now and this is just not quite the same.  This seems it might be a U.K. version.My 2 previously purchased US versions do NOT have the extra button above the wheel/pad.  This seems to be the only visual distinction...which results in...No such things as "missed calls" on this phone.  It is classified as a Received Call, but either has a "check" or "no check" next to the entry seemingly indicative of it being a missed call or not.Speed dial assignments (1 though 9) are 4 digit values (1001 through 1009).Cannot lock Smart Key on phone exterior.No light illuminated when charging."Center" is spelled "Centre"Installed graphics are not even remotely the same.Doesn't seem that time will auto-set.Doesn't even use the same battery part # as my 2 other U.S.-purchased phones.That is why I do not believe this to be a U.S. Version phone as stated.I am not very happy about this.  I am going to seek to get this resolved.  This is why I purchased this from Amazon because I believe they will make this right.End
I have never written a review before but I think this is important.  These phones are NOT new!  I purchased two of these phones for my sons.  I tried to set up the internet and found that the phone was either used or refurbished and had the previous users information.  Both also had parental control blocks on the internet and the previous users passwords were necessary to remove the block. I called my carrier and they told me there was nothing I could do and I should return the phone.  I am extremely disappointed!
A replacement for my original Motorola Razr V3.  I guess they don't make them like they used to.  Not the same, quality-wise as my original, but it'll do.  Paint chip off easily, sure wished I had opted for the silver one, not black.
Description says "with warranty" read the fine print. i obviously didn't. It died after 45 days and no warranty after thirty days. Sad product. Don't waste your money!
I bought this phone around a year ago, and now it has become totally useless with the ear piece on the phone no longer functioning.  In general, I found the phone to be of poor quality, with the buttons coming un-glued, and the screens getting glazed over.The battery life is great, and so is its ability to move photos and files via blue tooth.  I will however, not buy another.
I bought this phone and when it arrived it was a cheap refurb that had problems from the moment I put the sim card in. The Customer service is bad, basically you have to use email to get a RMA Number and then they take their sweet time sending you a RMA form that makes you list all this stupid infomation then you have to send it back to them. I have not gotten a number yet, even after sending them emails to check on the status. STAY AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR.
No doubt the product seemed worthwhile, but it does not turn on. No instructions for contacting Motorola, or connecting to a web site or rebooting or paying a start up for it. The company promised to get a new one in the mail when it was 5 days late, but never did and it took 11 days to get there.No customer service after I said I was sending it back. We will see how long it takes to get the money returned. Hasslefree---IT IS NOT.
Phone was listed as U.S. Version with warranty. Phone received was from Germany, obviously used or refurbished with a third party warranty. Phone did not have U.S. set up, but eventually worked well. Sound quality is mediocre at best. Phone was full of German text messages and voice mail somehow takes one to a German voice mail center. Originally a Cingular phone, it works fine with a T-Mobile SIM. Not exactly what we thought we would be getting.
we purchased this cell phone to go with the pay-as-you-go, AT&T; Go Phone Service. The black painted matte finish starting to tip slightly on the edge on one side. Because of this, I don't think the finish is very durable on the long run. If nothing else, the voice quality is fairly good to me. Initially, the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for a long but gradually appear to improved with more charge cycles. The digital camera resolution is quite low but adequate for simple snapshots. Because of limited storage, the digital camera is probably useful in case of auto accidents or other uses.This phone has many other features that is not supported or optional with our service provider such as net access and IM as well as online gaming. Although I haven't tried it yet, it's supposed to also record videos. Like I said earlier, because of limited storage it would not be practical to use. This phone uses a miniature USB port like those on some Cannon digital camera. I've tried hooking this phone up to my computer using my digital camera patch cord to see what would happened. My computer wasn't able to do anything with it. I found out that in order for the phone to interface with the computer, the optional software is required. This phone also would not charge without the needed software. Although, this feature is not important to me.Final thoughts: As a basic no thrill cell phone it's okay. But the paint finish quality leaves a lot to be desire in my opinion. The ring tone using the vibrator feature is so so being kind are weak. Under some circumstances it may not be felt.
I would have reviewed this at the seller profile instead of here but unfortunately the feedback time line has ended.  I ordered this from OEM shop since the profile is 96% positive.  The product spec states that it's brand new but within a month of use the paint started to peel off.  Now after 6 months, I can see the red under layer color.  Our friend has the same model and the paint is still intact.  Other than that, the phone is working fine...
Warning.  This product was branded with the ATT logo.  It still works with other gsm based providers, but if having the ATT logo bothers you then do not buy it.
We received the unlocked RAZR phone as expected. Working beautifully. My son was able to move his SIM card to the new phone without difficulty
The phone works with our ATT sim card. It came in Italian display. It took a while for me to figure out how to change it to English. It does not have software for syncing with PC. If you buy the latest version, the mobilephone tool is listed at $49.99 on Motorola website. The phone is in black, and the color start to rub off in a week. Not a quality product
Love the phone, it's simple, easy to use and it's sleek design is exactly what I was looking for.  Flip phones are becomming harder to come by but I still enjoy this style.
Bought this as a replacement for another razr. Came with many extras the original did not.
The phone is good overall for the price. The only feature I don't like about it is the message typing. It gives you options for words every time you type a letter and then wants you to choose the letter you like. This ends up taking so much of my time typing up even a very short message.
THIS IS NOT THE U.S. VERSION!  BUYER BEWARE OF THESE EUROPEAN VERSIONS BEING SOLD AS U.S. VERSION!  THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE RECEIVED.  THIS ONE WAS SOLD BY "AMAZON.COM" AND I THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE MORE INTEGRITY.  DIDN'T WANT TO REFUND MY MONEY UNLESS I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SUPPORT IN INDIA.
Within the Product Description is the phrase "not all carrier features supported",which I glossed over--unfortunately.  If downloading pictures to your PC or Online is important to you, then don't buy this phone.  Compatibility with AT&T; is fine for phoning, including Bluetooth.  But, support for AT&T; Multimedia Messaging is nonexistent.
The product was delivered defective.  I did not know it was used when purchased.  I had a hard time getting it exchanged.  The company I purchased it from had a 20% restocking fee associated with their RMA.  I wouldn't have had a problem with that if it hadn't been defective when received.Normally, I like the RAZR product and have had at least 4 of these phones.  This is the first bad one.
Phone appears to be new, and works fine for my use - phone calls with bluetooth link to car.  However, its definitely a foreign version as it only does 24hr clock, and defaulted to day-month-year format.Phone Tools CD that came with only wanted to install in Chinese, so I had to find English version on internet.  After installing the English version, I discovered the supplied USB cable was also bad and had to use another (fortunately generic) USB cable.Still, it was cheap and better than the free phone from AT&T; that it replaces.  Shipping was extremely prompt and quick.
Bought this phone from AMAZON site (seller was The OEM Shop) a month back. This was shipped to me in 8 days then it had bad battery.Again it took 5 days for my seller to send me the battery.Even the second battery  had problem. The fully charged battery used to  discharge if I talk continuously for 20-25 mins. The pitch of sound I was hearing after receiving call was uneven, seems like speaker of phone was overused or could be some other reason. There was a sticker pasted on body of phone, the area where battery is hosted, I removed the sticker and can easily make out some work around done with this phone to get this working.  My intention of adding this information is, in my view the body of phone was new but the electronic equipments were old or used. I opted to buy a new phone from AMAZON site. Looking at back side of phone, the cover which holds battery and SIM card is not properly aligned. It should get locked in such a way the battery should not fall out but due to its loose alignment there was possibility for the battery to fall out. Now I Paid the shipping charges and return the phone back to seller and still waiting for them to respond.
I was a bit cautious on this purchase as I had problems with an earlier Motorola.  However, the product has more than met my expectations and I am very pleased with my acquisition.
My husband dropped his V3 razor while riding his motorcycle. This is the only type of phone he swears by because of its sleekness. So, I noticed it was on sale at Amazon and I jumped at the chance to buy this phone that he enjoys dearly and is easy for him to manage while riding his motorcycle.
Item arrived in Portuguese even though it says it's U.S. Version. Cannot make voice dial calls because there's no way to train the phone to use the voice dial. It's simply not there. Had I known this before ordering, I would not have ordered this phone. Warranty does not cover language problems or missing commands such as the voice dial.
Phone headset volume would not work.  Too much trouble and shipping cost to send it back.
They sent me the wrong phone, they did finally give me a refund, but it was a bit of a hassle to get in contact with them.
I have T-Mobile, but this is an AT&T; phone.  I can answer calls and make calls - but I can't forward picutures or download ringtones, etc.  I should have spent the extra $$ for an in-network phone!
I bought this phone a couple years ago, and it was great. Although I was suprised when I got it. First of all, it's huge. It takes a while to get used to the size. It had everytlhing that a regular phone would have, plus it had a camera built in. Overall it's a great phone and its discription pretty much describes it perfectly.
Recibimos el telefono adquirido a Ustedes tal y como le informamos con anterioridad el mismo llego con las siguientes fallas, No le funciona la camara fotografica ni la camara videograbadora, igualmente al comunicarme me dicen los que reciben mi llamada que el sonido de voz es distorcionado, le ruego me recomienden si debo asistir a un servicion tecnico de motorola para corregir las fallas antes descritas. De ser posible, le ruego me contesten este correo en español.
Having used the razr v3 for a month or two at this point, i have no significant complaints. The reception is reasonable, better than the 3 year old Nokia 6822 that my wife uses, but not as good as many other phones of newer makes and models. The phone when first turned on begins in Spanish but automatically switched to English as soon as the network was accessed.The speakerphone is not worthwhile and is only used when absolutely necessary as there is poor voice quality on the other end and the output sound is scratchy and sounds as though the speaker is blown. Another point of frustration I've experienced with the razr is an increase in the voice echo when speaking with other cell phones, although I'm not certain if the fault is the phones or my current networks' issue.Overall, I feel like this phone is a reasonable purchase for 100 dollars for an unlocked phone and I'm satisfied with it. In fact, I'm considering purchasing another to upgrade the reception of my wife's service, but not so sold on the value as to make it a no brainer-type decision.Other functions such as bluetooth, camera, video camera etc. work as expected and provide satisfactory results.
I was expecting this to be a new phone, not branded by any carrier. It came packaged with plastic stickers like a new phone, but looked dirty inside like a used phone would.  It shows the AT&T; logo on power-up and shut-down, and has "AT&T; Mall" apparently permanently installed on the menu. (Which would be okay if I was going to use this with AT&T;, but I'm not)The enclosed warranty card is from "Consumer Certified Repairs" in Miami, FL.The phone seems to work fine, but it's sure not what I thought I was buying.  If I had it to do over again, I'd go for a used one on Craigslist instead.
I bought this phone for my mother, knowing that it was not the newest phone on the market. However, after testing many other phones, my mother who is partially deaf, found the RAZR v3 the easiest for her to hear in both her good ear and with her hearing aid. Also, the speaker phone is exceptionally clear.
First phone didn't work after two days, but the customer service did great and they sent a replacement phone. It's been working fine for the past month.
I have no idea if the phone works. I think it is for europe because they sent a european plug end on the charger. I installed the sim card and cannot make calls with the phone.When I find time to get to the Att store I am hoping they will be able to help. If not I will return the phone. Regardless it's a lot of extra time wasted to get a phone to work that was suppose to be ready to use.
This phone is not working and I would like to return it.  The light does not come on when you open it up.  Please let me know how to return it.thanks,  Jan Young
The cell phone arrived on a timely basis as advertised.The unit was in good condition and works fine.However, the promotion of a SIM card that was supposed to come with the phone never arrived. So I would caution purchasers who decide on this vendor over another based upon such promotions to beware of potentially unfulfilled promises. I have waited several weeks to see whether the SIM card would arrive separately, but it has not.
Fast delivery, great price. Nice phone to replace my  lost one (same model).
I like it.  Everything works, good reception, and sounds clear.  That is all I ask of a phone.My wife does not like the numbers on the keys.  They are a different finish rather than a different color.  In low light, you have to hold it so the light reflects on it at just the right angle to see the numbers.First time it got knocked off the night stand while plugged in, the back of the case cracked next to the charger plug.  I put a glob of superglue gel on it to stop the crack from spreading any more.  That worked, but it does not look very good.
Decent phone.  Came with T-Mobile proprietary information still loaded.  Sends a text message automatically everytime you turn on the phone. Battery would not hold a charge, but cheap to replace.
I was tricked into selecting this phone by the Alltel Associate who "Assured" me that this model had all the glitches ironed out from the previous model I possessed. I had complained numerous times to Alltel that the sound quality was awful, calls were repeatedly dropped, service was unpredictable.  She told me this new model was MUCH better, I would be very happy with it!I signed a 2 year contract, with 2 new phones/2 lines.  Then I find out Verizon has bought out Alltel. Am I happy?  NO!  This phone is even worse than the previous model.  On average, I have 20-30 dropped calls per billing cycle.  Neither Alltel nor Verizon is willing to do anything about it. It locks me out of my voicemail, so I cannot pick up my messages!  It goes into "roaming" without warning, even when I'm in my local area!My daughter was in a serious vehicle accident less than a month after I got this phone.  Her car skidded down an embankment after a deer collision ... She tried to call me three times, but was unable to get through.  She was able to call me after a passerby let her use his phone, called the EMT's, state police, etc.  I took photos of the vehicle, showed them the dropped calls on my bill, complained about the seriousness of not being able to get help in an emergency! I also explained to them that I had to talk to various medical personnel & had multiple dropped calls while speaking to doctors, orthopedists, physical therapists, etc.  This was very embarrassing & time consuming, as doctors would not immediately return calls, & be unavailable after I seemed to hang up on them!I brought all this to their attention ... "Sorry, we can give you another Razr, & check yours for defects".  Well, "New" Phone/SAME Razr = SAME PROBLEMS!So this is how I have to place my calls:  I find the number I need, turn on the speakerphone, hit talk, & walk around till I hear the dial tone ... & then I stand perfectly still, without moving a muscle, hoping I can complete the call.With a phone like this, WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING A CELL PHONE!  Arrrggggg!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS USELESS PHONE!!!  It will most likely fail you when you need it most!Samsung Hue is a Great phone! That is what my daughter has now & she LOVES IT! :)
Overall it is a good phone.  The sound is good and loud and it works as a phone.  But, I have not been able to browse the internet or sent anything other than text messages, and it is impossible while dialing to enter a plus so it is impossible to call international numbers.
I love this phone! It is very simple to navigate through. Ringtones sound great on it. Great size for holding and putting in your pocket.
Great [...]. Acouple were worn alittle but work great. I just put my sim card right in and it worked! I love the bb too. Don't know how I survrived as long as I did without one. For email and Internet to work you have to activate it through At&t;
This purchase was for my daughter (13 yrs) as a starter phone.  It is a little bulky, but easy for her smaller hands to work, and the full keyboard was perfect as she uses text more than talk.
Few minor dings and scratches, but advised of them before purchase.Functions fine and delivery was exactly as promised and timely.Reliable source and would purchase again from him
I am very happy with the product I ordered.  It was exactly as it was described and it arrived quickly.  I would order from this merchant again.
The Blackberry arrived quickly, looked great and is still doing great.  I am terrifically happy with the whole experience.  I will go to this site the next time I need a new phone.
I was a little apprehensive being the first sale for this seller, but she was quite responsive to acknowledge me and send the product. It arrived quickly and in the condition promised. KUDOS!!!

The G900 is a worthy successor to the Sony Ericsson P1i. It fact, its is every bit as good and even better than the Sony Ericsson Walkman Flagship W960i.Though it uses the same Symbian UIQ3 platform as the P1i, the user interface has been polished with the addition of easy to use home screen panels. You can add panels for different applications like messaging, music player, application shortcuts, tasks and calender. These home screen panels make the phone much more user friendly than the P1i and the W960i.The G900 also has a much improved media manager for your pictures, movies, and music files. The media application would be familiar to people who use the PSP and the PS3. It has the feel and looks like the media crossbar that Sony uses in its Playstation line.The G900 also has a 5 mega pixel camera with a picture light. The light can also be used as a bright flash light which can be handy in an emergency situation. The pictures taken by the camera can be a little washed out and lack the vibrant colors of some better 5MP camera phones like the Nokia N95.It has a traditional candy bar form factor. It is much slimmer and smaller than the P1i and the W960i. This makes it a lot more user friendly and more pocketable. Its size combined with its easy to use user interface makes this phone attractive to people who want smart phone capabilities but don't want to deal more complex to use phones. Simply put, this is the best smart phone that Sony Ericsson has made to date...until the Xperia X1 is released at least. :)Pros:-Great touchscreen. The screen is bright and vivid.-Very slim and light for a smart phone with so many features.-Easier to use UIQ3 interface with the addition of panels-Excellent media manager and music player-Five megapixel camera with innovative touch focus-Excellent connectivity with bluetooth and WIFI and GPRSCons:-Does not support EDGE or US 3G networks (Supports UMTS 2100 for European 3G)-Though it takes 5MP pictures, the pictures are not as vibrant as other 5MP camera phones-Lack of built in GPS-Base package does not have any memory stick included-The Opera web browser could be better and does not support flash
I have had this phone for exactly one year from today- give or take a few weeks. Unfortunately, the phone died on me today. (I'm disappointed from the substantially low damage threshold. I have seen it take many strong hits before, but as I was taking it out of my pocket, a mere 2ft drop, was enough to destroy something inside the phone even though nothing physically broke)So far, I have been moderately satisfied with it. It is a decent phone, it gets the job done.. although the "smart" features are not all that useful, as they require heavy configuration and support/fees from the service provider.The Media functions on the phone are satisfactory. They are not worthy of five stars because of the occasional lag and slow response time. The camera is weak. Although it is 5MP, it does not seem to produce pictures of the same quality of the rival, any Nokia 5MP camera phone.The touch screen, honestly, is seemingly unnecessary; except for the open, yes/no, menu, etc. buttons. Come to think of it, I rarely use the touch screen.The keypad lockcode lags sometimes, or sometimes engages when a get a call, not allowing me to answer until the right code is entered. However, this only happens occasionally; most of the time it answers phone calls automatically, with disregard for the lock.Over all decent phone, but one star for durability. I used to own a nokia phone, that was of similar class.. almost a rival model, that I could safely call a tank. Such a light drop should not destroy the phone.
This is the worst mobile I ever had, The touch screen is not good at all and 3 times after I started using it it didn't work anymore for answering calls, so I had to change it.
I can't complain, is a nice phone, and is not that expensive, but it could a better phone if it was more faster
plain crap. i bought this mobile and the wireless broke down less than 6monhts from buying it. Its slow and imcopatible.Plain crap.
This is no joke, no warranty means the buyer will not respond to calls or emails. Our product came with a manufacturer defect (half the touch screen does not work) but we have been blown off by Johnny at Integron Technology. Do not deal with this company unless you are willing to throw away good money. Many other bad reviews of this company exist online, so do your homework more than I did!
I recently bought this phone and was a bit surprised by the lack of quality put into the housing of the phone.  Sony Ericsson found the cheapest type of plastic to build this phone with therefore the feel of the phone is not the greatest and I was not happy with that.  After I've gotten over that, I found out that the software was just lagging from one stage to the next, took me several minutes to boot up the phone the first few times, application are slow from one screen to the next.  Needless to say, I sent this one back.
Altough a bit old, this phone has everything one needs for practice use.the sound quality is very good, the menus are easy to navigate,fast and the phone itself is very sturdy (steel case).it has adecent web browser, and supports bluetootha very good simple mp3 player and expandable memory via mini sd.another great feature is battery life: in moderate use it can last up to 4.5 days.the cons are: 1. low quality camera (only 2 mega pixel) 2. it's a 2.5 generation phone, making the mobile internet a bit slower and not supporting video calls.I enjoy this phone very much, and recommend it to everyone who need a sturdy, practical phone.
This is a great Phone I love mine, but I get so frustrated that Nokia didn't finish their work.Since the iPhone I have started to expect more from a phone then basic functionality.  I don't want a phone, I want an extension to my computer.  If life happens and I will miss a meeting I want the numbers and contact information so that I can reschedule my life on the fly.  Apple get this.  Nokia sells tons and tons of phones, yet they seem to be too busy to do one phone to completion.  I have contemplated moving to the iPhone like my wife but the size and capabilities of this phone keep me from making the leap.What I like about this phone:1) Size: Nothing beats the size.  You don't even know you have a phone on you.2) Bluetooth: This phone support file transfer and stereo headsets.  Two things the iPhone can't do.3) Cut and Paste: Basic functionality that I have come to expect that is missing on the iPhone. This phone support cut and paste4) Sound: This things sounds great with apple ear buds!  And it has decent sound without a headset (remember it is like 7mm thin)5) battery:  At the end of the day my battery is still full.  Last month I talked on the phone all day.  Took and over night train to shanghai.  I listened to music on the train and then talked the next day on the phone.  Amazing!6) AAC support:  This phone can play unencrypted AAC files from iTunes.What I don't like...1) Wont sync with Mac.  Worse yet People on the net say creating a sync profile is easy!  So why doesn't Nokia do it!!!1.a) won't sync with iCal (very important)1.b) Won't sync with Address Book (very important)1.c) Won't sync with iTunes (less important)Nokia, Apple is eating your lunch.  Finish the job.  You have a very good product finish it out.  Continue to release software for the product.  The rules are changing.
I'm not the guy who is looking for the super-fancy,  multi-function iPhone type of handset.  I just needed something with simple web browsing ability and all the basic functions of a cell phone.  I don't like flips or sliders or any of those mechanical lever type phones, I only like these candybar type phones so my options are kind of limited.  This phones meets and exceeds my expectations as far as features go.  Came with a 2GB chip which I found impressive.  The phone works well, reception is good, bluetooth works perfectly with my blueant, web browsing is fast as heck for a little phone not really designed for it.  Overall, I'm very happy with the phone.  The only down side for me is that the buttons are a little small and not separated enough so I often push the wrong buttons when texting.  The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of five is because some of the menu systems are a little funky and go against logic.  I get frustrated with it a little too often, but overall, the phone is great.  It's SUPER thin, sometimes I can't find it in my pocket which is just how I like it.  It's actually a powerful little phone for the money, I definitely recommend it.
I purchased this phone to replace my old LG.  I've always complained that many phones are primitive an lack most of the functionality a moderate phone user requires.  I must say Nokia has impressed me.  Everything from free, well programmed PC suite software, to the ability to update the BIOS easily on your own, to the slimness and studiedness of the phone.  My only complaint is I wish the battery life was a tad better, but for the size, quality, features, and price you can't beat this phone!
I use to be a cell phone junky before it was trendy to have the latest and greatest phone.  When cell phones started to become fashionable (the Razer) is when I backed away from always having the newest model. I have owned phones from every manufacture who has phones in the US.  I wanted a new phone, something solid, but not overly expensive.  The 5310 is a very nice phone, if it had a few things more I would say almost perfect. The phone's very small, and feels real solid in your hand. It's not heavy, but it's not light either.  It's almost too thin, but doesn't slip out of my hand.  The speaker on it is pretty good, not as loud as a Nextel, but it's pretty clear. Much better than most other phones on the market. Battery life isn't great, but look how small this phone is.  I think Nokia has it rated somewhere around 5 1/2 hours of talk time. I don't know how much I get, but the battery icon seems to diminish pretty quick. But for how thin this phone is I'm not complaining at all. BTW I have the white/gray version. Same exact phone, just a diffent color. You don't see many white phones and I think it looks good. Supports stereo bluetooth, which is nice. I love hearing my ring tones on my headset.  Voice commands work reasonably well. I don't use them for anything except calling people.  Call quality is pretty good, the built in speaker is loud, and the speakerphone is loud too. Reception isn't as good as my Blackberry Pearl, not bad by any means though.There are some big issues with it, for me. 1 being the menus, they're ugly. the resolution of the screen is good, the colors on pictures are fantastic. The icons for the menus look horrible. You can download, or even make your own themes. But the default ones suck badly. You have this incredibly sexy phone, with a cheap cheap cheap looking user interface.  Making your own with Nokia's software isn't exactly easy either. The phone supports Flash Lite, but I don't know if it supports Flash Lite themes or just screen savers. If it supports themes like my Sony Ericcson w810i, I take back my comment about the ugly UI :)Another issue, it has a USB port, but you cannot charge the phone thru it, So when I hook it to my PC I have to hook up the charging cable too.  Seems pointless to have the Nokia charging port on the side when the USB one would work great. I dunno why they didn't do this :(What I like:Size, feel, keypad feels good. Has a standard headphone jack, and comes with a 1gb MicroSD card. I already own an iPod Touch so I don't need tons of storage. But I still like to have some to play around with. Also has an FM radio, which could be considered a minus to some since you need to carry around a connector (antenna) if you want the radio to work.The price is right on this phone, if Nokia was to release a phone that looks like this built off the s60 platform I'd jump on it in a minute. I honestly find most Nokia phones to be ugly, but this is a very sexy phone.
This phone was a gift so my review is second-handed and not based on any long use but rather on the feedback i received.Pros:1. VERY thin and lightweight2. alot of features3. Good sound quality and volume4. Stylish with very good graphic interface and software5. Bluetooth worked seemlessly6. Screen quality is amazing7. 2GB expansion card8. Very nice music player and radio9. Flight Mode - so you don't have to turn off during a flight but rather just stop transmitting.10. For all the features that is packed into this tiny phone i must say the price was right.Cons:1. Camera is too slow. Hard to take a picture that is not blurred. A lot of light needed and no flash.2. The screen flashes for about 30 seconds after a call or message has ended. Not sure if we changed a setting but we can't seem to get it to stop.Really good phone but i had to take away a star for what i think is a crappy camera. That is very minor because the camera would be under-used anyway.
This is a slim phone. Be careful if you dont wanna break it. The mp3 player is great. Its sound is so good. It's nice that they give u a 2gb memory card. Again, just need to be careful when you open to insert smart chip.
Brilliant, no nonsense candy bar design. It is really slim, and sometimes this can be seen as a con. If you are used to thicker phones, you'll be dropping this a bit while you figure out a grip. However, I totally love it's form factor, screen and speakers; with an 8GB SD card, it has totally supplanted my mp3 player as well. The camera and video resolution aren't the greatest, but passable.
It's an excellent little music player (as far as phones are concerned) and has enough memory that you won't need a bigger card unless you want to carry a massive music library...in other words, it's good enough that I don't need to take my nano with me.  The headphone jack is standard 3.5.  The speaker is loud.  It's also tough...I've dropped it dozens of times and nothing has broken.  Maybe a little speaker buzz on occasion, but that's not surprising considering the hits it's taken.It does everything else well, and has some useful little Apps...converters, calculators, calendars and so on.Here's what I don't like:During phone calls, many people have complained about the noise on their end. Apparently, every little movement is magnified, so if I move around just a little it sounds to the listener like I'm standing in a hurricane.Also, and I know this sounds ridiculous, it's so small and light that it slips out of my hand if I'm being careless.  Thus the frequent drops.  If you have large hands it's probably not going to be the most ergonomic phone for you.Lastly, the external music buttons are fairly pointless.  If you have it in lock mode you can't use them until you unlock the phone.  But if it's not in lock mode, you'll find it's also pretty easy to press these buttons unintentionally.Still, despite the flaws, it's a high-quality, tough, and useful little phone.
With all the touch-screen, amazing phones coming out in the market, I decided to stick to this one, expecting I'd only get the basics. However, this phone's really useful and it has a lot of features to offer. I love the style, the size (it's thin!) and by being handy, I can bring it wherever and take pictures and send them as MMS. I love the MP3 player feature! Great buy! :)
I ordered this phone as a backup to my E51, but this phone is just waiting to see some action. I used it a few days and tested it out. I love the dedicated music circuit, it sounds wonderful. The controls are easy to use on the whole phone. In two days I was wizzing around through the menu. the blue is so nice, and the only complaint is the internet is tough to configure. Maybe I'm not as tech savy as I thought, but phones never make it easy, none. I do think overall this phone is great. It has a clear voice setting that really brings out the mid to high levels in voices while on the phone. I couldn't tell you what menu it's on. It's truly the best phone for people who dislike flip slide or giant I Phones that feel like your carrying a computer. this phone is like the zoolander phone small, and light easy to use, and without complications. This model works on att and t-mobile.850 and 1900. The 3.5 mm headphone jack is so cool to connect easily to your computer speakers, stereo, at a friends house on the go jams. It sounds as good as my I pod nano 4th gen. At 200 dollars it's a little pricey. It should be around 140 dollars in my opinion.
I have been true to Nokias ever since I started using mobiles and every time I get a new one I am pleasantly surprised. 5310 is no exception to this rule.5310 offers everything I expect from a Nokia - sleek design (slim and fairly light), nice colours (nothing too flashy), sturdy materials and easy to operate software.The screen is just the right size to use the internet and the connection is just OK to suit my needs that is checking information such as weather, movies, rates of exchange etc. I wouldn't recommend it, however, for reading long newspaper articles, however, the letters are a little to small.The musical part is well done (the mobile even comes with a pair of small loudspeakers which is a very nice idea in theory but nothing very practical in everyday use) and I can't help but appreciate the handy controls on the outside. This Nokia basically made my ipod a fashion accessory - why carry a mobile and an ipod if mobile offers most of ipod's functions?There is also a camera - good enough to take pictures which will show on the screen to let you know who is calling and snapshots but their quality is only a little above acceptable so don't throw away your camera before you check it out thoroughly - and a radio, a nice addition (headphones, naturally included) although you should be prepared to recharge the battery quite often if you're addicted to listening all the time.In short - if you're shopping for small, sleek, light mobile phone with all the basic functions plus some added musical ones, this is your perfect choice. It's hard to get anything better for the money.
As soon as I saw this phone, I knew I had to get it. so I did and all I have to say is WOW. Awsome phone. It's small and thin, you can hardly tell you have a phone in your pocket. I went the unlocked version too, so all I had to do was just slip my sim card in it, and I was ready to roll!It comes with many great fetures such as an organizer, bluetooth ect...It comes with a 2.0 Mp camera/video recorder. The camera is good, it snaps a clear pictures, but it's sort of slow after you snap the picture when saving it. The video recorder is just your standar vga recorder. That's alright, I hardly take videos.It comes with a 30 mgs of internal memory, but you can add a memory card (up to 4 megs worth). It already comes with a 2 meg card, but bought a 4 meg card and I still haven't even filled it up, and I put a lot of music in it!Now for the MP3 player: It's AWSOME!!! It comes with MP3 player controls on the side if the screen too, which I thought was cool. So the phone can be on standby and you can continue to listen to music, just use the controls for it. The speakers are LOUD! So this phone can bump music!This phone also comes with a built in FM radio! Now that's cool. So if your not in the mood to listen to your MP3s, just swtch on the radio. But you will need to hook up some headphones for that though. No worries, the phone has a 3.5 mm jack for REGULAR head phones, like the ones you use on a ipod or cd player. And to top it off it comes with some headphoes as well, with an microphone adapter for it as well if you want to go hands free.It also comes with other accesories such as a 2 mg memory card and a USB cable, which is kinda cool. Most of my other hones I had never came with that cable so I would have to go out and buy it, but with this phone, it comes with it!Last thing is the battery life. I had the Samsung Gravity for T-Mobile before, but that phone's battery hardly lasted me a day. I'd take it to work and by the end of the day, it was on it's last bar. I swear, I'd just use it for 15 minutes and half the battery life wiuld go!But the battery on the Nokia Xpress seems to last longer. I have been using it all morning long listening to the mp3 player as I type this and it's still at a full bar.Over the Nokia Xpress Music is a great phone with many great features and accesories. Dispite the sort of slow camera I still give it a 5/5. I guarantee you'll get your money's worth.
I know very little about cell phones. I bought this xpress music phone for my 17-yr-old son as a birthday present.  He loves the phone and the music capabilities.Says also that he can text very well on it. We have not had any problems with it nor complaints, except that i wish it were a bit larger, so that it stays more safely in his hands, hence the 4-star rating.  A great purchase, on my part. Thanks to all the reviews i read before buying!!!
Moved to this phone from my Nokia 6230 (AT&T;) which was getting pretty old and tired.  I'm not particularly interested in music abilities, just wanted a phone with decent battery life, signal reception and bluetooth.Overall, I'm quite happy with the phone.  It's slim and light and has the Nokia UI which I like.  Battery life, however, isn't quite as good as I would have liked.  I would have sacrificed some thickness for more battery, but it's generally okay.  With bluetooth on, I get about 2 full days before recharging.  Reception is as good as the 6230 if not a little better.  Speaker is good and loud and handsfree mode works well as does the bluetooth connection with my Plantronics Discovery 925 which I also like.Tried the camera, it's slow and needs good light and a steady hand to take clear pictures.  Not an important feature for me though.Best, and most importantly of all, I have an old (pre-cingular) AT&T; sim card.  The phone came unlocked and worked fine with my sim.  This was a much better solution than having to get a new phone / plan from AT&T; for which long distance rates are currently terrible.Overall, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery life, but I would recommend this phone as a straight forward phone that fits nicely in your pocket and that you just want to make calls with.
I bought this phone a few months ago to replace my iPhone because I was sick of it's lacking features and having to get it fixed after it continued to break. I have to say it's served as a great replacement. This is the first Nokia I've ever owned and I would DEFIANTLY buy another one.It's excellent for someone looking for a small phone that's amazing as a music player, built great, and won't break.Pros:-TINY! This is one of the smallest and thinest phones I have ever seen. It's like you're not even carrying a phone.-AMAZING music player. Much better than an iPod/iPhone. And can hold just as much with an SD  -Standard headphones are amazing!  -Dedicated music keys are very convenient.  -Very loud speaker for playing music without headphones.-Built great and very stable. I actually have a hard time getting the back off it's built so sturdy! And I've only had the phone crash once when I had thousands of messages in my inbox.-Bluetooth works amazing, something that was really missed on my iPhone.-Customization: this phone is extremely easy to get to work and look just the way you want.Cons:-Slow camera, it takes good enough pictures, but takes almost 20 seconds for each picture to save.-Accidentally sit/hit music keys so music randomly plays.-Easy to accidentally hang up/answer a call without realizing it.
excellent in every aspect. one thing that was a hidden bonus to me was that it allows  you to browse your music collection by folder - as alternative to artist/album - especially useful if ur id3 tags are messed up..
I've had this phone for over a week now.  I've barely used it for calls and I am even having trouble working out which buttons to press for calls.  I must say it was beautifully packaged like an expensive box of chocolates.  The handset was not expensive though, since it was provided free of charge by the telecommunications carrier which I use.I mostly use it for web browsing.  I found the supplied software useless for this purpose, but quickly downloaded Opera directly to the phone.  This I found very useful for setting up bookmarks to mobile sites.  This is my first web enabled handset, and I've found it great for checking the weather report in the morning.  Speed to download web pages was very fast, even though this is due to the mobile phone company service.I've been unable to connect the phone to the computer.  I have no need for syncing the phone with my PC, but I would like to be able to download the latest firmware for my handset if that is available.  I've been unable to locate any information about how to download the firmware, so the inability to connect to the PC is notI didn't find the games of any interest at all.  None of the other applications that you can download were of any use or of any interest to me either.I find the phone a delight to experience in general since its beautifully designed, but sometimes its really impractical in the way it operates.  The phone controls via the glass interface are often delayed in responding.  There are so many options its confusing, and sometimes difficult to select the right button.  Entering text can be very annoying, and I wish there was an easier way to enter standard characters such as "." in a web address.  The angle of the keypad (slightly lower than the main plane of the phone) can lead to cramp in your thumb.  Still I believe I'll eventually get used to it.  However, I've marked it down one star for this.
Phone definitely looks nice, sleek and classy, with a solid feel, smooth slider, and fairly easy to feel keypad.  The one place it fails (or the one I bought) is freezing, especially associated with the touch pad.  Not a matter of aim, but 50% of the time, touching the correct touch key does not trigger a response, or the phone freezes for a bit before responding.  Less of an issue when using keypad or hard buttons only, but it still freezes up at least once or twice per text msg (using keypad).  One can get around using the touchpad to an extent, but the up/down/left/right function is exclusive to it so its unavoidable.
DesignThis phone as you can tell from pictures is very good looking from the leather trim to the carbon fiber screen which is practically unbrakable which saves it from scrathes, It always manages to catch a couple eyes whenever I bring it out because of its unique look with its touch pads and touch screen ONLY for media such as games, pictures, music app etc.The SpecsThere are 2 cameras on the back is a superb 5MP lense, on the front a maybe 1.3MP camera im not to sure, used for video calling and can take pictures thanks to a java application i have , well for any1 like me who just snaps shots from time to time the 5MP lense is superb, video capturing is as well superb you can zoom during video captures set speeds from fast to slow before you capture a video, not during it, but I find that capturing fast/slow motion videos requires alot of light so it works best oustside during the day.Java apps/games work good but it doesn't support 3d games fully it shows at its frame, i mainly use opera, a browser that is just amazing its like real web browsing a must have app far better than the standard browser already on the phone, and no its not touchscreen during browsing and there is no on screen keyboard.I have 8gb micro sd card within my phone which it doesn't fully support, it FULLY supports up to 4gb micro sd cards thats how much it was made to read and write but when I put in the 8gb I was only able to save up to 4gigs of picture and video taking, so with the other 4gbs you have to fill it up with music/videos from your pc, so basically it can read/play 8gbs of storage but not write more the 4gbs of storage, but it does everything well it just takes time to load all my music which i have over a 1000+ songs which can be set as ring tones, you can drag and drop basically anything from music videos(may require converting) to games to adobe files.ConsThe battery life is alright you need to lower the brightness for it to be longer lasting of course.It freezes at times so you will have remove the battery to restart it.You have set up all the profiles for internet/java/youtube.Hard to see the screen under direct sunlight unless u bring up the brightness level.Writing only up to 4gbs of storage on micro sd cards with more than 4gbs.Basically its a good phone,very attractive good for traveling,I plan on upgrading soon to a more powerful phone soon there is a upgraded version of this phone that maybe sold on amazon im not sure the *KF757* which includes wifi i am not too sure of what else ill look it up, well thats it email me for any questions.*Also I have this phone with T-Mobile and it doesn't support 3G.
Its very slim. Very cool interface. Very cool phone. GSMmonster has it for $200...thats where i got mine from.
I ordered this phone from amazon the kf750 and they sent me the TU750 which is the same phone except it's from rogers wireless in canada and there is no touch screen mp3 player and the menu icons are different. It works for what i need it for texting and calls it works very nice not slow at all, but in order to use internet or Instant messaging or download apps or games or tunes or wallpaper you have to use rogers internet which is in Canada... so i can't get connection. i'm going to call amazon and ask them about this.
This phone provided me with everything necessary to run a successful business. The internet is quick and internet explorer loads pages very well. The stylus is accurate and easy to use. The greatest feature of the entire phone is the WiFi. If you decide you don't want to pay for a data plan, there is WiFi available almost everywhere and it is extremely useful. The contact management software, the Microsoft Office Mobile software, and the various other tools are extremely useful. The storage is ample and virtual memory is plenty.
I love mine!  It works great!  If you want a more expensive phone all you have to do is pay!I wonder why someone would spend so much time giving such a low report as some have done?  Suspicious!  But anyway, It is an older phone that gives you a lot of perks for a little money!Be sure and keep your programming up to date and you won't have some of the problems others have.  Buy an extra battery for $17 - $25 and you will not use them both up in a day...  But I rarely have to change mine.
Update 9/24/09: I had been actively searching for a replacement for my SCH-i760 since writing this review, and was recently offered a Blackberry through work.  It is a simple Curve 8310, but it is tried and true, and I have found it in all ways superior to the Samsung.In comparison to my 5 points below, the Curve 8310:1. Was even easier to get setup with email than the Samsung - no entering in POP3 information or guessing how to format your "username" for each account2. Came pre-loaded with Documents To Go3. Ran fully functional on the pre-charged battery at ~30% for 2 days, including battery-intensive activities like intial setup, emails, and some media playing.  A full charge has lasted me 5 days under similar use.4. Has the Edge network through AT&T; and it is quick, but pages do not appear as nicely as they did on the Windows-based browser on the Samsung.  Otherwise, coverage has been excellent wherever I have travelled so far, even in places where the Samsung struggled5. Has been rock solid reliable, with a host of handy pre-loaded apps that do more than enough for me.  I have not had to do any hard or soft resets, no software updates, no mysterious auto-shutdowns, no lockups, no laggy input response, no inability to answer and hang up calls, no quirky software behavior, no frustrations because there's no gimmicks with this phone.***********************************************************************************The SCH-i760 has been my first smart-phone, and it is for company use, which means the big needs were:1. easy acccess to email,2. ability to view and make simple edits to documents and spreadsheets,3. battery life when travelling on the road,4. solid wireless network for accessing the web around the country,5. reliability.5 points, 5 stars.  After almost two years of use, I have found the phone can only do the first two well, and none of the latter.So first, the Good:1. Email was easy enough to setup, and if worst comes to worst your IT person/people can handle that for you.  Emails can get pushed from your companies Exchange server just like on a desktop, and you can set up a few other (not sure the limit) other email accounts like Hotmail or other personal accounts and easily select between them to check all your accounts at once.  Attachments are easy to attach and download.2.  It is of course Windows-based, and initially I was torn between Windows and Blackberry OS but went with Windows because at the time, Blackberries did not have the ability to edit MS Office docs, which was crucial to me.  Now, apparently they do.  But in any case, the phone handles Excel spreadsheets about as well as you can expect, but powerpoint presentations are pretty slow to load and view.The Bad:3. Second only to Reliability, the battery life is, plain and simple, horrendous. While the phone has provisions for bluetooth and Wifi, the only connection I need is wireless broadband access so neither one is ever active.  I set screen brightness to the minimum setting, it auto-powers off the screen when I'm on a call after 10 seconds, the screen dims automatically after a few seconds of non-use, and the screen is set to turn completely off after 30 seconds of non-use.  In a typical day at the office where the phone is mostly dormant, I will go from a full charge on the standard battery when I wake up to hearing the low-battery warning light by the time I get home - approximately 9-12 hours depending on how bad my day is.  That is almost no phone use, no emailing, no web browsing, no vibrating ringer, no BT or Wifi, no games, no nothing - just the phone sitting there.  Taking it out on the road is risky, because the battery drains so quickly you can easily empty it by the time the evening rolls around.  I have never had the standard battery last more than 36 hours, no matter how lightly I used it in that period.  The extended battery (included in the purchase) fairs slightly better, but it will not last 48 hours with regular use, guaranteed.  Frustrating, disappointing, pathetic is how I'd describe the phone's battery life.4. Perhaps it's Verizon, or maybe it's Chicago, but the phone has a great amount of trouble getting a solid signal.  Firmware has been updated, tower's get updated regularly, and 1-2 bars is pretty much the average for this phone.  Travelling, it does well the few times I'm in San Francisco and NY, but it still hits "dead spots" pretty frequently, so I feel like it's a phone issue.  Dropped calls are rare but call quality is never what I'd call clear, there seems to be a slight delay in conversation on the receiving end.  In terms of wireless broadband, when I get a decent connection it's never what I'd call "blazingly fast".  Maybe it's my first experience with a smartphone, but I'm underwhelmed when browsing the internet with this phone.  And decent connections are few and far between.5. Reliability - this phone's biggest downfall.  Is it Samsung?  Is it Mobile Windows?  Or a terrible combination of the two?  Whatever the reason, the phone has proven to be incredibly unreliable and unstable.  The most persistent issue (after the firmware update) is it's tendency to power off completely, on it's own.  You will miss countless calls before you think to use it to make your own call.  I do not have any third party software installed save for Google Maps, which itself runs fine.  As a basic phone, the Samsung fails.  In addition to the call quality and reception issues stated above, there's also many times when it quite simply cannot make a call, citing a connection issue (and it beep-beep-beeps to let you know there's an error), or it just "hangs" during the dialing period.  Inputting phone numbers is often-times tedious because there can be a one-second delay or more between when you press the number and when it registers in the phone.The Samsung is exceedingly frustrating to use as a smartphone.  Of course, a smartphone will never take the place of a dedicated phone and laptop and it is not meant to, but the Samsung makes a very strong case for this route.  I've tried very hard to like this phone, because it's been an expensive investment for me, but I'm fed up with the unreliability, poor battery life and general lack of ability to deliver on what it promises.
Works perfectly and syncronize with windows/outlook and a great way!  I don`t use G3, so i don`t mind that this cell phone doesn`t have this feature.Highly recomended!
Recomiendo ampliamente la compra del equipo. Para las personas que laboran es una valiosa herramienta para el control de gestiones  empresariales. Lo unico que aun no he podido aprovechar bien es el Touchflo, de modo que si tienen alguna recomendación para maximizar su utilidad les agradezco que me envien informacion para compartir please.
I've had my Nokia 6300 for a week. I am pretty satisfied with it. For me the battery last for three days since I make about 6 phone calls each days. The screen is large and the quality of image very clean. Overall, I like this phone and would recommend it to those interested in a simple and reliable phone.
I got this phone for Christmas and it's exactly what I wanted. A small cool looking phone that has a touchscreen, syncs with Outlook and has a fast processor.Overall this phone has been fantastic and does everything I need. It is seamless with Outlook and it's certainly easy to see everything on screen. It's a bright screen with clear photos, text and wonderful features. The interface is very cool looking (sad but cool was a plus for me) and it's so tiny that you can keep it in your pocket without knowing it's there. It's also surprisingly sturdy as I've dropped it several times and it is working just fine.The downside for me is that the Touchflo interface while being very cool doesn't really seem to have much customization. It's not as responsive an overlay as I'd hoped. Someone else wrote that you should tweak it etc. which I have done and the Touchflo setup just feels slow and clunky regardless of my settings. I have changed settings with very little noticeable difference. The battery is indeed small and you don't want to leave Wifi on or it'll drain faster than you could imagine. I don't care to get a battery that adds bulk...the size was a selling point to me.With all of that I still love my Touch Diamond and would love longer battery life but couldn't go back to my old phone because the screen on this is beautiful. Images are crystal clear and it is just a fun cool phone that is seamless with outlook. I have problems with my meetings going off an hour even though Outlook has it right.. we don't change times in Arizona but I had to set it to California time and will have to change settings when the time changes again. That's clearly a flaw and I spent lots of time trying to fix it, finally being told by HTC that I could just set it to California time. It's a smartphone.. I shouldn't have to do that, but I did.  Windows Mobile6 is the only true weakpoint of this phone and there isn't another option.This phone does what it is supposed to do and I can't blame it for WinMob6. It's a real stunning winner of a phone and for the few issues it's still a winner for me. I don't have any desire to get an iPhone and this little gem is the best WinMob Smartphone I've had my hands on.Look past the few small issues and this phone will truly shine.
This is the worst phone I have ever had. The weight is nice periodthe back cover slides OFF all the time, phone does stil work.BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE G#% D@&$ WHITE SCREEN 3-4 times a day.I know I am expecting a phone call and I look @ the phone and WHITE SCREENSet the alarm when I was traveling the phone when to WHITE SCREEN AND THE ALARM NEVER WHEN OFF!!! woke up late for airportDONT BUY THIS PHONECustomer service @ HTC are rude and NO HELP AT ALLI'm back using my Tilt at least no white screen.
This product is a one star item because...1) It has a convoluted interface. If you need to make phone calls on the go, DO NOT buy this phone. You need at least two eyes and a few minutes to navigate the interface.2) The screen attracts dust or something. You can clean it, wipe it, pretty much anything, and it just stays greasy.3) The keypad is tiny. Once again, if you text message on the go, DO NOT buy this phone. You will need a microscope, stylist pen, patience, and more than a few minutes to make a simple message.In closing, there are other annoying things about this phone; I would end up making an essay if I listed all of them. This phone was given to me to make my life easier. It just ended up being a constant frustration and has been returned. By the way, I am LOVING the simplicity of the iPhone now. Good luck if you buy this item!
I've had this phone for about 4 months now and I have to say that I really like it.  The look of the phone is really appealing, and the interface is really quite new and different.  Navigation is pretty smooth and intuitive (when it isn't lagging, more on that later) and I love the way the keys change depending on what mode your in.  Call quality is crisp and loud.  The display is very good quality and album images and text appear clear and sharp.  The mp3 player on this phone is one of the best I've heard.  I connect it to my car stereo and, as far as audio is concerned, it even blows away the Creative Zen I had before.  Even the built in speakers are pretty good and don't sound as hollow and tiny as other phones.Now for the bad.  The reason I only gave this phone 3 stars is because of two pretty big issues.  The first is the 2mp camera.  For 2megapixels this produces some awuful shots.  The colors are washed out, blurry, and grainy no matter what light you're in.  Even the 1.3mp camera on my TMobile Dash took better pictures.  Much much better pictures.  The other issue is this ... the phone has 2GB of built in memory, but beware of using it to store songs.  The built in memory is touchy at best.  Some songs transferred to the phone mem just flat out wouldn't work.  On top of that, putting songs on the phone memory causes the phone to experience some serious lagging.  And it can get pretty bad, even hanging and lagging during calls.  Forget calling any company that asks you to hit a series of mumbers to get to the right department, and punching in something like an account # is a nightmare.  The only reason I didn't mark off heavily for this feature is because if you put songs on the micro sd only this seems to solve the problem.  But you do have to set the phone to keep the phone memory seperate from the memory card.  If it shares then it's the same issue.So, a good mp3 phone, cool interface, but bad pictures and make sure you upgrade the free 1gb micro sd stick because the 2GB on the phone is pretty useless.  Maybe a firmware upgrade will fix that later.
I'm just going to sum this phone up in a few sentences.  First, it looks great. It has a simple, yet elegant design.  Next, it has good performance.  While it's not as great as most Sony Ericsson phones, you won't receive too much lag, especially after you add more memory. Lastly, the battery is very good, and easily only needs to be plugged in once a day for an hour or so.Pros- Decent Music Player2mp Camera can create high resolution pictures, though they aren't amazing.True Headphone Jack2gb On board memory, expandable to 6gb.Great battery LifeScroll Wheel:Better than iPod wheelCool morphing keyboard.Cons- Music player lags sometimesCamera has no flash, and needs oneFaux Buttons are hard to text with, lag sometimesDurability is questionable; Screen scratches easily; Definately buy a protector3-d like menu lags to point of uselessness; Use one of the other menu options instead.OVERALL- I can't really recommend this phone to one specific audience, except for those who want a little bit of everything on their phone, in which case, this is a great buy.
I researched in the web for several weeks for a good unlocked phone with some real good music. I couldn't figure out which phone to buy but when i got this i knew it was the one I was looking for. With ipod quality music in headset n best in the inbuilt speaker this phone gives you rid of carrying two gadgets in your two pockets. The new keypad system that the motorolla introduced in this phone is real unique.  But if you are looking for a good camera phone its maynot be for you. The 2 megapixel camera is not so worthy and gives an average quality picture.  Over all its not so expensive so guys  go for it n give a try. You will then have a most coolest phone among your frens(provided non of your frens have iphone) just kiding......
As other reviewers have indicated, the processor sometimes freezes up, which means that when you press a button, there can be a delay before the phone processes that the button has actually been pressed.  The delays can be as short as a second or two, or can last for close to a minute.  This is particularly frustrating when a call is coming in and you press (and press and press) "answer", but the phone does not answer the call and it bounces into voice mail.  This doesn't seem to relate to using the memory to store music, since I don't have any music stored on my phone.  If I had known that I wouldn't be able to answer many incoming calls and would have problems using the buttons to make calls, I never would have bought the phone.  Super frustrating.  I'm sending it back to Motorola to see if they can fix the problem, but since a number of people have commented on this, I'm not expecting any miracles.
In general the features on this phone are well done.  Things are pretty intuitive and well thought out.  The display is ok for a smaller display.  I really like that key pad is easy to feel and totally closed from dust.  Motorola's click/scroll wheel which is intended to be similar to the one found on an ipod is ok but seriously lacks something when compared with an ipod.My biggest gripe is that the processor on the phone is a bit on the slow side.  Every now and then the display looks frozen and the buttons don't do anything.  Give the phone a few seconds and it catches up with you, whatever you last typed or the last command you gave the phone actually happens, just after a short delay.Oh you, call quality is good and (my last phone was a smart phone)I think battery life is fantastic.
I had this phone for a long time and let my friend borrow it for about a year.My friend literally beat the phone up and it works perfectly fine (About 3 years of use!). The battery life is also still amazing!Once you get used to the phone's UI and all it's little features, you will absolutely love it. I am an avid Android user. I had the G1 for a year. When my G1 got stolen, the W610i was my back up. Switching back to a basic phone wasn't easy but I fell in love with this phone again once I relearned the UI.If you hate bulky smart phones and hate tiny basic phones, this phone is smack dab in the middle. Data plans on phones are overrated.Great basic phone functions.Camera is really slow.Great music player.Very bright flashlight.Very loud speaker.Doesn't use microSD.Front buttons are PERFECT. They never stick or wear and are easily replaceable if you decided to buy a new housing.
I had owned a similar phone, which was damaged beyond repair. Couldn't find anything I liked locally. Everything is a mini computer now. I just wanted another phone that can make calls, text & picture message, and take photos. This one does it. Had a few problems connecting to the net when I first got it, but Sony has a fantastic web site that got me up and running super easily. This phone takes a decent photo, too. So, if your looking for a reasonably basic phone, I'd recommend this one.
Before I fell bonkers in love with my new phone, I got this phone and used it in Iraq, in the states, everywhere! I absolutely loved it and I still own it! I plan on using it on my next deployment. Awesome that it came unlocked, it's durable, the body is comfortable to hold, the stylus and touch screen are comfortable to use and it's just a great phone. I wish I could give more specifics, but I can definately say overall it's a great phone.
Nice phone, be aware because mine only came with two language: English and Chinese.  the systems that this phone uses is linux, you have to be a power user if you want to download or change anything....keep that in mind.
This has been my favorite phone ever.  Besides the fact that it is extremely unique and makes people go WOW, the capabilities of the phone are far beyond what I ever need.  As a standard phone for texting and calls it worked fine.  The stylus is required for all texting since the keyboard is very tiny.  If I used my fingertips there were too many mistakes but once I got used to using the stylus I could move at a reasonable speed.  I was able to access my contacts and make calls without using the stylus but those with larger fingers may have a problem with this.The built in memory is fantastic as well.  I had a total of 1700 texts on the phone before I had to delete them as I was out of space.  Much better than every other phone I've owned that held a total of 80-100 texts total.The 2mp camera takes good pictures for a camera phone.  There is no flash but if you want high quality pictures get a camera.  If you want to store a lot of pictures make sure you get a memory card as you'll probably need it anyway.I never used the web browser as I didn't want to pay for a data plan.You can install programs on this phone via memory card but I never ventured down this path.  You can do a lot to it though, its all up to what you want and what's available and there is plenty of information on the internet, specifically on forums geared towards modding Motorola phones.  Since these phones are unlocked in order to be used in the US you're able to do anything and everything you want.If you want a truly unique phone then this is the one for you.  Everyone has their Blackberry's and Treos and iPhones.  This phone will stand out above and beyond and thanks to the clamshell design you don't have to worry about buying screen protectors like all your friends do for their PDA phones.If you have the patience to experiment with this phone and are smart enough to handle the lack of tech support then this is the Smartphone for you.
THIS PHONE IS EXCELLENT, IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU NEED IT TO, THERE ISNT REALLY NOTHING BAD ABOUT THIS PHONE, AND THE BEST THING ABOUT IT, ITS ADDICTIVE, IF YOU PURCHASE THIS PHONE AND LOOSE IT LIKE I DID, YOU WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE IT AGAIN, ITS WORTH THE BUY, AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. NO COMPAINTS FROM ME.
This is my second Razr. The first was a V3xx. I didn't think it was possible to improve on the V3xx, but this is the phone. I've owned everything from sliders to flips from several makers. The Razr V9 is a beautiful phone with exceptional sound clarity and a menu that is so intuitive that most will have it mastered quickly. Mine ia a beautiful mahogoany color. There just is no better phone out there.
The Razr2 is really a good phone, but buying an unlocked one is not such a great idea.  Of course, none of the service providers have had them for several years - the flip phone is a vanishing item.Amazon sells this one through HassleFree, which is anything but. Mine came from Australia, programed for the main service provider there, Telstra.  Setting it up for a U.S. provider requires some work.  For instance, when you try to dial your voice mail, it will attempt to contact a voicemail box in Australia.  It took a trip to an ATT store to get this changed.Also, the phone always shows a "new voice mail" icon when none is there.  Further, after a voice mail is left, it is always followed by a text message showing a few strange symbols.  ATT tech service was very good, but told me this is an electronic quirk that can't be remedied.  Due to the differences in Telstra and ATT phone programming.The seller puts difficult limitations on a return for refund, i.e. No more than 30 minutes talk time.  It takes longer than that to determine if the phone even works.I can use the phone as a backup, but if do-overs were possible, would find a used phone that came from a U.S. provider.I would not recommend any unlocked phone, unless you know where it comes from.
I've owned this phone for over two years. I'm finally upgrading to a Windows Smart Phone (HTC Touch Pro 2) but have felt some sadness moving away from this beautiful and functional phone and decided to write a review about how much I've liked the phone.First, this is a slick, high quality phone both aesthetically and in build quality. Everything just feels solid and well made, including the responsive touch pad which makes texting as easy as possible considering it doesn't come with a QWERTY pad. The hing is one of the best I've seen on a flip phone, and even after two years of constant use it is still solid and not wobbly at all.The LCD screen is very nice, even by today's (end of 2009) standards. It's crystal clear, and make texting, operating the phone, playing games, etc., fun and not eye straining at all. The front screen, while lower resolution, is useful for taking self portraits (in camera mode when the phone is shut, it displays what the 2.0 mega pixel camera is pointed at!) and displaying your own custom images.The phone has a built in mp3 player (compatible with mp3s and WMA files) that is better than average for a phone based player. The phone can also play music over the phone's speaker, which sounds surprisingly good!The touch screen buttons on the front of the phone are well placed and easy to use for changing tacks or pausing.Voice commands works fairly well, but certainly not perfectly. I find it recognizes what I'm saying about 75% of the time.Phone call clarity is the best of any phone I've ever used, and better than friend's phones I've tried that are new.A few complaints:1) To use the phone as an mp3 player requires a mini-usb to 3.5mm adapter.2) The phone occasionally freezes up and needs to be reset by removing the battery.3) web browsing is pretty poor on this phone, but I never used that functionality much so it didn't bother me.Overall I've LOVED this phone and it's held up remarkably well over the last 2+ years. This is a high quality piece of hardware that's stood the test of time.4.5/5 Stars. A real gem.
I really can't rate this as never used it due to problems with the seller and shipping.
I have had very good experiences with Nokia phones but we've had this thing repaired 3 times in the last year and it just went dead. I'm going to something else.
A really nice sleek looking phone, however it was bought in February and by September the slide stopped working. I got no sound from the phone. I changed the part and one week later the touch pad stopped working, so...that meant being unable to make calls, answer calls and send text messages. What a disappointment because I need a new phone again and a year has not even gone by.
The back scratches a lot. The cancel touch button doesnt respond well after the first 3 months (on mine at least) which makes it a pain sms.Its a bit complicated to browse trough the diferent menus. The interface could have been better and more simple.Still is a really nice phone and I love it.
I am a beginning runner who lives in the country. For safety, I always carry my cellphone and identification when I run, and I bought this holder to circumvent the fact that most running shorts don't have pockets.This cellphone holder is sturdy and well-constructed, but flexible enough to allow me to slide my ID/health information cards behind the phone. The band, which fits easily around the arm or lower leg, is slightly stretchy for comfort. I prefer to wear this holder around my ankle, where it seems least likely to interfere with normal circulation.While I haven't experienced this, I suppose it's possible that the heavier stitching on the back of the case may cause chafing if the holder is worn over exposed skin, although I'm inclined to doubt that this would be a problem.In conclusion, this is an excellent product for a fair price. It would be useful not only for runners, but for anyone who'd like the hold their cellphone, ID, and maybe a house key without pockets. (This product was, in fact, originally designed for horseback riders.) I am highly satisfied with this product, and would not hesitate to recommend it.
I love to go horseback riding out on the trail, and I always carry a cellphone in case of emergency. This cellphone holder can be worn on the arm or leg for secure, quick and easy access. The item description doesn't mention the adjustable velcro band is also elasticized to help keep it in place. I have worn the holder on my arm, over a slippery nylon jacket, and the holder didn't slide around as might be expected. I purchased the holder in yellow; it's a bright, bumblebee yellow, with black trim, not the soft, buttery yellow shown in the picture. Not a complaint, since it could be just the way my monitor shows it. Whatever color you might choose, I think you will find this cellphone holder a helpful item. Highly recommended!
I received 2 of these today and I first thought they were going to be too small for my Blackberry Curve 8310. However, the entire case is made of a quite stretchy but sturdy material and it expanded enough to fit my phone. The quality of the case is quite good and will not easily rip apart. As the other reviewer mentioned, the strap is elasticised and adjustable and long enough to fit around your leg but can still fit securely around your arm without having any excess stick out. It's perfect for keeping your phone on you regardless of what you're doing.

I prefer to wear this holder around my ankle, where it seems least likely to interfere with normal circulation.While I haven't experienced this, I suppose it's possible that the heavier stitching on the back of the case may cause chafing if the holder is worn over exposed skin, although I'm inclined to doubt that this would be a problem.In conclusion, this is an excellent product for a fair price. It would be useful not only for runners, but for anyone who'd like the hold their cellphone, ID, and maybe a house key without pockets. (This product was, in fact, originally designed for horseback riders.) I am highly satisfied with this product, and would not hesitate to recommend it.
I love to go horseback riding out on the trail, and I always carry a cellphone in case of emergency. This cellphone holder can be worn on the arm or leg for secure, quick and easy access. The item description doesn't mention the adjustable velcro band is also elasticized to help keep it in place. I have worn the holder on my arm, over a slippery nylon jacket, and the holder didn't slide around as might be expected. I purchased the holder in yellow; it's a bright, bumblebee yellow, with black trim, not the soft, buttery yellow shown in the picture. Not a complaint, since it could be just the way my monitor shows it. Whatever color you might choose, I think you will find this cellphone holder a helpful item. Highly recommended!
I received 2 of these today and I first thought they were going to be too small for my Blackberry Curve 8310. However, the entire case is made of a quite stretchy but sturdy material and it expanded enough to fit my phone. The quality of the case is quite good and will not easily rip apart. As the other reviewer mentioned, the strap is elasticised and adjustable and long enough to fit around your leg but can still fit securely around your arm without having any excess stick out. It's perfect for keeping your phone on you regardless of what you're doing.

I wasn't sure that this was ligit but it seems to be working fine...ThanksAnd the shipping was fast...Great purchase!
These phone are so neat I bought 3 of them. The latest sprint update lets you use SDHC cards so I've got 8 gigs in mine plus there are lots of free apps out there for the palm. I use google maps and the word apps everyday at work.
works perfect in Costa Rica, nice lock and good materials, the only problem it doesnt have spanish on the software. and makes the writhing slower!!
While the thought behind the phone (including the simpler "breeze" mode) is nice, the implementation is often disappointing.For example, there's a long list of various service numbers (musicID, 411, voiceCall, etc) hard-coded into the phone's contact book and cannot be deleted. Why not allow the consumer to pick and choose which numbers to keep in her own phone book is a mystery to me.While the phone is touted as particularly usable for elderly people, the power plug is finicky and requires a lot of coordination to use correctly. In various parts of the interface, large font becomes tiny and hard to read.It's clear that Pantech is headed in the right direction, but they still have a way to go.
The things that I like best about this phone so far, are the large display, the large raised buttons. Also, the sound is very good, and the ringer seems to be very loud. That being said, this phone currently has a major drawback for me. The keypad light only stays on for abot 5 seconds. There is currently no way to change this light on time in the software. You can extend the time that the display screen is lighted, but not the keypad. For others this may not be a big issue, but for me, I am finding it very difficult to use the keypad in low light situations.
I purchased this phone because I have big fingers and the large buttons of the Pantech Breeze seemed a welcome change from the microscopic buttons on just about every new phone made now.Pros -1. Big buttons.Cons -1. Programs (games) and phone numbers you CAN'T delete.2. I can't crank this thing loud enough to hear people unless I'm in a quiet room.3. Phone must be centered very precisely over your ear or it sounds muffled.4. Perhaps I have a lemon, but this phone constantly dies and tells me I have no service.  This happens in the city.I will -not- be looking at any Pantech products in the future.

This is a great phone... I have AT&T; and the 850 3G works on AT&T...; It can hold up to 8GB microSD card for storing my music collection and photos... the camera's actually not that bad... I actually took some nice pics with it... It's not the best you'll find at only 2MP but it does have a flash which makes it better and you can take the pictures in landscape mode which makes them better... it uses a micro USB cable to connect to a computer and a 2.5mm headset jack... it doesn't come with a micro USB cable so I had to order one from Amazon but that's OK as they're super cheap... it only came with a mono headset but that's OK because I have a stereo one from my previous Nokia phone and I usually listen to music using the stereo bluetooth anyways... the screen is only 2 inches and I would prefer 2.2 inches or more but actually 2 inches isn't too bad... it's really light and pocketable... I put a screen protector on it to protect it... Eventually I'll move on to another phone but this phone is great for now... Being that it is unlocked you have to input the settings to be able to use the Internet but that is no problem for me... I use Opera Mini daily and with Opera Mini it's an awesome phone... if anyone has anyone questions feel free to leave a comment and I'll try to respond to it...
please, the description of the cel is different than the package you receive, it is not includ the front camera to video calls and without 3d touchflow, the seller can not give an explicationThe cel is slow, I miss the my sonyericsson 810i....

My husband loves his phone. It has so many great features and the price was excellent.
I transferred over to Virgin Mobile after having much difficulty with T-Mobile. I am very happy with Virgin and my Samsung Slash. I get service everywhere. The sound quality through the earpiece is decent. The buttons are big enough for easy entry. It's pretty basic and not too flashy, but it's stylish enough. The only things I don't really like about this phone is that when I text people, it always adds an unnecessary "RE:" before every message, and ends each message with "...". I don't really know if you can change this, but it's only a minor issue. Also, the Slash gets rather warm with use, but not as hot as other people have made it out to be. I don't burn my fingers or switch hands. The camera quality isn't that great either. But for the money, it does the job and I don't have to suffer with another ugly phone that T-Mobile gave me. I would recommend this phone.
This is a great phone and the other person commenting about getting burnt fingers is a clear exaggeration. Does the battery get warm? Yes, but too hot to touch or possibly get burned? Give me a break.It get's great reception, gives you quality pictures and easily recharges.My only complaints are the length of the active battery time which is well below the 3.5 hours claimed and the long recharge time required to gain only about 1.5 hours of actual usage.other than that it is still one of the best phones i've ever owned with worthy features you'd find on much more expensive cell phones.
I would not recommend this phone at all I can get past the dust that gets under the screen but not the fact that the battery gets so hot after just a few minutes on the phone it becomes impossible to hold the phone. After just a few minutes on the phone and you have to switch hands every few minutes if you can last that long. I love the style of the phone, but any prolonged use of the phone is PAINFUL...!

Other than that, it's a good solid phone like only Nokia seem able to do.  Seems to give decent reception.  Unfortunately at this level you get no connectivity to a PC, so you have to manually enter your contacts.It's an unpretentious phone, and it works, but it has a few unnecessary flaws:1.  No non-musical ringtone.  There isn't one which *just rings*.  I ended up choosing some sort of buzzing thing which sounds like a woodpecker, which was the least offensive.4.  Over-large font for texts and phonebook, which can't be changed.  There's a menu setting somewhere to change the font, but it doesn't take effect.  You get to see your texts two lines at a time.3.  Rather unpleasant keys - not very positive or easy to use.
I am no one to criticize cell phones, considering that I washed TWO in my jeans in three months!  I had JUST agreed with AT&T; for another two years as well.  I thought I was lost until my nephew told me about `Go Phones'.  For this price, I get a phone that does just about everything my regular Nokia would do - except.It is totally plastic and won't hold up well if dropped.  Forget about texting; the keys are designed poorly and you can easily hit the wrong one.  And (this is a big one) the removal of the back panel for the battery and SIM card drove me nuts!  It appears that the textured part of the phone should be the removal panel, but it is actually the entire half of the phone that gets removed.  It took me twenty minutes to figure this out (but then, remember, I've washed two cell phones!).  Just press in the button on top and carefully unlock the entire back panel (it really is like half the phone).  I read others had problems with this.  The charger/headset cover is very flimsy and will probably break soon, but...This is a temporary phone.  It was very cheap.  All I did was replace the SIM card from my old phone.  It's not meant to be great, even though it has almost all the features an expensive Nokia would.  You know what?  If I manage to wash this sucker as well, I'll just go out and buy another.  No worries.BIG PLUS:  With AT&T;, after six months you can get a new free phone (tax is not included anymore) if you upgrade your service.  They will extend you for another two years.  Hey, don't we all have two years commitments anyway?  Enjoy!
The price is reasonable remembers that there is addition flashlight. The flashlight made from white LED lamp that super kind bright, the light is enough to illuminate road in the theater so that doesn't tread on another person foot or stumble ladder, or when at home suddenly the electricity broken off. It can be loyal friend in darkness.And Nokia 1208 battery is durable enough, doesn't disappoint when used to speak sufficiently long with friend or darling, but necessary alerted cause sometimes this cellularphone suddenly dies by itself.There is a friend of mine also use this cellular phone but there is no problem at all, maybe i am just unlucky when i buy it.
After owning an HP iPAQ 4355 for nearly ten years I decided it was time to buy a new one and started to shop around. I found the iPAQ 910 and decided on it. Granted it is a little high priced but, I paid the same for a PocketPC that did not have an internal GPS and was not a phone which the 910 has! Unlocked units are the way to go! Pick your carrier and you are essentially a month to month contract. So what do you lose, nothing I am sick of two year locked in mobile contracts! Back to the 910, it does use the battery life quickly, however if one turns of Wifi, bluetooth and do not use the gps it lasts as well as any other phone I've had.Customer service, contrary to other reviews, for me has been outstanding! I left the house one morning and turned of the wifi. When I returned home could not get it to come back on. Longish story short. Called HP and the sent a new replacement to me free of charge when the wifi was determined to be defective.WM6.1 is far better than 2003 and no complaints about speeds!Specs state that the mini SD card is has a max of 4gigs, been using an 8gig with no problems. When the 16gig mini cards become reasonably priced I will be getting one of them.
I have owned and used the folowing to compare this to: 8525/Hermes, t-mobile Dash, Ipaq Ultimate 8502, Samsung Blackjack, T-mobile Curve 8310, and 8320, Treo 680, AT&T; Tilt, Motorola q9h (my current favorite), Audiovox SMT5600, and a couple others I don't recall all the model names on some of the rest, but you get the idea. I have quite a bit of experience with smartphones, primarily Windows Mobile.This phone has the potential to be nice, but is pretty weak when you consider the price. Because these do not have a carrier agreement, they are never available discounted, the cheapest you can get one right now is $350 for a used one, maybe $390 for almost new, $450 plus for brand new. Now I realize that is inline with other phone of this caliber, but this phone is just too QUIET. You can barely hear it ring, can't hear the notifications at all really. There is an app inside it to boost the volume, but anytime the phone reboots, it resets back to too quiet.It's just a waste of time and money for them to make a phone like this that you can't hear.For $150 you can get a tre 750, motorola q9h, t-mobile dash, 8525, tilt, etc. THey all have better volume then this.Besides that, the battery life is poor, and the processor even though is not real slow is not real zippy considering the battery useage and the price.For corporate use only, it's probably ok, but just barely. I mean if the company was paying for my phone, I might use this one.wifi works fine.Has a nice form-factor, a little cheap feeling build quality (but not too bad).I have found the q9h to be the best overall smartphone for me. Durable, LOUD enough. Nice rugged feel and good form factor. No touch screen though.If you want a Windows Mobile Phone with touch screen and qwerty on top, you have a few choices: ipaq 910, treo 750, imate 8502. The 8502 keyboard was a little too tight for me. The treo does not have wifi and alittle older, but a good choice because it has a carrier discount, which means the second-hand market you can find them for $100! It has everything this has but GPS and Wifi.It all depends on what is important to the user. For personal use, not that good because too quiet. Hard to justify spending $400 hard cash on a phone you can't hear!
I like this phone mainly because It is the only phone I know of that allows you to edit and read office 2007 files. I like the touch screen. The handwriting function works well. The voice quality sounds good to me. The volume is not as loud as other phones, but I never have trouble hearing, even in noisy environments (I keep the volume turned all the way up).When it's working properly, it's a great phone. But it never seems to work for very long before it locks up and I have to reset it. I have to reset it 1 to 3 times a day.I also have bluetooth problems. My plantronics bluetooth headset that worked perfectly with my ipaq 510 does not work well with the 910. It works fine for making calls, but for some reason it does not work at all with the voice command feature and files played on the windows media player will not play through the headset.Another problem is the battery life. I had read complaints about the battery before I bought the phone, but I did not think it would be a problem for me because I do not use the phone much during the day. I use it for one or two personal calls a day and I briefly use ms word or excel. The battery does not make it through the day without recharging. I don't know how business users who make frequent calls, send/recieve emails etc. can get by with this phone. Another battery is available for this phone on the hp website that provides 60% longer life, but it is twice as thick and makes the phone bulky.One great way to save battery power is to turn off the power when you are not using it. It will still receive calls and messages. The problem I'm having is that every third or fourth time I turn off the power, the phone locks up (this is in addition to other lock ups). It has to be reset to make it work again. Unfortunately, the phone will not recieve calls or messages if it locks. This is not a problem for me because I don't receive many calls. For someone who cannot afford to miss a call, this would be a big problem.This phone reminds me of my old ipaq hx2495 pocket pc. It used to lock up all the time and I was always resetting it. After using an ipaq 510 for about a year, I became accustomed to having a reliable device that almost never had to be reset. Now I'm back to resetting my device all the time. I'm very disappionted.I do not recommend buying this phone.
Pros: -Good looking professional device-Fast GPS-Great processor speed-No bloatware from HPCons: -Shared mini USB/headphone jack-Battery life not as long as one would anticipate from a 1940mAh batterySummary: Because the HP 910 doesn't have the sleekest looks or skinned interface, it is constantly dismissed as a heavyweight contender. But it stands head and shoulders above the Treo 750 series and most of the current QWERTY-bars. Working within the confines of Windows Mobile, HP has put out a nice device which has, for the most part, slipped under the radar.The first batch of iPaqs shipped out were plagued with issues, but for those of us that exchanged them for another unit and upgraded ROM we were rewarded with a stable powerhorse with tons of memory and options. It has plenty of shortcut buttons, and the keyboard is fantastic to use. Don't be fooled by devices with 320x320 resolution- as a non-standard screen size, there are a large number of applications that are not compatible. The 320x240 of the iPaq 910 is nice and bright, works with most applications and is excellent for watching movies.Hopefully a future ROM will improve battery life, which is good but should be out-of-this-world for the size of the battery. And sadly, HP decided to share the audio and power USB port which means that you cannot use standard 3.5mm headphones, or even listen to music and charge simultaneously.After 3 months of use I sold this phone. It eventually became plagued by random unresponsive keyboard, and an inability to see the memory card (including apps and photos) both of which would only be fixed by a soft reset. Look over in the HP Forums and you will see tons of folks still waiting 9 months later for these issues to be fixed. I wish HP would release a fix for these issues because they've got pretty decent hardware, but they are overpowered by faulty software bugs.
I've been wrestling with my HP iPAQ 910 for weeks now.  I'm synchronizing between Microsoft Outlook on 2 pc's and am continuously plagued by an Activesync error (86000107).  Based on the forums I've followed, many users of handhelds using Windows Mobile 6.1 are experiencing the same problem.  It seems to be tied to synchronizing more than 100 items between two pc's.  The problem was identified over a year ago, but Microsoft doesn't seem to have addressed it yet.  If you are using only 1 pc or have very few items, the Ipaq is probably fine, although the battery life could be better.  If your handheld carries your "life" in it, I'd suggest going with one that doesn't use Windows Mobile 6.1
After 2 weeks of almost non-stop messing with my iPAQ 910, I decided to write a review to share my findings with the world. While this phone is just about everything I could have hoped for, it does have a few drawbacks too that I have not figured out a workaround for yet.On the plus side, this phone is every bit as powerful as a windows mobile phone can be. Setting everything up and syncing all my contacts, files, ect. was a snap, and I was up and moving in minutes. Even without an external GPS antenna, the GPS function works well (though Google Maps has given me wrong directions a time or two). There is also a function that allows a PC connected to the phone via bluetooth or USB to connect to the internet through the phone's service plan. I have found this feature to be extremely helpful, as I use several computers that have no internet access. The Wi-Fi is also excellant, with a range that is actually better than that of my laptop's. This phone definately lives up to the "Business" in it's name in every way, I have never been so well connected as with this thing in my pocket. I had no problems setting up any of my email accounts, hooking up my service plan, or any other kinds of issues connecting the phone to, well, anything I have tried to connect it to.Of course, there is always a down side. In almost every review I have seen for this phone, two issues where mentioned: battery life and volume. I wes expecting these both to be a bit under par, but I have to say that they are both FAR worse than I could have guessed. If the phone is in a pocket, forget hearing the ringer. The speakerphone is useless. It might have helped if they at least put a regular 3.5mm headphone jack on the phone, but it only has a mini-usb port. I also bought an adapter 3.5mm to mini-usb, but it doesn't work with this phone. The battery seems to be draining at an alarming rate, don't EVER forget your chargers! I leave the thing plugged in all the time to either a wall outlet, my PC, or the lighter port in my car, and I can still rip through the power pretty quickly on this thing. If you buy this phone, get a second battery and a charger for it.Aside from these two commonly mentioned issues, I have had a couple other things about this phone get on my nerves too. The audio tends to drop out while using a bluetooth headset, and the voice commander software on the phone leaves room to improve. Also, I had trouble installing an official HP patch to my phone from a Vista PC, so if you don't have an XP system, avoid the updates, you'll be really glad you did. Lastly, there is no way to rotate or change the display at all, and I have had a few software titles that could work perfectly be complete garbage on this phone because part of the graphics of the software hang below the visible screen, with no way to scroll or anything. I have had to reset the phone a couple times because some game demo I was trying was set to 320X240 instead of 240X320 and I couldn't click on an exit icon.Well, I am getting long winded here, but I have to say that overall I am very happy with this phone. It does everything I need it to do, in most cases flawlessly. With the right combination of Today screen plugins and a few days tinkering with settings, I am still being amazed every day at what this thing really can do.
I bought this phone in October 2008. Thought it had nice features and would work well for work. When I received it I thought it was great. Touch screen a plus, windows os I liked it was a good improvement over the T-Mobile dash window mobile 5. after a couple of days with it. I noticed it looked like was kind of like they just took differt features that's were good on other phones and crammed it in to one. To many redundant functions. You have a directional ring button in the middle allowing you to scroll up and down the screen. Then The touch screen its self can scroll up and down too. Then there select and menu buttons in the messaging part, as well as on the touch screen . And if you wanted you can us the black berry like scroll wheel on the side to make your selections and navigate around the screen. Just made it seem like didn't put any thought in to adding more functions for the hard wear to could take advantage of. Over all was user friendly but only cause there are three ways to do the same thing.The GoodI like the windows 6.1 so easy to find setting to make changes.The touch screen worked well although its a bit on the small sidethe over all form factor of the phone was good easy to use with two hands but, took practice to use with oneThe badFroze 2 to 3 times a day and that's with minimal useDeleting text messages is a night mare. when you select clear all text and mms messages. would start delegating and then freeze. used that option once before bed and it was still stuck in the same spot when I woke up. and that's was only with about 50 texts messages to delete.battery life on the low side I'd get 9 hours of medium use before I had to charge it.Taking picture was slow. you press the button to take the picture and it takes about 3 seconds to actually take the picture. not a very good way to take pictures hold still. ha hathe speaker phone volume is way to low even when turned up all the way.ringer volume to low as well when all the way up.Vibrate function inconsistent, it  worked when it wanted to and isn't strong enough to feel when it goes off.by month 5 battery life was down to 3 hours before needing a charge. come to fine out its because the charging port was detaching from the board. in month 6 it stopped charging and syncing all together when the port came off the circuit board.it was under warranty and hp had a replacement out in 3 days.I stopped using it for about 2 months and when back to the T-mobile dash. but the decided that since I paid $499 for this phone I better get my money worth. so started using it still having the freezing problems. which's most phone have. some more then others. and now im approaching month 6 on the replacement phone. and surprise the battery life is down to 3 hours again and the screen flickers when its charging or syncing, which means The charging port is detaching form the circuit board again. And its our of warranty so Looks like it will become a paper weight. Sad a $499 phone only lasts a year at most well 6 months each since mine was replaced.If I had to do it over again I would pass. Good Attempt just bad hardware design. I don't think this phone is worth paying $[...] for. $275 would probably be about right price point in my option and that would only be if the was a $50 rebate. so it's back to my T-moble dash which oddly enough was run over by a scissor lift and still works fine after replacing the just the screen. HTC makes a good product in my opinion, Id recommend you look at a HTC phone instead of This HP ipac.
Excellent product all in one.Only thing bad, speaker or audio deficient.
Great phone! It took me a while to get used to but I think I got it down. If you don't like phones that are too advanced and confusing then this phone is not for you. Definitely an acquired taste!
It is a great work tool for me.  It is a lot smaller than the old HW 6945 and it is definitely better-looking.As I'm never on one place, its mobility is great. Quick 3G internet, you can even run Skype on it while using the 3G network (low costs)I had an Iphone 3G but I prefer the HP Ipaq with its windows mobile 6.1 No hassle to put song, movies, pictures or other data on the phone and when needed just take out the memory card en put it in a computer or card reader.The way I use my Ipaq the battery lasts almost a day, so you'll need a car-charger or an extra battery.The down side is that when my Bluetooth headset is on it doesn't make any sounds or songs when a call or a message comes in. I also had some problems with the ROM update that didn't workout with Windows Vista, making the iPaq 910 unusable, but after trying to update with a windows XP computer it worked perfect again.I recommend this smart phone, it doesn't have the visual tricks that a HTC Diamond or an Iphone has, but it has an ease to use keyboard and buttons. With its GPS on I'll go anywhere.
The phone looks good on the surface. However, the audio quality from both the ear piece and the external speaker was very disappointing. I bought an extra 4GB of flash memory hoping to put in my favourite music and carry only one device with me when I hit the road but even with the volume control on maximum, the output from the external speakers is terrible for a phone costing this much and in this class.Another disappointing feature is the fairly sluggish processor speed which take a while to wake up from sleep and takes almost forever to snap a picture. Finally, the phone is not as intuitive to use as the Nokias.
a love it, but I hope that the alarms could choose an MP3 file , but only have simples bored ringtones.The sound of the ringtine is too low I can't listen it.BUT ALL THE FUNTIONS ARE GREAT
This phone is probably the worst phone I've ever seen, and certainly the worst phone I've ever used. It is actually user-hostile. On several occasions I've needed to use it to listen to a long conference call, and after about 15 minutes, te phone gets too hot to hold comfortably against the face. On one occasion after an hour of use, the screen started flashing a message about overheating battery!Battery life is miserable.There is no way to lock the touchscreen so holding it against your face can accidentally activate the soft-buttons, one of which is "disconnect" (Which by the way is inexplicably tiny and directly above the "Hold" button. On the subject of the screen, WHY did they make all the butons so small that it's virtually impossible to press them without the stylus?Battery life is miserablethe speaker is a mystery to me. when using the speakerphone function, the volume is so low as to make it unusable,and ringer volume is a joke. But when listening to music using the media player, it's very loud. WHY?Battery life is miserable.If you activate the security lock on the phone, 50% of the time you can't answer a call. You can try, and the phone thinks it has, but it doesn't actually connect the caller. People calling me have learned to just leave a quick message and wait for a call back.Battery life is miserable.Button responses are delayed so you're never quite sure if you've actually connected or disconnected a call. It can take upwards of a second to register. Maddening.Battery life really sucks.As a PDA, though, it's not bad, other than the miserable battery life. It's just that I thought I was buying a PHONE, not an email machine with a buggy afterthought of a voice device thrown in.
My first cell phone, and after a lot of research I went with TracFone over Net10 as I wanted something for emergencies/light use only as cheap as possible. Got on the Value Plan at TracFone after purchasing this phone-with the DMFL of this phone, that gives me 100 minutes a month (minutes rollover every month) and an automatic renewal every 30 days (don't have the hassle of keeping your plan from expiring) for only $9.99/month-can't beat that for price? If I need more minutes, I can still buy airtime cards etc.Now for the BIG caveat-they've crippled the Bluetooth/USB function on this phone! I see a lot of folks wondering how to get pictures etc off this phone-since the USB/Bluetooth file transfer function has been crippled, you have to e-mail pictures to yourself at a cost per minute!From research I knew of this, but figured I'd never use the Bluetooth except for earpiece hookups etc, so my preference of the W376g keyboard over the LG600G TracFone determined my choice. When I connected via Bluetooth to my Sony NV-U94T GPS, the phone function works fine (can make/receive calls hands free from the GPS), but when the GPS offers to receive transfer of my phonebook from my W376g, no go-I've hit one of the crippled Bluetooth functions!PROSCheapest plan I've found for emergency/light useSeems to be a quality unitLike the entire keyboard lighting up at nightExcellent sound qualityFM radio (works/reception great) with RDSCONS (and this is a biggie)Bluetooth/USB file transfer functions crippled!Web browswer key easy to accidentally hit (while scrolling). If you do so, 1/2 minute air time gone!If phone choice makes little difference to you, and you really hate the Bluetooth/USB file transfer function being crippled, you might opt for TracFone's LG600G. Far as I can tell, it's darn near equivalent to the W376g (no FM radio) but apparently they've not screwed with the Bluetooth/USB file transfer functions.Rated 3 stars-if they had not screwed with the Bluetooth/USB file transfers, I'd up it to 4 or 5 stars.EDIT: Just got OEM Motorola Stereo Handsfree Headset # CHYN4516B / #HS120 for Motorola Q/ MPX220/ A630/ V710/ E815/ E816/ V365/ V361/ V360/ V325i/ V323i/ V235/ ROKR E1 Cell Phones (from SF Planet) and am really impressed with the FM radio. I live in a fringe reception area, and the radio pulls in FM stations 45 to 60 miles out-much better than the radio on my Zune 80 does!
I've been using TracFone services for about five years and owned this particular model for about a year now and so far I have been very pleased. I use my phone to talk and text daily but it is still functioning like new and just shows a bit of wear on the outside. I spend a lot of time in rural Vermont but I still get excellent coverage; on a recent camping trip in Southern VT I was the only one of my friends to get cell phone service. The phone itself is very durable and has endured everything from drops and falls to subzero weather. The camera is a nice bonus although it is impossible to transfer a picture to a computer unless you send the picture to another phone. The internet service, while primitive, comes in handy if you need to know the weather and don't have access to television, radio, or computer. Overall, this is a reliable and easy to use phone and is a great buy for someone who wants to talk and text but doesn't need all the bells and whistles of a fancy phone.
This is such a GREAT phone! I signed up for the $10 monthly plan, which gives me 100 minutes per month for only $10!! I know people who pay $150+ each month for cell phone service! That's just crazy to me! The phone works perfectly for its purpose of placing and receiving calls. Don't expect a great camera or any fabulous toys on this unit; it is a PHONE! I have never had a call dropped or lost service and I live in a somewhat rural area. The only thing I miss from my last phone is the voice-dialing. This unit doesn't have it and I used it a lot on my last phone. The built-in FM tuner is really cool and even includes RDS, but you have to have a headset plugged in for it to work. I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, but plan to soon. The phone and service are so good that me, my wife, my mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and niece all have this same phone! For the value shopper who just wants a phone to talk with an occasionally take or send a picture I strongly recommend this phone and Tracfone service!
Just have to say, this is a great phone.  Had the model before this one w/o the camera.....dropped it in my coffee....anyway...great quality, good pics, great customer service. since i have switched over to prepaid cells about 2 yrs ago, I have found tracfone is the one. no monthly fee, no bs, very straight forward. i switched the two phones myself on their web site and even got my minutes doubled!!! no contracts, no hassles!...and this phone is made quite well. clear screen....can create your own style, bluetooth/fm capable. so you are really not missing out on much.  the brower takes a little long to load, but hey everything is not perfect. Just one last note, i have travled to maine with this 65 miles from the border, worked just fine.  great buy in my book!
This phone is hands down the best phone deal out there! Double Minutes! Camera! Flip Phone! All for $30?? I kept looking for the catch and I never found one. I bought the phone about a year ago and have had ZERO problems. It is also very easy to find BONUS CODES online to get extra minutes. If you only have a cell phone for convenience, and you AREN'T someone who talks all day on it!, then THIS IS THE PHONE FOR YOU! It averages out to me spending $10-15 a month instead of $70 or more for a plan! I love this phone!!!
I bought this phone to switch to Tracfone, since I was tired of paying Verizon a ton of money for minutes I didn't use anyway.  In just two months, the phone has paid for itself: I paid ~$33 for the phone (and double minutes for life) and $21 for 120 minutes (60 min + double minutes).  With Verizon, I would have paid about $70 for these two months.About the phone: the phone itself is very simple: it doesn't have many whistles, but it does its job just fine: making calls.  The only part I didn't like was the fact that I had to type in all the entries in my phone book since Tracfone disables the communications with a computer.  Some people didn't like the fact that you can't transfer pictures taken with the phone to a computer for free, but you have to send them to yourself as an email, using airtime minutes.The bottom line is that this is a very nice phone if you don't need any fancy stuff.
This is one great phone! I got mine via TracFone's site. For under $30 and double minutes for life, you can't go wrong. I even am able to browse the web and email photos, including to twitpic for twitter! I got a 1 yr. card and then I called TracFone and they transferred my minutes and remaining time from my old TracFone to the new one and deactivated the old one. Easy and great customer service. And it works with a Jabber Bluetooth headset I bought at a local Walgreens! Three caveats though are no voice activated dialing and they disabled the USB port so you can't connect to a PC. The USB port is for charging the battery only. The third thing is that they don't allow short-code SMS. So you can't use it with things like Twitter (unless you email a photo via twitpic). Other than that, I really love this phone. TracFone sure has come a long way! I recommend this to anyone that is on a budget and needs a good phone with a few extras.
After having so many troubles of trying to find a nearby payphone after some situation or other I decided it was time to buy a cellphone but which way to go?,  after hearing so many problematic stories with companies like AT&T; or Verizon and hearing how with most companies like these you had to at least sign a two-year contract with about a $175.00 or $150.00 payment for early cancellation fees I heard about Tracfone and prepaid cellphones and haven't regretted that choice since then.  Like what most expect the Motorola is a good phone and with this one you can access the web and text friends as well though as said by an earlier reviewer you get charged minutes off your airtime total when you do this,  but when I purchased this model Tracfone had put an added bonus with it double minutes meaning as most would expect you pay for 60 minutes and 120 minutes is added to your airtime.  Now the real question for a buyer is probably going to have to be are you using the cellphone for just calls and some texting or the added bonuses of listening to music watching videos and such an such(Though you can download some news and sports information with it costing you airtime minutes),  now you can listen to music on this phone and download some wall papers or new ring tones if you wish but sadly there's no video streaming on this model but for myself I have no problem with that since I feel that if you're going to watch a video than see t.v. or if you're going to listen to music get an mp3 player or Ipod.  So for anyone who's ever been in a situation regretting not having a cellphone here's a great one to check out but for the younger generation or those who wish to have the newest fad on cellphones than you probably want to try something else.
Excellent value for your money. Tracfone service is great - my screen died after a few months, and after only 20 minutes to customer service, they had arranged a replacement which arrived in 3 days. Upon activation, the replacement had all my minutes, phone number, and "double minutes" transferred. I keep spare Tracphones handy for overseas visitors to use. Great deal, great service, without any long-term commitments.
I've used TracFone for several years and I know that there's a good chance that I'll have some difficulty when dealing with them, but I like TracFone because it fits my needs.  But this time after purchasing a TracFone from Amazon the difficult issue with TracFone really went beyond difficulty.  After receiving the TracFone from Amazon, I went on line to activate the phone and after entering all the necessary information suchas phone model, serial number, SIM Card Number, name and address, e-mail and phone number, I was directed to an automated phone number because the SIM Card Number was in error.  After entering all the same information again, I was again directed to call the 800 number for Technical Support.  I spoke with someone that I had a very hard time understanding what they were saying, plus they must have been in one large room with other people dealing with other people's issues like myself, as the voices in the background were very distracting.  After going through the same routine as before, I gave them the same information again.  I was told the SIM Card Number was no good and they would send me a new one in seven to ten days.  I received the new SIM Card Number and installed it according to the directions.  The phone would still no work.  I went through the same routine as I previously described.  I was told that the second SIM Card Number was bad and they would send another new card in seven to ten days.  After 14 days, I still had not received a new SIM Card, so I called TracFone again.  They said they didn't send a new card because of an error in their computer.  I was then connected with a supervisor, who was not sure as to what was causing the problem with the SIM Cards and was not sure as to what the next step would be, but she would have someone call within 24-48 hours.  No one ever called, so I felt that after spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone with three people, I was not going to call them again, so I finally had enough and decided to return the phone to Amazon for credit.  I like TracFone, but they really dropped the ball when it comes to dealing with customer problems.
I purchased this phone last December.  I have since discovered that this is a reconditioned phone and have had some problems.  The speakerphone is extremely garbled and to hard to hear even when it is mere inches from your ear and the volume is maxed out.  Sometimes I miss calls even thought THE RINGER IS ON and the phone is close by. (It will chirp when it goes to voicemail, but at random times it will not ring when I receive a call.)  This is my third tracfone, and I had very good past experiences with their customer support in the past, however regarding this phone I only received a "helpful" email to remind me to "make sure the ringer is indeed on" and let them know if the problem continues.  And to top things off, the power on/off button only works when it wants to.  I have to be quite careful to never let the battery get to low because if it powers off, it will sometimes take up to 8 or 9 tries of holding the button down for a minimum of 40 seconds to get the phone back on.If the features (and all the buttons)on this phone were fully functional, I would not hesitate to give this phone a 5 star rating.  It has fun ring tones, takes fairly good photos and the camera feature is simple enough my now 3 year old son can take photos with it.
I am not an avid cell phone user, so pardon my review. Coverage in my area of the country is limited, thus cell phones aren't all they are cracked up to be. This motorola W376 seems to work ok. Needless to say I don't use the internet feature. The double minutes are a boone. Not being able to easily download pictures to my desktop computer is a disappointment. (A search for a workaround on the internet was fruitless.) So the long and short of it, I bought it for the convenience of the occasional call I needed to make that the shortage of phone booths are not helping. It has clear reception. I would probably buy another one if this one broke. Battery life can be improved if you don't leave it on all the time (it likes to search for a signal all the time... power drain alot of places I go.) I don't like that I get charged receiving and sending text messages. But its only at 1/2 minute per text message. Also personal ringtones are limited to the old midi type if you want a "free" one, else you have to pay for one.
It's an okay phone nothing special in opinion but beware of their family plan. I bought one phone ordered a second and tried to enroll it under the plan. Can't enroll it. Two hour long calls and there was nothing the company could do to enroll the phone. So while they say you can enroll a second plan on the web site you can't. The service was terrible by the way busy signals numerious transfers and holds. This is definitely a low budget company.
I previously owned a TracFone and Net10 Phone and never experienced any problems.  However, the purchase, porting, and activation of my Motorola W376 TracFone has been the worst customer service experience that I've ever had in my life.I began the activation process on the internet in early February 2009 by requesting that my old Boost Mobile cell phone number be ported to my new cell phone.  Initially I provided only my old number as I didn't have an account number.  I was contacted by TracFone and they requested that I contact Boost Mobile and obtain my account number.  I obtained my account number and advised TracFone customer service.  I then receive another phone call indicating that I needed to provide a Pin Number. So I provide that information as well.  I then receive repeated phone calls claiming that the information I provided was not correct.  Eventually, a three way phone call between TracFone, Boost Mobile, and myself was arranged.  Boost Mobile confirmed that the information that I provided was correct.  So again I wait, assuming that the problem was resolved.  Then in late February I receive a letter indicating that the porting of my number was "delayed due to incomplete or inaccurate information" and was advised to contact another number for assistance.  At this number I was advised that my SIM card wouldn't port, and that I would be sent another SIM card through the mail.In early March I thought finally my problems would be over.  I received and installed the SIM card and called back as requested.  The phone was finally activated and I indicated that I would add additional minutes online.  After all the delays, I had forgotten that my phone came with double minutes for life and ordered the 800 minutes with double minutes for life at the price of $139.99.  To my surprise the minutes were not added to the phone and I again had to call customer service.  The lady on the phone was nice enough to inform me that I made a mistake in my order, but to my surprise was unwilling to correct it.  I complained but it was obvious that I was getting nowhere.  The minutes I ordered were added to the phone.  I decided I would call back and would insist that the second double minutes for life be removed.  I figured this would result in a $40.00 refund to my credit card as 400 minutes (doubled to 800 minutes) costs $99.99.  I called back and again got nowhere with customer service.  I asked to speak to a supervisor who was apologetic but indicated that there was nothing she could do.  She indicated, however, that she would refer me to a higher level and that someone would get back to me.  Well I waited over a week for a response and received none, so instead of calling again and getting the run around, I decided to send an e-mail.  By e-mail I was provided a number to call for credit card adjustments.  I thought I was finally making progress, however when I called I was again advised that nothing could be done.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was informed pretty bluntly that it was my mistake and there was nothing they could do about it.I subsequently wrote a letter to the Tracfone Resolution Department. In response I received a phone call offering me 30 additional minutes of airtime.  I turned it down as it does not adequately compensate me for my time, trouble, and expense.  To learn more about Tracfone's terrible customer service, enter Tracfone complaints in your search engine.  Based on my experience, I will never buy another Tracfone product.
This would be a perfect cheap phone except for the battery life. My old Nokia held a charge much longer. This phone quickly loses a charge while turned off. I have had it four months and I had to buy a new battery. What a shame.
I've had this phone for a while and it's a great phone for the price - complete with camera and browser.  And I do like the payment plan.  However, I frequenty lose "bars" - I am unable to use the phone in my very own apartment.  Most evenings the bars cut out in the elevator on the way up to my apartment.  Sometimes after an hour or so the bars will come back and I can use the phone.  Sometimes the bars will come back if I turn the phone off and turn it on again.  Sometimes the bars will not come back unless I go outside, wait for the bars to come back, and then hope the elevator goes non-stop to my apartment.  Sometimes the bars won't come back until I leave the house the next morning to go to work.  Customer service did send me a new SIM card but the thought of trying to get a new SIM card activitated makes me want to vomit (customer service is in Mumbai) and truth be told, I believe the problem is not the SIM card - the problem is the fact that Tracfone does not own cell towers - they only lease space on the towers.  Last summer I spent August in a rented house 110 miles east of where I live and the only way I was able to get bars was to climb on the roof of the house.  Sometimes when I send a picture, it doesn't go through.  Yet minutes are deducted.
Dealing with Tracfone has been a nightmare so far. I ordered two phones from my favorite site, AMAZON.COM. Following the instructions on the Tracfone site I tried to port my two #s from Verison. It turned out that only one # was ported and they gave a new # to the other phone. Also the phone with the correct # does not make or accept calls. When I contacted Customer Service, I was told they would work on the porting problem from the first phone and after being on the phone for 30 mins I was told the problem on the second phone was resolved and it will now work. To my serprise it did not. When I called back the next day the rep. agreed that the phone did not work, and customer service would again address the problem.S0 currently I have one phone that workes, but with the wrong #, and another that has the correct # but does not work. I hope they will resolve this problem soon so I can write another review.
The W376 Motorola has all the features that you would ever want in a cell phone.  Given that it is a prepaid tracfone - makes it even better.  Texting is a breeze and the keys react VERY quickly to touch response time.  Camera is a typical cell phone camera, not great - but what do you expect from a cell phone camera??  It is handy to take pictures of "in the moment", so in my eyes this camera does just fine. The ability to access the web is present and works just fine.
I am very happy with this phone - and especially with double minutes for life.  Good to be out from under a 2 yr contract for minutes never used and which do not roll over!!!  My only criticism is that the directions for setup were a bit sketchy - not so good for the tech-illiterate like myself. Neither Amazon's support person, nor Tracfone's support person were a great deal of help - seems I am one of the first to own this particular model.  But we all muddled thru together.
I bought this phone for my mom for mothers day. Cool looking and a lot better than the blue nokia. only thing is it charges more for texting. also there have been a couple times where the phone has turned itself off and she has to plug it into the charger to fix it. I dont know why, other than that camera is nice, voice talk is good. sleek looking and very few complaints
I have the correct cord. How do I get the software that applies to this particular cell phone (Motorola W376g) without internet access on my PC (XP operating software)?
At http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Prepaid-Double-Minutes-Tracfone/dp/B001B15ARU/ref=pd_sbs_misc?ie=UTF8&qid;=1251328664&sr;=8-1 the item is titled "W376" but the text keeps referring to "W376g."  It caught my eye because it says it has Bluetooth connectivity, which presumably means it can swap data with your computer or other Bluetooth devices.  According to http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-W376g-BlueTooth-Camera-TRACFONE/dp/B002EXMJ7S/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top the W376g does NOT have such connectivity.
Actually, I liked the phone but I'm in a CDMA only area (there are cornfields in the city limits)! I traded with Tracfone for one that did work, but no camera :< So it pays to do your homework,sigh!
First of all, I love Net10, I have no complaints about their service or price.  I am not a heavy phone user.  I had a monthly plan for a few years and never came close to using all of my minutes so why pay for them.  Net10 is the perfect solution.  I get by with $30 every other month.About the phone itself, it is OK.  I love the size, it is thin and easy to carry in hand or pocket.  Keypad is easy to use.  Features are basic and easy to use.  It is a phone to make calls, not a gps, computer, or camera.  My only complaint is the sound.  People on the other end do not seem to have trouble hearing me, but from my end they sound a little quiet and as if they are in a tunnel.  Feel like I am always saying "what?"  It does not seem to be the reception of the call, but the lack of clarity in the earpiece.But, since I only talk on the phone 30min/wk at the most, I'm willing to put up with it for now.  Also, I bought this phone on sale for $19.99 with 300 minutes, so basically I made $10 in the deal.  I am happy to tolerate the could-be-better sound quality until something better comes along.
In this age where Bluetooth, WiFi, touchscreen, mp3/video players, FM radio, GPS navigation, PDAs, memory expansion slots, voice recognition, web browsers, digital cameras, polyphonic ringtones, etc. are being incorporated into mobile phones, the LG 300 is a severely stripped-down phone that doesn't have ANY of the aforementioned features. It's just a barebones, no-frills phone that's reminiscent of the mobile phones in the 90's. Not surprisingly, then, the LG 300 is nothing to write home about.But I will say this -- the LG 300 is sleek and one of the most compact and lightweight mobile phones I've seen. The battery life on standby time is about 4 days. I can't speak to its battery life on talk time because I've never had a long enough phone conversation to determine it. It uses a lithium ion battery so there won't be a problem with "memory effect."If you need a basic cell phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies, this compact phone is a good deal and Net10 is a good service to go with:Free Phone----------Why buy this phone used or refurbed when you can get this brand new LG 300G Prepaid Phone (Net10) with 300 Minutes Included? For starters, for [...] bucks you get this phone PLUS 300 minutes. Since Net10 sells add-on 300 minutes in airtime for 30 bucks, you're in effect getting this phone for free.Cheap Rates-----------At 10 cents per minute for local or long distance calls, the Net10 phone service is simply the best deal. Text messages cost only 5 cents to send or receive.No Hidden Charges-----------------No wireless contracts or penalties for early cancellation. No roaming charges. 10 cents per minutes, plain and simple.Rollover minutes----------------If you buy more minutes before your old minutes expire, your old minutes will roll over and expire the same time as your new minutes. Minutes will keep rolling over for as long as add more minutes before your current minutes expire.The airtime available for purchase come in 150, 300, and 180 minutes:cost in dollars/airtime in minutes/expiration in days15/150/3030/300/60180/1800/603 Convenient Ways To Add Minutes--------------------------------You can add minutes by:1) buying Net10 phone cards2) buying airtime through the Net10 Website3) buying airtime directly from the LG 300 phone.To buy airtime directly from the phone, you are required to set up a PIN at the Net10 Website. You will be asked for this PIN whenever you add airtime through your phone.Decent Coverage---------------Net10 reportedly uses both AT&T; (formerly Cingular) and T-Mobile networks. Most of the time, I have no problems with coverage in my area, although I do get dropped calls every now and then.Frustrating Tech Support------------------------My only major complaint about Net 10 is their tech support (-1 star). I've had to call them on a few occasions. Their tech support, which is outsourced, is slow and getting through can sometimes feel like pulling teeth. For example, on one occasion, it took me 50 minutes on the phone with them to transfer my number from this LG300G phone to a new one.The worse was yet to come. On another occasion, I was told matter-of-factly that it would take up to 72 hours to get my number transferred. "72 hours?!" I cried. The response I received was a nonchalant "72 hours. It takes up to 72 hours to transfer you number. Don't call before 72 hours." I was incensed. After 48 hours, I called them again, and this time another operator (who sounded slightly more intelligent) managed to get my number transferred within a couple of minutes. The moral of the story: Net 10 is a descent service to go with provided you don't have to make too many tech support calls (I haven't had to call them for anything other than transferring my phone number to a new phone). You have been forewarned.Conclusion----------The Net 10 service offers the cheapest prepaid cell phone service. Despite the less-than-stellar customer service and tech support, I'd recommend the Net 10 LG300G Prepaid Phone for making an occasional call or for emergencies.
Excellent prepaid phone.We never experienced any problems with it what so ever.We live in Texas and even when visiting relatives 400 miles from home all the way to the other side of Louisiana we were able to make and receive clear non interrupted reception.I highly recommend this phone.TracFone Wireless Digital Prepaid Plan + Motorola W376 Prepaid Phone with Double Minutes for Life
I got this phone after I gave up my contract with Alltel because of insane fees. I'm using it as an "in between" phone until I decide to sign another contract with someone else. For a pre-paid phone, I'm quite happy. The phone itself has all the basic functions I need and isn't complicated to use. It's compact and light-weight. I can easily fit it in the pocket of my jeans when I don't want to carry a bag--and it has a key lock feature to keep it from dialing while in my pocket.I've had two problems with this phone/service. When I originally activated it, I called my house phone to test it out. The caller ID showed a woman's name who I had never heard of. However, I contacted the customer service and the issue was cleared up within 24 hours. The other problem I've had is with volume control. It took me 15 minutes to find how to set my phone to vibrate instead of ring at the movie theater. Once I figured it out, though, it was no problem. It just isn't listed in the settings as you might expect. It's under ringer volume, instead of a separate setting for vibrate.All in all, no big issues. The phone feels almost like a children's toy in terms of weight, but it's durable. Battery life seems great. It lasts for two or three days, even with me using the phone. Net10's rates for minutes are great, IMHO. I haven't found another company that offers as many minutes for the price that they do. And you get 300 minutes with the phone. You're totally set for 60 days from the second you buy the phone. You have to spend a minimum of $20 every 60 to keep the service. This is nothing compared to your average contract deal. There's even an on-screen display that tells you exactly how many minutes you have left, and how many days of service are left until you need a new card. If you need all the fancy features of a smart phone, this isn't the one for you, but if you're looking for an "in between" phone like I was, or a simple phone for routine tasks, I would recommend this one. Great deal.
I love this phone!Have had 3 of them & would definelety reccomend it,good reception & features & what's best is the battery lasts a very long time!
i purchased this net10 phone at a Radio Shack after researching online for a while. I've never had a 'track' phone so I didn't want to screw it up.  This phone is for my 7-almost-8-year old twins to take to camp.  This one comes with 300 minutes and 60 days of service.  WE LOVE IT!  I don't get the bad reviews I've seen on Amazon, except it definately is not as nice as an I-Phone or Blackberry. But for my little girls, it is easy, fun(has a few games), cute standard backgrounds/ring tones and even gets reception in notorious areas of town that MY cellPHONE doesn't! I've had to use their phone a few times because mine didn't work!Also, the Radio Shack clerks set it up in the store, I paid $29.99 plus tax and viola, in 5 minutes we have a great little cell phone for my kids!I love that the display shows how many days of service you have, plus you can add minutes/time directly from the phone!  When my Sprint phone 2-year contract expires next month, I'm getting one of these too! NOTE: Only charge for 5 hours at a time; do NOT overcharge or it will stop working. Otherwise, its absolutely perfect!
Pros: good reception, phone comes loaded with 300 minutes. Nice looking design with a bright, full color screen and buttons that light up blue. Comes with 20 MIDI ringtones, 2 games, and nice choice of wallpapers. Text messages cost 5 cents each. Easy to add minutes right from the phone or online.Cons: has a sort of "plastic toy" feel to it. Very light, very small. Takes some practice to avoid pressing multiple buttons at once. Callers sound slightly muffled. Cannot download new ringtones or wallpaper. Not recommended for heavy phone users or newbies.This is a cheap, no frills phone. It is not a multimedia device. It doesn't take pictures, surf the internet, send emails, or play MP3s. It makes and receives calls and texts and stores phone numbers. To be honest it's a cute little cheap piece of plastic for people who want a cell phone for emergencies or to make occasional calls. Heavy callers, texters, or people that tend to be hard on their stuff should think twice before buying this phone.On the other hand if you are someone that tends to keep your phone nice and shiny, you are a reasonably competent technology user, and you only want to make the occasional call this is an attractive, reliable little phone for a good price.
I bought this phone when I was in town for leave and will definitely be reactivating it when I get back to the states.  The phone plans are no strings attached, and I can buy minutes straight off my phone, in a store, or off the internet. The website is easy to use, and the phone isn't cheap at all.  This might even replace my current cell phone plan.  Very pleased overall.
Most reviews of this phone are grounded, but a few seem to have higher expectations than maybe they should have for this type of device.  You're not talking about a $250 Verizon model or an iPhone here, folks.  It's a $29.95 (retail), plastic, BASIC, no-thrills, cell phone.  Frankly, it's amazing that for that price you can get something with a color LCD screen that actually gets cell receptions at all.  So my 4-star rating is based on the features and quality of this phone FOR THE PRICE.I use Verizion as my main cell provider, but sometimes I like to sell things on Craig's List or Ebay and want to have a way for people to contact me if they have questions about something I'm selling.  I do not however, want to give them my main cell number.  So I got this Net10 phone for that specific purpose - as a more anonymous way of communicating with strangers who I don't know, who call to ask about products.  For that, it's great.While plastic, overall the phone is pretty sturdy except perhaps for the upper battery door area with is somewhat "creeky" when you hold the camera and press in (it gives, slightly).  The buttons are small and yes, you can accidentally press two at one if you have sausage fingers, but a small amount of paying attention will solve this - it's not designed to be a hard-core "texting" phone, and for that, you should buy a phone with a full keyboard.  They do glow a pleasant Blue color when in use, by the way - another minor but amazing feature at this price. The LCD screen though lower resolution, works fine enough for what it is.  The reception is excellent, actually being better than my LG Dare when indoors.  The ear speaker is just a bit fuzzy, making folks sound like they're talking through a cloth - but still not super bad.  People I talk to say the microphone is great, and they can hear me clearly.  No camera, no 3D video games, no multi-phase transporter... sorry.... not for $29.95!My only real complaint?  You use your minutes when you check voice mail.  Maybe I'm being cheap, but I figure if you're just calling in to check messages, they should charge a flat 5-cent or 10-cent rate for the entire call, and not a "per minute" charge for it.  So if you tend to ignore calls and let a lot of them to go voice mail, keep this in mind as just checking your messages frequently WILL use your minutes.Ok, now, I do have to say that I would NOT use this or any cheap prepaid phone as a full time cell phone.  I'm one of those people who feel that cheap plastic and cell signals do equal radioactivity in your brain.  So I prefer to get something built substantially better if I'm going to talk for hours a month on it.  Likewise, if I had teens, I probably wouldn't want to fry their brains ahead of time by letting them use a device such as this as much as they do.  But for occasional use, and for people who don't LIVE on their cell phones (yes, those people still exist), I think this represents a great value for the price.
In tough economic times, you be glad you have this phone.Net 10 is a nation wide phone service available without a contract. They have charge 0.10$ per minute and 0.05$ for text messages.Their phones vary in price and start at 29.99$ with 300 included minutes.Compared to all other no-contract cellular services, Net 10 is by far the cheapest and their wireless coverage is comparable to AT&T.;The LG300 is great phone because it gives you the Net 10 cellular service, 300 included minutes, and the low price tag of only 29.99$Other people might consider getting a Net 10 phone with a camera, but that is a mistake because those phones cost up to an additional 30.00 and they're nothing special, definately not worth the additional money.This particular phone is great because it comes with some cool wallpapers, decent generic ringtones, two games, and a rubber keypad to make dialing numbers very easy. Its sleek black exterior has a nice look and the bright blue keys look great in the dark.I am a satisfied Net 10 customer and highly reccomend this phone.
Net10 will drive you crazy with their insane customer service! Sooner or later. It's just not worth it! I've been with them; long enough to see their true colors. I finally decided that the long DAYS, waiting for problem resolution, just isn't worth it! They can keep my left over minutes. I'm sorry I ever paid them a penny! I'm tired of begging them, to do right by me. It's an entire system of denial. There a distinct attitude of entitlement; emanating from the company, and it's true policy. Their attitude is pay, then shut up, or go away. Don't say I didn't tell you.
Pro - easy to get started, has a web site to "manage phone(s)". Phone service and phones are low end for higher per minute cost than most national brands, but in line with their fellow service providers. Phone does work, service outage experience is similar to that of national brands.Con - very, very time consuming to deal with if ANYTHING goes wrong, which it naturally does.. often.Phone support is1. very mechanical "at best"2. very often quite ineffictive at things taking more than 1 step to fix (will you hold for another x minutes while I call (someone else) to do xyz?... repeat this loop endlessly.. when done phone still does not work...3. Refund is NOT POSSIBLE, even if tracfone admits it cannot deliver what you bought from them.4. Marketing is "IN YOUR FACE" type of shrill.
I ordered this phone, but when I received and activated it, it didn't work.  They sent a new Sim card, phone still didn't work.  This was a "reconditioned" phone--BEWARE!!.  Now I have to return the phone at my expense to get my money back (less postage).  Bad, Bad, Bad deal.  And the customer service was the worst I've ever had--being put on hold repeatedly, speaking with employees whose English was beyond poor, and finally being told I would have to pay to return a product that never worked.  My advice is to avoid this company and the  reconditioned LG300g phone.  I  have been without a cell phone for 2-3 weeks, not a happy thing when you're traveling.Going to Virgin Mobile.
I'd like to tell you about the phone or something like that but can't because the phone still hasn't activated, several days now after I started the process.  I chose Net 10 because I'm a light user and the value seemed to be good for that.  As I'm coming from another provider, I asked that my old number be ported over.  That's what I'm waiting for, even though my previous provider disconnected within hours of my request via Net 10.  Net 10's reps (via email) keep saying "it should take 24 to 48 hours" (which I'm beyond) while almost everyone I've spoken to, including people who sell these phones, says it should take hours at most.  Earlier today I spoke by phone to a rep who apologized and promised it would be done within "2 to 4 hours."  When that didn't happen I called back and a different rep rudely kept insisting that it takes "7 to 10 days" but then ended up telling me to it should be done "tomorrow"!It better be, or this phone is going back and I'm going with someone else.
Perhaps the particular phone I had was a lemon. I have had four Net10 phones, and this one, and only this one, made memiserable.  With the ring volume on max, I could rarely hear the phone ring. With the earpiece sound on max, I could often not hear the caller well. With the alarm clock volume, I over slept. The only thing it was good for was a game of Soduku!
I was willing to overlook that the phone doesn't have a headset jack.  But the purpose of any phone is to communicate, and this one barely does that. I had to max out the earpiece volume to hear at a decent level.  And when I left myself a message at work to check the mic quality, the sound was very muffled and barely intelligible.  I was looking for just an inexpensive phone with decent audio quality to replace my house phone for rare use.  This isn't it.  Not sure if the problem is Net10 or the LG phone.
Ok, I'm upset, I have this exact phone.  Just a warning, don't fall behind or let the time expire, because if you buy a phone card and use it with 0 days left, someone else will recieve your minutes and you'll be out $$$.  Mine lapsed about a month and 1/2, so I'm thinking they re-issued the serial number on another phone.  They told me when I called customer service I'd have my minutes in 24 hours, and now it's been two days, and still no minutes, and this didn't happen with my virgin phone.  SO, if you want a little forgivness, virgin is a best bet, but if you lapse on this phone, you might as well use it to store phone numbers.
Cheap phone.Sounds like you're talking in a wind tunnel.Lots of dropped calls.Get used to hearing "Huh?"..."Can you repeat that?"..."Say what?"This service and this phone are NOT a deal by any stretch of the imagination.Bottom of the barrel as far as cell phone plans go.But then again, what do you expect for $15.00/month?You get what you pay for.Which in this case...ain't much.
This is a slim flip style phone that you get the basic description up above. I will concentrate reviewing what may help you decide if it's right for you.First go to the Tracfone website to do several things. You will input your zip code to see what phones are available in your area (on the buy phone tab). After confirming your city, carefully check the web address page that will appear in your browser. Somewhere in the string of characters there will be either a GSM5AT (ATT and Tmobile), GSM5 (Tmobile), or GSM4 (ATT). Those are the two providers that Tracfone currently uses. This code will tell you who is in your area. If you are lucky to be in a dual provider area, select your W260g (or actually any other) carefully by looking at the white label on the bottom of the box (if shopping in a store). The phones (and sim cards) are specific to only one provider. The top line of the white label will have a string that will contain either TFMTW260SP5PSDM (Tmobile) or TFMTW260SP4SDM (ATT). Pick a phone for a provider that you have better coverage with in the area that you will be using the phone most often. You cannot swap a P4 sim into a P5 phone and vice versa. They are sold married to each other only.Second, select this phone in a "Bonus Pack" package only. It is only a couple of bucks more and includes car and home charger, a case, earphone and most important "Free Double Minutes For Life" (FDML). That is what the last two digits in the code above stand for. This means when you buy a 60 minute card, you will get 120 minutes, etc.Third, always Google "bonus codes" and Tracfone when buying air time for current offers that will add even more minutes to your card/phone. I typically buy a 60 minute card, get double minutes up to 120, then get 60 additional bonus code minutes. So a 60 minute card can get you 180 minutes.Fourth, activate on line on Tracfone website. You will get 10 minutes free.Fifth, when you first get assigned a new phone number, be aware that someone may have had it before you. They may have had a "history", such as bad credit. If you don't want to load up your voice mail with unwanted messages, do not set up the voice mail for a couple of weeks, or have Tracfone "unset it" up for you. You can also set the unwanted caller numbers up as "ignore a, b, c, d etc" in the directory. You then hit "ignore" soft button (the one on the right of select circle)when they call, and not lose any minutes.Now the rest of the review. The phone looks nice and modern with a sleek shiny black surface. Feels good in the hand. The charging and earphone openings have plastic covers that swing out of the way when needed. Unfortunately when you unplug the charger you tend to grab the both the plug and the cover, and the plug feels like it does not want to come out, or worse it does come out with the plastic cover.The battery life seems optimistic at 6.5 hours talk time and 18 days standby. While futzing with the phone and all its features (not on the air, but with screen on all the time) I managed to run down the battery in about 3 hours. Not using the phone much at all I had to recharge it in 4 days. That is still good for a GSM phone.Keypad is just OK, the circular pad is a bit small and I wind up occasionally hitting one of the arrows rather than the center circle.The screen quality is good. You can only set the contrast, not the brightness. The various W260s I saw, had a good degree of variation between them some bright with a bluish tinge, some dimmer and yellowish. Both are very acceptable.The reception and voice quality are good to very good (not excellent). I had both the Tmobile and ATT versions, and in my case the ATT had much better signal strength.The supplied earphone (bonus pack) is single ear, pretty good quality, the clip on holster is very good, and both home and car chargers fully recharge the batteries in about three hours (updated information).PS Tracfone customer support has been excellent. They answer on the first ring, sometimes are a bit difficult to understand, but get the job done.
I purchased this phone from another site.  I have had it about 3 weeks.  So far, it is a good basic phone, and the battery life seems pretty good. The Tracphone pre-paid rate is good if you have the double minutes, and they offer promotions that give you extra minutes when you purchase time.The main problem I had with it is that the instructions in the manual for selecting a different ringtone were poor.  Neither I nor a friend could figure out how to get to the advertised 35 pre-loaded ringtones. (Both of us have owned cell phones before.) After several failed attempts, Tracfone's customer service (both a tech rep and his supervisor) said it didn't have different ringtones.  (They also said that feature wasn't advertised for the phone on their website, although it is.)  I called back a second time to complain that the features listed for the phone on Tracfone's website were misleading.  This time, the technical rep led me through several different series of steps, similar to what I had tried before and, finally, after several different attempts and conferences with her supervisor, it worked, and the ringtones were displayed for me to select from.  I don't know why it was so hard to do at first, but I have never before had this much of a problem setting this on a cell phone. I am pleased with it now that the ringtone is set--you can set the volume for the loud ring so that it is fairly loud.  The customer service has always been courteous.(If you have a problem with the ringtones, here is what you do:from main menu select Ring Styles -> Style -> Loud Ring -> Select.The phone will display "changed style", then return to Ring Styles with "Loud Ring Detail" on 2nd line.Select Loud Ring Detail -> Alarms, and an "Alarms" menu will be diplayed, begiining with "Silent".  If you continue to scroll down, you can see (and hear) the ringtones.  Seems straight-forward, but like I said, I made numerous tries with no success.  Repeat for "Soft ring".  Ringtones will not display if phone is set to vibrate.)I haven't noticed any other problems. My needs are relatively basic, and I don't talk on the phone frequently, although I keep it on during the daytime.  I don't text, so I can't comment on that.btw This is my first experience with Tracfone.  I activated the phone after purchase, was given a number, then started the process to transfer my phone number from my previous cell phone carrier.  They said they would send me a new sim card for my new number.  I assumed I would have use of the cell phone using the number assigned on activation, but instead I was without cell phone service until my new sim card arrived.  They did FedEx the sim card to me, but in the past I have not had a disruption in cell phone service to transfer my old number.  I don't know if this is their standard procedure, but it was unexpected and somewhat inconvenient.
We got rid of our land line, we hardly ever used it anymore and long distance was too expensive in our area. We chose the Motorola W260g Prepaid Phone (Tracfone) because it was affordable, and came with the proper accessories and it also came with a plan that everytime we bought minutes it doubled them. The minutes are easy to buy, either you go to the store and purchase them, purchase them online, or you can buy a plan that adds them every month. Its super easy to set up and use, adding phone numbers is a cinch, and its display is simple and direct. I didnt want any bells and whistles on this phone, we didnt want a camera, or internet capability, or whatever else all the more expensive phones have to offer. I wanted to be able to make calls, send texts, and recieve both. I also didnt care about different ringtones because to me thats not what is important in this product.The battery lasts a long time, charging is easy also.I would recommend this phone for anyone who just wants a plain, simple, product that works!
I have had cell phones since the 80's. I always had phones from the big carriers.  They would die/break etc.  They came packed with features I never bothered with.  After getting completely aggravated with my last service provider I did not renew my contract and I picked this phone up.  It is very simple, it seems flimsy but it's actually worked better than some of my higher end phones. I use my phone for the occasional phone call home or to a friend. I don't live on it.  I have also used it to text a few times.  My son has dropped it a couple of times and it's fine (not so with my last 3g phone) If you just need something basic without the hassle of a contract I would not hesitate to recommend this phone.Updated: It is May 2013 and my phone is still going strong. No issues at all.  It has been drooled on, chewed on, dropped, left in the car in extremely cold and hot weather. It still works.
I purchased this phone from another site and had nothing but problems from the start. I wrote Tracfone that they wouldn't get any word of mouth support from me! The phone quit working at least six times, and I had to call each time to have the phone recoded which would take at least a frustrating 20 minutes. The phone would work for a quick check call, I'd go to make a call an hour later and the phone would have "broke". I went through three or four days of this, and they finally agreed to send me a new phone. I had the same problem with the next phone, but THIS time they didn't have to recode the phone, making me feel like THEY were disrupting my service deliberately. I ended up taking the second phone back to the store after feeling completley jerked around, without getting my money back for the airtime I had purchased. I have never been so mad about buying a product, or customer service, or feeling GIPPED! I wrote them a scathing e-mail, and they couldn't even offer me an apology- just a form e-mail in return. I will NEVER deal with them again! Completely taken for a ride! I'd give it zero stars if this would get published.
I used a Tracfone for a few years with decent results--the phone was fine in most basic ways. Recently, though, after my first problem that required customer service, I decided to cancel my service. As I've learned again and again in my life, a company's true merits emerge when a problem arises and a consumer seeks reasonably fair resolution.In my case, I just lost $100 of minutes due to Tracfone's error, and despite my calls to 3 service reps and 2 supervisors, I received nothing more than an apology. Unethical companies like this don't deserve my business--or yours. I should have trusted the army of web reviewers who've issued similar warnings, and now I find myself adding to that list. By the way, I'm moving to T-Mobile's pre-paid plan, which I've found offers slightly lower rates for my particular needs and, most important for me, significantly better customer service with local reps available.NOTE: If you check out my other Amazon reviews, you'll notice that I usually only take time to review products and services that I especially enjoy. Like most of us, I'm too busy to do more. In this case, though, with clearly unethical behavior and lost money involved, I simply feel the need to warn others like you.
I purchased this phone from Tracfone for my 11-year-old, knowing that it doesn't have a camera (because we don't want her to have a camera right now).  It works well for basic functions and seems very durable.  We give her 50 minutes per month automatically through the Tracfone monthly value plan, then she has to earn any additional minutes (good life lesson!).The one big limitation that I was disappointed in was that it has no MMS receive capability (i.e. it can't receive pictures from other phones).  The previous phone that we tried from Tracfone (the Motorola W370) also did not have a camera but it did include MMS messaging, so we assumed that the W260g did have MMS.If you want to receive MMS/picture messages even if you don't have a camera, choose the W370 rather than the W260g.Tracfone should make this very clear on their website:  right now it's very misleading and leads  you to potentially choose the wrong phone.  To determine which non-camera phones have MMS, look in the phone description details on Tracfone's site to see if they list "picture messaging" in the features.
I saw a TracFone claim that they cover over 95% of the US. If you go to the tracFore web site, you can see that there alot of areas where there is no service.I spend alot of time in central Wisconsin and am unable to use my TracFone unless I am close to an interstate highway.
I have had this phone about 8 months. I have used it about 550 min. only as a basic phone (duh, that's all you can use it for).  Reception (ATT) is OK-not what I'd like, but I live in a rural hilly area;sometimes I have to go outside to get connection. As this is my first cell phone, I cannot compare reception to others. The battery rating listed is very optimistic; mine typically lasted a week with my relatively low talk time. After about 7 months use, the phone developed a sporadic problem--though set to turn on when opened, sometimes it will not do so and sometimes will not turn on even when Power button is pushed. Then, after a bit, it goes back to working. Go figure.  Also,it started only vibrating when set to ring only (this is a constant problem). While I could get it repaired under 1 yr warranty, decided to go for another phone instead; am trying an LG phone this time. Tracfone service has been fine, but I all I've done is activated and subscribed to their monthly plan (which is a great plan for those of us who use few minutes and have double minutes phone: $10/month for 100 min.)
Hello I'm an autistic adult.This is my review on a Motorola W260g Prepaid Phone (Tracfone).My dad got this for our church to use for the prayer line and so far the phone work's pretty good.  The sound is nice.  The ringtones are loud and annoying on the phone espicially when trying to watch spongebob at 10:30 a.m. in the morning.  But overall this is great phone and is used to help our church that we go to to grow.Get this phone if you don't want alot of accessories on it and just want to use it for simple calls.Happy Cell Phone Hunting!
I love this little phone.  It works great, was priced right, and was delivered on time.  Amazon.com came through for me again.
The phone charges from the standard mini USB connector. "Great!" I thought. I have all sorts of USB cables at home and work. I can just charge it at my computer and not have to lug around another transformer. Not! I plugged it into my computer and "Unable to Charge" displayed on the screen. I checked the users manual ... "Note: Charging the phone from a computer's USB port is not supported."Drat!
My husband and I purchased the trac phone because we don't otherwise use cell phones, have only one car, and he was going out of the country for a trip and had many places where delays or difficulties could occur.  So, it was an emergency back up for us.  First, it seems to me that you can buy a Trac phone cheaper just at a store.  I saw an advertisement for $5 and $10 trac phones at TJ Max just the other day (didn't check the fine print, though).  Second, the phone didn't work from the Dominican Republic, where my husband was (which maybe should have been anticipated, but wasn't).  Next, just calling to get your messages uses up valuable (as in expensive!) minutes.  I know, we aren't used to cell phones, so maybe this is obvious to others.  Maybe it's also why we don't have cell phones to begin with.  I find the minutes and subscription limit (ie, time within which you can use your minutes) really nerve wracking.  You are either likely to use up your minutes completely and then not be able to use your phone without purchasing more minues, or you don't use up the minutes in the specified time, and each minute you used cost you like over a dollar.  Other than that, the phone seems to work as advertised, and it was a comfort to know my husband did have a sure way of getting a hold of us once his travel brought him into the US, though fortunately the trip went without incident and the only calls made were to validate that all was going well and to pick him up at the airport.  The phone also arrived on time and I have no complaints about the vendor.
I was spending too much for cell service being I am a lite user. So I set out to buy the least expensive phone available and "pay as I go."  The Motorola W175 was the cheapest phone I could find. I paid $15 for mine and got "double minutes for life." Which is really just a sales gimmick. Otherwise minutes from Tracfone are overpriced. You can buy a double minutes option from them, but that stand alone purchase is $25. I got the phone, double minutes for life, 20 mins of airtime, and 2 months of service for $15. You should get a similar "starter" deal. The Motorola W175 phone on sale here is NOT a double minutes for life phone, by the way. Just FYI.As others have said, this sort of "pre pay" deal isn't for the heavy phone user...or even the modest one. This is more for people like me who use their cell phone sparingly, and may even go days at a time without using it at all. And if you do have conversations, they are short. I mean think about it...a half hour conversation costs $3 to $5 with Tracfone. Depending how you buy your minutes. So if you have several or more of those half hour conversations a month, heck, you can get a pre payed "no contract" plan via Straight Talk with 1000 mins and 1000 text included...for $30 a month. Straight Talk is owned and run by Tracfone, btw. And Virgin has unlimited talk and text for $50. With Tracfone you get no "mobile to mobile" or "nights and weekends." You simply get what you pay for. No ups, no extras.So Tracfone (and the similar Net10) is for people who use the cell phone 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there...a couple minutes a day to talk to the kids, maybe? Or  to have a phone around "just in case." Maybe let the kids use it on sleepovers, etc. To "keep in touch" with home.So far as the phone itself...its plain, sturdy, has good build quality, and looks decent next to similarly styled Moto's. It has a loud speakerphone, a big text display, and keeps a charge well, also. The menus are simple and well laid out.  It makes calls, takes calls, sends text, receives text. Thats it. The buttons feel nice, and it looks better in person then in the pictures. It is a simple, plain phone. 4.5in high, around 1.7in wide. Nice candy bar sized phone, lightweight but not cheap feeling. Service is reliable so far, good connection, calls are clear, none have dropped. The phone seems to get a strong signal here in the L.A. area, however it does take two or three minutes to find the signal when you power on the phone from OFF. I don't know if that is a phone issue or a network issue? But its not a big deal to me.For the phone, double minutes for life, 3 months of service, and 140 mins of airtime, I paid $30 total. Thats enough for me for a month and a half...maybe two. And if I need more minutes I can get more for a little bit of cash anytime to add to the phone.  Pay as you go. It suits me fine. I was paying $50 a month before for a phone I hadn't used much in almost 3 years. So this is great for me.
The one thing the package doesn't tell you is that the phone needs to be charged for 5 hours before one can activate it or use it.  That was okay; I didn't need it right away but it proves that even with an "emergency" cell phone a little pre-planning is needed.Once I had it charged up and activated, it proved to be a handy way to have a "local" phone number while on vacation. Despite the affordable price, this cellphone comes with a full bank of features including caller ID, texting and the ability to store and auto-dial frequently used numbers.  One buys a chunk of minutes either on a card in a store, from the Tracfone website or by calling Tracfone's number.  Every time more minutes are loaded on the phone, the service period gets extended so one can chose to keep this "temporary" cell phone going for as long as one wants.  The service expiration date shows on the screen along with the time of day and how many minutes of time left.The audio quality was excellent and there have been no dropped calls.  When I changed time zones the phone updated the time display instantly.  I'd recommend this as an excellent way to try out a cell phone for a child or senior citizen, to have an emergency or backup phone and to have a "local" phone number for a place where you frequently vacation.
PRO:-great battery life-great call quality-great speakerphone-great reception-holds a lot of text messages-holds a lot of contacts-can hold contacts on the phone or the sim cardCONS:-only one phone number per contact-cant send a text message to an email address
i ordered and recived my phone quicker than i expected. and am yery happy with it.
If you want a phone to make calls and send messages, which is simple to use, durable and light ... and doubles as a clock ... then this one is perfect.
im 19 yr old male from texas.Got this phone for Christmas for 400$.If you are thinking about this phone but cant decide, over others, consider this. i previously owned the original iphone. great phone, nonetheless, but decided to sell it and go for a nokia. Most people dont realize it, but this nokia really can do just about anything (and more) than that iphone your thinking about. (save the apps on the iphone) But i truly am more happy now with my Nokia. its such a solid, substantial piece of technology, in every way i can think of, nokia made this thing of quality materials. not fragile at all.So what about the monthly internet (data plan) ?Well, with the iphone get ready to pay 30$ a month for data alone! that is a rough estimate of  720$ over a span of a two year contract with at&t.;Why not get this Nokia, sign up for at&t;'s "smartphone data plan" (also known as MEdia net thing) i pay literally 15$ a month flat rate for unlimited data. it takes no genius to realize thats about 360$ savings over 24 months. (that number covers the actual cost of the phone it self!)Do not be swayed away either by the e71's business appeal. I am a college kid and very into electronics, and i can honestly say this phone has everything a person would need (business/just for fun/practical uses) and seriously has technology a year ahead of its time. in otherwords, i could see myself using this phone in two years and still be more than pleased with it.Buy also a micro SD card. i bought an 8gb card on here for around 20$ these plug into the phone and allow you to save your media on the phone. i.e. music, videos, pictures ect. this gives me a wonderful media device thats easily comparable to any ipod.one setback on the phone is the 2.5mm headphone jack. Standard is 3.5mm so your favorite headphones wont plug into the phone without an adaptor. i bought one on dealextreme.com for literally 1.26$ (no tax, and no shipping) the adaptor is a 2.5mm male to 3.5mm female adaptor, and works wonderful.Nokia did things right with this device.the iphone strays away from the fundamentals of what a cell phone is really about: making/ recieving calls. Nokia sticks to simplicity and makes using the phone for calls/texts VERY straightforward and easy.you wont be dissapointed, and at this price its really a deal that can save you a good chunk of change in the future.
Based on all the reviews I had seen of this phone, I am really under whelmed by the actual product. I have used a Motorola Q9h and really wanted something  that could connect to WiFi.  While the E71 does that, it does not offer much more.  It has a few nice features, but there are many things that make you wonder what Nokia was thinking.Pro:Build quality is greatEasy set up, auto wizards did everythingBrowser is greatCall quality and signal is good (better than some LG phones but no better than my Q9h)Menu system is very good (much better than Windows mobile which hides so much).Lots of option for pic takingPC Suite is a nice free app for syncing -integrates well with OutloolGPS with Google maps is very quick to pick up signalNice to have a phone w/o all the garbage they put on the ones you get from the network operators.Syncs Outlook notesCons:Sending and deleting emails should be easier, they make it a 2 step process.  I do a lot of email and this is a major disappointment.When using IMAP for mail, no way to move emails to other folders.Categories for contacts does not carry over from OutlookNo ability to filter contacts, you must use groups.  Unable to set a default groupDoes not play quicktime or windows media video filesPic quality is just ok, color are really off unless the light is greatSignal strength meter is almost impossible to readLimited ability to customize home page, no ability to add shortcuts to non original apps (lots of plug ins for Windows mobile allowed much more flexibility)Enabling call forwarding is a very involved processAlarms are not well done.  You can not save an alarm turned off.All in all I like the phone but am not sure there is much of an improvement over the Motorola Q9h.  Generally better menu system, but email is a weak point on the E71.  If you are a light email user and are looking for a good looking phone, the E71 is a good choice.  If you are a heavy email user, go with either a Blackberry or Windows Mobile phone such as the Motorola q9h
I received my phone on 12/24/2008, and I just love it! At first I wanted to get an iphone, but the $30 extra monthly for the iphone set me back. I've always been a fan of Nokia due to their great reception, battery life, and durability. I went into the Nokia flagship store in NYC during Thanksgiving break, and I saw this beautiful phone, and I just had to have it. I checked on Amazon, and it was on sale! Saved $100.As soon as it arrived, I just inserted my ATT SIM card, and it was good to go. Some of the contacts did not transfer from my previous Nokia phone, so I had to do that by hand :/. I got the ATT media net package for $15/month, and the internet works great everywhere, it is very fast. Setting up email was very easy, just had to type in the user name and password. Calendar is very user friendly, I use it all the time, and I think the camera is pretty good considering it is a phone camera. All in all, a great smartphone, no complaints, highly recommended!!
I use my phone for 1-2 hours of phone calls, an hour of email, and maybe a little web and gps thrown in. I charge it every other day. Things that I like are the basic design, sturdiness and quality.  Call reception is excellent.  I previously had two Samsungs, and always had numerous dropped calls each day.  Reliability of radio service is much better now, which is saying a great deal considering I use the least reliable network (begins with "A").  It comes with a wired headset and I actually prefer that to my bluetooth earpiece.  Sound quality is important.  The speakerphone works but isn't loud enough in my car or outside.The keyboard is a little cramped and takes getting used to.  The dictionary works great and mostly predicts what I am trying to type.  You can add any word to the dictionary easily as you type.  I have g-mail and I found both the Nokia mail app and g-mail's own app disappointing.  The Nokia app doesn't display html messages without opening a separate browser--not good if you want to quickly scan through messages.  The g-mail app opens .pdf files within its program, but loses document formatting.  You cannot choose to open an attachment with a program of your own choosing (sounds like the Microsoft strategy is growing within the g-camp).  I found "Profimail" which works great for me.  It works more like a true desktop mail client and can update your IMAP folders so you can carry all your important messages with you.  You can download attachments to any location and open them with the application of your own choosing (like Acrobat Reader).  The mail client meshes well with the Nokia address book.  It is totally software worth trying.  I purchased it after only a couple of days of trying it out.There's another default screen app called "Active Notes", which I thought would make saving documents a snap, but I was again disappointed.  Sometimes I edit emails for people.  I copy emails, paste and create a document, edit and then send the edited document back as an attachment that can be copied and pasted into a new email.  I tried using Active Notes and it would only attach as a .zip file.  I replaced the Active Notes icon with Quick Office, which works well and saves text documents as .txt and .doc.For gps and maps, I use Google maps for Symbian.  The gps works quickly and accurately.  I'm a guy and wouldn't use turn-by-turn directions even if they were erotically whispered into my ear.  I just want to find my location and look at a map.  While house-hunting recently, I used it to look at the satellite views too.  I recommend Google maps and it's free.The browser mostly works well, and I salute any browser that can display modern web pages on a 240x320 pixel screen.  I tried Opera Mini, but didn't see anything better, so I just use the Nokia included browser.  Speaking of internet, I also use my phone with the included USB cable as a tethered modem.  The Nokia PC Suite of software makes that pretty effortless.  Too bad the USB cable doesn't also charge the battery.  I purchased a separate USB charging cable that adapts to the charging connector on the phone.There are a few little irritating quirks i found.  You can briefly push the power button to switch to different modes, like "Silent".  Unfortunately the default setting on Silent mode is to not alert or even vibrate upon receiving a call.  I missed a whole days worth of phone calls because of that one.  I later edited the Silent mode to include a vibrating alert.  That seemed a little lame to me.When the phone drops into the standby screen it displays the time without the backlite.  When you press the home key, the menu displays and when you press the menu key, the home screen displays--Totally backwards.The mute button is right between the volume keys and you can easily mute your own voice while trying to adjust the earpiece volume if you are not careful.The menus are confusing and completely non-intuitive.  Trying to find out how to change something like a hot-key can take a lot of trial and error.  An update to the Symbian OS is going to be necessary to keep Nokia competitive.The best case I found is from Beyzacases.  They are a Turkish company that makes fine leather cases.  I received mine within 3 days of ordering from them.Lastly, the fact that it is unlocked (but works best on US ATT networks) is the best feature of all.  You will pay half what you would pay for data if you buy a subsidized phone with a contract agreement.  When you remain out of contract your carrier's CSRs will treat you with more respect and care.
I bought the E71 to provide several functions:(a) international access to voice and Internet;(b) WiFi access; and(c) GPSThe voice, Internet and WiFi work fine. The GPS software, however, leaves much to be desired. See details below.Voice/Internet/WiFi work fine:-----------------------------The voice  worked fine with T-mobile and AT&T; in the US. The signal strength and voice quality are excellent. However, these companies either do not offer Internet access to prepaid customers, or if they do, their staff had no idea how to sell and use it. I used the E71  with O2 on a recent trip to the UK. The O2 staff, in contrast, were exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful in setting voice and Internet access in minutes; I paid 15GBP and had unlimited calls to the UK and US as well as Internet access which is where the money went.The WiFi access is terrific and I have used it heavily while travelingand at home to handle email and web access. The E71 discovers WiFi networks quickly and attaches to access points instantly.GPS Software Leaves Much To Be Desired---------------------------------------The GPS software is very unfriendly. I preloaded a map of London before traveling; when I arrived I found that only sections of the city werepreloaded while major other sections were missing; it was not clearhow to get the other sections, short of getting a map of the city andentering addresses in the missing parts. Then, when I tried to use thenavigation feature it got the route all right and the position of the car reasonably well, but, surprise, there were no voice instructions. I checked the manual and could not find how to get the voice to work. Fortunately, many other users that struggled with the problem posted solutions on the Internet. Do not expect the GPS to work like standard GPS. It does not provide visual directions for traveling; when it loses the satellitesyou may need to stop the car and push menus to get it to work again; etc etcThese are all results of poor software design...
I recently bought my E71 and it came promptly in great condition! I find the keys are quite close together but this I find is the only downfall. The keyboard is convenient for texting and even if you dont have a data package connecting to a open wireless network is made easy with this phone. I have not downloaded any applications yet. The battery life is excellent and volume is also good. I bought a 4GB memory card and in the process of downloading songs to the phone. The media player is configured well and very user friendly.Do not buy this phone for the camera, it is only 3.2MP!
Good phone, you can do a lot of things with it. Not for everyone though, as some people (like me a few years ago) can feel overwhelmed by all the features. Take time to read the manual, and don't be afraid to look under 'help' in most topics on the phone. Once you get the hang of it you won't want another phone!
Pros: 1. This phone had by far the best cellular reception of any phone I have ever owned, and that includes any other phone on any cellular carrier!!! 2. Great speakerphone.Cons: 1. Keyboard is very cramped, becomes difficult to type especially if you have larger hands! 2. Screen is also small and therefore need to scroll constantly. 3. In need of support for various video files
I'll keep this short as there are hundreds of existing reviews of the Nokia E71. I needed a sleek upgrade to my Nokia 6682 and decided against the AT&T; Wireless-branded (read: neutered) Nokia E71x. The unlocked Nokia E71 provides everything I need and want from a phone while still retaining its identity very stylishly as a PHONE. Given that I've only ever owned Nokia phones, and they have all proven their longevity (had the 8260 for > 4 years and the 6682 for > 3 years), I trust that I will enjoy many, many years of usage out of my Nokia E71.Plus, this is the thinnest smartphone I've ever seen!
After my iPhone was stolen, I opted not to spend $500 on a new one since next generation models will probably be released in the next 2 months. So I looked at other options to tie me over until I figured out what I wanted to do next. And a new toy is always nice as well.The E71 fit pretty much everything I was looking for: email support, qwerty keyboard (the iPhone keyboard is a bit tough to use quickly), 3G connection, GPS, expandable media for music and images, camera--all the main things I was using my iPhone for. The expandable micro SD was a big plus, since I was at the point where I was trying to figure out what was coming off my iPhone to make room for other stuff. The four dedicated keys to email, contacts and calendars are awesome--things that I predominantly need a smartphone for. The size is great--about the size of an iPhone strangely--and just looks so slim. The steel frame is worth it for the high end look to the phone even at the expense of some fingerprints. Nokia did a great job with the design of this product. What really caught my eye was the white version. Most smartphones are geared towards men and so colors are chosen accordingly. I was happy to have a more feminine choice. Also having lived abroad, I was ecstatic to finally have a place to put my girly accessories (which are not as popular in the States) to jazz up/personalize my phone.On the flip side, I do wish there were more free apps for the Nokia. After being spoiled by the sheer number of apps that cater to every whim on the iPhone, I'm finding life with Nokia apps a bit boring. I understand that Nokia Ovi acquired Widsets, so I assume there's more apps/widgets on the way, but haven't been able to find any information on what the plans are for that. The included email client doesn't do a great job of mimicking email accounts when it's not automatically retrieving mail, which you can only do for 2 accounts. Every additional email account needs to be manually retrieved. I'm trying some of the push applications that are available and the jury is still out for me on those. Also the number of steps that one has to go through to delete emails, mark emails, add recipients to emails, get to applications that are installed on the phone, etc. is a bit annoying.All in all though, I think this is a great buy and a strong contender in the more business-oriented smartphone that has entertainment add-ons. Personally, I'm looking forward to exploring the camera, music, IM and other entertainment aspects of the phone in the coming weeks.
Enough people have discussed the merits of this phone without my having to say anymore. It is an amazing phone, much better, and sexier, than the Blackberry phones.Just one thing, to fully unlock the phone's potential, I suggest you get a 4GB or 8GB micro SDHC card. This will allow you to store as many Symbian apps as you  want. I have an 8GB card.I also have the N79 which is absolutely amazing as well and I am saving up for the N97...See a pattern here? :)
Others have already highlighted the many things to love about this phone. Coming to it as a smartphone skeptic, I have fallen head over heels for it.First, it is a very good phone: easy to use, great call quality and speaker volume.Second, and better still, it's a great little computer. I use it more as a wi-fi networked computer than as a phone. Gmail, Google Maps, Opera browser, Fring for Skype and IM, Youtube, Putty, etc. GPS is useful and fun. Often, I leave my laptop at the office and just use the E71 at home.We've even used it at the office as a backup modem when our DSL went down. It was absolutely simple to setup and delivers excellent 3G connectivity. With an unlimited data plan, a single person could use this device instead of a broadband plan for home.Finally, it's very well made, nice looking and inexpensive. I've always liked Nokia phones. I love the E71.
Best phone I have ever owned period.This phone has it all and everyone will ask you where you got it.Very easy to set up on AT&T;, it finds everything from your Sim card and sets itself up practically.If you want a quality phone buy it you want be disappointed.Cons; None
Awesome Phone...I looked at getting this phone versus several different blackberrys. After doing some research I realized that one bad thing about the blackberry is the fact that theres alot of apps that cant be installed on the Blackberry that I wanted. I was rather surprised how many apps work with the Symbian S60 V3 (The OS of this phone). This phone in alot of ways is similiar to the BlackBerry similiar look, Full Keyboard and One of the best things is the Browser. I honestly like the Factory installed browser over alot of popular browers like Opera...With the Browser it runs full web pages which you scroll from side to side to view (Im assuming its done this way since if it showed a full page on the screen everything would be tiny)..Also this phone has fully functional YouTube Support anyone running a Data Plan on this phone I think will be Pleased.... The ONLY thing I truley hate about this phone is the keyboard. Yea its got a full keyboard but the keys are TINY and rather hard to text on...I wish the phone would have been alil wider to make the keys bigger. Other then that Great phone and the thickness of this phone is great I was using a Tilt previously so literally about 1/3 the size.Great Phone Great all around software Setup looks neat and also very well Constructed a large portion of the phone is metal you could probably drop this thing in the shower and it would prob keep on going.
Nice sleek phone...keyboard allows for one hand typing, easy to navigate through the menu options.  Definitely recommend it.
Being that this is my first 'smart phone', I was pleased. But had only a few gripes (see below). Anyway, the phone is stylish, with a leather case, sweet. It has almost every connectivity to networks under the sun, GSM, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.Keyboard is nice, especially if you don't like clicking keys for the right character. Coupled with an 8 gig mem card, holds all my ring tones and mp3s and pics. Email is right there, messaging is right there. I was not a 'phoneaphile', but Nokia has won me over. I was looking at Blackberries like everyone else, but I wanted to be different. I believe I made a good choice.As for OVERKILL, I live in an area that recently got GSM capability (imagine that). This phone has a lot to offer if your service provider can supply the service.Only gripes, the stylish small size makes type a chore even if it is easier than regular keypad. Last, battery life. Solution, plug it in every now and then. You'll be set.
this phone is awesome. i can get on the INTERNET anywhere (riding down the street,library,in stores) and watch  the news ,you-tube web pgs. send email, download mp3 ring-tones, books, videos. this phone has my husband excited. he stay up late just discover all the new things about his phone. blue tooth is wonderful,but it eats the batteries up..
Yes, this is definitely and excellent piece of all-in-one smart phone.  With everything I need that includes almost all the basic features in this phone by not over complicated the interface.  I so happy to get this phone and I'm still do because it is compact, good battery life, ease of use, user friendly.There is always room for improvement...... :)
I bought this thinking it was a very intuitive phone to use- and getting my gmail was easy. Maybe I am a simple person. However far as hitting button to call someone, having to push numerous buttons multiply times to simply call someone or navigate- this thing is painful.  It also seems like pushing buttons sometimes doesn't work- ie you go to lock it but it doesnt lock. Or the keys are locked and when someone calls it unlocks the keyboard showing various keys but then locks up immediately. Very strange. The on/off again if you don't hold it long enough (which is long) it starts going through other functions or you have to use mulitple keys to get it to turn off. Finally, the reception on the phone is terrible. I would have thought it was my carrier, but I have had two previous types of phones that didn't have half the reception problems this one does. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone for the price.
This is a great phone- no doubt about it.  The camera is great, interface is easy, it is useful and works well.  I love the WiFi- if you use the WiFi, get Opera Mini OS for the phone so you can see and access real web pages. The main problem is that AT&T; sucks and I hate their crappy weak service that craps out on you- avoid them like the plague they are.  Of course, if you are stuck with them (and the crap phone I got from them bunked out right around the 1 year warrants) or have T-Mobile, I would definitely suggest the E71.
I bought this E71 for use in Europe because of the prohibitive cost of AT&T;'s roaming for Apple iPhone. Nokia makes great products, but this one left me underwhelmed. It is a well executed piece of hardware, but the Symbian OS is simply outdated, and the entire user interface is cumbersome - a pain, in fact. For example, to make a phone call by finding a contact in the directory you click around and you have to even select whether you want to make a voice call or a video call every time. Really? A video call? When has anyone ever made a routine video call?The camera is good, but after you've taken your shot the software to allow you to send it or store it is cumbersome and counterintuitive. The form factor is great, keyboard is great, screen is great. But you know what? It's a hassle to use and no fun whatsoever. Look for something with better software, maybe the E97 or an offering from another vendor.
It's a excelent phone, Hardy and fast, so you can tell everyone that this device is better than every Blackberry phone.
Excellent product.For an unlocked phone, the GPS should already have been available. Had to get an image off the web to enable it.
All things considered - if you want an affordable smartphone, this is the one. The hardware looks great, the Symbian graphical interface is a bit old looking - but that can be mended with easily downloadable skins.You are not going to get endless cool add on apps like with the i-phone - however, if you are looking for a QWERTY keyboard, non-touch screen interface (keywords again being: affordable, all rounder) - buy this. No regrets.
this phone is a good alternative if you are not going to used it for work, and used limited amount of e-mail send.
From day one I've loved this phone. For those be afraid of the white -  it's only the keyboard that's more white than anything else. The rest of the phone is pretty much silver. It is a great eye catcher!! Works pretty much the same as any other Nokia...just wish they would make their theme icons a bit more professional looking.One more thing Nokia does not offer Blackberry Connect for this phone. A bit of a step back I would say, but maybe they will at some point.**does not come with a memory card
I have bought for a friend of mine, i was so impressed with the phone. This a great phone.I'm a blackberry customer, but was very impressed with this phone
There is no much to say about this product,i like it,it's very good,but the only thing that i'm dissapointed about is battery life....i tried even in offline mode to keep it,it lasts still one day max!!!I don't know what to do?I purchased it from amazon,seller was mobile city online.[...]
i had the older version and had a hard time giving it up. i only did when it totally died so i got the upgrade. i love it. it has many of the same features but better.ive heard many complaints about the battery, but ive had no issues in that regard.
This is one of the best phones ever....Wow for the sip client working on 3G....it works great...i am not using my gsm service any more....I got a Yupifon.com account and they helped me to configure it on the nokia so i make calls from voip instead of GSM from now on....!!!
I bought this phone as a replacement for a stolen iPhone and I couldn't be happier. 3G, GPS, wi-fi, music, email, etc. All for 320 dolars. It's very stylish as well when compared to a blackberry or other smartphones with full qwerty.
This fone has all the features I need and more. Its looks simple but loaded with a lot of power! Good for work-related duties. Battery power is the best by far. Best Nokia fone..or should I say best fone I've ever used in 18 cellular years!
I'm a man who only requires 3 things out of my electronics: Battery life, size, and usability.It's why I paid extra for my laptop to have 7 hours of battery life instead of the average 3. It's why I like the Nintendo DS over the PSP. It's why I bought the Blackjack II. All three examples are products that have a great battery life, perfect idea size, and superb usability for my purposes.My Blackjack II has been through the wire and just doesn't look attractive anymore. Back cover falling off, screen brutalized, etc.I purchased this phone, the HTC Diamond, and the Palm Treo to see which one could replace it.Of the three, this phone is simply the easiest to use. The Symbian operating system is horribly easy and I promise my grandma could master it in a week. Applications run fluidly and efficiently. For the first time ever, Gmail and Opera Mini run smoothly without any problems for me.Battery life: Blows the other two away. I shot off many texts, browsed the web, tried the music player, and did some office work and only dropped ONE bar! THIS PHONE HAS AN ESTIMATED 10 HOURS OF TALK TIME. Think about that for a second...Size: It's thinner than my BJII. A plus is the phone itself. On the back is a metallic finish which is great for people like me who might get sweaty hands. It is a fingerprint magnet (I have the white version) but one wipe of the thumb ends that.I didn't go into huge details about this phone because it seems everyone else has. My only complaint is the 2.5MM port for the headphones. I wish it was a regular 3.5, but, go to radioshack and you can easily fix that. Plus, I wish the included usb cable actually CHARGED the phone. Other than that, it's perfect for the quasi-businessman such as myself who needs a business phone - not a toy.
Aside from the sturdy construction, sleek design, and Nokia's T9 predictive texting (which is awesome), there is really nothing else I like about this phone.  I think if you're the type of person that would enjoy using Linux as your desktop OS, then maybe this phone's for you.  Another reviewer said that the OS is cumbersome and I totally agree.  It's not an "Enjoyable" experience to use this phone.  Google maps with GPS activated is fair, but it doesn't seem entirely accurate to me.  Sometimes when you're sitting still, the blue dot (your location) can't decide where you really are and bounces around.  Not a big deal, but still lame.  Silencing an incoming call is another one.  Other than hitting the dedicated silence button, I don't see another way to do it (volume buttons, power button, etc).  Maybe there is, not sure?  Setting up Mail for Exchange was a hassle.  It takes less than one minute on an Iphone, and took me a while to do it on this phone with all the little nuances.  Setting up GMail and Yahoo was easy, although that opened up another can of annoying worms.  If you're viewing your GMail mailbox for instance, and you exit, the phone alerts you that the mailbox is connected, and asks if you are sure you want to disconnect?  YES, I want to disconnect, that's why I pushed the exit button....ugh.  The web browsing is by far the worst I have ever experienced on any phone, simply unusable in my opinion.  When your packet data connection is active, and you receive an incoming call, the phone will beep in your ear and display that the packet connection is off...then will beep again at the end of the call and display that packet connection is back on.  Why do I care about this?  Why do I need a beep in my ear for this?A friend of mine who's an engineer in this industry says that Nokia phones have the best antennas.  I'm not sure if that's true or not - I was using this phone with a T-Mobile SIM.  Whenever I was someplace where I didn't have reception, my ATT and Verizon friends were just fine.  This was especially true inside of buildings.  BUT, I think this is more of a T-Mobile issue than a phone issue.Also,I bought his phone in White.  The online pictures of the phone make it appear that the keys are more of a silver, and blend into the rest of the phone.  This is not that case, the keys are WHITE WHITE and are not sliver....there is a huge contrast between the keys and the chrome body of the phone.  - It's ugly in my opinion.
Normally I get paid for giving my opinion, but since Nokia gave me a real solution I will write a few lines about this product. Folks, I am not a seller. I am a 27 years old, psychologist, politician, and entrepreneur who live in COLOMBIA, South America. I usually use Amazon to buy new technology and that's what I get. But... with the Nokia E-71 I bought possibilities, and that is what you are going to get: POSIBILITIES. It is possible to do almost anything with this artifact.  Are you smart enough to get this product? I don't know; -Is the product designed for smart, demanding and creative people?  YES.Be smart, just get it.
OK,  I love this cell, is one of the best cell phones ever made.

This is the most versatile smartphone on the market but it isn't for everyone. It took me a month of trial and error and of Internet searches to learn how to make all the features work. But for what I wanted, nothing else on the market compares.  The Nokia E71's competitors are the iPhone and the Blackberry, but unlike its competitors, Nokia makes unlocked phones.  This means the E71 can be used on any GSM network and, more importantly, it means you don't have to sign up for the expensive data plans of cellular phone companies unless you are sure you need them. This was important to me because I wasn't sure that I did. And after two months, I have found that I almost never do. Owning the E71 is like picking from the ala carte menu at a restaurant rather than ordering the full course meal.  You can pick which services you want from your cellular carrier on a daily basis, if you want, without committing yourself to two-year contracts and hundreds of dollars in fees.As with other smartphones, the E71 serves as phone, PDA, MP3 player, GPS device, and low-resolution video camera all wrapped into a cellphone-sized package with Internet access, email, and games thrown in to boot.  Let me give the specifics that were important to me.  First is GPS.  After you buy the phone, you go to the Nokia Web site and download for free the mapping software and maps you need. I downloaded a complete U.S. map. This means, when I walk outside and invoke the GPS function, the E71 will spend a few minutes calculating my location and then track my movements on a map. I was on an Interstate the other day and the phone announced that I was exceeding the speed limit.  If you want turn by turn directions, you have to subscribe on a monthly basis either from Nokia or from your carrier, but if you are like me and can get close to where you want on your own and only need help with the last few blocks, the E71 will does that for free. Or, if you are lost, it will show you where you are on a map and you can take it from there.  Second, if you want to go online over WiFi at hotspots, the E71 can do that. I wanted something to carry in my pocket at home to alert me to email so I wouldn't have to keep checking my computer. The E71 can use "push" email through WiFi, so whenever you establish a WiFi connection it will check your email and play a tune of your choosing when email arrives.  Third, there are times when having a cellular data connection comes in handy. The E71's can calculate its GPS position in seconds with a few kilobytes of download from the cellular carrier instead of the minutes needed to make that calculation on its own. Or if you are bored and want to check your email and there's no WiFi around, you can tell the E71 to use a cellular network.  Now, if you take an unlimited data plan from your carrier - and AT&T; requires this for the iPhone and Blackberry - the cost is $30 per month.  But AT&T; sells kilobytes for a penny.  So, getting my GPS position quickly cost me 6 cents and downloading five emails cost about the same. This is why I concluded that I don't need an unlimited data plan from my carrier.  Someone who regularly needs Web access is probably better off with an unlimited data plan.  Fourth, the quality of Nokia products has always been unsurpassed, and the E71 is no exception.  The MP3 player is better than the Sansas I own.  The camera shouldn't be compared to a dedicated digital camera, but it's perfectly fine for a cellphone camera.  The screen is smaller than the iPhones, but I shouldn't need to tell you that.  The E71 is somewhat smaller and a lot more rugged.  Its battery is user-replaceable and lasts longer than most other smartphones.  Plus, a battery costs about $10, so you can carry a spare if you want.  There is a learning curve with the E71 that many will not like.  As I said, it took me almost a month to get the features I wanted functioning.  What is more, not all those functions are intuitive, and some take too many button presses.  But the phone seems less dumbed down than its competitors, so that although it may take some time to figure out how to make it do what you want, you don't have to fork out more money for special software applications to do these things for you.
First a little background - I bought this Nokia E71-2 from Amazon after a  not so positive experience using Apple iPhone (first generation) and Blackberry Bold. I needed an all purpose phone for use in corporate (read that as Microsoft Exchange) environment.While I found the iPhone to be otherwise great, I had some major issues with it - Lack of real Keyboard  just does not work well for lots of email/sms typing. Next the Exchange support was too late, too little (Exchange Account did not work for me ever and Calendar/Reminders was a problem when using Exchange over IMAP), Battery life was unbearably bad, and lastly the iPhone did not support Bluetooth stereo headphones.So I tried Blackberry Bold - only to find out that the browser on it was not anywhere near as good as the iPhone but the real problem was that it needed a BlackBerry Data plan before it could do anything - no mails, no Internet even when connected to Wi-Fi - and my corporate data plan does not include BlackBerry Data Plan - Bummer!Enter Nokia E71 - I am happy to report it has solved all my problems. The browser on this phone is based on the same WebKit engine that Apple uses in Mobile Safari. I found website compatibility to be excellent. Most importantly however, it comes with Flash! Most flash sites work well - but not all, as this is  a Flash lite version. There is also a Youtube client freely available that works amazingly well.Battery life on this phone is really great compared to the iPhone or any other smart phone - I can easily get through a heavy-use day (3G calling, Some music over bluetooth, Always on Exchange Sync) and even go for another day with lighter use.If you use Exchange for email - you will find the E71 does Exchange very well. Setup was very straight forward, I could customize the sync schedule to be always on during working hours and every 1 hour off-peak. The newest version of the Nokia Mail for Exchange Application is very stable and functional. It includes a Company Directory Client which lets you quickly search for your colleagues to find their email/phone information. Meeting reminders work very well - Exchange server calendar is synced to your phone and so all your meeting reminders are available right on the home screen - very convenient. It also supports regular GMail over IMAP.The real keyboard on this thin little phone is very usable - you almost want to keep typing!  I rarely mistype. There is auto completion which works OK for most part and is actually useful.Call quality is great - very rarely I had dropped calls, but they were due to "Network Busy" errors on AT&T;'s part and happened after  2 hours of talk - so I can't really blame the phone for it.Media - The phone continues to do great on this front. I was able to pop in my 4Gb micro SD card to make enough space for all my music and podcasts. It plays MP3s/AAC and most other routinely used formats. All of your music is available automatically for setting as ring tones or other tones (reminders/alarm etc.). It has a very functional Podcast client built-in - I was able to subscribe to all of my favorite podcasts and it automatically updated/downloaded the episodes as and when they became available.  Stereo bluetooth support is great - it allows to listen to music or podcasts while driving or while in the Gym. This was the only phone that played lots of music over bluetooth without crashing.The camera on this phone is 3.2MP and so it produces better quality pictures but I found a blue hue on the pictures initially - that was fixed with the latest software update from Nokia and now the pictures are great.Speaking of which - if you buy one, do yourself a favor and download the Nokia PC Suite Application (Windows only -works with Vista/x64) and run the phone software update before using the phone. This way you will get all the bug fixes and enhancements for the Phone without losing any data or setup.  This is one area I wish Nokia improved - the upgrade process does not automatically preserve your data/settings/applications that are on your phone (as opposed to on the MicroSD card) - it should just put your phone back where it was before the upgrade and do it all automatically.Lastly the GPS - it works well. It was able to connect to the satellites and determine my position even indoors!  Download the Google Maps application for free and you have a very usable GPS.If you are OK with having this phone locked down to AT&T; network for a 2yr contract - I have heard that AT&T; is bringing a later version of this phone for under $100 - so keep an eye.
May 5, 2009 Update: I have lived with the E71 for about 3 months now. It's a good phone, but I like the iPhone better. So today I went out and bought an iPhone 3G. The graphics on the E71 just can't compare. Plus the iPhone has so many great applications that Nokia just does not have. My call quality issue arose from a problem with at&t;, that they are working on at my office. It seems better now. The 3G iPhone is quite a bit better than the 2G version I had.Original Review: I owned a 2G Iphone for about a year, and was getting frustrated by the Iphones bugginess and poor phone quality. So I decided to go phone hunting and settled on the E71. These 2 phones are very different. The Iphone has great graphics and nice applications, but is a pretty basic device. The E71 is a more powerful device, with less graphics ability, but is a better phone. And that was my primary need, #1 a good phone, and #2 a PDA. The Nokia excels at both.I like the VOIP options of the E71. The music player is good too, and can use up to an 8GB micro SD card for music storage.Setting up my Gmail and exchange server accounts was fast and easy.The E71 battery lasts at least twice as long as my 2G Iphone.The call quality is the best of any phone I have owned. I am very happy with the switch. I even switched my SIM card back to my Iphone last week to see how I felt about the Iphone. I switched back to the E71 at lunch. I missed the E71, and I don't like the touchscreen keypad of the Iphone.The E71 is not an Iphone and is not really comparable. The E71 is more like a turbocharged  Treo or Blackberry. The Iphone has better graphics, and if you need graphics, the Iphones the better choice. But the E71 is more stable and does not require rebooting, which my Iphone did.I also like the physical size and feel of the E71. It's lighter and thinner than the Iphone. It also seems very well built.The GPS works great and is a lifesaver. You can also use google maps.
Hardware Superior, OS Takes Some Time to Get Used to.PROS:Let me start off with what the most important in a phone, the call and voice quality.  I live in the NYC area and the reception with this phone is superior.  I have had BB, Motorola, HTC(winmo), and LG phones all within the past 3 years, and believe me it makes a difference to have a Nokia.  The radios and data services speeds are unparalleled to any other 3G phone I've had.  It also works well in rural areas of NY, PA, and NJ and has become my link to the office when traveling.Outside of that, this phone does everything!  It even has barcode scanning software on it.  The default email software is poor, but Nokia mail or Seven (which is what I use now) give me faster then BB service. Contact sync with google is like having BES, and the media playback and browser are fantastic.Build quality is very high.  The phone is extremely slim and a bit heavy, but not so much where it is a bother. Battery lasts well over 2 days with normal use.  Heavy use and your going to need a spare if you don't bring a charger.  Not a big deal as you can pick up those and other accessories for cheap off ebay.Some other great features built in or via 3rd party:  Lower Monthly AT&T; Data Rates (15/mo vs 30)  Loud Ringer and Speaker Phone  Last.fm & FM radio /w RDS player  WiFi AP mode so I can connect my ipod or Notebook (joiku)  GPS Software and Mapping Quick lock through a-GPS  WiFi Connectivity  VoIP (I use this with my Co PBX)  Flash video compliant  Video Conferencing Front side camera.  Tons of 3rd party games and appsCons:Negatives are minimal and most can be overcome as well.  The OS is a bit tricky at first (I was too programed to using a BB).  Once you become familiar with it you'll like it better.  The 2.5mm headset jack is a bit of a pain and the headset that comes with the phone is awkward as one headphone wire is shorter in wire then the other. The D pad is a bit close to the quick buttons and can make it hard to navigate with gloves. The charger port is a pain.  I don't know why they didn't use the microUSB port to charge as well.  This was an oversight in my opinion.At the price of 280 or less you will not be disappointed.
UPDATED!after some time with this device, i updated my review.  also, i wanted to give this 5 STARS, but amazon doesn't allow changing ratings.here's my review:i bought this e71 from amazon for $329 to replace a blackberry 8700.  what an upgrade this is.  in fact, anyone who has experience with an 8700 knows that it's a waste of time to compare the two.  so i'll just share some pros and cons...pros:1. good clear call quality; ultimately this is a phone and it needs to make calls and keep calls.  i have att wireless service, and i am on the phone day and night, and it hasn't drop a call yet, not even in areas where i know the signal is weaker.  overall the 3G reception is good and fast.2. useful and fun features; gps, wifi, usb, bluetooth, stylish look and feel, small size, qvga quality (although bigger screen size would be better, you'd have to increase the size and weight of the device), games, downloads, music, image viewer, video, etc.3. battery life; it's just amazing - i've used the gps, a lot of wifi and 3g sessions, downloading and installing lots of apps, updating software, updating nokia maps and all the stuff one does when one has a device with so many features.  after 2 days of doing all this stuff, the battery meter is only half way.4. i am very superficial about devices; this phone looks and feels sexy all over.  it's solidly built, feels heavy and looks sturdy, and it is tiny.5. qwerty keyboard; for anyone who is upgrading from a non-qwerty phone, this is quite a pleasure to up to.  if you've had a blackberry, i think this won't be a downgrade, but it'll take some getting used to the smaller size, esp if you have large thumbs like me.  i admit i do miss my old 8700 keyboard, but i'm getting used to the small one on the e71 and am mistyping words less frequently.6. email integration; i'm currently on a corporate imap, so exchange with activesync doesn't relate to me.  but at least my gmail and yahoo mail accounts are a breeze to set up and manage.  so far, the email client is very speedy and functional.7. downloadable apps; there's nothing i hate more than being stuck with a set of features or apps;  with that said, the e71 gives you a lot of apps to download and add to your lineup - skyfire, opera mini, joiku light, gizmo5 (for VOIP and multiple IMs services), g-maps, ssh, etc.8. skyfire; yes, it deserves its own section, and yes it's a 3rd party app that works on other phones... but if you want a full web browsing experience that puts the built-in nokia browser to shame (ok, maybe a bit drastic), then you got to get skyfire.  opera mini, based on a few days of usage on the same sites, actually loads faster.  but, what makes skyfire better in my book is that some sites presented in their mobile versions in opera, whereas every site i've opened in skyfire is same as i would see in browser running on a laptop/desktop.9. replaceable battery; i've had previous phones where the battery died and my phone was fine otherwise.  there was nothing i could do since i couldn't replace the battery.  amazon sells batteries for the e71, get a spare one for ~$35 if charging is too slow an option for you.cons:1. the camera software is great; so many options - white balance, exposure, zoom, etc. but that does not compensate for the disgustingly shameful camera on this oh so beautiful device.  the first time i took a picture with this 3.2mp camera, i almost cried.  the picture was blurry, fuzzy and had a purple tint.  what a disappointment this is;  i don't know exactly why it is so bad - perhaps the sensor, optics and flash are just POC (pieces of crap) components - whatever the reasons, the important thing is that the end results are crappy pictures in such a great device.the latest firmware is supposed to improve the quality of photos by this camera (along with enhancements in stability and performance in other apps).my phone came with the first firmware (from 8-2008) and other phones from amazon are likely the same. for more info on the firmware versions, go here:[...]i've tried to update the firmware for this device with info from this forum...[...]in summary, my e71-2 device was safely firmware upgraded - it worked for me the first time.  just remember to install pc suite, NSS, hard reset the device, use the correct code for your keyboard layout before you do the actual upgrade.although my upgrade went well and all is fine, the camera is still crappy.2. non-standard audio jack; my bose noise cancelling headphone doesn't fit? thanks nokia.  i guess i'll have to stick with my pc and my ipod.  sure they sell adapters, but they're bulky and ugly.  why nokia?  why!3. no microSD card; for the US version, there's no included card.  there's a slot, but no free card.  small problem, but still annoying.4. there either is no way or i haven't found a way to get all internet-connection-based applications to always connect over a default connection instead of asking me every single time. it's a little annoying.5. fingerprints; it's true what everyone says.  but oh well, whatever.6. Yahoo Go 3.0 runs 25%-50% slower than other apps on this phone.  the UI isn't any more graphics heavy than the other s60 apps, so i'm guessing it's making many [...] requests and they're all adding up to 4-5 seconds of load time for each page/screen.conclusion:i've forgotten about the crappy camera and moved on because i have a really good camera anyways.  you can't expect a phone camera to perform like an SLR, and thats what i use for pictures anyway.i also bought two necessary items for this phone:1. flexskin: http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-E71-FlexiSkin-Low-Profile-Black/dp/B001H3JXNE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_9?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qid;=1233858881&sr;=8-92. minsync car charger: http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-E71-miniSync-Charger-Bundle/dp/B001EHLSRC/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s;=wireless&qid;=1233859147&sr;=8-3i've had this device for 5 days and it has been all joy.  everytime i pick it up, i'm happy before, during and after using it.  it's just great.buy it already, it's just N I C E!
I own this E71 unlocked version and this has got to be the best phone out there. In comparison, iPhone has the "cool" factor but in terms of features, the E71 wins hands down. Blackberry has a better email client but if you go with the Nokia email client (in Beta currently), it comes pretty darn close.In reply to another reviewers comment about not being able to dial by letters, i.e. 1-800-SEPHORA, I wanted to add that it is actually possible and easy to do that. Here is what you do:1. First, dial the digits. So in the example above, that will be 18002. Then, press Shift twice on the phone (second button from left, bottom row - the up arrow). Then press the function key (first button from left bottom row)3. Type SEPHORA on your keypad. Don't worry that you are actually not pressing any numbers4. Hit Dial. Here's where the E71 is cool. It will actually translate the letters to numbers!! Try it and be in awe.And, that my friends, is only the tip of the E71 coolness.
I needed o phone with- full qwerty- reliable Operating System (sorry Microsoft)- nice multimedia - mp3, youtube, hi rez photo and video camera, flash, podcasts, fm tuner, voice recorder, memory card (sorry Blackberry)- easy Exchange integration for mail, contacts and calendar- easy sync and backup options out of the box- gps that would work on a free software (google maps)- all possible connection options: wi-fi, bluetooth, infrared, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, 3G- unlocked and available for tethering- background applications (sorry Apple)- long, long battery life to support all of that - like no need to worry my battery is gonna die if i use my gps with the light on for 2 hours(sorry Apple)I found them all in the E71.
MY DEVICES: MOTO Q, SAMSUNG EPIX, PALM PRO, BLACKBERRY BOLD,NOKIA E71CARRIER: ATTTHE NOKIA E71 is the easiest and fastest phone of that group for me.BATTERY LIFE: E71=3days, BOLD=2or3days, EPIX=2days, Q&PRO;=1DAYANTENA RECEPTION QUALITY: BOLD,  Q, PRO=best, E71=ok, EPIX=unacceptable indoorsCALL QUALITY: all about the same with EPIX being worst.INTERNET: NOKIA E71 is  faster and easier to use.  Epix,pro,q  were all slow and sluggish  in this area.EMAIL:  They worked about the same. This is a personal preference thing. I didn't like reading emails on the e71 compared to the others.DOCUMENT READING: MICROSOFT OFFICE  FILES, PDFS:  E71 was the quickest to open and move around in with the rest being sluggish.  Also liked being able to sync whatever folder I wanted to with the e71CONTACTS:  This is where the e71 let me down. It is more like a regular cell phone.  I enter all my customer data on my contact info. Including address and categories.  The e71 made this painful and has groups instead of categories. (groups do not sync with outlook categories).CAMERA:  E71 was the easiest to use and add to contacts.BLUETOOTH SYNCING WITH COMPUTER:  E71 using nokia pc suite has no equals in this area. Not even close. By far the easiest to sync or send whatever you want.PROS: Fast and easy to use. Great battery life. Small.CONS:  Not a touch screen, no categories for contacts.
This review is written after 2 months usage:I can summarize my e71 experience in four words: small and infinitely versatile.My smartphone criteria included: an unlocked, small, useful smartphone with reliable connection capabilities, good voice quality and a useable QWERTY keyboard.  Other criteria included quad-band GSM and Wi-Fi.  The e71 fills the bill admirably.Using the AT&T; network I'm able to connect in places I could not connect before and the voice quality is superior to my wife's Blackberry. In two months I remember only one dropped call and that occurred as the signal was passed from one tower to another (in a weak signal area).  The keyboard is very funcitional even for my male hands and short fingernails.The screen is smallish but that comes with selecting a smaller, pocketable phone.  The build quality is outstanding and in my opinion it is (still) the best looking phone on the market.  Despite the small dimensions and thin profile, it feels substantial in the hand but rides comfortably in my pocket. (I tried a couple different style belt holders but found it challenging to get the smooth surfaced phone out of the pouch quickly so  I reverted to using the Nokia supplied pouch and keep it in my pocket).The Symbian OS is very functional and the e71 arrives loaded with most everything you need to get started.  There are more programs on the Nokia web site and there are lots of other sites that specialize in Symbian programs.  If you want to change the Nokia theme or need additional software there is plenty available both for free and for purchase.  I am still looking for an acceptable Symbian tweaked web browser but otherwise I've found everthing else I need.A high pixel count camera on a cell phone is not an important feature for me.  I find the 3.2 megapixel camera on the e-71 more than adequate for casual use and easy to use.  Included camera software is a plus.One my favorite features of the e71 Symbian OS is the ability to segregate my business and personal life with different home pages and themes.Wi-Fi is a definite asset.  It is great having the option of using the AT&T; network or Wi-Fi.If your smartphone criteria is similar to mine you will find the e71 a real winner.
Alright, I finally bought one a month ago based on the reviews here. This is my first smart phone. I considered iPhone and N96 before finally settling for E71. Here is why: I realized that what I really wanted was connectivity on the run (or walk ;)) - not necessarily watching movies or doing demos to others on what my phone can do. I wanted a phone that can do many things pretty well, and not just some things absolutely the best. I also wanted a phone that lets me add applications that I (as opposed to AT&T; and Apple) want/allow. And I didnt want to go bankrupt buying/using that phone.  E71 satisfies all (well, except the demo part: I ended up demoing it a few times ;)).Coming to the phone itself - it has an unvelievable set of features - * Connectivity options - You name it, it has it(Bluetooth - including stereo headset support infrared, Wifi, 3G, Edge). You can connect to Wifi networks that requires encryption (I configured WEP) or browser-based authentication. * A GPS with A-GPS support - meaning fast GPS lock. Not sure if you need(I have) data plan to use it. You can disable it, though, and use just the plain GPS. * Decent email client (setting up gmail took all of 1 minute - just enter your user name and passwd). But you should try Nokia's new push email service (free for now - not sure how long), it is much better. Emails show up on your phone even before Gmail web ui shows it (same case with built-in email client as well). Both has no html support (yet). * It can sync up with outlook on your windows PC using Nokia Suite, and it can connect to Exchange using active sync (though I havent checked this myself - my employer doesnt allow me to). * It plays all kinds of media files (audio is decent, and the speaker loud enough) and youtube. * It has a very good browser with flash support (and you can watch You Tube videos) * it has internet telephony support(meaning you dont need any additional software if you have SIP account with any provider) * it has tonnes of other applications (free and paid) that you can download from Nokia's own or various Symbian S60 websites. Fring (chat/voip client for google talk, skype, etc), Google Maps (with street view), Yahoo Go, etc are some must-have applications available free. Ability to be on Skype all-day (of course, if you have data plan) can save you a lot of money, if you make/receive international calls (you can make skype-skype free or skype-phone for lower rates without using your minutes) * You can add more memory using micro SDHC card and applications can be installed on phone memory or card * Good battery life (at least to my expectations) - with wifi and 3G turned on, push-email set to immediate notification, Fring running always and lots of browsing, I get through 2 days. With 3G turned off (using edge), push-email at immediate notification and moderate browsing, I have now gone 3 days and battery has 40% charge left. * Looks - One of the best looking (still feature-rich) phones (much better than N95, but nowhere near an iPhone) out there. It is very thin, and is probably smaller than iPhone. * Finally, it has a full qwerty keyboard which is very very very usable - never thought I could do that on a phone.For the negative side, I must say that the Wifi reach is not as good as my laptop (meaning, I can get fairly good signal on laptop, but E71 wont get any) - but then you cant really compare the high-power laptop to a low-power cellphone. Also the phone has a 2.5mm audio jack (not 3.5mm, as your regular headsets would use) - you will have to get a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter if you are particular about that favorite headset of yours.Overall, I recommend the phone. With the AT&T;'s Media Unlimited (just $15 per month, instead of $30 that iPhone requires), I am enjoying the new phone. My days have changed - for the better!
I won't restate why so many people adore this phone -- it's very well-documented.I got rid of this phone and replaced with a BlackBerry 8900 and the difference is night and day.  The 8900 for my money is far superior.Do you like Facebook?  Pandora?  True push email that works without fuss? Threaded, conversational text messaging?  A great 3.2 MP camera with auto-focus that takes good pictures?  Well, if so, the Nokia e71 doesn't do any of those things.Facebook/Pandora, there's no app for Symbian.  Nokia's "Mail for Exchange" works well if crudely.  But want Gmail, Yahoo, or any other web-based or IMAP/POP mail to show up on the Nokia as it arrives? No can do.  Sure, there are 3rd party apps like Seven or Nokia's Email, but I found the battery to drain in short order when those things were running.  I also found those add-ons to make the OS unstable.  Had to reboot the phone 1-2X/week.I found the camera to take grainy, purple-hued pictures.Oh yeah, a 2.5 mm headphone jack just adds insult to injury.  So if you want to use your own headphones, you'll need an adapter to add bulk and noise.Further, I found that it lost 3G signal constantly in my home.  The antenna is located in the base of the handset, so if you hold the phone by the base, you will lose a few bars of reception.In other words, I didn't find the phone to even be that reliable for calls.  As you're on the phone, the crude OS fills your ears with beeps as you "lose packet connection" or the phone puts "packet connection on hold" or lose your radio signal all together.  I was often very frustrated by this expensive piece of hardware.Now it wasn't all bad.  It's unlocked, so you don't need to sign a contract.  It is built very solidly, with lots of steel and chrome.  It's very slim, so easily fits in your pocket.But initial pleasure with the phone turned to displeasure because of all of the aforementioned points.Couldn't want to get rid of it.  The 8900 is superior in almost every regard.
I've been using the E71 for a month now. It has been an awesome deviceso far. After using Nokia phones for years (121, 8260, 3590, 3100) Istopped finding their phones appealing and switched to other brands.The E71 replaced a Palm Centro, my first smartphone. Wanting 3G, Wifi,GPS and a better overall platform with full keyboard in a bar format,I spent months researching phones and it came down to the E71, PalmTreo Pro or Blackberry Bold.Pros1. The is a very versatile phone. There aren't many features missing thataren't on other phones of similar design. The biggest missing function isa touchscreen, but the directional pad is excellent so it more than makesup for the lack of touchscreen.2. The build quality is great, very solid, no creaks, no worries about case breakage, or durability.3. Battery life is excellent. I can easily go 2, or sometimes 3 days between charges with a reasonable level of voice and data activity.4. Network speeds, including WiFi are very good, but my only comparison is to the Centro that had Edge only and no WiFi. Browser performance is great, pages load very quickly (I'm on AT&T;).5. The browser is no Safari (iPhone) but it's still excellent. Better than my wife's Blackberry browser. It's missing Java applet and flash support for playing website videos (except youtube) but no native mobile browser that I know of does either. Skyfire will give you that flash support using a server based rendering engine and its performance on the E71 is pretty good considering what you're getting. This should be one of your first downloaded apps.6. I've had less than a half dozen resets in a month which was far less than my Centro and what I consider acceptable considering what is packed into this phone. The multitasking support is excellent, 1-button task switching. Symbian is a great software platform, rich in applications, very mature, stable, very large user community.7. It's an excellent phone, great reception in weak signal areas, greataudio quality, everything you can expect from a Nokia device.8. The size is optimal for a bar type phone. It's comfortable in thepocket. The tradeoff is a smaller keyboard and screen than the BB Bold,(but a better keyboard than the Treo Pro) but if size is a concern,the E71 is a winner among bar phones with full keyboards. And it'ssuper thin!Cons1. The music player is weak. I have an 8 GB Sandisk MicroSDHC card and have had to format it at least once and reload all my music because the player had trouble detecting new files after around 900 were downloaded. Since formatting I haven't seen the problem again and I'm over 1030 files, so it could be related to my not formatting the memory card after initially inserting. Could also have been corruption during file transfer.2. No touchscreen but the D-pad makes up for it.3. Camera is so-so. Don't buy this if a camera is important to you. Forquick snapshots it's adequate.4. No native threaded SMS application. However this can be overcome by downloading Conversations for free from Nokia labs. Doesn't match Palm's threaded client, but it's ok and you get used to it.If you're looking for a feature-rich, well-built, stable, no-lag, pocketable phone that's also very good at making phone calls, this is your phone.
Update; December 2009:  It has been almost a year of using the Nokia E-71 not only for calls but also for Internet browsing, reading and replying to e-mails, text messages and using it as a video and music player.  The more time I spent with the phone, the more features I discovered.  Because it has been protected by a full cover leather case, has survived many accidents including being lost overnight in the snow.Attached to my belt, has been with me for probably 16 hours per day while at work and during leisure activities.  Has been in the ON Mode 24/7 because it is used as my alarm clock and the 3-G always active receiving e-mails anytime, faster than the server that sends these to my computer.  Average battery life is typically of Nokia and needs recharging every third day with regular use.Using an 8GB Micro SD card, many applications have been installed plus 50 MP-3 albums, podcasts, like 20 video clips, several long MS-Word documents, PP Presentations, Excel charts and even PDFs plus ten full movies compressed to 300 MB each under AVI format.  The reception with ATT's 3-G has always been great; no complains.Two weeks ago after falling from my belt, the phone developed the well documented "Turn Off Syndrome" when any key was pressed.  Checked the Nokia Website and seems that has become a fairly common issue for many users.  Tried all the solutions posted but none of them worked, so I ordered another unlocked phone, the Nokia 5800.  This new phone is a great device (will review it soon; still testing battery life), but since it was not a replacement for the E-71 and not finding other phones I would consider as true replacements, did erased "everything" on the device and installed the new firmware (300.XXX.XX) the original version was 100.XXX.XX.  Also, installed the new software (for the S 60 OS) from Nokia's site.To my surprise, the problem was solved and it's great that Nokia's upgraded firmware has some new features including a much faster Internet browser and four new wallpapers that make easy reading the relatively small fonts and make the Icons more noticeable.  Two of these wallpaper screens are red and the other two in black shades; very nice!  The only think I am noticing is that battery recharging time has decreased from three to two days.  But that is still a considerable time compared with the berries collection, the I-Phone and the many other new phones that run Windows Mobile.Thus, it has been a year of satisfaction with this attractive device and have no major complains.  Even though I have tried most of the other keyboarded phones including the berries the palms and the Samsung's Blackjack & Jack, none has the conveniences of the E-71 as for fast and accurate messaging.  The wired mic & phones are history and the device is paired to three others, two Plantronics headphones and the Garmin GPS.  In conclusion, the more time I spend with the phone, the more I like it and the harder it has been to find a proper replacement for it.  Thus, I have planned to keep it as my business phone for at least 2010 but getting a new battery.  Pictures of the phone have been included.Initial Review; January 2009:  After reading several reviews, I ordered a Nokia E-71 Unlocked US Version from Amazon. This is the first Unlocked Phone I get and will comment on "unlocked devices" at the end. I selected a Nokia E-71 after having tried several phones which included the LG Incite, RIM's Storm, Samsung's Omnia and the Blackberry Bold. Why did I not stay with any of these phones? Basically because of very few and subtle advantages found on the Finnish product wanting a phone of proper size capable of my e-mail, multimedia and web searching needs.With the E-71 Nokia's has been able to offer consumers a beautiful stainless steel device full of features that most users will probably never even know that they have on their hands. From an Infrared Transmitter, to literally reading your messages so you actually listen to e-mails instead of having to read small fonts on the screen to voice dialing, an integrated GPS and a full multimedia system that allows you to see videos, podcasts and listen to your favorite music. Not to mention good quality of reception, sound, a great Symbian OS, up to ten e-mails and all powered by the well known long lasting Nokia battery.The shortcomings are only few in my opinion. The first one is the micro jack for the headphones and microphone. The second one is the micro USB port for connection with the computer. Nokia should have used the standard ones like other companies have been doing. The third shortcoming is the small screen fonts (even on the large setting) that make difficult reading some e-mails and MM messages. Besides these three, I consider that all the plusses make these limitations not significant.Unlike most American products, Nokia uses a port for charging the phone separate than the one used for connecting the phone to the computer. This has pros and cons but for me is better leaving the phone charging wherever I want instead of needing to leave it next to the computer in another area of the house. As well, if you are away from home and do not have a computer, the charger will do it by itself.The E-71 has a full Qwerty keyboard and this is what probably makes this phone the best choice for persons that need or like to type considerably. What makes the keyboard unique is its design. First, the keys with numbers have been located in the center. Those of us who have used the Bold and other RIM products have struggled when trying to type the numbers 4 and 7 in a sentence because they are immediate next to the only ALT key of the RIM keyboards. You will not have this problem with the E-71.Nokia has wisely assigned lowercase keys to two of the most important characters when surfing the web or composing e-mails. These are the @ and the period ( . ). On other devices such as the RIM ones, these have to be activated trough ALT plus the corresponding key. On the Nokia keyboard the @ is immediately left of the space bar and the period is slightly up and to the right. These become very convenient when typing.This keyboard has a very attractive charcoal colored (almost black) on the grey version. In order to differentiate the keys with numbers, the upper half of these have a lighter color. Thus, if you turn the phone slightly downwards, 12 keys in the center show up in grey color. These have the numbers 0 to 9 and the # and * keys often used when accessing message centers and companies. In order to have all these in just three rows of keys, Nokia has placed the zero to the right of the number 9. Not what we are used to but quite clever.Compared with the Bold the keys are somewhat smaller and no space between them. But, their convex shape makes typing relatively easy even for persons with big thumbs. One thing that works for me is having the phone flat on a surface and type with the index fingers.On the upper part of the keyboard, ten keys have been arranged in a not so usual way which includes the square that substitutes the "rolling ball mouse". At first was sort of difficult to use it but when you web browse, the logic behind becomes evident.This is one of the few phones that come with a leather strap which attaches on the lower left corner of the device. This is extremely convenient when you receive a call and need to rapidly take out the phone from a pant pocket or if it's being carried inside your jacket or coat.The installed software has many features which are found only in more expensive devices. Their Office Suite has even the Acrobat reader and Word and Excel documents can be edited. Not so with PowerPoint, Access and Publisher but that' Ok since the screen on cell phones is relatively small. I guess that the IR Transmitter will be useful sending a document to a printer so you'll be able to see/read it in full size.Thus, the E-71 is a product with multiple capabilities that can be used as a phone, a micro computer, a messaging system and even as a substitute of your Personal Video Player to watch your favorite videos while commuting or flying. Even though it was intended for companies (that's why the E; for Enterprises) the device can easily make its way into the average consumer. Needless to say, I consider this Nokia the best bang for your buck in the current world of smart phones. I have had mine for four weeks and plan on keeping it.Currently there are two versions of the phone being sold "unlocked"; the US version and the European version. At the time I wrote this (01/09) those that plan to use the ATT network needed to get the US version. In contrast, T-Mobile users need to get the European version. This is because of the different operating frequencies of the carriers.Why should someone get an Unlocked Phone instead of buying one with a plan? Well, it's what you will end up playing with the plan for the next two years. Carriers actually make more money out of the contract (at least $2,500) than of the alleged discounted price of the phone ($250).I have been a customer of Cingular/ATT since the first cell phones came out in the nineties and do not complain of their reception in general. As well have had Sprint and Verizon but only because of reception problems with ATT in specific geographical areas I've lived.But, this time I bought an "unlocked" phone because I did not want to be "locked" with a two year contract with any company. That way, when advances in technology present us with a better product, I'll be able to get it immediately.
I know that "elegant" is not a word that a man would usually use to describe something that he owns but it is truly an elegant phone. It's beautiful.I'm not a technophile, so my review won't be as indepth as some. So I'll keep it simple.If you've owned any Nokia phones before then it will take you only one day to learn to use this phone. It has lots of menus and it's very easy to navigate between them. It operates on 3G and it's better by leaps and bounds over EDGE. All I did was get the phone, put my ten year old sim card in it and I was making calls. Seriously, it was that easy. I bought an 8G micro sd card and I'm taking pics too. Some have said that the camera is not world class but it works just fine for what it is- a camera phone.The screen is not as big as the new touchscreen phones but it is very large and shows very high quality pictures and video. The speaker is loud and clear, but on speakerphone, the louder the volume, the more the distortion.The phone is stunningly beautiful as well. It is very thin, yet sturdy. It has a heavy feel, and quality build. I recommend the gray for men though. I own both the white and gray and they are both fantastic. Prepare to get compliments- ALL THE TIME! Ladies love it, men love it, and my kids all want one now.Lets get to the pluses. 1: Sturdy build and estectically beautiful. 2: Many menus that are very easy to understand and navigate between. 3: Accessories included. Very handsome carrying case, headset, usb cable, and ac charger, and cd rom with drivers all come with the phone. 4: 3G interner with wi-fi. Fast internet at that. 5: Unexpected little things like the notification light that alerts you when you have a missed call, text message, email, etc. Ane the beautiful clock with date stamp and icons; it only comes on when you turn off the annoying breathing light. but when you push the navigation button, the digital clock is very big and bright. Very nice touch. 6: Very long battery life. On both of my phones I'm getting between 4 and 5 days between charges. Maybe I just got lucky. There are many more pluses, but those that I listed are my favorites.Now the minuses. 1: The phone gets really warm if you're on it for more than 15 minutes. This is terribly annoying. 2: The stupid breathing light that I see no need for at all. It just blinks and drives you crazy. I checked and most other users of this phone found this to be annoying as well- so I'm not alone in that department. Nokia emailed me and showed me how to turn it off and it worked. I'll instruct on that later in this review. 3: The qwerty keyboard is fantastic and has great feel to it so one doesn't have to push the buttons hard at all. The problem is that the keys are super tiny and take a little  getting used to. 4: Finally a very minor minus; no smileys. There are no emoticons to insert into texts like on older less expensive phones.Overall verdict is BUY. I researched phones for 8 months, and this one in particular for at least two. I read the reviews and decided that this one was perfect. After two weeks with the white phone and another two weeks with the gray one, I am perfectly satisfied with this phone. You won't believe how beautiful it is.How to get rid of the "Breathing Light" when you get the phone.Step 1. Push the "Menu" button.Step 2. Go to the "Tools" menu, and select it.Step 3. Go to the "Profiles" menu, and select it.Step 4. Go to your prefered setting (normal, silent, meeting, etc.), but DO NOT select it.Step 5. Push the "Options" button, and scroll to "Customize"Step 6. Scroll down to "Breathing Light" and push the "Options" button. Scroll to "Change", and select "Off". Select "Ok".Now the light is off and the screensaver clock is activated. I hope this review helps someone.Update: 04/05/2009. I love this phone. I backed up my files to my computer. And its a good thing I did. I did the recommended firmware update and low and behold it updated the phone but wiped out all of my settings and all of my contacts!!! I reinstalled my stuff from the pc and all is well, plus a few extras that was in the update. I will be backing up my phone weekly now.One new glitch though. After I updated the phone, the clock that acts as a screensaver does not advance. It stays at the same time until you push the navigation button. When the lighted clock shows, it shows the correct time, but the screensaver does not. Very minor problem, just wonder why a good thing goes bad after an "UPDATE"?Still the best phone I've owned, and I still say purchase.
I recently purchased the Nokia E71. This phone so rocks!.Performance wise it is quite zippy. It looks nice and sleek. Its also not very heavy but you know your holding something. I immediately popped in my 8 GIG SD card from my previous Motorola. All my songs, pictures and videos were immediately recognized by the E71 no matter what directory they were in. It has fantastic volume and the sound quality is great. Even with the volume about halfway it quite loud.The biggest benefit for me of having this phone is being able to use the VOIP over WI-Fi. I don't have to spend big bucks making calls over the expensive cell network if a wireless network is present. I was on the phone for hours last night and the battery life, even tho using wifi, hardly moved by more that 1 or 2 bars. I use [...]and the charges were a couple cents off my prepaid account. Configuration was a snap because the E71 comes with all you need just enter the account information and away you go.
Have had the E71 for about a week and so far I love the phone.  I really did my research on smartphones before I made the decision to go with the E71.Things I love about the phone:-Operating system is very easy to use and the phone is very fast.-Love the web browser, pages load quickly and clearly with vibrant color on both wifi and through ATT service-Love the voice activated features on the phone which I am still learning about.  I really like how the phone can read your text messages to you and how the phone will say the name of the person calling so if I am driving and it's somebody I don't want or need to talk to I don't even have to pick up my phone.-The size of this phone is amazing with all of the features on this phone like the full QWERTY keyboard and large screen that it is so small.  My company uses Blackberrys or Motorola and in comparing the build quality, size, and features they don't really come close to the E71.  The Blackberry phones are bulky and have a very unimpressive, cheap plastic build.  With the slim dimensions of the E71 this phone fits in my pocket easier and more comfortably than my old Motorola C139.-Above all the call quality on the E71 is the best I have ever had in a cell phone and the sound quality is amazingly clear and reception is always good.  I paired up my E71 with a Nokia bluetooth headset and even on Bluetooth and on the freeway people have commented that I don't even sounds like I am in a car with almost no background noise.I researched just about all smartphone brands for about 2 months before purchasing the E71 so I want to also give my opinions on some of the common "dislikes" or "cons" about this phone from the reviews I have read or seen and provide my opinions:- The phone is completely customizable which according to some reviews is good and bad.  Bad if you are someone who isn't very "tech savvy" and good if you just want something like the IPHONE that is completely setup for you when you buy it.  MY OPINION: I am not the most tech savvy person and with this being my first smartphone and scrolling through the different menus and setup screens I found the phone was very easy to setup the first day I got it.  I like for example how there are multiple profiles you can setup for the E71 which include setups for ringtone, text tone, email tones, et cetera that you can program into a specific profile so if you are in a meeting and you need to silence your phone you can just switch to the "meeting" profile.  With there being about 7 or 8 profiles you can setup, you can setup your phone to have a multitude of profiles depending on your setting.  If you can't find an application or screen there is a handy help menu and you just simply type in what you are looking for and you get detailed instructions for either finding the application or setting it up.  If you want to get back to the home screen, there is a home key that you click to get back to the home screen along with other handy keys next to the scroll key to get to commony used screens quickly.  Conclusion: The phone is very easy to navigate and setup.Non-standard 2.5mm headphone jack: This seems like more a minor annoyance than anything.  I have had the phone about a week and used everything on it from calling, calendar, and MP3 player and I have not had any problems with this not having a standard 3.5mm jack.  I don't see any problems here.Camera: The camera takes slightly above average photos in outdoor/sunlight but below average indoors with the flash with the 3.2MP camera.  Bottom line, if you want camera quality on a cell phone comparable to your DSLR or point and shoot digital camera than you're going to spend a lot more $$ and have a phone much bulkier and thicker than the very compact E71.  So in the end there is a tradeoff.  If you want to also use a cell phone to take family pictures and other important events than you'd probably want to go with the Nokia N95 but again the N95 costs at least $100 more and 0.8" thick (double the E71) so it costs more and isn't exactly pocketable like the E71.Fingerprints: The fingerprints show up on the back panel pretty easily and I consider this a minor annoyance.  Nokia would have done better to make the entire backside of the phone the dark gray color as opposed to making the removable plate a chromed titanium.Summary: For the price and comparing this phone to other phones like the IPHONE and Blackberry Bold, the E71 doesn't have a couple of things the IPHONE does and EVERYTHING the Blackberry has for much cheaper than both.  The E71 doesn't have the large touchscreen of the IPHONE but the IPHONE also doesn't have video recording like the E71.  Considering the IPHONES and Blackberry Bold new are still $500+ and I was able to get the E71 for about $330, the E71 provides a much greater value.
Phone:Has great call quality, but needs a good signal. Used this with Tmobile first and was disappointed since the signal strength in my area was very low. Then switched to AT&T; and am amazed what this phone is capable of. Loudspeaker is good, although has to be cranked up all the way high. Had a Nokia N73 earlier which is by far the best phone in terms of voice clarity and loudness.Build Quality:Build quality is exceptional. Phone feels solid and keypad is a pleasure to type with. After using it for about a month with only a screen protector, I see no scratches on the metal back or anywhere on the phone (touch wood!)Messaging:This is a great phone for messaging. The physical keyboard makes typing a lot easier. Nokia email is installed automatically if you try to add gmail, hotmail or yahoo accounts. It provides true push email. However, software is still a little buggy. Also has support for Microsoft Exchange, although there is no HTML support. This phone can also read out your Text messages.GPS:Used with the A-GPS, this phone gets a fix even indoors. Outside the fix is within seconds. Phone comes with Maps 2.0, but can be upgraded to Maps 3.0. Nokia's navigation is excellent, but unfortunately is not free. The entire U.S. map can be stored on the SD card and is only about 1.2 GB. Google maps work very well with AT&T; 3G, but was not able to update maps quickly enough on TMobile's Edge (while driving at 65mph).Built in apps:There are some very good, but lesser known, built in apps on this phone. The podcasting app lets you view audio and video podcasts for free. The dictionary app is excellent for quick lookups as well as translating the word to other languages. Language packs can be downloaded from the nokia website. The internet radio app has quite a few stations to choose from and works very well even on 3G.VOIP:This phone does VOIP quite well. It can be paired with Gizmo. If you have a Google number and set to forward your calls to Gizmo, you can actually take your call on this phone and not spend any cell phone minutes.Battery:Battery life seems to be great in standby mode. I went through almost a day with Nokia Email in push mode without loosing even a single bar on the battery indicator.Other apps:Sports Tracker is a great app if you like to keep track of your exercise activity like walking, running, cycling. This app plots your route on a map and keeps track of your pace (and even what music you are listening to at that moment!). It works with only the internal GPS and doesn't need additional sensors. This app alone makes the GPS worth having in this phone. Workouts can be uploaded to the nokia sports tracker website [...].Fring works well for instant messaging as well google voice chat. I tried nimbuzz too. Although nimbuzz had a smaller memory footprint, I was not able to get google voice chat to work with it. Fring also has built in support for automatically switching from wifi to 3g and vice versa. e.g if you are on 3G, and get within range of a known wifi access point, Fring will within 5-10 mins automatically change over to wifi. Similarly if you walk out of your wifi range, it will fall back to 3G.Google Mobile supports voice search that actually works! It is another must have app for the e71.Multi-Tasking:By far the best feature of this phone is its multi-tasking capability. All symbian phones support multi-tasking in theory, however, due to memory (RAM) constraints, most phones are not able to run more than 1 or 2 apps simultaneously. This phone has a total RAM of 110MB and after startup has a whooping 62MB free. I have been able to run Microsoft exchange, Nokia email, Fring, SportsTracker and the music player all simultaneously and still have about 40mb free.Web Browsing:The built in web browser works well for mobile websites, but is not able to handle larger web pages so well. Wlan speeds are slow. I am not able to get anything more than 1.5mbps using speed tests, even though my internet connection is about 9mbps. This phone supports HSDPA (3.5G) and works well with AT&T;'s data network. Opera mini is able to handle full blown web pages and makes the web browsing experience just about acceptable.Update:Unfortunately the phone does get really hot after being on 3G for a few mins or on a call for 15-20 mins. Maybe I just got a defective piece :-( Sending it back for a replacement.
I purchased Nokia E71 few months back and feel like it was a good buy. It has all the things that I need -1. Music Player2. Wifi3. Radio4. PIM5. Quad-band - GSM6. Sync with Outlook and Lotus Notes7. Free MapsWhat I do not like is -1. Bluetooth is not easily configurable with headset (may be I am doing something wrong).2. Ovi Application does not show which maps are loaded and which are not.3. Contacts do not show it is associated which groups.4. For charging through USB, one has to buy a separate cable.I would say that it is very good buy.
The phone works very well for the core smart phone functions: mail, web browsing, messaging, navigation.  Google Mail and Calendar sync is supported (via the Nokia Exchange client, see Google instructions).  GPS works very well, both with Google Maps and the built in Nokia navigator.  Physically, the phone is small and thin.  The keyboard is excellent and probably the best keyboard you can make for a phone this small.There are some negatives, too: the phone software is aging and not the most intuitive, the built-in VoIP app doesn't quite work, and there are not that many useful third party applications out there.  The 2.5mm headphone jack is a nuisance, as is the fact that you can't charge it through USB (but you can get a USB-to-phone charge cable).The phone is smaller and (I think) nicer than a Blackberry.  It's not a lot of fun (few games or other diversions available for it), but as a business tool, it gets the job done really well and in style.
I owned a Nokia 6680 smartphone for several years and was never tempted to upgrade because this phone did everything I needed... Touchscreen phones are too delicate for my job (construction engineer) and I type much faster using a standard keypad anyway. I looked at an N95 but in my opinion it was too thick and I don't trust the slide mechanism (or flip mechanism for that matter). My friend bought an e71 and I borrowed it for a few minutes to make a call. I was so impressed by the slim sleek design that I purchased one the following day! I can find no fault with this phone! At first I thought the keypad was too small to type (being a fairly large guy 5' 8") but let me tell you that Nokia designed the keypad flawlessly! Within a few minutes I was happily texting away at blazing speed! It also comes unlocked so I can use it with my both carier SIM cards without any problems.I own several handheld gps units (Garmin etrex and Lowrance iFinder) and these cannot get a fix indoors. Within a few mins my e71 got a fix from an impressive 5 satellites. The screen resolution is amazing (tv quality). The entire phone is well built, sturdy and strong. Just looking at the back cover you can see that this phone is built to last. It has all the usual "requirements" for a smart phone: symbian os, email, web, camera, video, realplayer, mp3 player, quickoffice, etc. etc. Even though the camera is 3MP this is sufficient in my opinion.I am still discovering new features for example the e71 has text to voice capability - the phone can read out aloud text messages (very convenient when driving)! I am yet to find a flaw.To Nokia - excellent job 5 out of 5!
Great little phone.I bought it because I wanted to access email/internet with WIFI  and not pay for the blackberry data plan. I have the minimum data plan (20 mg/month) and that is enough for my use outside of "free" hot spot zones (primarily home and  office..but if you  get this phone you will be amazed at the places that are available for WIFI use and not locked down  either intentionally or just through negligence) .Just to pass along I recently downloaded opera mini for this phone and you absolutely cannot believe the difference in browsing speeds regardless of WIFI or EDGE data source. It works perfectly and best of all its FREE.Also Google maps offers full GPS support  with trip planning,routes and map guidance for FREE as well (except for your paid network data stream of course)..Can't beat that !!
I've had the BlackBerry Curve, switched to iPhone, then tried out the Storm (which is the worst BB ever made in my opinion), then switched back to my iPhone.  I needed a QWERTY phone and I think this one is a good compromise between Cupertino and Ontario, good in many but still short of some.Map app is better than Blackberry. Directions are turn-by-turn in 3D or 2D, and other modes with voice guidance (7 days only). Absence of US POIs. You can't even search "Universal Studios Hollywood".  You can search a POI in Google Maps and enter address in Nokia Maps to get a 3D turn-by-turn direction.Nokia (Ovi) app store will launch soon. You currently can access free apps, themes, ringtones, wallpapers, etc on Nokia Beta Labs, S60.com, Nokia Mosh, and many forums and blogs.Great metal design, feels like a fine piece of gadget, which it is indeed. Small enough to really look like a phone, thin but substantial in the hands, and formal yet sleek look. QWERTY pad is responsive, very good sized one and very fun to use (trust me, it is way better than my ex BB Curve 8330's QWERTY pad which I always seemed to use my nails on that one instead of fingers).Good native internet browser.  Even better than BB Storm's.  Another browser, the Skyfire works great on the Nokia E71 (Skyfire runs only on Symbian and WM).  It is way better than Opera Mini (on BlackBerry).  Flash player and flash content works great.  With Skyfire, you can display desktop version of websites, unlike Opera Mini on BlackBerry which will always display mobile content.The email functionality is poorly designed, in my opinion (the BlackBerry is still the king).  You can have push email through Nokia Messaging Service (IMAP only, I can't figure out how to use POP3).  Native email client will only "push/auto-notify" you of new email(s), but will not download the email itself, instead it will download an email only when you select or decide to download it.  One by one in fact.  Both clients are not capable of displaying HTML content within the email's body.  Will have to download the attachment or link and displayed in a browser.  The entire email functionality needs some time to be appreciated.  In fact, because of some email functionality issues, its release on AT&T; has been rumored in blogs and forum to have been pushed back towards end of May 09.  Newer BlackBerries, Palm Pre, and iPhone 3.0 will likely take the stage by that time.Email filters are non existent especially if you use Mail for Exchange.  You can't block internal office spam, ERP/server-generated responses, and annoying co-workers.  Neither the native email client nor the Nokia Messaging client provide filtering for MS Exchange emails.Multi-tasking is great on this phone. I can listen to internet radio, browse the web for a restaurant, search in Google Maps, type direction in Nokia Maps, open a PDF file to read something, and switch back to internet radio to change station and do all these without exiting an app, and the radio is still playing.Internet radio is a good substitute for lack of Pandora or Slacker app.  However, the phone jack is not standard. You can't plug it into your car's mp3 jack like you normally do on your ipod, iphone and blackberry. You won't find any third-party adapter either. You are stuck with cheap ear piece which you can't replace with a premium one either.  Weird.You can sync your Google Contacts.Limited support (stingy software updates) from Nokia for US version.  Either they think their phone is superior or they are not listening to customer feedbacks.Fast 3G/3.5G (depending on your location though) but will work only on AT&T.;  It will work with T-Mobile on voice but not sure on the data side as T-Mo operates on 1700 whereas this phone operates on AT&T; 3G's 1900 spectrum.Has Wi-fi and GPS.  I'm not sure if you can tether and how you're going to billed for that.  I've heard from several people able to do this but have not tried it.Cheaper plan than iPhone and Blackberry.  My plan is $30 unlimited data and unlimited messaging.  I used to pay extra for the messaging/SMS on the iPhone and BlackBerry, but messaging is bundled to this specific phone's data plan and unlimited :).
The nokia E71 is a remarkable phone. i recently purchased this phone, and i am well pleased. the design of the phone is great. its small, thin, yet, not flimsy. its metal body is a very smart and unique design. it gives the phone this feel that you have something valuable in your hands. that's the best way to describe it.the pros to the devicethe phone does everything i can imagine a business user, or anyone who has lots of meetings, could need. your documents will open fine, i.e. pdf, excel, word, p.point. you can also install some nice games and software on this and it runs the games well.this phone is feature LADEN.you will take a while to go through it all.the phone is very fast. i barely feel a lag, unless i am running some programs (google maps, msn messenger, google messenger, etc) in the background and even so, we are talking about 1.5second delay. barely noticeable.the concern i heard about the keyboard is true. man, its crammed, BUT, i noticed that even though my fingers are big, i have little problems and typos using this device. in other words, the keyboard is fine. once you get used to your keys... you'll be fine. i dont know how nokia does it but.. they know how to make the keys work for anyone.the features are all great. wi/fi works jus as though you are on your pc... the browser is SWEET and the zoom feature doesnt make it too hard for you to read the stuff on the sites. youtube works without a prob.battery life.battery life is pleasant. its very hard to drain this phone if you are only gonna talk on it. however, if you are gonna be using wifi, bluetooth and listening music all day... you will run your batteries down and have to charger every two days, vs three days. not bad in my book. i tested this phone on a full day basis and... at the end of each day, there is enough power to carry into the next day. running the batters by playing music kinda leaves me half way at the end of the day.Conscamera is really a pain. seriously!why does nokia do this to us? why must they always hold back on features that can make their phones THE BEST period?let me explain... its a 3.2mega pixel cam.. but its a "daytime" camera. meaning... the pics are best when in the blazing sun, with no clouds... if pics are taken in that type of light - you will be pleased. however, anything less will be grainy (noisy) sometimes. you cant take pics in the dark or shadow areas and expect good camera quality. forget it. the flash is not like on the N82. its nothing like a digital camera's flash. its really only for close pics... and even then.. you have to have good to excellent lighting to get pleasing results. please dont try and take professional pictures with this.The headsetThe headset nokia gives with this phone is... well, crap. its light in sound. no bass for music no matter how you adjust equalizers. (well, its so low is nonexistent) and i didnt really like the design. i dont see how i am supposed to walk with it on the road when on cord for the right ear is so long... its annoying to have it dangling plus it gets caught in stuff and tugs and one day, if you're not careful, it will burst.2.5mm headphone jack.disappointing to me. i wont deny it. 3.5mm is greatly preferred, however. contrary to what many think... with the right headphones, this phone is an excellent mp3 player. so, dont despair. jus get a nokia headset that is designed for music and you are good to go.overall, i gave this 5 stars because... the camera doesnt bother me. hardly use it, and when i do its to take pics of people to add to my address book. those are great.when i walk with this phone, its a pleasure to take it out and watch people bending over backwards to see it. :) nokia is the best there is even if they refuse to max out their phones in top class features.
I bought this phone for my husband in January and another one for myself in March.  That shows how much I like this phone.  Beyond everyone's ravings, here are some points from my personal experience with the phone:1. battery life is not as long as claimed in the product info.  My husband's phone lasts about 2.5 to 3 days with one full charge.  He uses it for  voice calls only with about 30 minutes daily talk time.  I typically get more functions of my phone with usually 10-20 short phone calls, a dozen text messages, 10-30 minutes podcast and checking emails with wifi 3 to 5 times a day.  My phone's battery indicator gets down to the last 2 bars by the end of day.  So I have been charging it daily.2. Good language support but less ideal than iPhone.  I bought the North American version so the phone comes with English, French and Spanish.  I was able to install Asian fonts on both my phones without much hassle.  My iPhone came with the option to change languages out of box.Notwithstanding the above, I truly appreciate the beauty and functionality of the phone - otherwise I wouldn't have bought two!Update 6/13/09: we have been living in China and Europe for the past several months and use the E71s with local service providers (the beauty of an unlocked phone!).  The phone performance seems to deteriorate:  the phone would turn off by itself - sometimes in the middle of a call about at least once a week.  Occasionally, I can hear the other side fine but the other side can't hear me.  Not sure whether this is a network compatibility issue.  I have been trolling websites to find cures - some suggest doing a complete software upgrade.  I am seriously considering it even though I may have to spend more time to configure it the way I like.
I have had my E71 for about 6 months now and have nothing but praise for it. I upgraded from E62, so initial difference was huge. But once I got to use more features over the months, I realize this is no ordinary phone.What I like:1. Awesome build quality, no moving parts, no squeaky sound, top quality materials2. Probably the best form factor smart phone in the world. Not too narrow so it will slip from hand, not too wide to bulge out from pockets, easily fits regular sized palm. Easy to type messages, emails with one hand3. If there was a fashion show for smart phones, E71 would win it hands down. I got steel and gray and it looks serious business and smart stylist at the same time.4. Battery, battery, battery. It lasts me 3 days on one charge with good about of browsing, phone calls, skype and push email (sync-ed hourly)5. Call quality is top notch, as expected from a high end Nokia product, with excellent clarity.6. Very good speaker, for use as Speakerphone or playing music or read messages automatically.7. Beautiful, crisp screen. I miss the big screen on my earlier E62 and I think it was the best small screen ever for watching movies, videos etc. E71 has the same screen quality but only slightly smaller due to phone size8. Processor and Symbian S60 3rd Edition work great together and menu navigation, apps run fast on E719. Nokia calendar and Message notification on home screen keeps my life totally in control. After I got this phone, my laptop sits closed for weeks. This phone will let you "work from phone"10. Documents processing - I edit Word and Excel docs on this phone, also read documents in pdf. No problem whatsoever.11. Add on apps for Symbian enables me to be constantly be in touch with family, friends and the world. I installed France24 for live news, Google Mobile for searching, maps. I installed Fring to use Skype, Google talk Twitter all on one interface. I use MobiReader for reading ebooks12. Nokia's free email (Nokia Messaging) client has a crisp, beautiful interface. I like it even better than Gmail for mobile. Sync is customizable (frequency, how much email etc)13. FM radio is excellent, although not many probably use it. I catch my channels when workload is light.What I don't like:1. E71 comes with basic cheap earphones, you might need to upgrade to something better, preferably with Bluetooth wireless2. Camera is not great, but I don't use it much3. Nokia's Ovi store does not have much content. There are not many professional looking themes. But you could downloaded nice themes from S60 app sitesOverall, I don't think there are many smart phones (or even phones) out there that stack up to E71. Go and get it. If you can, buy the unlocked E71 and not E71x from AT&T; that is loaded with slow bloatware.
I was looking for no-contract smartphone. I did features comparison with blackberry, and found that it has all the features of blackberry at half the price. Nokia E71 is my first smartphone and i am impressed by the advanced features. sound quality is great. video looks great. webbrowser is fast. camera is good. I haven't used most of its features. So far the only hiccup i have observed after 3 months of use is, there is no 'view number' option in call log if the number has already been added as a contact. Its is a minor thing. keyboard is easy to use, camera has flash. I would definitely recommend it.
I was looking for a smart phone with high functionality and flexibility for productivity rather than entertainment. I suppose what I wanted was a device that I could do all that I wanted to do but in a 'cool' way, not so much access to some 'cool' things that I would not really want to do, so I looked around and got the E71 and I am very pleased.The more time I spend customizing it the more indispensible it becomes (and it has just been 3 weeks). There is also a large online Nokia and Symbian community that help you find a lot of good apps and highlight important functions.I recommend-- the eye call app-- sms preview app-- nokia messaging client (i am using the free trial at the moment)-- vlingo (you can send text messages just by speaking to your phone)-- spending time to create shortcuts and customize buttons-- using the "search" function (allows you to search everything from google to your sms outbox)
My wife and I both got new unlocked Nokia's a few weeks ago. I love this phone. It replaces a Motorola Razor V3 and my Palm T3. This phone is beautiful and metal! The screen is very easy to read even out in daylight ( I always had trouble with my Motorola in the sun). There are a few functions I have not yet been able to get working yet (primarily Internet phone) but everything is easy to set up. I found an app from StyleTap that allows me to use most of the apps I had on my Palm T3. This alllows me to use many of those apps on my phone, especially the data bases I have set up, and many neat games. Of course I can't use a stylus, but that has not been too much of a problem. My T3 needs mechanical repair and won't let me make stylus input anyway. One thing I really like about the Nokia is the ability to multitask, something the iPhone can't do. The phone works perfectly. Calls are clear and I have no contract remaining with AT&T; so I was able to modify my current plan to include unlimited calls, messages, media messages and data for just $30 a month a $15 increase from the plan I was using for the Razor which allowed limited calling and data. If I had bought an iPhone under AT&T; plan, I would have paid about the same for a locked iPhone, but a data only plan of $30 is required by AT&T; for that phone. I get perfect 3G connections and I am also able to connect to my home network and other WiFi networks with a few clicks of the keypad. The keypad is small, but full QUERTY. I hated texting on the Razor but really like it on the Nokia. I have figured out how to get my big hands to work the tiny keys. The camera is easy to use and takes better pictures than my Razor did. This phone even has an FM radio! So in summary, this phone is fully customizable, has clear voice and is a great geeky smart phone.
I just LOVE it! I'm not going to write a super extensive review as other people has.Let me tell you I spent around 3 weeks checking out other devices and I saw this one as a very strong option.Nokia doesn't have the reputation a blackberry has when it comes to smartphones, so I read all the reviews that you may find out there about this phone and it's true what they say: it's so easy to fall in love with this phone in so little time. My brother saw mine and he bought himself another within a week.As for the hardware, I can't ask for more. Solid device! and the metal finish makes it look very professional and has impressed several of my friends so far. It doesn't look cheap at all.It can do pretty much anything you usually need. GPS is great. Web browsing with Opera Mini is great. Google Maps works amazing. Sports Tracker lets you go out for a run and track time, speed, altitude, route, etc.For texting of course, this is a great device. I rarely miss type something.The only reason I'm giving this phone 4/5 stars is because its vibration is not that strong. You can barely tell it's vibrating. If you depend on vibration only (no sound) then this may not be the phone for you. The ringtone volume may be set to ascending as a workaround, which I like actually.Yes, it works as phone too. Voice is loud and clear, just as you may expect from a Nokia!I don't think you'll regret buying this device. Amazing!If you're not in the whole touchscreen stuff and you need a phone that is not that "sensitive" or prone to be broken, then this is phone for you.ps.After reading a couple of reviews, go with E71 instead of E71x.
El Nokia E-71 es un excelente equipo, aporta una amplia gama de recursos y aplicaciones que permiten desde un rapida navegación hasta la edición de documentos, haciendo del equipo una herramienta de trabajo insuperable.
I bought the E71x - ATT version (lots of excess bloat ware - removable via 3rd party apps).  Awesome phone.  Excellent build quality, ergonomics are very good, capability is excellent, love the GPS.  I use it to read multiple blogs and Gmail, as well as an e-book reader.  Has multiple types of tethering, including ability to act as a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot for laptops!  Good web browsing, good phone, excellent calendar.  Takes a bit of time to customize everything and create shortcuts, but then it works the way I do.  Love the easily replaceable battery.
This is my first PDA phone and i am impressed by the functionality of this phone. There were many reviews that seamed to suggest that the QWERTY keyboard is cramped, however I did not feel that way while typing.The GPS functionality is awesome.. I am sure soon somebody will write an app for google maps, that will provide real time directions like other Navigation devices. I was also able to install skype on this phone, which is cool. Also, you need not even close the skype application. so if anyone wants to call you, they can call on skype, but you will be answering it on your phone... a very good feature for people with friends in other countries...The camera appears to be good, though i have not yet tried it much. The form factor of the phone is very similar to that of an iphone, but i certainly believe that this phone has a cool factor similar that of an iphone, with way better applications and functionality. I appreciate time and effort put in by other reviewers as it really helped me to decide whether to buy it or not.
This is the best phone I've owned so far.  Had a E65 before and older phones from Nokia.  They just keep getting better.  Everything is great about this phone except for my carrier (T-mobile).  After getting this phone 4 days ago I activated the online service for my phone.  I wasn't getting the 3G status so I called T-Mobile and found out that I won't be able to access T-Mobile's 3G service because of the different frequency or bandwidth that they use.  Not to happy about that but it's too late I really love this phone.  IF you are with AT&T; you are in luck because they announced that they are going to release this phone in black called the E71X.  I heard it will be $99.00 but no release date yet.  So if you are with T-Mobile forget about 3G.If your wondering why I gave it a top rating is because the phone is great.  It's just T-mobile :(
This phone meets all of my needs and expectations and then some.  The things I love about it most:- Battery life.  I get 8 days on a charge, even when using 3G, Wifi, texting and calling regularly.  I don't use Bluetooth or the GPS too much, so those might affect your battery life.  Still, the battery on this thing is really impressive.- Keyboard.  I have large hands, and my first day with this phone, I definitely had my share of typos.  That ended pretty quickly though and now I'm a typing machine.- Screen.  It took me weeks to realize that I hadn't removed the little plastic film on the screen as I'd been using the phone the whole time.  It even looked great through that plastic, and now it looks even nicer without it.- microSDHC support.  I put an 8 GB card in there I picked up for another $20 or so and I can't imagine lacking for storage now.Despite my 5 star rating (because for me it's a 5 star device), it does have a shortcoming or two.  They don't detract from my enjoyment of the device, but I think the more information you have, the better informed a purchase you can make:- The camera is just not good.  I have yet to take a good looking picture with it.  The colors always seem off to me and there are noticeable artifacts.- Software selection.  I'm in the US, but I think the S60 operating system is much more popular in Europe, and it shows in the software catalog available for this phone online.  Many of the apps you'll find are Euro-centric (for example, soccer score tracking or European news sites).  I found a variety of apps that provide all I need from the device, but if you're the kind that likes having lots of choice, you may be let down.  That said, this phone does run J2ME applications and it also includes the Nokia web runtime that lets you run web widgets (Google for Nokia WRT to find out what that's all about).All in all, I think people looking for a powerful phone with a full QWERTY keyboard would get a lot of use out of the E71.
First off, I must admit I actually made arrangements to return this phone after exactly one week. The rumors of reception problems are quite true, but once you understand the nature of the problem it is tolerable. The problem lies with the location of the antenna. If you hold the phone in a normal position and you are in a location that has a weaker signal ( 3 or less bars ), then your hand blocks the signal and reception is horrible. However, if you carefully hold the phone by avoiding the top and bottom of the phone, reception is not affected. This is annoying since my house is located in a rural location where the signal is not strong. Now while at home I simply put the phone down and only use a bluetooth headset thereby avoid touching the phone during a conversation. If you are in a strong signal area, there are absolutely no problems with reception no matter what you do or how you hold it. Just something you should be aware of. I decided to not return the phone because I love it in every other way and other smart phones have similar problems with reception. Perhaps they are emphasizing the "smart"  too much and not enough of the "phone" technology. The camera does indeed add a purplish tint, but the images are very sharp. The gps is wonderful. Battery life is EXCELLENT. Love all the features- far superior to many of the other phones available. Amazon was wonderful to deal with and was willing to take the phone back and arranged for UPS to pick it up, but I just couldn't bear to part with it.
I have had my E71 for about 2 weeks now, switching from a Motorola A1200.  I found the phone extremely easy to connect to WAP (no 3G in Costa Rica...yet.) and any wifi access point.  I have it connecting to our Exchange server, which was easy to do works flawlessly. Bottom line: connectivity is excellent.Call quality has been outstanding and reception is as strong if not stronger than on my A1200.It does everything that I want it to do.  For instance, the other night we were out looking at the stars and we wondering what some of the different stars are.  In five minutes I found Sideralis, downloaded and installed it and was looking up star/constellation information.  However, the coolest application that I have found so far is Fring, which allows you to make Skype/Skypeout and SIP calls.  Configuring Fring was dead easy and immediately I was able to access the phone system at work and make a call.There are three aspects that have given me slightly less than total joy:  first is the GPS and that's only because it takes a long time to determine my location (Costa Rica and 5 satellites).  Second is the camera, as everyone has been saying its less than ideal (but comparable to my A1200).  Third is that the keyboard is slightly small.  I have a lot of misspellings if I try to type too fast, but my accuracy is improving.The phone itself is a beautiful device and has an extremely solid feel to it.  Due to its thin profile, it fits discreetly in your pocket.  For the price, there isn't a better buy.
I ordered this for my wife who wanted  a full keyboard on her phone as opposed to the virtual keyboard I have on my iphone. I read the stellar reviews and frankly, they are all accurate. The device is absolutely beautiful to look at and amazingly compact. Setup is super easy. Just pop in your sim card and follow the wizard commands. I had email set up with AOL, the internet working on 3G and Wifi, and all my wife's contacts copied off the Sim card in under 20 minutes. I am not kidding. Make sure you have a basic, unlimitted data plan on board. The operating system (Symbian) is superb and is a cross between windows functionality and a the ease of a palm based system. I still love my iphone but this thing does stuff (video phone, for example) that the iphone does not do. It is absolutely superior to the blackberry bold and the high end samsung devices. Nokia has a real winner and I can see why this phone is so popular overseas.
Its an excellent phone except the following :1.The phone heated up twice without any application running. Not sure if it will happen again.2. If you do not have any WLAN or data connection, do not go online while using the GPS feature. The phone hangs.3. When you are out of your WLAN range and any of your applications running using WLAN, the phone will irritate you to search for a WLAN. So switch off all your application before you go out of your WLAN. This observation is only for WLAN not for data plan.Everything else is perfect. Enjoy the phone, its a good one.
Besides the Pros / Cons mentioned (but some to emphasize):Pros:- Superb sync with Apple OSX 10.5 applications (Even iTunes!!!). Contacts won't miss details.- Sound is very good and loud enough even to play music.- Great software available (including Google's apps).Cons:- Even battery is elsewhere rated as high performance, to me it last between 1 1/2 and 2 days per full charge. I'm using 3G for voice (30-45 min talk per day), Bluetooth off, WiFi On all the time (about 1 hour navigation per day). I might say it could be good to have extra chargers (the original is rated 800mA)- The Media player is very slow (Videos play with glitches most of the time).- The camera is a joke. Very noisy pictures. Colors never match originals in any condition.- 2GB Micro SD card was not included on mine (docs mention that this is depending on the market)Overall, does the job for it was intended: to keep in touch all the time.Hope it helps someone.
I've nothing but niceties about this phone. The 5 stars are for the phone.BUT and its a big BUT Nokia does not seem keen to release firmware updates for this version. The European version and the other NA version have had several software updates available, but not this one (product code 0569371). The support gets 0 stars.I've always been a fan of Nokia phones, but this is not acceptable at all! Search online for 0569371 and decide if what you find matters to you.
I have had several phones over the years.  The last few being, the iPhone (stolen whilst I slept on the subway!!), 8525 (or the slide) and a blackberry.  Although, I have to say I did like the touch screen of the iPhone, I found I am not missing it as much as I thought.  The iPhone didn't have copy, cut and paste, which although the E71 does, it's not as flexible as Blackberry.I am a business user, so I have connected my E71 to my companies GoodLinks account, which provides me with instant access to my works outlook email, along with customizable RSS feeds, notebook, contacts etc.For the gadget lover, there is a barcode scanner program built in, although I have played around testing it out, I haven't had it match anything yet.  From what I know, you can scan items and then see other places where you can get it cheaper etc.  There is a feature that will have your E71 read out you emails and texts to you with a choice of male or female voices, could be a nice feature if you multi task, but for me, it hasn't really been needed (except to show my friends with iPhones, that my phone is better...lol) It also has MP3 player and Video to name a few.Connection is fast, it has 3.5G I am with At&t; and although, they are OK, they are not normally the best for coverage here in NY, but this phone holds the signal well.The camera is a little disappointing.  It has a reddish tint to it.  I am unsure if it is just my phone, and I don't know anyone with an E71 to compare.  There are plenty of features for the camera, color mix (yes, I tried to adjust, so as to compensate), flash, B&W;/Sepia etc If anyone has a way to correct this, contact me at ttStone.com/contact/I found the GPS to be fairly accurate, although I remember the iPhone being near perfect.  The volume and sound quality on this phone is the best I have heard.  I can play some MP3's and my colleagues can hear clearly the music that is being played 40 feet away (it's not a busy office, but hey, that was way better than my previous phones)The construction is awesome, real metal back (looked like carbon effect in pics, but this isn't so) looks great though.  The protective screen finally came off 2 weeks ago, I didn't replace, but not a single scratch from being in my pocket.To put it simply, this is not an iPhone, it is a business phone.  It has items that would get any iPhone child going nuts for, but Nokia chose not to highlight them, which is wise, as this really is for the more sophisticated business user or the person that needs quality and effectiveness, rather than balloons and whistles.O yeah, I installed Skype on there (and it works!  A little slow, and no video, but...it works)[...]
As an owner of HTC TyTN II (Windows Mobile 6.1) with one year's heavy use and more recently my first Nokia - the e71, I would offer prospective buyers this feedback:I was eventually very frustrated with WM6.1 (being initially a Psion-EPOC and then for years Palm OS5 user with 'instant action'). The Windows platform is certainly "rich" in functionality - if you *really* wish to use all the bells and whistles which I, having used PDAs/phones for 15 years, found beyond my demanding professional needs. WM6.1 based PocketPC productivity software such as the very popular Pocket Informant 8 (my preferred Contact manager) offers wonderful features but is needlessly complicated and cross linked to other suites, and importantly is less than intuitive (compared to Nokia). This is not a complaint on PI - their support was great! full marks! - but symptomatic of many other WM6.1 software I use. As a result, the mighty TyTN II is too slow for simple things like quick access to calls, looking up contacts etc. and ultimately, I gave up. The TyTN - despite good memory size - also used to hang up and this despite regular memory management using Memaid, clearing caches etc. I used SpB Shell and related software to get better GUI but still it hung up...Overall, the "stickyness" of this platform caused me to wait for the simplest of functions such as for a contact to be found on my database and for him/her to be dialled out : tedious and impractical in a fast moving media business. Some aspects of being unable to Cut and Paste within WM6.1 applications gave me alittle heartache too. I did not care for WM6.1 onscreen touch-based virtual keyboard dialling software, prone to a few errors...pretty unslick.WM6.1 did render Internet Explorer/browsing and Windows Media Player/videos in much better performance and true HTML colour content than the Nokia e71 can manage (-Nokia is abit simplistic despite its marketing lines). I reccomend TyTN and WM6.1 here. Wifi connectivity with HTC TyTN II too is lightning-fast compared to slow and difficult to connect aspects of the e71 - very poor (I still can't get my Nokia to browse smoothly with my home wireless Netgear router).However, Nokia e71 in terms of intuitive handling is streets ahead of my TyTN II. Contact location and dialling (of the same database of 2000+ contacts as on TyTN) is achieved far more smoothly, faster by a long way, and in a more pleasing manner (to handle messaging options etc.) than, sadly, the HTC/WM6.1 combination ever could. Ultimately as a business user, this matters more to me. I do not miss the touch screen of WM6.1 at all. I can work faster with Nokia's Symbian OS drop down menus (+ D pad switch) which are far less intimidating than some reviews I read before purchase. And the form factor (slimness) of the e71 is all the more remarkable compared to the small but decidedly chunky and swivelly HTC. The e71 keyboard - vital for me - is a little more dainty but it is manageable even for big hands (I need to edit docs). I do not miss the admired TyTn II keyboard that much and am not that much slower on the Nokia either. The e71 battery life is also very good, two full days of heavy use+ and faster (2-3 hour) charging than the HTC. Call clarity is better on the e71. I do not use Bluetooth handsfree.All in all, if you want a mobile with more phone-type use, easy scheduling, faster lookups, adequate but not picture saavy photos, great form factor and battery, good enough keyboard, and intuitive use (I never consulted a manual)... then the e71 is a great phone (remarkably at half the cost!). If you are more into heavy Internet Explorer browsing and want all the richness of HTML-type displays, albeit in tiny form, or want very detailed scheduling options/contact parameters/heavy real GPS options, touchscreen... then maybe WM6.1 plus TyTN II is a way (the hardware I feel is ok, but it is the platform that lets it down). As a result of my experience, I will stay off WM6.1 phones myself for a while until significant "portability" by Microsoft is evidenced. I miss my Palm Treo 650's OS which, though dated, gave instant satisfaction (touchscreen).
I have just received my lovely nokia E71 5minutes ago. The look makes me excited.I have not set it up. But, I tell you what, this is the phone I have been longing for. I have searched for a phone of this nature for over 2months. Now I am convinced that this is it. In fact I love it, it is a gentleman's piece. If you are a gentleman go for it, you will love it too. There might be some little issues with it which I might realize later, I do not really care, I will fix them. The only accessory that came with it which does not feel like its family member is the head set. I wish Nokia should reconsider it.
I've owned this phone for a few months now and I can definitely recommend this phone.Pros: - Performance (8/10): Very fast and stable system. Has never crashed, although the Opera Mobile app has crashed a few times.  - Super fast on Wireless LAN.  - Amazing battery life (Charge can easily last over 2 days with moderate talk + heavy browsing) - Looks (9/10) : Very stylish and 'expensive' looks. Unlike Blackberry's cheap plastic looks the metal covers really gives it a stylish and sturdy feel. It's thinner and lighter than most blackberries. - GPS (8/10): Very good GPS, works very well with Google Maps. The built in GPS application is handy for calculating trip distance/current speeds etc. Very handy indeed. Nokia Maps are not very easy to use though. - Camera (8/10): Good cellphone camera with easy controls. Decent flash for night photography. The lens could be a little bigger. - Apps : Easy to load Google, Youtube etc. But not many frivolous apps on Ovi store (which may be a good thing).  - Easy to view/modify Windows Documents/Presentatations/sheets.- Saves lots of money on T-mobile Network (you pay $9.99/monthly for unlimited Internet). Will pay for itself in an year when compared to using a Blackberry phone.Cons:- Does not run on 3G in T-mobile Network.- Screen and Display  - Why is the screen so tiny? Why? Nokia left out a big band the top and bottom which could have very well been excellent addition to the Display real-estate (which would be a huge benefit when browsing)  - Screen resolution not sufficient (Nokia did not fix this even in E72! Not buying any future upgrades until Nokia upgrades the screen)- Buttons are a bit cramped.- No 3.5" headphone Jack (fixed in E72)- Messaging not adequate. No threaded SMS.- Ovi store lacks useful apps.- Interface could be easier. Sometimes difficult to find the controls for setting the apps/clocks/display.
I really like this phone, first I ordered a Blackberry 8900 but I wasn't satisfied of all, then I ordered the Nkia E71 and is perfect for me, actually my fiance want it too so I will order a new one or probably I order the E72. But the E71 is a perfect phone, it has everything you need, if you want to chat with somebody use the msn, also if you like to watch videos just downloads the youtube aplication for cell phones. Go get it...
I won't go into the long list of features it has (you can view that in the item description). But it does have alot of bells and whistles, and most work really well.The phone is sleek, slightly narrower and thinner than a Blackberry, and feels solid. I have had a hard time finding a suitable sleeve for it (I'm not a fan of the belt attachments).The features are mostly intuitive. The Nokia PC Suite software allows you to link up your phone with your computer, and move files back and forth, including contacts, photos, music... You can even write text messages from the computer while the phone is connected.The 3Mp camera is great, takes great photos and videos.I use the camera for personal things, but it does have the neat feature to toggle back and forth being a work profile and a personal one, to keep things separate.The only disappointing feature wear the earphones that came with it, which don't really work. I'm not a fan of cordless Bluetooth types, and there aren't any good alternatives.
very happy with it, it has gps, the camera takes pics and video, the contacts are easy to be managed. I gave up on a palm 650 for this smartphone
I have been using the phone for about 4 months now,with unlimited prepaid call and text plan from AT&T.; Without a dataplan, I am able to read all my emails: yahoo,gmail and my .edu mails as text messages on the go using.I love it, including signing into yahoo messenger and chatting with text message. MMS is perfect. Picture quality: fantastic. Because I dont spend much time viewing multimedia,my battery could last up to 3 days. Once I entered my house, I am connected online through wifi. I tried calling a friend with skype, it was fantastic.  The call history keeps record only up to 30 days.
Nokia's Swiss Army Knife - 5 Stars!The E71-2 US Version 'Communication Device' is more than a just a Cell Phone. Nokia has highly-Integrated several Powerful Feature Sets, that includes, GPS with Nokia Maps, Wi-Fi, Stereo BlueTooth, MicroSD Slot, Barcode, Sync, Radio, Recorder, Podcasting, QuickOffice, WLAN, and Quad-band GSM + US 3G compatibility via 850/1900 UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities.* Beautifully rendered with a Stainless Steel case, etched Graphics, and Cool metallic finish, and is notably THIN in size!  High-Resolution 2.4 inch screen, easy to use, one-digit tactile QWERTY.* Operates on the GSM Cell Frequency therefore, has more Versatility not only with GSM carriers like AT&T;, T-Mobile & Rogers, but GSM is most widely used in the rest of  the World.You just change out your SIM Card in wherever 'Country' you are traveling in and Presto ... You now have a Local and/or International Number, based on their Local rates!* You may also use Skype Lite 'inside' the fabulous Fring application and place Call's & Text's via Wi-Fi !!!!* BlueTooth is one of my most favorite features as I can Send & Receive > Music, Photo's, Movie Files and Word/Text Files, to ANY other BT Desktop or Laptop, as well as,  Print to my Canon BT Printer! Now how cool is that!* The Symbian 9.2 OS is Rock Solid and has NEVER Crashed on me!* Now for the Downside - 4 major drawbacks, at least for me, are:1. The 3.2 MP camera takes so-so photo's, but the Video is actually better! This could be fixed with a simple Software Update. (The Carl Zeiss 5MP camera is better!)2. Not MAC-compatible! It should have a Mac Version Updater!!!!3. Firmware Updates - Strongly Recommend that Nokia support all Future Updates, by giving Customers several 'Download' Options, like  Firmware Updates "packaged" in DMG, & Sis FILES; that can easily be downloaded directly online. Nokia R U listening?4. The iPhone has stolen the Show with AMAZING Free & Buy Applications that are being released right now and every few seconds! Nokia has FAILED to offer any  and/or enough Number of App's that even come close to Apple's.Conclusion - My Unlocked Nokia E71 has been in service since October 2008, exactly 1 year and has Performed Flawlessly.I signed-up with AT&T;, received a Free SIM card, have Multi-Media On-Demand (Text, SMS, etc) and getting 3G service.Very pleased with this purchase; however, my attention is beginning to wander over to the New iPhone 2010 model.I will most likely keep my E71 as a back-up and for travel abroad. Nokia's Technical Department, has been So Slow to respond to any Inquiries regarding updating it's Firmware (for which I have to keep a WinDoze Box around just for my Nokia). Not COOL!Overall Rating - I gave the E71-2, a 5-Star Rating because it's an Awesome Performing Communication Device. Seems that every week I discover yet another Cool Feature, that I may explore. However, I'm giving Nokia-USA only 4-Stars, simply because of the drawback's (con's) mentioned here.A Final Word of Caution - This Smart Phone / Device is for Smart People!
This phone is a lot better than I expected. Not as many applications as there are for the blackberry or iPhone, but most of those are useless anyway. This is just a great all around smart phone that does everything that a smart phone should.Pros:-Thin-Intuitive OS-Stable-Great Keyboard-Useful pre-loaded software-Comes with a caseCons:-Shiny metal is a finger print magnet
By far the best smartphone I have experienced. I've been an avid Blackberry fan up until deciding to replace my Blackberry Pearl with the Nokia E71. Mine was made in Finland which was a nice surprise! Somewhat heavy which gives it a very solid and well constructed feel. Screen is very clear, and the pictures are gorgeous. Typing takes some time to get used to, and I still hit a couple letters every once in a while that i don't mean to. All the basic phone capabilities (voice clarity, sound, connection) are as as good as any other.Basically a beautiful, stylish, thin and well-built phone that should last me a very long time. Ditch the Blackberry plastics for one of these!
I've had this phone for a week now and it does everything I need it to do.Quick rundown:Display is fantastic. Sharp, strong colors, and easy to see, even in strong sunlight.Battery life is ridiculously long... Seriously this phone doesn't quit. I can do a whole day of heavy browsing, emailing, texting, and voice on this thing and the battery is still at 75%.  I plug it into the charger when I get home and within an hour its fully charged again.Great keypad.. perfect for typing out long emails without worrying about typos and the damn thing just feels right when you are typing.Strong, clear voice communication.  Very often overlooked in phones these days.Fits well in your hand.Powerful operating system.  If you are the kind of person who can figure out intuitively how different gadgets, computers, programs work.. then you'll love this phone and be an extremely satisfied power user within a few days.  If you are less gadgety, then this phone will be annoying for you to figure out, and you should get something more user friendly... like an iPhone or a Blackberry.That being said, the unlocked nature of this phone is a big plus.  There are tons of free apps for Symbian on the net that you can easily install, along with lots of free themes, ringtones, etc.Now about style:These days, phones are alot like watches, shoes, etc... Your phone can say alot about you to someone else. Right or wrong, people can stereotype others based on their phones:iPhones are associated with fun, trendy, and $$ people, and more recently with fad based conspicuous consumption.Blackberry's are associated with boring corporate types.Rubberized clamshells are associated with construction workers...This phone isn't well known enough to say anything other than "classy" thanks to the understated, but elegant look.  The qwerty pad implies that you've got a real job, but the styling indicates you have a fun side too.  Its a great looking phone and you can expect to get random compliments and questions about it from people when they see it.
I am a heavy cell phone user.I use all the features, including audio streaming, Bluetooth, wi-fi, e-mail ( personal and professional ), take photos, make movies, and so on.Also, I read Word, Excel and Power Point documents on the go!And the Nokia E71 works fine in all situations!
Fantastic phone! The slim depth of the phone allows me to keep it in my pocket without any issues. The phone came with a really nice leather slip cover so it won't get scratched while in my pocket either. Lots of cool apps for this phone so I can customize it to how I need. Eg. can use it as a webcam for my computer over either wifi or bluetooth. I customized both the soft keys and the four app keys to my preferences. It works with gmail, gmaps (gps is FAST). I downloaded free maps of my area from Nokia (free because I didn't get the turn by turn route add-on). Honestly, from now on, I'm only getting phones that have their own fan websites ([...] Using the Nokia 'mail for exchange' app I'm able to sync my google calendar and contacts with the phone.On a side note, the phone I had before this one was a Samsung i550w that was also running Symbian S60 ... don't ever get an S60 phone from anyone but Nokia. Implementation by a Non-Nokia manufacturer will always be buggy.
This is one of the best phones ever....Wow for the sip client working on 3G....it works great...i am not using my gsm service any more....I got a Yupifon.com account and they helped me to configure it on the nokia so i make calls from voip instead of GSM from now on....!!!
This is a very good phone, with features that work above expectations. As a phone, it has an excellent signal even in difficult areas (where other phones have problems). Two applications I use are skype (through wifi) and gps with garmin software, and both work very good. It also has easy sync with PC (easier than with i-phone).Overall, well above expectations. I really recommend this product. I believe that nokia is the best brand for phones.
I had an E61 and E61i before so E71 was a natural choice... this phone now serves as my mp3 player and gps, i have a 8gig memory card which is 60% full now with songs and garmin maps. phone works much faster compared to both e61 and e61i... battery life is not as good as my e61i but again i m using this phone a lot compared to the previous one. i connect it to my car stereo to play music now, great sound quality.camera quality is not as good as e61i :( colors balance is really weird, nokia should try to fix that with a firmware upgrade, i dont like pressing the T button to autofocus either, its a real pain...sound quality is awesome, its a nokia so lets not talk more about the sound quality.no dual antenna like e61i, tends to lose bars when held from the bottom, so either change the way u hold the phone or dont waste ur money buying this phone.its the slimmest smart phone out there, and feels pretty solidly built. keyboard is smaller compared to e61i but u get used to it soon.i am using it on t-mobile so no 3g for me, i dont really care about 3g speed anyways as long as i can do some light browsing and check my email. i can use the front camera with cameraFX application, dont really like why nokia chose not to let us use the front camera to take pictures as they do in Nseries phones.in total, great phone with some shortcomings.... hopefully nokia would fix them in the upcoming firmware upgrades...
Simply put, you can't find any better smart phone. It's tiny, sleek, thin, big screen, real buttons (can't stand those touch screens), and has the Microsoft exchange server, which means it receives the email easily and automatically. No need to pull them & no need to erase them after a week. One can define when to get work emails, so lets say you can get work emails only between 8am to 8pm on weekdays. After that, you'll have to actively pull them. Genius.
The thing I love most about this phone is that it is excellent for email and texting.  This has completely changed my life, since I am not able to do work from wherever I am, including coffee shops, the movie theater, dinner parties, and even the bathroom.  It's great for a workaholic like myself.A feature I have really used is the voice recorder.  This has helped me to keep track of the million things I need to do every day.For a phone that does so much, the size is pretty good.  Not too big, not too small.
Pros- compact, well made does all it claims to do; only the camera is less than stellar. it's quad band GSM so works all over the world. GREAT for travelers!Cons- Very feature rich, you'll need to read the manual to get the full advantages out of this phone... don't expect too much from the camera as it doesn't do well in low light, but for me, the camera was not my primary concern.
Having read most of the reviews already posted, you should know that this is generally very powerful, high quality phone.  That said, a few items frustrated me.  Because of the amount and sophistication of the features of this phone, documentation is necessary, but lacking.  Both writtena and on-line.  Many of the features are several layers deep, and when you think you have figured out the general operating philosophy of the software, another application sets up completely differently.Nokia's support is prompt, but obviously just paraphrases steps in the Users' Guide when responding to a question.The browser is a step up from the Palm Treo, and the navigation takes some getting used to.  Don't expect it to be i-Phone like.  On a 3G network it is fast and functional, but not a replacement for a "PC style" browser.Be prepared to spend some time tinkering with settings and looking in odd places to change values.  This is a powerful, useful and quality item, but you are pretty much on your own putting it to full use.
I am incredibly happy with my Nokia e71. It is a very sturdy phone and I appreciate the stainless steel construction. The keypad is easy to get used to. I wasn't very impressed with Nokia maps either but it took no time to install Google maps, which I prefer anyway. There are a lot of features that even iphone doesn't support, like mms, full bluetooth connection, and can even support applications in the background so this is a perfect phone for me.
This is a great device, the GPS works great, I live in Panama, Central America, but I used the GPS in US, first time ever using a GPS and it was perfect, It detects every WLAN, good range, works inmediately with my SIM card I gave it a 5 stars for every single feature... I installed Fring to use Skype for international calls, my wife was very pleased, cuz she don`t have to use the computer and the headphones to call her sister anymore. I have big fingers and Im able to press the correct keys, so I dont have problems with the keyboard, is a little tight, but its useful, I was chatting thru msn yesterday and I wrote at a good speed, without mistakes.  The camera works great, to be honest, I have no Cons for this device, If you are planning buying one... go ahead, you will be glad to have one.
this gadget so complete and so simple to use, as Nokia Always it has been.Built-in GPS receiver, very fast 3G.A-GPS functionJava MIDP 2.0MP3/AAC/MPEG4 playerOffice applicationsFM radioPush to talk, great battery life up to 10+ hoursVoice command/dial, Skype app works great, amazing VoipPIM including calendar, to-do list and printingBuilt-in handsfreei also have push mail, up to ten accounts, and nokia chat too.
El mejor producto que he tenido de Nokia, aun mejor que mi antiguo Blackberry 8700g.El nokia E71 me ha dejado sorprendido por sus amplia capacidad y velocidad. Wifi, GPS, Office, Mail, MSN, Jabber. UUffffsss una computadora super compacta.Si he decir que la camara no es muy buena, sin embargo, si deseo buenas fotos las tomo con mi camara digital.Muy recomendado.
Amazon: great counterparty to trade with.Cell phone: find it great, slim, good looking, easy to type, wifi is what i was missing with my prior cell phone and it turns to be great.Only thing missing: touchscreen.
I really like my Nokia E71! You can use a lot of applications, it's sturdy and looks just gorgeous. The only drawback is pretty short battery life, but it easily lasts for 2 days.
WELL I STUDY EVERY PHONE I EVER BOUGHT AND THIS IS THE BEST BY FAR. I don't need my regular back up phone because the batter is long lasting through youtube,searching the internet, playing music, listening to audiobooks all on this phone they have website to find these things they are great. please by this phone unlocked  you get the metal back.this phone is awesome i never had a smartphone  but i'm not going back to a dumb one anytime soon haha. now that i have a small computer ,audiobook,radio,mp3 player,fax modem,in my pocket the world is at my feet so to speak.oh 2 camera, video camera. took it to the hospital when the baby was born. i wished i had it for the others. well this phone is the bomb. it keeps note in activenotes, conference calls. we are think of getting rid of the home dsl service and just plug it up to the phone when we get home haven't decided yet. but with this phone the option is there. see you soon
This is a great Nokia phone! The only drawback is the closeness of the keys, but that is expected on such a narrow instrument. I have almost gotten used to it, and it is serving me well. Thanks Nokia!
love every thing ond the phone.. the only bad thing is  they  get  to hot if you have a long phonecall
The E71 is a fantastic product.  It's thin and has excellent features that fits my lifestyle.  It has frozen on me a few times but apart from that i am totally satisfied.
The phone works great.  It takes a little while to learn how to use it and all of the features but once you get used to it, you realize how smart the phone is.  My Samsung Eternity was much more user-friendly but wasn't what I needed for work so I gave that one to my son who loves it.  Initially, I had trouble with the web-browser on the Nokia E71 - it kept shutting down - so I had to reload the phone's software using PC Suite (back-up first because it wipes out all the info on your phone) and it's worked great ever since.  The battery lasts 2-3 days w/average data use and talking.  I'm very happy with this phone considering it was the most affordable unlocked AT&T; smartphone besides the plastic version.
This is an all-around amazing phone, from feature set to call quality. A great value too. Google Maps, Gmail, Opera, Fring, Putty and Bloomberg are fantastic on it. I use it more as a handheld computer than phone.
The phone by itself is the best phone I have ever had; it works terrific for my work as well as for my personal usage. This was my first ever online purchase and I am thrilled about having used Amazon.com to start with my online purchases. Great service and great item!I highly recommend it!
I have always been a big nokia fan..One thing I like about them is their pro user approach. They like to empower the user by letting him do as much as possible with the device. The E71 does almost everything its processor is capable of. Email Videos Radio Third Party Apps, GPS.A shortcoming I feel is its camera, not the very best, doesnt give good pictures in dim lights..but i hvnt compared it to others so..just a personal perception.Overall it looks impressive and is capable of al lot of things.. and certainly a lot more powerful than E71x from ATT.I wish it had a bigger touch capable screen..but i guess u cant ask for more in 300 USD.Overall I am happy.
Hello E71 fans & future fans in which im sure you will become once you purchase this GREAT piece of hardware...First off,i would like to say i was a little shaky buying a $300.00 phone just by reading reviews about it but let me tell you what,this has to be the best investment i've made in a VERY long time.Once you get the E71 in your hand you will know right away that you've made a solid choice,THEN when you power it up...OMG! you actually want to kick yourself for waiting so long to get it.Again,i could go on forever telling you what it does & doesnt do but hey,i'll leave that for the pickey people,saying things like (3.2 camera could be better or no 3.5mm headjack)WAH!WAH!WAH! If those are my biggest complaints then i like to think i came out smelling like a rose.So,for all you BB & iphone users there is another little fellow in town who's making some noise and his name is "Nokia E71!"Enjoy your purchase and enjoy the compliments because you will be getting a bunch!
I like this cellular one so that it is complete, has many things interesting, the bad thing is that some videos do not reproduce very well, and the camera is very poor to comparison of other equipment, the rest works perfectly
great product at a good price; internet access with laptop and multiple other great features
Besides the fact that it does not have a messenger application such as BB messenger, it is without a doubt the best smartphone in the market right now.
It's the best phone I've had... I used to have a Sony Ericsson w800i and traded it for my new Nokia E71 'cause for me, it's the best brand out there. The phone works perfect! Thanks so much!
I have used at least 50 different phones in the past 2 years. The E71 is one I always come back to. The only thing lacking is the camera quality which should be improved in the soon to be released E72.... Yes, I will be buying it too.
Bought this phone for my brother, he has been looking at it for some time now. It is a great phone for people who don't want to lose touch with the office while out of the office. It allows for two email accounts to be used simultaniously, not to mention the phone also has wifi. Another great feature is being able to switch from one application to another without ending the application you were originally using and it is very easy to shuffle from one to the other. The phone looks great as well and feels great in your hand. The keyboard works perfectly even if it may seems a bit tight at first. It functions identically to a regular keyboard even with the short commands for cut, copy and paste. Long and short this phone works great and would recommend it to anyone who wants an alternative to blackberry or replacement of a Blackberry. The nokia E71 is alot easier to use.
I was looking for a phone with wi-fi and the possibility of editing office documents. That is exactly what I got, plus a nice design, GPS, good sound (e.g., MP3), good quality in pictures and video and a decent-size screen. Compared to other brands and models, the E71 has a great package.I bought it through TigerDirect; the service was ok, exactly the delivery time they said. The only thing was they didn't have a tracking system for my package, but it was safely delivered anyways.
This is a great phone. Built-in WIFI, GPS, pdf reader, word, excel and powerpoint editing apps among others. You can also download tons of apps. The phone is relatively small for the features it offers and very very thin. Although the keys are compacted/close you will have no problems typing.
It looks stylish.  If you have ever had a Nokia phone, it won't be difficult for you to get used to the Nokia E71.The reception signal is very good, I used to have a Sony Ericsson T303, which was a headache.  The old phone could not find the signal, maybe it was too weak.  But with this Nokia E71 that problem disappeared.I compared it with the iPhone and found these main differences:- The battery of the E71 lasts much longer.- The software of the iPhone is more user friendly than the E71.- Both cameras are almost the same considering their quality.- You can record video on the E71.However I like my new Nokia E71. I wish it could synchronize easily with the Google Calendar, which I haven't been able to do.
I own both a Palm Treo 750v and the Nokia E71 and I tell you that the Nokia E71 has all what it claimed to be. I gave the Treo to my wife and I kept the Nokia E71 (as with my other unlocked GSM phone , the Nokia N95 8GB, which I use when I go overseas)because of usability. The screen resolution of the E71 is better than both the Treo and the N95 and it's more handy, although it weighs heavier because of the all-metal material which is good quality. The only negative thing I can say about the Nokia E71 is that it does not support many attachments on my email which I did not have a problem opening withthe Treo 750v. But other than that, Nokia E71 is the best buy that I ever did at Amazon next to Nokia N95 8GB. And it's made in Finland.
I am very pleased with my purchase (nokia e71) and I have no complaints.  I would be gald to recommend Amazon to anyone who has doubts.
I bought this phone recently with a good price from Gold box deal and I'm very pleased with it. It has everything I need for my business, is easy to navigate, slim, comes with cover, nice camera and good battery! I wouldn't choose any other phone for business needs and I do believe it is 1st best Nokia phone launched in US. If you want cheaper version but also great phone, look for nokia e77. the only difference between these two are: plastic cover instead of metal, no GPS and just 1 camera instead of 2 as here in e71.My husband also bought this phone from Amazon Store but he wasn't fortunate enough with a price. He paid for it $342 and after 2 days price has dropped to $319. He asked Amazon for a refund of a difference but unfortunately they don't have Price Protection Policy.A price protection guarantee extends assurances to a consumer that upon buying an item, if the customer finds the same item cheaper from another or same vendor, the original seller will match the price by refunding the difference to the buyer. A time restraint of 30 days is typical, and other conditions apply which can vary among retailers. Price protection guarantee provides a powerful incentive for building online customer loyalty in an economic model that allows for easy comparative shopping and highly competitive pricing. Even before a customer buys an item, he or she can use the price protection guarantee to ask a vendor to match a lower price. I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't have it. They are allowed to change prices daily and if you aren't lucky to get a really good deal, you can get ripped off from your purchase just in a few days :(Today you can buy the same phone for way under $300 with free price protection plan from other vendors. It's a good lesson for me and my hubby to look more careful for items we wanna buy and really reconsider other sellers not just Amazon.
Love my NokiaE71. Does everything I ask for and more. Like the fact that I can download podcasts, carry lot's of music and audio books by adding the MicroSD. Haven't tried the camera yet. Too busy trying to find out what else I can do with this phone. Wi-Fi works great and was easy to setup with my home network. Can even print from my phone.Wasn't to happy with the fact that I have to pay monthly/year for GPS map subcription but it does work fine. E-mail works ok. Does'nt always download at regular intervals.  Windows live was suppose to be available on the phone but can't seem to find it or get an answer from Nokia support. Over all great phone.  P.S. My wife has one and loves it. Works great with the bluetooh headphones while she walking or working out in the gym.
I bought this phone as a replacement for the Blackberry Bold i would have liked to get. But instead i find myself really enjoying this phone, very easy to use. Not lightning quick but quick enough, the screen is of a decent quality with images well represented, although you need to stick to a simple wallpaper as a active one will just make it hard to see the icons and stuff. The only thing i can mark this phone down on is the Camera and the GPS, but i am not going to mark it down any on the ratings. Because if you want to take good pic's you get a camera and the same with GPS. All though i do feel that Nokia has engineered the GPS not to work as quickly if you stop A-GPS connection to a network. IF you do this then sometimes the GPS will take too long to connect like 20 mins or not at all. Which defeats the purpose as you've already reached your destinatino by then. Overall a great phone for interent and wifi and texting. I love this phone and recomend it to all the people wanting a blackberry but dont want to stump up the cash for it. This is a good option, enjoy!
I like this phone. It has tons of features. Nokia tries to bundle as many features as possible to include in this model. You can read about in the the features and from other readers.Personally I feel 1) this phone is not easy to hold like blackberry. It is small but heavy and slippery. 2) I can not save settings in camera. 3) It's menu should have more intuitive and easier to use. Saying these I love this phone.
If you have a telephone with all the functions that a phone can have(and everything works fast and accurate), with a beautifull design and builded with luxury materials. Can you ask for something else?I dont think so.Probably the best nokia in years.Take it. you will not regret.
This is a good phone, but not a real good smart phone. It has wi-fi, easily shifts between email accounts,can send group texts; it does a lot of things real well. The challenge I had was the size. The phone fits nicely in your pocket, but I had to get a rubber case to feel comfortable typing on it without worrying about dropping the phone ( I didn't). The intuitive text is very nice, and the keys feel good and secure, just a little bit bigger would have been great. This being a Nokia phone, the battery life was great, and best of all you get FREE customer service from Nokia.
Feels great in your hand and the keyboard buttons are much better than the Blackjack II that I broke.  Amazingly thin and fits well in a pocket.  Also feels more sturdy with the metal casing versus the flimsy plastic on my blackjack. The OS runs well and doesn't lag.  It took a little time to get used to versus Windows mobile,  which had a pretty idiot-proof layout, but it wasn't killer.  I like the media player, especially since it doesn't limit the number of songs you can have (I had a motorola with itunes before, which I loved, but was limited to 100 songs).  The screen is pretty large and the light sensor is nifty because it makes the buttons light up when you're in a shady or dark place--literally, not metaphorically. It doesn't adjust to your emotional state, friends.  The screen looks good; even in bright sunlight I can read my emails.  Camera is amazing.  Free google maps runs great with the GPS.  Some Web sites like pandora and hulu have yet to make apps for the operating system, which is a shame.  You probably can look up the regular Web site though, but large format video would have trouble with the display.  I haven't tried pandora to see if it runs fine just in the browser yet.  Connects with  wifi as well as 3G, which is nice.  Has cut and paste ability.  I think the iphone may have recently added that, which I guess was a big deal (???).  Biggest bother to me is that the keyboard seems a little loose so that it'll sometimes shift down and lets a little line of light out from beneath the screen.  Especially disappointing since it seems Nokia put so much effort into the other details.  I mean, it has a camera for video-phoning, which I'll probably never use.  Why the slippy keyboard?  Overall, still worth the money.  Great, great phone at a decent price.note:  I read that you could tether with your laptop to connect it online through the phone.  I tried with my macbook and it said I needed to contact my provider.  I called AT&T; and they said it was a $60 monthly fee to have.  So it's not free folks, and at least not worth it to me.  I'm still happy though.
The size, the weight, the OS, the screen resolution, the apps, the qwerty, the desing...everything is great.
A surprisingly thin phone, not to light, but as heavy as another regular phone I use to have.The complete keyboard is one of its good points, I can write very fast with it, considering I have big hands. I can type with one finger from each hand, or with the thumb of the same hand I'm holding the phone.The applications and the start screen are very intuitive. Another good thing is I was able to install Fring [...], so now I can chat with Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger, talk using Skype, etc.The music playing is decent, not as good as a dedicated gadget (iPod), but this way I don't have to carry gadgets in my belt like a cowboy. (I thought about getting an iPhone, but I wanted to install any application and don't wanted to unlock the iPhone)Connecting the phone to the computer using Nokia PC Suite was smooth and now I have all my contacts and tasks on the phone.Great phone, at a great price.
Everything was excellent, without any trouble.I recommend everybody the phone and the service given by Amazon
Pros: slim, sexy, very good QWERTY, multi-threading, Symbian OSCons: camera, RAM 128MB
Nokia make great phones and this is one of them. The features are top notch and better then most phones have these days. There are some features you don't need like the infrared port but you will never know, you will need them. The E71 is lightweight and not a fan of S60 OS but in time will get use to the phone. The call quality is excellent. People keep telling me, if I was on a land-line. The keyboard is nice, made some error, but hey, first time use can be rough. Only wish is for this phone to be an touch screen so would become an iphone killer.
A great phone packed with features at an amazing price with Nokia build quality. How can you go wrong with that? I used a htc tytn before and had issues with the phone so when it was time to replace, I decided to try the Nokia because of the feature set and price.The good:1) Great feature set in a (relatively) small and light form factor.2) Ability to read you your txt messages and contact names when they call is very cool.3) Lots of software available for the platform (check out Nimbuzz for a great mobile chat client).4) Great battery life (2-3 days) compared with my tytn which averaged 1.5 days.5) Paired with a 8gb card, i have immediate access to all my files and even have space for some music for those idle moments.The bad:1) Menu structure isn't the best. Would have probably been better to at least follow other nokia layouts. You can get around this by configuring your home screens to access frequently used options.2) Keyboard keys small but that's the price of smaller and lighter. The tradeoff is acceptable.3) No ability to sync with Outlook if you don't have MS exchange.4)Camera is poor but this is a phone. If great pics important, get a good camera. Any cameraphone is going to be a compromise.All in all, this cost less than half of what I paid for my tytn years ago with a better feature set. Highly recommended.
Este celular es un equipo super completo, tiene de todo y mucho mas! Lo recomiendo!David Tejeda Goico
One of the best smartphone's out in the market. Very impressed with the battery life and tons of nice features.
This is the best nokia ever made. Made in Finland, excellent tactile feedback, Great battery life, it has a prediction system to type fast (in my native language the predictive writing also put the accents, that's nice because you don't need to worry about tricky button combinations). This nokia has IR that mean that you can install the best and most practical software ever made: psiloc IR Remote, your mobile as a Universal Remote, great!.This phone is better than the new E75 and E55 (this two doesn't have IR).The screen is OK for me, very large.I recommend this phone, for all the functionality is impossible to find another phone for the money.
This is the best phone out from Nokia as of today. Solid design, overall metal casing, good design and craftsmanship. The first ever smartphone or PDA that is not bulky. Buttons are easy to press even I have huge meaty fingerstip-type. camera is ok. OS is good which I wish its a windows mobile. The best of all is the free "Advance call manager" which works wonders against harassing dumb callers ;)
This is a  very well built and easy to use phone.  I just installed my SIM card from AT&T; and the setup wizzard did the rest.  It set up my internet settings automatically.  I also had no issues accessing my Gmail account.  Very simple, it took 10 minutes.I didn't bother with Nokia maps, instead I installed a Micro HCSD card and installed Google maps on it with no problems at all.Call quality is great and the volume is LOUD, even on a medium settings.  The keys on the qwerty keyboard feel nice when I press it.  If you text allot or use e-mail then I recomend this phone.  Well built, great reception, and nice and thin.Camera could be better.  Works fine where there is plenty of light, but indoor even with flas the pictures are a bit dark.  Then again if you want super pictures, buy a digital camera or spend lots more money on another phone.  Great phone for the price.
Great phone! Has all the features that are currently available. Qwerty is small yet it is not by any cramped. Makes for very easy typing. The phone itself is very sleek and compact. Rest assured that this phone will definitely turn heads!
I have this phone now for about three weeks and I must say it exceeded my expectations on all levels.Compared with the BB Bold which I had for two weeks and returned,it is a much better value for the money.You can add Google maps,Yahoo,etc and many more applicaions.The only issue right now is the battery which is not lasting as long as I expected (at best 2 days).I hope it is a defective piece and that either Amazon or Nokia will rectify and that is why I gave it only 4 stars.I  would highly recommend this phone.Very slim so it can fit on the front pocket with no problems.
Good news, Firmware update is available. Update your firmware, this phone will really satisfy you.
I'm been using Blackberry phones for a long time and coming from that to Nokia ones was a little daunting for me simply because i don't know all the menus and stuff, where with Blackberry i know all the menu functions. In my opinion, the default email client with E71 is a little quirky, i then discovered Nokia email client that one can get at [...] the client installs easily on the phone and it runs very smoothly. I use Gmail as my primary account and compared Nokia Email with Gmail Mobile 2.0, Nokia Email is easily better.Call quality is exceptional on this phone and i like the look and feel of the Symbian OS.All in all, i like this phone so much that i will now start more closely at Nokia Phones.
I have been using the Nokia E71 as a replacement for my Treo 680, and I must say it is a lot fancier, and with a very improved battery life, with a much better bluetooth handling, as well as music management, email, and possibility to chat and voip that is completely unbelievable with the previous cellular.What I still have not been able to get over is the calendar, view as well as the ease to input or goto reminders or meetings and read the notes. I must say that the thing I miss the most is the task management, since it doesn't even allow me to input tasks or todo's directly from the home screen.Aside from that, it is a very good cell phone, and worth the $350 I paid for.
Revision: It broke but was replaced at no charge by Nokia. Took a week to replace.Overall a great phone, nice and solid feel and good screen.GPS software is not useful unless you want to pay [...] bucks, but Google does the trick if you have data signal.Email client is a bit crappy, try nokia mail which may not always be free.Upgrade your firmware, Europe has better firmware, you have to trick phone into thinking it's from Europe by changing a code in it. Version 200 something it comes with 107 or 100.
I Love this phone!! When I first got it I was having some minor difficulties trying to get my email together, I was also doing it without reading any manuals.Note To T-Mobile Users: Call them!! They are happy to help you set your phone up and change your service so the phone will work correctly. I called them up and they send a few things to the phone and it set my connection up with no issues. I'm coming from using the Sidekick so they switched me over to the Smartphone plan.With this phone you need Unlimited net access.I'm a serious texting manic so I really needed it.One bad thing that I cans say about this phone is the lack of The Yahoo Messenger, there are third party apps that have it on there but I prefer the original.Other than that the phone is great. I owned the BBerry Curve and prefer this over it. I even use my wireless net at home with it.
This phone is simply amazing. on Tmobile Edge it's 2.5G, but on At&t; it's 3.5G!!! here's a tip. get data plan only for aT&t; and you save 5 buxs vs tmobile's data plan.software is polished, unlike Blackberry. streaming Youtube 2.5G or 3.5G is a charm. try that on a grossly overpriced, plastic Blackberry.This phone puts all those Korean, Taiwan made to shame, clearly Nokia has hardware and softwaredesign team. This phone is neck n neck with Apple 3G.There's pros n cons for these 2 powerhouse.
It does as designed very well. It's taken a bit to get use to after using Motorola products.I like the very clear communitaion audio, and the great sensitivity it has.It's very lightweight, and thin in size.Long battery lifeYes, I would purchase again.Yes, I would recomend it.
Using this on AT&T; 3G network, thorughout southern New England, metro NYC and metro Philly.  Excellent phone reception...I've never had so few dropped calls.  My Treo 750 wasn't bad on dropped calls, but the E71 drops almost no calls...even with the lousy cell coverage at my house.  Love the thin profile of the phone, too.  The pouch that came with the phoen is great, too.  Slips easily into a pant pocket and keeps it looking great.  I'm using the phone to pick-up my corporate e-mail (Exchange Server)...this has been great, e-mails are pushed and I often see them on my phone faster than on the computer at the office!  I'm also now easily able to pick-up my personal e-mail with Yahoo and Comcast.  Much easier (and faster) than what I saw on those accounts on my Treo.  Unlike some posters, I've been pretty happy with the web browser.  Also the camera is pretty good.  I snapped a few photos at a recent Bruins game, and they looked good.My only real complaint is my Bluetooth earpiece constantly disconnects and re-connects on a regular basis after it's been connected for about 2 hours...this has happened with two different ear pieces.  It's very annoying and doesn't allow the bluetooth to "sleep", so I think it is also killing the bluetooth battery faster than usual.  Looks to be a bug that Nokia needs to fix!
I purchased this item direct from amazon without ever seeing it in person. I based my decision on many of the reviews I read online and the device's features.I will say that this is one of the best smartphones I have ever used and seen, being that I have worked in wireless for quite a bit of time.The phone's operating system is stable and fully-featured, and there are many programs available that can help you personalize it even more.It's features may be of the norm of any other smartphone, but when you actually see how thin, narrow and sexy it is, you will wonder how they fit it all into something this small.I have used it for a little over two weeks now, and I must say that I have never been happier with any other smartphone until now.If you are looking for a fully-featured device that's not going to take up so much space in your pocket, your purse or anything else, you need to invest in this item.Nokia deserves all the credit for making such an awesome product!
This is a very nice phone, at a good price, with excelent features, I like it to much, at this moment I have no problems with it.
I have had this phone for about 5 months now, and I love all of it's capabilities. I have not owned an iphone or a blackberry, but I have to say that this phone has every with the exception of a touch screen.  The greatest benefit is the fact that I can connect it to my laptop and have access to the internet where ever I am using my provider's(ATT) media net service without the need for wifi hotspots.  Overall, it serves its purpose as a business phone.  The pictures are not the best quality for a 3.2 megapixel camera, but the video quality if fine.
I've always liked having a phone and PDA which are separate.  I've used HP iPaq Pocket PC for years with Motorola V3.  I've now replaced the V3 with the Nokia but still like using the PDA in combination.  The Nokia is terrific and very small and sleek.  It has tons of great features but I really like Google Maps/GPS with it. It can also be set up as a WiFi router so others can use your internet service.  The keyboard is small but usable so it works well when you want to leave PDA behind (like when skiing).  However for organizing and responding to a lots of e-mails, I prefer to use the iPaq's excellent Transcriber feature, which reads any handwriting and just Bluetooth to the Nokia to Internet.  I also find iPaq's Pocket PC interface with Outlook to be flawless and the screen is much bigger so much easier to read (with my 54 year old eyes).  Some people told me the battery on the E-71 was not good but I find it to be great.  To summarize, I love the phone but strongly suggest combining it with and iPaq so you get the best of both worlds.
This is a truly great phone. I had used an iPhone for about 2 weeks before selling it and buying this phone. This phone functions much better. No reception problems and amazing battery life ( I'm currently at about 1/2 after 2 days of regular voice and data usage ). The phone also has a very solid, high quality feel to it, nothing feels cheap. Real metal is a big plus, I get tired of chromed plastic. The keyboard is very useful; much better than the iPhone's touch screen. As for the OS, it took me a little while to get used to, but after a day or two I could quickly navigate the menus. This phone is still as impressive to me as when I took it out of the box a month ago.
Great phone that I would wholeheartedly recommend to those looking for a stable, stylish, productivity oriented smartphone... except for the lack of firmware support from Nokia for the NAM versions of the phone. Nokia has failed to provide updates for these phones for at least the last two firmware updates, so take into consideration the fact that you will likely not be able to take advantage of firmware delivered stability, bug fix and feature improvements.
This cell phone it's very good. It has many useful functions like gps, wlan, bluetooth, switch mode, usb, microSD until 8Gb, full QWERTY keyboard, very small form factor, good photos and videos. The cons are the battery isn't good because it doesn't stay charged for the time indicated in the specifications.
I have had this phone for a month now and I love it for the phone functionality it provides.  I have switched it to GSM mode and the battery lasts 5+ days easily with moderate phone use.The internet browsing is not at par as iphone but I dont use it as much.  The phone is really slim and looks great.
This phone has lots of features which the iPhone lacks.  3.2 meg camera, skype with webcam, cut and paste, real MMS, replaceable battery, long battery life, great small keyboard.  Oh yeah, you can also do all that iPhone stuff with music, pictures etc.  I have had this about 2 weeks and absolutely love it.  Several of my iPhone friends are jealous of the features they lack.  This does not have an accelerometer or a touch screen but those features are not what I was looking for and you do not miss them at all using the phone
I recently bought this phone and i love it... it have a lot of applications for every day activities and for stay in touch with the office.Is not too big and a little bit heavy but not too much... it worth the price...
This is my fourth phone in two years, previous devices include Blackberry 8700c, Palm Treo 650, and most recently, the AT&T; tilt. The E71 blows them all away. I received my steel gray version just a day ago and have been able to test approximately 35% of its rich feature set. The phone is beautiful and the design is extremely elegant. Very clearly, Nokia put in a lot of thought into its ergonomics and aesthetics. It is sized just right to fit into the palm and can be operated using just the fingers of the holding hand. It is very thin and light, yet as other reviewers have commented, the build quality is superb with high quality materials. The user interface and menu system is quite self-explanatory. Email setup is easy. Discovery of WiFi networks and their setup is also very easy. Web browser is fast! In fact the entire operating system is very fast. So far, I am very, very pleased with this phone. It looks classy, polished, and elegant. Definitely will draw second takes from onlookers. Will update this review with additional comments in a couple of weeks.
This is a really slick and fantastic well designed smart-phone for the person that do want a Qwerty keyboard on a very compact phone.It has a really rich and nice feeling to it and if you download the latest "Fring" and "skype" free software to it like I did you have an almost free phone to the whole world via the internet. Fantastic deal!
Well, this is the best phone *I've* ever owned anyway.  It does it all, you can shoot video, still photos.. comes with great games and you can download more for free.  Lots of free applications of all sorts online.  I use it for email on the road, as well as keeping notes on the note application.  You can add a memory card to put MP3's or even movies on and play them on your phone.I previously had a Nokia E61 and loved it... until I dropped it in a bucket of motor oil and it went bye bye.  Then, in a mad panic, I went to my carrier and bought "the best phone you have now!".  They sold me a blackberry curve.. from the moment I bought it I thought it was crap.. totally locked down, hardly any free apps.. just a miserable experience.  I had to use that phone for nearly a year before I "accidentally" dropped that one in the toilet and had to buy a new one.Well, you better believe I went straight for the phone I had been dreaming of.. the E71.  I use it with Qik.com to shoot live videos straight from my phone to the web so I can be a mobile broadcaster.  I use it for my schedule, contacts.. and I sync everything to the web over the air for free with zyb.com.  Try that with a blackberry... you can do it but only if you pay money for a 3rd party program.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't make my breakfast in the morning.. also the 3.2 megapixel camera is awesome, but when other guys have nicer cameras, some as high as 8megapixels, you have to believe there's room for improvement.  The built in GPS kicks butt as well, but I had to download Google Maps to make it work right.  The included Nokia maps didn't seem to work right at first.  I got it to work later, but since google maps is free anyway, and Nokia Maps makes you pay after like 3 months of service I decided not to even get attached to it.But like I said, this thing is awesome and I highly recommend it to all my friends and family.
pros:flash on cameragpswifi worked greatcons:Nokia software (calendar,phone book) not very helpful. I downloaded google to sync. Had a hard time saving photos to my computer. Should be easier.screen is small for gps directions and web viewing
Very nice cell phone with very good camera, reasonable size and weight.But if you have many business contacts you will not be able to organized them by Organization. The only way to sort your contacts is by Last, First Name. Or you will have to create groups for each company, which is a hard job.Another disadvantage is that you will not be able to search contacts by Company, Telephone number or other data. You can onlys search Names (first or last)All this is a terrible mistake if Nokia wants to compete against Windows or Palm systems cell phones.Besides this considerations is a strong device with many capabilities and for experienced users.
Very very good mobil.Este equipo es una maravilla, es un celular muy completo , trae 3g, gps y wifi. No tiene que envidiarle en nada con el mejor de los blackberry. El precio es bastante accesible.Hay muchisimas aplicaciones en symbian.Yo tuve un htc touch y no hay nada mejor que escribir mensajes directamente con un teclado completo.Totalmente desbloqueado, nada mas poner el chip y listo. Me tomo el 3G sin configurar nada.Definitivamente nokia es nokia.
Este teléfono cuenta con todas las aplicaciones necesarias para convertirlo en una pieza clave tanto para el trabajo como en la casa, es liviano, tamaño apropiado, cámara con muy buena resolución, la navegación entre las aplicaciones es rápida, compatible totalmente con  3G, puede ser uusado con cualquier operador GSM, en fin lo recomiendo ampliamente.
I'd put no stars if i could. I purchased this phone in February. It started to "crackle" so I sent it to Nokia last week for repair. I received it back in 5 days with a note saying it was not able to be repaired due to corrosion! I have since seen several similar reports on the internet about poor customer service from Nokia and that this corrosion issue is a COMMON response. My phone has never been wet or abused. It was a good phone, worked well and it's very attractive. Now junk. I have emailed and called and spoken to customer care "specialists" that say "so sorry, can't help. Our technicians know... Not covered....." I am beyond frustrated. If this corrosion is true, it must be a defect but they don't want to hear it. This is not a cheap phone, paid for the U.S. warranty for what reason??? I have had several Nokias over the years and told everyone how great they were. Now, I will buy some other company. Almost ANY other. Too bad, they have lost a loyal customer. If they respond, which I have little hope they will, I will update my review.It really is a cool phone which I'd hoped to enjoy for a few years, not months.Update: I miss my phone, it's very sad. Amazon rocks! They stepped up and helped me. I am very close to getting this phone again. I must have gotten the bad one. No other phone matches it, and I've looked.
me encanta este telefono, llego en perfectas condiciones a Venezuela ... no tuve problemas con La Línea, desbloqueado totalmente a Cualquier Operadora. Lo unico malo es que no trajo memoria externa!
This is a very nice and good phone but it coukd be better, it doesn't charge thru the USB for instance.
Tras comprar este equipo, le pusimos un chip Movistar Venezuela e inmediatamente agarró los menúes en castellano. Sin problema con el wi-fi, carga un poco lento la conexión con los satélites gps con vista al cielo; una vez los conecta, funciona bajo el techo del vehículo. Existe mucho software gratis disponible (Ebuddy, Google Maps, Garmin, YouTube, etc). Falta configurar la conexión wap con un equipo similar de una amiga para que funcione este servicio. Cuando lo haga, actualizaré el comentario para relatar el éxito o fracaso de esta conexión.
i want to give this phone 5 star, but i just can't. i've had this for about 6 months on metro detroit at&t; 3g network. it's got a lot of cool features that i use a lot: GPS and Wi-Fi. Which is great for searching the net on the go and knowing where you're at. I like having the MicroSD slot. Features I haven't used as much lately were the music player and internet radio. It's compact, does what I need it to do, convenient, and on and on... but there are some flaws I've come across unfortunately:- music player is choppy when playing an hour long dj mix. the song plays fine on the computer, mp3 cd, ipod, but not this phone. i downloaded a different music player, so we'll see if that works- internet radio seems to just shut off the phone. i haven't used this in a while, so maybe updates to the program have fixed itSignal Strength Problems- this phone drops 3G calls constantly. i've tried other phones on the 3G network in my house, near my house, and in the general metro detroit area without any problems.- i sent this phone in for warranty because the vibrate mechanism stopped working and the reception problems were getting bad. I got the phone back in like 4 days which was awesome, but second call i made, dropped call. All while showing FULL 3G signal strength. I did some research online and seems like a lot of people are having 3G signal problems with this model phone. I think it's because of the metal frame and the compact size.  This is a hassle because if I want a garaunteed non-dropped call, i need to change it to GSM only. and to use internet , i need to change it to 3G, then go back and change it to GSM.OverallIt's unfortunate that some $50 phones have better reception than this, but I still like this phone a lot. It has a lot of great features, sleek design, lots of potential, and a great company backing it. I would buy another Nokia, but I don't know about this model.  I hope other people that buy this have better call connections than i do!
Comparing the price, E71 is very good. Even the symbian OS make some trouble with me. Actually I thought WM OS is better for those people always us PC and WINDOWS OS.
Just got this phone for use on AT&T.;Pros:- Multi-tasking operating system. You can have many applications open and switchbetween them, don't have to close them. I don't think the iPhone can do that.that a reeeaaaly cool feature. very efficient to switch between programs.- slim design. it fits nicely into your palm. comfortable to use.- screen is crisp.- charges up very quickly, within an 1-2 hours- nokia browser is pretty good- built-in speaker is pretty good- keyboard is solid.Cons:- screen is a bit small.- nokia maps is a cool feature, but top and bottom line in the application takes valuable screen  space away. that is, full screen mode is missing.- the driving/walking GPS capability is neat, but Nokia charges a steep $15 per month to use it.  that's a rip-off.- FM radio almost useless, no reception indoors. The head phones in the box  are useless, the cables are too long and tangle all the time.- no car charger in the box- keys cannot be programmed to launch applications. That's what I liked about my treo.- USB connector plastic flap on the left is a bit too loose, comes off too easily- alarm clock/timer function is missing. Should be standard on such a phone. My ancient T616 from  Sony Ericsson had such a function built in.Overall can recommend it..
its features are great and you wouldn't dare to compare it to blackberry, except for the speakerphone feature.
I JUST SWITCHED FROM ATT TILT.THIS PHONE IS A REAL FINDING.USUALLY DURING MY FIRST MONTH OF USAGE I FIND CONS IN EVERY PHONE.for the first time I DIDNT FIND ANY.WELL OF COURSE I WOULD NT MIND TO HAVE AN XM RADIO ON IT,AND 10MP CAMERA,AND GOLDEN PLATE ))),BUT HEY,THIS PHONE IS WHAT I NEED.WITH A HEAVY USE OF 3G AND APPLICATION IT LASTS 24 HOURS,COMPARING WITH 4-6 HRS ATT TILT.CALL QUALITY IS GREAT.GPS WITH GOOGLE MAPS IS WORKING PERFECT WHEN I NEED TO FIND A STORE,IT FINDS SATELLITES PRETTY FAST.FRING IS WORKING PERFECT ND THE SOUND IS ACTUALLY IN THE SPEAKERPHONE,NOT THROUGH THE LOUDERSPEAKER.GREAT PHONE,GREAT PRICE!!!
Bought this for my dad and he's very happy with it.Surprised to see how different it is compared to my N82.Nothing left to be said that hasn't been said by everyone else.
This is the best cell phone to date will do what you need it to do you will love it
The phone is difficult to operate and the customer support is the worst I have ever found.  The phone manual leaves a lot to be desired.
Pros:I am getting compliments on the phone looks from the iPhone owners.Too many to list here... Pls read reviews of othersCons:Some 3-rd party applications make phone unstable - random phone resets. Doesn't pay my bills...Update 6-3-09:Ok, I updated the firmware on this phone and it is very stable now. Didn't have any phone resets since the update for about 4 weeks. I also didn't install fring - maybe it was the culprit for instability as well.I also easily configured my work MS Outlook e-mail/calendar/contacts. Syncing up with it is a breeze and it is push client, but you need to know if your mail servers/IT department supports it.Another application that I use often is Sports Tracker - not only I use it when running, but also on the recreational trips. It provides stats on your driving, like speed/altitude/time/distance.Browser is pretty good. I use it on T-Mobile and it is satisfactory with EDGE connection.Signed up with OVI and backed up my contacts/calendar there as well.Anyway it seems like it takes a while to learn all of the features/capabilities of this device...
I bought this but didn't find it to be as good as it's hyped up to be:Things I don't like- not intuitive to use - eg. sometimes clearing a password field is impossible need to reload webpage- hard to make it go over wi fi for some functions ( I don't have a data plan yet, I wanted to see how much use I can get off wifi )- non standard headphone jack- non standard usb- no usb charging- special software needed to sync ( should use standard windows api )- camera sub parIdeally, it should redirect all network traffic to wifi if you're connected ... but it doesn't seem to do this. I'm still a newb with this phone maybe there's a way to do it ... but I've not figured out it yet.Also, the GPS is not connected yet - I think I need to contact the service provider regarding this (At&T;) as I moved my SIM from my old junkie phone over to this one ... I was hoping GPS would talk to the satellite directly and not go through the service provider.IM seems hard to setup. I cannot just click yahoo and login ... it needs a server addreess or something. Why can't they make it easy and let you choose standard IM providers?
I just bought one of these phones. I'm a computer professional, writing software and running big and small software projects since 1965. My point in saying that is not to try to impress you, but rather to point out that I'm not a novice when it comes to technology like this.The hardware's nice. Build quality appears to be excellent and it just feels like a quality product. Symbian has a reputation for being confusing, but there's some method to the madness (I'm referring here to the user-interface) and it's supposedly well-engineered under the covers. But some of the choices in the apps aren't good. For example, to try to make the setup of email accounts easy, it knows about the popular providers, like gmail. gmail lets you talk either pop3 or imap4 with a separate email client and, in fact, provides some different options for each (with pop3, you can enable it on the gmail site so that your client sees only mail arriving after the time you enabled it; imap4 has no such option). The email client on the E71 decides for you that you are going to use imap4; there's no way to change it, at least that I could find. Consult the documentation? You've got to be kidding. It reads like it was written for 5-year-olds by 5-year-olds. This is a complex device, providing a lot of features, and the documentation is so dumbed down, perhaps to avoid scaring non-computer-types, as to be near useless, in my opinion.One of the features of this phone is the GPS receiver. To be useful, GPS receivers need map data, yes? If you install a brand new MicroSDHC card in this phone and then attempt to download map data with the Nokia Map Loader on your PC, it will sitthere in a loop saying "Waiting for device". It turns out that you need to first attempt to download map data via the phone, to initialize the directory structures on the memory card which, for some unfathomable reason, the Map Loader doesn't do. Did I learn this from the documentation? Not a chance. I found this out by googling and got the info from discussion groups populated by similarly frustrated Nokia owners and one or two who stumbled across solutions. Having dealt with that problem, I begin downloading map data for the US. After successfully downloading the data (about an hour on a broadband connection; it's a little over 1 Gb), the Map Loader begins loading it into the memory card in the phone (there's a little progress bar). After making a tiny bit of progress, I get "Unexpected error. Sorry for the inconvenience". Gee, that was informative. Does it preserve the temporary file on your computer after this error and use it on a repeat attempt? Not a chance. So, another hour downloading. And the "unexpected error" happens again. So, I google again, and surprise, surprise, there are a whole bunch of frustrated folks out there who have seen the same thing. Well, one of these good folks devised a workaround, which I've yet to try.Maps are just one aspect of this phone, but I'm afraid that it's symptomatic of the general level of software quality supplied with this device. If RIM put out stuff like this, we'd never have heard of Blackberries.Unless you are willing to put up with some pain (think Windows 3.1/MSDOS), I'd pass on this phone, or any other Nokia phone with the same software suite.[March 13 update]Well, it's been two days of struggle and I still don't have the US maps loaded into this thing. If you try to download the maps during the day, you are wasting your time. The download will invariably hang. Downloading is only possible late at night and first thing in the morning. I'm guessing that there's a bug in their protocol (I'm assuming they are using something of their own, because ftp works reliably), as well as a bandwidth issue with their website. As for the "Unexpected error", I'm still getting them, despite having disconnected all other USB devices from my PC (USB is a bit of a crock and I have seen situations where USB devices interfere with each other, but not with properly written drivers, such as for the iPod, a Palm, HP scanners, etc.). I'm in the process of trying a different PC and if that fails, I will switch to talking to the phone with Bluetooth rather than a USB cable. If that fails, I'm going to send this thing back to Amazon. Again, if you are not very computer-savvy *and* a masochist, skip any Nokia product with this software suite.[December 25 update]Well, I've lived with this phone for almost a year now and have to admit that my first take on it was wrong. It seems like I ran across everything that is wrong with this device and its supporting PC software right from the outset and I retract none of that. But, after using it for some time, I have changed my rating to 5 stars, because, on balance, there is so much more right than wrong with this phone. First of all, as a phone, it's superb -- sound quality is excellent and I have far fewer dropped calls than with my previous Motorola phone (I've read, though have no direct experience, that the iPhone is great until you try to use it as a phone). The PDA applications and synchronization are good enough that I've been able to retire my Palm. The much-maligned camera is fine for what I'd expect from a cell-phone camera. It's not a Hasselblad, for goodness sake! The music player works well, the GPS is a welcome feature (once you get the Nokia maps loaded) and Google Maps works very well. The ability to have multiple applications running simultaneously is very, very useful (I understand the iPhone doesn't support this). Email and web-browser are fine. Battery life is excellent. It's true that the UI isn't as sexy as an iPhone or the other touchscreen phones. But this thing just does *everything* you could possibly want from a phone, does it in a small, well-made package, and its UNLOCKED. I use it with an ATT pay-as-you-go account, because I actually do very little actual phoning and this is far more economical for me than paying a flat rate every month for minutes I'm not going to use. This alone eliminated the iPhone from my consideration when I bought the E71.In summary, this is not a perfect device, and some of its imperfections are glaring, but its assets greatly outweigh its liabilities. Furthermore, the perfect device doesn't exist, so if you are looking for a remarkably capable smart-phone with this physical configuration, I can heartily recommend the E71.
the phone looks cool.  the key pad is too small and don't know how to dial english character.  my ringtones play at the music player.  i can't delete nokia ringtones.  it is locked. i like windows mobile better.  wrong choice to buy nokia product.
Es el mejor equipo que hasta el momento he tenido, siempre he confiado en Nokia porque sus telefonos son muy buenos, en este caso en particular el modelo E71 ha sido el mejor.  Tiene todas las caracteristicas que uno puede desear en un telefono celular.
I have bought for a friend of mine, i was so impressed with the phone. This a great phone.I'm a blackberry customer, but was very impressed with this phone

I have both the blackberry bold and e71. I will compare the major advantages of both:e71:- the battery life is double- doesn't have push email but downloaded program "seven" which works- keyboard easier to type on- seems less complicated- thin and lightblackberry bold:- push email is bestI just bought an unlocked second e71 rather than another bold.  The e75 isn't out yet but the form factor looks interesting.
This is the best lookiing PDA cell in the market, infact i will rate it higher than blackberry storm on appearance. The body is sleek and beautiful. The qwerty keybord is handy and the internet browser is great and you will get used to it in no time.But my cell phone froze a couple of times when i tried to access the GPS, and I had to restart the cell to get it back to life.
Fantastic phone that gives you plenty of options as a smartphone but remains slim and sleek.
I used the E71 exclusively for the last 6 months. I would consider myself a advanced user who bought the phone for its extensive set of features.What I was looking for when I bought the device:* An actual keyboard* Comparatively small form factor* 3G* GPS* Contacts & Calender sync features* SIP integration (VoIP)Pros:* Build quality of the handset is quite nice. The phone survived 6 months in my pocket without any protection.* The keyboard works despite its small size really wellSoftware cons:The main reason why I rated the phone 2 stars is because of its extremely bad software. Unfortunately Nokia never developed the software beyond prototype status. The entire user interface is absolutely inconsistent, buggy and not mature.* Even if you just run native Nokia apps you will be surprised how many different ways to access the phone book, enter text or access other phone functionality Nokia came up with. The way the menus are organized seem to be completely random for first time Nokia users. All in all it takes forever to get used to this unintuitive interface.* The native email client is a laugh at best. How can a business phone be limited to 2 email accounts? I had to buy a 30USD 3rd party app to be able to run an email setup with the feature set I would have expected from the native client on a pro phone.* I got about 300+ contacts in my address book. Opening the contact list takes about 3s. If someone calls me from my contacts it takes 2-3s before I see the name instead of the number.* I use the Nokia push mail service to receive email from one specific account almost instantly. To not miss an important mail I have a long ringtone assigned to incoming mails. You would think that the ringtone stops after the first button on the phone is pressed. Not so with the E71. It keeps happily ringing till the ringtone is fully played.* The SIP implementation is useless because once the phone looses the connection to the server it never restores it again. To restore the connection you have to restart the phone. * Every time I want to access 3G with a 3rd party app the phone asks me if it should allow the app to access the internet and in the next step which connection to use. There should be a integrated rule system regulating 3G access and a possibility to set a default connection.* There is no way to disable auto capitalization.Hardware cons:* With frequent 3G usage the battery doesn't even last a day. I had to extend the period between mail retrieval and syncs to be able to go trough a day without charging.* Quality of the camera is quite badSummary:All in all I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. If money is no concern and you look for a shiny handset to make calls and send a text once in a while the E71 is the way to go. Otherwise stay away from it.
I know it is a silly idea but I want to use a cell phone to talk to people.  I have speakers for music and GPS and cameras I just want to hear people and have them hear me.  What a concept.  Tried a pile of blue tooth set and nothing but complaints.  Must charge etc.  I have plenty of wonderful wired headsets with boom mikes.  That is what people who talk on phones use who want people to hear them. Plug standard three conductor 2.5 MM plug into headset and I can hear peachy keen but it uses mike on the phone not the boom mike.  Try adaptors galore.  None work.  Stumble over two accessories on Nokia Europe  WH-200 and HDB-5.  Both over the ear with boom mike. I make the usual useless call to Nokia. "sorry sir that is not available to you."  Apparently Americans just listen to music and play games on their phones.  Oh I tried a 3.5mm adapter on the E62 to a 2.5 mm headset and it did not work either.  I tried a Sony with their proprietary plug and it kept losing contact.  I tried a Motorola with the mini-usb and the phone answers by default when the plug is in and cannot be charged while on the phone. On to the Blackberry...next.....
This is one of the best cell phones on market these days..I used to use a blackberry bold and this E71 is much better and is even much less expensive..this is a great phone that I recommend to everybody thinking of renewing their phone.
From a hardware perspective, this phone is very well made.  It looks nice, is very solid, and call quality is better than any other phone I've used.  Unfortunately, the operating system is awful.  Every task with this phone (adding a Bluetooth device, storing email on the media card, adding music, etc.) begins with a trip to the owners manual and ends in frustration.  I have had this phone for 6 months and will be trading it for a blackberry.
Este "unlocked cell phone" es muy vistoso y de gran diseño exterior. Los iconos de funciones son pobres. En este aspecto los iconos de los cell phones de Sony son mucho mejores. Otro detalle que no se considerò fue que, al menos para mì, debo tener la hora permanentemente en vista, asì estè escuchando mùsica o viendo mis contactos. Creo que me acostumbrè a esto por mi anterior Sony Ericcson. Sobre el WiFi, muy bueno, buen alcance, buena velocidad de descarga y fàcil manejo a pesar del teclado.El teclado no presenta problemas por el tamaño de las teclas, la càmara es òptima con luz natural. No la recomiendo con flash. El video es aceptable, igualmente con luz. En lìneas generales estoy satisfecho, porque tengo todo en el cell y asisto a reuniones con èl y ya no llevo la laptop, dado que maneja PDF y el Office, asì como el mail corporativo y los web (yahoo, gmail, hotmail, etc.).
It's too complicated and when I tried to connect it with my hotmail address I realized that it's impossible with hotmail for some reason. Even if you connect it with gmail or yahoo, you need to log in to see new messages..
Nokia E71 Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS, Wi-Fi, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Gray)EXCELLENT CELPHONE
hi, i really like this product, but in my country is very expensive.i would like to know if i get this here in amazon.com is going to work in Colombia, South America?Thank you!
The resolution is not good enough. web surfing is slowing and hard to close the windows.
Works as well as any other 3G phone, but the buttons can pop off easily, and you cannot get replacement buttons.  Nokia's service folks will only replace the whole keypad, for which you have to send in your phone and do without.  I was waffling between the E71 and another one with no buttons, and am now kicking myself for getting this phone.  I should have thought of the issues that would come of having a keypad, but I had to learn this the hard way.
I just got this last night and was really excited at first from reading all the great reviews from others. However, I realized that it's not as what's hyped up to be.  The memory didn't come with the phone so I had to go out and buy one separately last night and then the map features doesn't even load but prompts many questions over and over again then it crashes.  Furthermore, I had to open the battery case then disconnect in order for the phone to work again!  The GPS doesn't work either since I have the old AT&T; service and I don't have the data plan.  I thought the GPS was a feature like you get from buying GPS separately in which it doesn't require internet service but satellite only. The short-cut email feature doesn't work either! I tried many ways to get it right but it keeps prompting me with same messages over and over again. So I had to log on to the web site feature then log into Yahoo then get my email that way, so what's the short-cut feature for if it doesn't work? Also, I had a difficult time to find where to delete the email account once you created one??!!  The number buttons are really small so when you just want to dial a number you really have to look for the right button to push.  All other features and icons are really small as well and too many to really understand which one is which.  I guess I'm used to having iPhone's bigger icons and user friendliness and now this Nokia is a big disappointment.  I wouldn't be complaining too much if this E71 hadn't been over $300 dollars. If it were only around $200 then I would give it an average rating instead of only one star. For $300 you can do much better. In fact, iPhone is only couple hundred more and worth it. I just didn't like the battery life on iPhone so I gave this E71 a try.  Before I close, I should mention that the camera/flash seems to work fine and the battery life on E71 seems to be awesome and long lasting once you fully charge it.  I may just get the cheaper version of the Nokia since I can't use email, map and GPS features from this phone.  So beware of these complaints before you order this phone for $300.Edit:Someone responded to my review by saying that since I didn't have a data plan I couldn't download maps and emails.  That's true but I was logged on with Wi-Fi and it still didn't work, whereas with iPhone I didn't have any of those issues.
The Nokia E71 bills itself as a 'messaging device', but is it really?  No.The ActiveSync that comes out of the box only syncs one email folder.  Want all of them?  That'll be $50 and plus some 3rd party software.Want to sync with your Yahoo! or GMail account?  Out of the box, this phone doesn't do that either.  It will pull via Pop, but IMAP is only semi-supported and headers are allowed.Nokia is now offering a new service called 'Nokia Messaging' that syncs with multiple email addresses (not Exchange).  But even that is in an open-ended trial and the site says that Nokia will eventually charge for the service.  Shouldn't this service be included in a phone that costs 2x's an iPhone?Want to read Office docs?  Well if it's 2003 or below, you are in luck! The E71 does that.  Office 2007?  That'll be $50 for an upgrade, please.I give the product 2 stars because it does do some things well.  The Nokia browser is decent, and with the addition of Opera mobile (which makes up for the weaknesses of Nokia's browser), it does the web well.The phone really shines on making phone calls and sending text messages.  Just type the person's name and then push the green button to call or select text message from the slide-out menu and start texting.The OS is ugly (the contact screen and the individual calendar entries are just atrocious - sub-old-Blackberry ugly), but fairly stable and very responsive.Overall, if need an ActiveSync phone with a longer battery life and can live without great email (yes, that is an oxymoron, I know), and you have extra cash to purchase the necessary software, then the Nokia E71 is your phone.But overall, I am very disappointed in the OS, the lack of real email support that US customers have comes to expect, and the expense of all the extra software you need to buy on top of an already very expensive phone.  If I could return it I would.  The Nokia E71 is just not ready for the North American market.
Nokia E71 Unlocked Cell Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS - U.S. Version with Warranty (Gray) I was looking for an unlocked GSM phone when I travel abroad. There are numerous products that serve this need. I bought the E71 because it promised additional features, particularly WiFi and GPS. Indeed, the promise of a GPS was my prime reason to jump into this price level rather than settle for a standard GSM phone; unfortunately, it is completely useless.Pros: The GSM worked well in several countries; however, it is difficult to find providers who support prepaid GSM with Internet connection (In the UK, O2 turned out, through a recent visit, to be an excellent provider of both).The WiFi works well so you can get your email and access web services, even if the screen and keyboard provide for a poorly designed user interface (e.g., as compared with iPhone and the likes). The camera works, but is of little value for me.Cons:1. Even as a mere phone the E71 is a trouble. You cannot dial without looking at the keyboard; and it takes some practice to hit the right keys. But the advanced features are a practical disaster.2. The GPS software simply does not work. It refuses to provide voice instructions or visual instructions, like any standard GPS. After many hours of struggling with the cryptic and useless manual and with Nokia's web site, I gave up. [Among other I followed up the instructions given to other E71 users for activating voice; I downloaded the "map loader" software into my Mac, then the "multimedia transfer" and tried to use these to get maps into the E71; but all I got is complaints from the map-loader that the phone has no memory card -- even when it has 8GB of free memory]. I managed to preload a map of London before a recent travel. But, when I reached London it turned out that the map covered a tiny section of the city and did not include such central areas as Kensington where we were staying. One bright spot is that Google Maps works on the E71. However, in the absence of voice, it is useless for navigation. Nokia should best discard its GPS software and make Google maps work on the E71; it will save itself money and save users the frustrations.3. The "free" radio application, likewise, refuses to play radio through the WiFi access point and requires the use of a cellular network, where you would pay for the "free" radio more than you would  pay for a satellite radio service.4. I would grade the user interface around 4 on a scale of 0-10 (I am a software professional). Nokia should perhaps buy iPhones for its product managers so they can learn how to get it right.5. The manual and web support are useless in resolving problems.All in all, you get a GSM camera phone and internet access -- if you can find respective prepaid providers-- with a poorly designed software and user interfaces. But then, why waste hundreds of dollars when you can get a vanilla unlocked GSM phone that will do the job. Better still, wait for the iPhone to become unlocked, or for unlocked versions of Google's Android.
I ordered this product based on the qualities advertised by Amazon.com. I was very highly disappointed by its performance. This may be due to the fact that I have previously used two very good products: Treo and Nokia 93i. My search was for a phone with 3G.Providers in Nigeria have not been able to see this feature in E 71, despite use of 3G sim cards. Internet connection is slow, compared to even Nokia 93i.I have gone back to my Nokia 93i, looking for takers for E71.
The worst Phone ever i bought 5 of them and all Freeze what a Great way to spend money, no wonder in some places it costs around $200 original.
If you're used to Palm or Blackberry business devices, you will likely not enjoy this phone.  It certainly looks the part - its hardware and aesthetics are very pleasing; it's slim and compact; the QWERTY keyboard feels good and works with even the chunkiest of fingers, my sausages not withstanding.  The battery life is also very good.Unfortunately the good news ends there.  The software is dreadful.  Firstly you can't load your contacts from other systems because the PC software provided has no import capabilities at all - except you can import `Thumbnails'.  Way too many menu navigations are required to do the common tasks such as looking up a number and dialing it.  Depending on where you start from, it can take six menu choices to get the phone dialing, the last one being an annoying extra option to make a voice or video call.  Setup items are difficult to find.  You can't easily switch to Vibrate for example; you have to go through a pile of menus to find the setting.  I'm in and out of meetings all day; I need a button on the phone to allow me to turn to vibrate on the fly.  Messaging does not thread - so every message is treated as a separate event, therefore you can't see the response from the other person when composing your answers.  Some of the shortcut menu choices on the screen are the same as the buttons - rather a wasted opportunity to bring other common features into easy play.  The rest are wasted on one time deals that should be buried in a menu somewhere; for example, Setup Email, Setup Internet Tel. Calendar Entries (Calendar Entries from where exactly - not outlook - you can't sync).  I've had this phone less than two weeks and am already looking for something to replace it.  I will likely go back to Palm.  Sorry Nokia, but whoever designed this software doesn't understand the needs of the business smart phone user.
I bought this phone because "is a nokia, is a good Cellphone" when I received this phone, on the top of the front mask have a little open. then I insert a micro SD and the phone no work properly, when I press on the top of front mask phone display "REMOVE MEMORY CARD AND PRESS OK"I lost maybe ten o more pictures take with the camera, the phone erase it.I NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.
I was looking for a good cell phone for my son just to take to his friend's house so he can call me when he wants to move on to another house and I can keep track of him.OUT OF THE BOXIt was very easy to set up with the quick start guide.  The battery was already charged, so I did not have to wait to set things up.  The website was easy to access and log in.  I got the phone number and passwords in no time.PHONEThe phone looks like any other phone.  It is lighter weight than my cell phone at 2.7 ounces.  The wallpaper  has the graphics of an old-fashioned video game and plays a little midi tune.  It's cute.The shell is shiny, gets fingerprints all over it.  I would prefer a matte finish, but that's okay.The screen looks much like my cell phone screen and operates much the same way.Sound quality of the phone calls is tinny, not crisp and clear.  I prefer my own phone.  However, it gets the job done, which is basically enabling me to keep in contact with my child.PARENTAL CONTROLSThe site allows me to manage my child's spending account.  I can also restrict his phone calls to time of day or contacts.Kajeet offers so many features which I am happy to disable.  With my permission, my child can use ringtones, wallpaper, games, apps, feeds, Google maps and web surfing.There is a wallet feature so the parent and child can split the costs.  The parent can choose which calls the child must pay for.GPS LOCATORI have set this up but the locator has been unable to locate the phone, which sits in my house.  Kajeet service works here, so it is not a matter of being out of area.  I thought maybe being inside a building was the problem, so I put the phone outside.  Still no go.  This service was free to try, but I will not renew this service.SUMMARYA good phone for the price.  It is especially good if you want control over your child's phone habits or to help them budget.I recommend the monthly plan.  It is advertised as $4.99/month which includes 10 minutes of talk time and 10 cents a minute thereafter; but they have an administrative fee, so it's a few pennies more.  It does not require a subscription.  This phone is much less expensive than other phones with similar parental control features.  I recommend it (unless you need it for GPS locator service).__________________________________UPDATE 6/27/09:After using this for some time, I have run into a few problems, nothing that customer support hasn't been able to rectify, but it did sometimes frustrate me.1) Starting with the GPS locator: I have since learned from Kajeet staff that the reason my GPS locator did not function as advertised is that I tried activating the service too soon after activating my phone.  The site does not tell us we cannot do that and customer service agreed that should be explained more clearly when we are setting up service.2) I had the monthly service set up to automatically renew every month for $4.99 a month.  It included daily service fees and 10 minutes of calls.  All of a sudden, I was getting charged daily service fees and for every single phone call.  I went to my account and sure enough, it was set up for automatic renewal yet did not renew.  One phone call and I was told they had changed their computer system and my account did not transfer over properly.3)  I set my child's account up to send and receive only calls from my husband's phone and my own.  Somehow, he was receiving calls from an unknown number from someone who was obviously dialing the wrong number.  She would leave messages, text him, everything . . . and I was being charged for it all.  Called customer service and it turns out that since I had turned on the option of calls from Mom's number and Dad's number to "always allow" (no time restrictions) the computer took that to mean any number, even though the option for allowing all other numbers was blocked.  That girl just thought I was dumb for not understanding how that could be.  I still don't get it.  All numbers are blocked, except mine and my husband's, but "always allow" calls to and from our number makes calls from all other phones okay.  I told her they need to explain that option more clearly on the website.  She fixed it, but I can hear her rolling her eyes.Basically, just watch the account activity.  Sometimes charges appear there that shouldn't be there, calls occur that shouldn't be allowed.  Not everything is explained clearly on the website.  If they change computer systems and it may affect your account, you may not be notified.We still use the phone.  Like I said, customer service has always been able to fix whatever problems I have.  I feel like I need to be on my toes, but the phone has worked as it should, with the exception of GPS Locator, which I was told I'd get to try again for a month, but I haven't taken them up on it.
Bought this as a stopgap because I lost my regular phone. The monthly $4.99 deal from Kajeet is excellent if you don't use a cell much, though you cannot get the advertised rebate if you sign up for the cheapo plan. Extra minutes are 10 cents, which can add up. Coverage in DC area is OK, but noticably less than my other network. Even if buying for yourself, you have to keep transferring money from "parent" to "kid", which is a a bit annoying but easy to do online. Be sure to give the parent and kid different names even if they are both you because names can't be changed  once set up. There are lots of handy features to control your tyke's talk time, like limiting times of use but permitting calls to certain numbers all the time. The phone itself is nice except that the battery life is awful, it needs recharging after being on for less than a day even if talk time is minimal. Kajeet offers other phones that may be worth the extra bucks.
phone works well - especially with the extra $ that comes with it.  Kajeet offers a good service for kids, where parents get to have a lot of control over the times, and numbers kids can call/receive calls from.
This phone is perfect for my family needs.  My son is 10 and isn't quite ready for a cell phone of his own, but I needed something to keep on hand for certain events where he would be without me.  The best thing about this phone is the online controls.  You can establish which numbers the phone can call and which numbers can call the phone!  And yuo can monitor all phone calls made from the phone online.  I also used the GPS tracking for the first month free and it was fairly accurate.  But it doesn't work if the phone is off or is out of range.  It's a nice little phone perfect for my 10 year old.  I'm glad we bought it.
I just signed on with Kajeet a couple of weeks ago. I have two tween children and I bought the Kajeet plan for them and myself. I am very happy with the plan and even happier to have gotten away from the two-year contract with my previous carrier. I love the phone options and the parental controls! Kajeet is the best for me and my family! Great customer service, too! No complaints so far!
The screen on this phone went blank almost right out of the box. Their online support is ridiculous - they gave me a customer service number and I was on hold for OVER one hour and still no one ever answered (Yes, I called during business hours). Waiting for instructions on how to get a refund of the money we loaded on the account.
Disclosure: I am an HP employee although I have nothing to do with HP Phones or hand-held devices. I bought this phone for my own use. This may have made me more persistent in seeking out things like the latest OS update but I think my review remains fair.I saw some of the same problems as other reviewers but after updating the OS from HP's website I really like this phone. The latest version improves the phone call volume (although I'd prefer it to still go a little louder). I think they also improved battery life although I never really had a problem with that as long as you don't leave things like wifi on all the time.I upgraded to this phone from a T-Mobile Dash and if you know the Dash then this is a vast improvement.It helps if you are more of a techy as you can find all kinds of good apps on the web - the YouTube player works great. If you already know and like Windows Mobile then you will certainly appreciate how well it runs on this device. In my case I am more interested in having a powerful PDA (with things like GPS and WiFi built in) than a whiz-bang phone but I think it does both well. The fact that is is unlocked is also good - I've used it on T-Mobile and AT&T; without any issues.My answer to some of the negative reviews:- Volume: Get the latest update for an improvement, and/or use a wired or bluetooth headset.- Battery: Avoid running wifi and turn off bluetooth if not being used, also put phone into standbay mode (press button on top). I have not had standby mode affect the receipt of calls - it wakes up fine when a call comes in.- Button press delays: I get this only when pressing numbers during a call, e.g. to join a conference bridge line - odd but not a big deal to me- Keypad vs. Stylus: I've not found anything I am forced to use the stylus for - there are keyboard alternatives, the spin wheel etc. but I do bring out the stylus from time to time as I think it is quicker.- Touching face setting off buttons: There are WinMob programs out there that will disable the touchscreen while on a call automatically to prevent accidental option selections when the phone is at your ear. For me I just press the button on the top of the phone after I answer a call - it puts the PDA and screen in standby but the phone keeps operating - if you need to use the touch screen during the call then you press the button again to wake it up - without interrupting the call.
I bought this phone a couple of months ago and I am very unhappy with the overall product attributes. Below is a list of things I detest about the IPAQ 910:1. Speaker, earpeice and ringer volume is poor especially when using in slightly noisy enviroments2. Action buttons do may not work on first press and phone takes too long to process requests3. Some vital functions cannot be accessed by the keypad except by using the stylus4. The notepad and word mobile software files get corrupted easily making file recovery sometimes impossible5. While talking with the phone next to your face, a lot of functions are activated in error6. Device takes too long to wake after the backlight shuts off (slow processor or device programming)7. Camera function is the worst I've ever used. It takes a while for the picture to register after you have pressed the shutter. This creates a difference in the picture you actually wanted and that which the IPAQ 910 captures8. When sending a text message to multiple users, phone does not let you pick all your recepients at once. You will need to keep selecting "add new recipient" every timeThe list goes on and on. I wish I never bought this product. Software is bad and general engineering not very impressive.
This phone is probably the worst phone I've ever seen, and certainly the worst phone I've ever used. It is actually user-hostile. On several occasions I've needed to use it to listen to a long conference call, and after about 15 minutes, te phone gets too hot to hold comfortably against the face. On one occasion after an hour of use, the screen started flashing a message about overheating battery!Battery life is miserable.There is no way to lock the touchscreen so holding it against your face can accidentally activate the soft-buttons, one of which is "disconnect" (Which by the way is inexplicably tiny and directly above the "Hold" button. On the subject of the screen, WHY did they make all the butons so small that it's virtually impossible to press them without the stylus?Battery life is miserablethe speaker is a mystery to me. when using the speakerphone function, the volume is so low as to make it unusable,and ringer volume is a joke. But when listening to music using the media player, it's very loud. WHY?Battery life is miserable.If you activate the security lock on the phone, 50% of the time you can't answer a call. You can try, and the phone thinks it has, but it doesn't actually connect the caller. People calling me have learned to just leave a quick message and wait for a call back.Battery life is miserable.Button responses are delayed so you're never quite sure if you've actually connected or disconnected a call. It can take upwards of a second to register. Maddening.Battery life really sucks.As a PDA, though, it's not bad, other than the miserable battery life. It's just that I thought I was buying a PHONE, not an email machine with a buggy afterthought of a voice device thrown in.
The cell is fine, not what I was specting from the latest mobile from HP. Cons: GPS doesn't works very fine somethimes works sometimes not. The battery drains if u use it with 3G or Wifi, doesn't last long that a half day.
This is the worse phone I have ever used.  Can't get the phone to ring and help desk doesn't help.  Sent it back to HP for repair and was charged $240 and still doesn't work.  Do not buy!
I got this phone for my daughter.  It far exceeded our expectations...  It has so much functionality and features that it is amazing.  Sound quality and photo quality are excellent, etc. I would only suggest getting more memory if you like to store a lot of pictures or music.
I recently bought this because the cost of a long-term cell contract doesn't make sense for our minimal usage.  I know someone well who has used the prepaid AT&T; (former Cingular) GoPhone for five years and has no complaints with service or call quality.The Nokia 2610 handset is simple to use, intuitive, and easy to configure to your liking (I did it all in under an hour.)  The volume is fine.  Though the handset lacks an external volume-control button, you can configure a navigation key to adjust volume easily without looking at the keypad while talking on the phone.  The speakerphone works extremely well; I don't even need a headset or earpiece/mike to talk hands-free with great clarity.  The reception in my area (metro DC) is excellent, even inside the house.  The keypad is well-designed; the menu and navigation keys are easy to use without pressing adjacent keys.  The pad locks automatically after ~ 30 seconds of idleness so you can't accidentally activate features while you're carrying the phone in your pocket.  It unlocks easily with the MENU* combination.Activating the phone via the Web and getting your new phone number is simple, too.  If you have an active AT&T; SIM card you can just insert it in the Nokia phone and use this handset if you want to retire an existing one and wait until your contract expires (though, of course, you wouldn't buy the prepaid minutes via this particular offer.)One note... for this $35 Amazon offer you're paying $25 for the airtime card and $10 for the handset.  The ten extra minutes airtime are free from AT&T; if you buy $25 of mins (using the airtime card you're buying here) within a week of activating the handset.  And that's true no matter where you buy the AT&T; GoPhone, not just on Amazon.  I mention this in case anyone thinks that he's buying $35 of airtime and getting a free handset.  When I was shopping for the handset recently it was $20 at local retailers and AT&T; stores.I really don't have any complaints with the phone so far.  Other users in online reviews complained about the video contrast making the display unreadable in the sun.  This is certainly true in the default setting.  However, I set the contrast to max and can read it in bright sun by tilting it a bit.  It's not a  big deal to me.  In fact, all of the user complaints I read about in various reviews could have been avoided if the user simply took the time to run through the menus and configure the phone according to taste.This phone is very good value, in my opinion, if you just want a simple phone for making calls and if call quality is more important than phone features such as a big screen for Web browsing or anticipatory recognition when typing text messages (I don't text at all.)  The option value of being able to terminate the service at any time with no penalty (and almost nothing invested in the handset) is a great benefit.I did a lot of research before choosing this handset and plan, looking at prepaid handsets and premium handsets tied to 2-yr contracts.  The Nokia 2610 has been around for more than two years and gets good marks from many users as a durable, simple phone with high call quality.  I've used it a great deal since I bought it.  It's very easy to configure and a pleasure to use.  I prefer it to nearly all the slide and flip phones I tested.Four final warnings...First, don't confuse this handset with the newer Nokia 2600.  That one gets far poorer reviews than the older 2610.  Reviews noted that the 2600 has a very slow menu interface, feels cheap and has a poor speakerphone.  I tested a 2600 set at an AT&T; store and agree with that assessment.  The 2610 is a far better phone.Second, once you set up your new AT&T; prepaid GoPhone choose your rate plan carefully (two are available: either a flat $0.25/min OR $1.00 per day used + $0.10/min.)  Once you activate the phone the fine print on the Web site under your user account info tells you that you may change from one plan to the other at any time.  The first change is free; thereafter it may (which I assume means WILL) cost you at least $10 (if not more) to change again.Third, note that the prepaid phones (whether on AT&T;, Verizon or T-Mobile) have far spottier signal coverage than contract phones do.  (This is yet another way they discourage users from buying prepaid service and try to lock us into long-term contracts.)  Check the applicable coverage map that the provider offers, especially if you live in the middle sections of the U.S. where providers have huge coverage gaps in certain regions, to ensure you'll get an adequate signal for prepaid service where you'll use the phone.Finally, the AT&T; cellular business has a rather unfavorable customer service reputation according to recent reviews, such as the one in Consumer Reports last January.  The convenient thing about the prepaid phones is that you can manage the account entirely online or automatically over the phone, recharging the account with money via credit card whenever you like.  You never have to deal with a customer service rep.  I haven't factored customer service into my review because I don't anticipate having to use it much.  If it's really awful then I have little invested in the phone account and I can terminate my service easily.  If, however, you require regular service attention you may want to consider the value of smooth interactions and look elsewhere.
This phone is a very cheap phone. I kept getting error messages when I tried to use the messengers. Very small memory... It also doesn't hold up when getting run over, lol, that doesn't hurt the rating though. This phone might be okay for a 3 year old.
I really enjoyed this phone's sharp appearance and simple to use features.  No frills, no extra features that you won't use.  Just the right stuff for the person who wants a phone to make calls and store all their contact information without the hassles and fees from having a contract.  Furthermore, this can be a great phone for emergency use or as a backup!  I've enjoyed using this phone and highly recommend purchasing it.
I never had any problems with this phone. It works great. Very nice flip phone from Samsung so I bought another version of it!
I used an N95 previously and having lost it, I bought the E66 as its replacement.  I find the E66 easier to use. The uni-directional slide I found more convenient than the N95's bi-directional arrangement. It feels like a serious device and not a toy as the N95 feels. I wished the E66 had a 5.2 megapixel camera.
I've used this phone for  a few months now and because it is so expensive, I have not changed it.  If it was a cheaper phone, I would have changed it a long time ago.  Symbian does not hold a candle to Windows Mobile (which was the OS in my previous phone).  Strengths are good signal strength and many features which one has to figure out and use.  I have been unable to figure how to set up the email and VOIP calling.  I don't think it works on this phone.  I set up email on my Itouch much more easily.  Weakness is the speed of the processor.  It takes a while for any of the apps to load, including the contacts list.  If I need to find a phone number, it is soo,soo slow.  Battery life is terrible.  Videos are jerky and everything is just slow.  I don't use the phone much (less than five minutes of calling per day) and yet I have to charge the phone every other day.  If I knew all this, I would never have bough this phone.
This phone behaves as though it is "refurbished" rather than "new." It does not hold the Bluetooth signal appropriately (not the Bluetooth--it was fine on my old phone), and the battery acts as though it is worn, as it doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long (I have to charge it every other day, and I turn my phone off at night). In addition, a part has fallen off of the hinge area, so it opens crookedly. Their shipping was quick, but the quality of the product leaves much to be desired. I would not order from this company again.
I got this phone for my husband a year ago and it has worked great. It takes great pics and has never had a problem with the battery. We were paying for the unlimited internet and never got it to work. Took my sons birthday and first day of kindergarten pics on it when our camera died and they came out great.And that is the problem with this phone. The only way to get pics off the phone is to send a picture message that costs you.We have tried to contact them about a usb cable and get told that there isn't one.We also checked on this site and at best buy and other places for one. If that is true then why is there a port on the bottom of the phone for a cable. We have since switched cell providers and now can't get the pics off at all. So if you are just getting this one for the phone then it is a great choice. If you want to take pics with it be ready to spend fifty cents a photo to get them off the phone.
I use the Arc prepaid cell phone as part of Virgin Mobile's pay as you go program. It is a flip phone and offers up to 3.5 hours of talk time before the battery needs to be charged. Besides the standard features on a cell phone it also offers things like: speaker phone; an option to send email messages and instant messages; caller ID; call waiting; speed dialing; voice mail; voice command; the ability to send audio messages; a camera; internet access; Bluetooth Capability; a calendar; alarm clock; calculator; tip calculator; stop watch; and world clock; among others.What I like about the Arc prepaid cell phone:The first thing I like is the whole concept of the pay as you go program. I like having a cell phone in case of an emergency, but I rarely use it and you can't beat having to pay as little as $20.00 every three months. Also the phone is very easy to set up and if you want to upgrade, you can transfer your phone number and balance to the new phone as long as it is a Virgin Mobile phone. You do have to reload your contact information and other features such as ring tones. When it is time to top off it is very easy to do so and you have several options: do it directly from the phone itself; do it over the Internet; buy a top up card. It is very easy to make and receive phone calls and with the key press feature you can answer the phone with any key except "End", "Back" and "Ignore". The sound is very clear and I've had no dropped calls. Although you can't shoot video with the camera, you can take pictures and there are several photo options: self-portrait; self timer; fun frames; image control and white balance; contrast; color effect. You can send text messages and if you often use the same words or phrases in your text messages you can save them as a template. The tip calculator is one of my favorite features - it is very easy to use. Finally, you have two choices in what language you want to use: English or Spanish.What I don't like about the Arc prepaid cell phone:Maybe it's just my phone or the battery in my phone, but the bar indicating when the battery needs to be charged doesn't work properly so I never know when it is time for me to charge it (to be safe I charge it once a week). Also, the protective cover for the battery charger is hard to close. There are keys on the sides of the phone to activate the camera and volume control and I am always hitting those accidentally, especially the volume buttons. The Vibrate Mode key on the key pad is hard to press. I found it hard to send text messages, especially since there is no space bar option. No matter how many times I tried to access the email option I got the message "Network Gremlins" and couldn't go any further. Finally, while there are several nice options like games, surfing the web, and the email function, none of these are included in the plan I use - all cost extra money.While there are a few things I don't like about the Arc prepaid cell phone, in the end there are more things I like than I don't like and I'd recommend it for people who want an inexpensive yet reliable cell phone.
I don't use the cell as much as most people so I got a prepaid phone instead. I used to have a Blackberry Pearl, and I think this phone has better talk quality then the Pearl. Also, the voice dialing works great on this phone, on my blackberry pearl it was so bad it wasn't usable. I have only one complaint is that I wish the Speaker and non speaker volume was a little louder without distortion. But, with all the good qualities of this phone I have no regrets. This phone has a ton of features with excellent talk quality(better than my Blackberry) and for $[...]bucks it's a steal.
This has been the best VM phone I have purchased. It has a decent camera and email abilites along with other features that you usually dont get with these cheaper phones. It allows you to tap into IM and send and receive email through various accounts. I dont surf the web on it but it does allow you to do so. The plans that are available through VM are very affordable. Overall the phone packs alot of bang for the buck!
I've only had it a week but so far am very pleased and wasn't sure I would be.The Pros: cost, hardware quality, ease of use, Virgin's payment plan and ability to port your existing cell number (can't do that with many pre-paid services.)Cons: lousy camera, SAR rating higher than I would like, but I don't use it much.  The low down on the phone - I haven't had to look at the manual yet. It's a simple phone, but it's user interface is simple to figure out as well. It feels sturdy in my hand, with a good hinge that is covered in black plastic, no metal hinges showing. The outer and inner LCDs are small, but visually crystal clear. The casing is somewhere between a soft touch and a hard metal, and it's deep red color with black front is cool to look at. The speaker is on the front which I like, though it soudns a little 'tinny'. The one option that stinks is the camera - don't buy it for the camera. I had a Samsung for exactly one day before I returned it, I don't care for Samsung's operating system. The OS on the ARC is much easier to use.On price, I did not get it on Amazon. I shopped around, including Virgin's website. But found it at Radio Shack for a startling $9. Yes, $9. So my advice is shop around. I also like Virgin's payment plan options for both voice and text, etc.I downgraded from a smart phone on Verizon, so this was a big switch for me. Because my monthly usage was so low it only made sense to go to a pay as you go plan. Years ago I had Tracfone and they were fine, but the reviews now on Tracfone's customer service are horrid. Also, Tracfone has splintered off into two additional brands - Net 10 and StraightTalk - as if they are trying to distance themselves from the Tracfone name. I tested Virgin's customer service before I signed up by calling them at the number listed on their website and asking them a few questions. I was greeted promplty by English speaking representatives and though transferred to two other departments, each rep was courteous and knowledgeable in a answering my questions.Virgin does not have as good a coverage footprint as others - just look at a coverage map - but for now it will fit my needs. It was explained to me that Virgin leases the towers from Sprint, but not every tower, so in some parts of my town I have better coverage than other parts. But I'm not in a major city. If you are on the East Coast ina major area your coverage may fare better. Test it out, you can always return the phone.If my opinion changes with time I will update my review.
I was looking for a cheap phone plan for my mother-in-law and an emergency back-up for my wife.  The Amazon information was informative and accurate.  The ordering process was easy.  Opening the new accounts was painless and the discounts were applied as advertised.  The phone soon arrived and I set it up.  My wife had done quite a bit of shopping and I found the best deal on Amazon.Com.To date, I am completely satisfyed with the transaction.David Wilson
but the phone really sucks. I bought this ARC phone almost a year ago, thinking that I was getting a great deal. Pretty prepaid no-contract phone that was fashionable, had a bluetooth adapter and a camera phone. Can't go wrong? Right? Wrong.Although it has a BlueTooth Adapter, it's a pain to turn it off, if you want to speak without the device. And, if you want to use a wireless headset instead -- you have to purchase a special STARCOM device. You're out of luck if you want to use a plug-in universal headset devices. Inconvenient to say the least. The speaker quality is also poor (it went bad after a month.) It's frustrating when I have to strain my voice, yelling into the device just so the person on the other line can hear me, or keep the device close to my lips so they can understand me.The ringtones are horrid. It's embarrassing not to find one good one on this phone. They try to crouch them as "hip hop etc; to make them sound "hep." They were so bad, my coworkers said I had the worst sounding ringtones ever. They have the classic "phone" ringtone, but even that is irritating.For "fun," there is a game arcade -- filled with demos. There are no preloaded games with this device. Cheaper phones like Motorolla's RAZR have two full games on hand. Paying the hefty price, you'd think that StarCOM would provide one or two full versions, with an option to purchase others. But, no... you'll have to cough up an additional cost of $5.The camera phone isn't worthy of the name -- the quality of the digital pictures are 640 x 360 -- hardly top quality if you're looking to keep mementos. You can't zoom in to take close up shots, and if you do, it's blurry. It does allow you to take self-photos though. The screen savers are also less to be desired -- boring -- compared to cheaper phones I've owned. Who wants to see different colored pictures of the same saver, or even cheap moving squares. Texting on this phone is an enormous challenge as well.The only reason I gave it two stars is because it looks really pretty in lipstick red and black, matching my Nintendo DS. Other than that it's a disappointment.
My telephone never started working. I spent a lot of time with customer service, re-programming the phone under their guidance, in the two weeks since I bought it. They never figured out what the problem was. And you cannot return it until you go through the entire chain that is planned by their procedures. Finally, they told me that they will send me another phone free of charge. Naturally, I asked to de-activate everything and will try to return it that is going to be a problem because in the two weeks I lost the receipt.
When I signed up for Boost Mobile, the i776 cell phone was the best offered. The phone has a great design. I love the velvety feel and sleek design. The style is small and compact. The buttons on the phone are easy to use.In researching the pay by the month plans currently available, I found Boost Mobile was the best deal. The coverage area is large. The plan I had previously on a two year contract with a major carrier, did not give me any signal inside my apartment. The payment each month with Boost Mobile is the same as what I was paying for a two year contract. I chose the unlimited plan costing $50 a month. This includes unlimited calls and unlimited internet use with my phone.The i776 has great features. The phone has a camera which offers two picture qualities-normal and fine. The size of the picture comes with four settings- wp 128x160, small 128x96, medium 160x120, large 320x240, and x-large 640x480. There is an airport setting as well. If this is activated, the phone will shut off whenever a person enters a place where cell phones are not allowed and turn back on when they leave the area. The phone is Bluetooth enabled and GPS. (RJC)
voice recognition went out after a couple months then I had to use speaker phone all the time.  do not use this because u get choppy service from boost.  It will worth paying the extra 10 or 20 dollars per month for different carriers.  I gurantee.
This phone aims to be an upgrade to the N95 8 GB, but it falls a bit short of that.  The feature set is only very minimally upgraded (mainly, more included memory plus a µSD slot, a pullout kickstand around the camera lens, and a newer software release), and instead, it introduces some new shortcomings.The first thing that struck me was how much of an underperformer this phone really is.  Using the included music player to stream audio to my Pioneer Car Stereo over Bluetooth (A2DP), it would stutter every 11-12 seconds, making for a less-than-stellar playback experience.  I attributed that to its slow processor, though it is possible that a future firmware upgrade would fix this issue.  Either way, i ended up returning it after a few days' use in favor of the slightly newer Nokia N85, which in contrast performs much better and feels snappier overall.  (And by the way, looks much more modern and sexy, thanks in part to its gorgeous AMOLED screen).Secondly, a couple of other shortcomings from the original N95 (interational version, N95-1) are reintroduced in the N96.  Both use a 950mAh battery, compared to 1200mAh in the subsequent N95 models as well as the N85, and coupled with its larger 2.8" LCD screen, it means that it must be charged daily with any extended use.  Also, although it does include 128 MB of RAM (runtime memory), only about 45MB or so are available for applications at startup, so like the N95-1, it is subject to frequent "out of memory" errors if you leave a few applications open.Thirdly, although Nokia have resolved their long-standing WCDMA patent dispute with Qualcomm, this phone still only supports North American UMTS bands (850/1900 MHz), whereas the newer N85 has tri-band UMTS (850/1900/2100 MHz) and so will be able to get 3G speeds worldwide.  (Conversely, the international version of the N96 will not get 3G speeds in North America).  In particular, if you plan to travel to Japan or South Korea, this phone will not work at all, wheras the N85 will.  (All these phones support quad-band GSM though, and will work on 2G speeds everywhere else in the world).The distinctive new feature of the N96 is its support for the DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcast for HandHelds) standard; however this feature is not enabled in the U.S. version, since carriers here have chosen to use MediaFLO instead.  The price, however, remains as high as the international version (actually higher for most, since they would get a carrier subsidy in most countries), so you end up paying a premium for a feature you cannot use.On the positive side, this phone has much better support for different video formats/resolutions than other phones (also N-Series ones); it will pretty much play any movie you throw onto it without the need for transcoding or resizing.Also, it built relatively solid (mine did not have any creaking sounds, wobbly slider, or the like), and if you are concerned about build quality, you should definitely choose this over the N85.  Or, you could choose to wait for the recently-announced N86 8MP (which upgrades the N85 with a 8MP camera, 8MB of built-in memory in addition to a µSD slot, and more attention to build quality).One note worth mentioning about N-Series and other unlocked phones in general is that although you pay a higher price upfront when compared to other smartphones that are subsidized by the carrier (mainly, AT&T;), you end up earning that back over time -- at least if you include a data plan.  The reason is that AT&T; charges higher prices for their "smartphone"/PDA/iPhone etc. plans than for the standard "data unlimited" plans.  For instance, the "data" portion of the iPhone plan is $30/month, wheras "data unlimited" for Symbian S60 phones like the N96/N95/N85 is $10 or $15 per month (depending on whether you also have unlimited messaging).  Over the 2-year contract period for the subsidized phone, that's a $360 or $480 difference - more than enough to offset the initial price difference.  (So basically, compared to the iPhone, you get a lot more capabilities at a lower price).Secondly, "unlocked" means that you are free to insert a SIM card from any GSM carrier in the world, not just those from a given carrier.  If you travel abroad, for instance, you can go into a local store to get a prepaid card with local tariffs, whereas with the iPhone you are forced to pay AT&T;'s international roaming charges ($1 - $3 per minute, depending on country).Finally, regarding carrier compatability: This phone is optimized for use on AT&T;'s network, with support for the 850/1900 MHz 3G bands.  It will also work with T-Mobile USA, albeit at 2G (GSM/EDGE) speeds.  It will NOT work with CDMA carriers such as Verizon, Sprint, Alltel, US Cellular, MetroPCS, and so on.  For those carriers, there is no such thing as an "unlocked" phone.
I started very slowly learning all the features of the Nokia N96. My former phone was fairly basic, and when I first started enjoying the many features of the N96 I became excited about the myriad of new things I could do--once I learned how.At the heart of the large 16 gig internal storage is the Symbian OS. Awesome. What a welcome relief from Windows Mobile. There is an easy transfer of files from an external memory source. It uses a mini SD card.This gives one flexibility in various types of categorized external files.I immediately noticed how clear the incoming calls were. Sometimes on other units I have had a bit of a problem understanding the audio from an inbound call particular those which have static interference.  The Nokia has very good audio properties, and the sounds are crisp. The speaker phone is a good feature on the N96 because the other party doesn't realize you are using this feature. There is an absence of feed back.Downloading the various features was easy as I took things a step at a time. The internet access works very well. At home it works flawlessly with my wireless router. WLAN can be tricky, and I was very surprised how easy it was to set up on the N96.The most interesting surprise of the N96 is the camera. Wow. The graphics are beautiful. Love the 5MP resolution of the camera, and coupled with the clearness of the 2.8 inch screen the photo viewing is spectacular for a device this small. There are many options in sorting your digital photos. Thumbnails are nice. The TV connection gives an added ability to view your photos on your TV screen. Also I like the fact they included AC and Car chargers.The FM radio expands both music contact and keeping in touch with the local news. This feature was emphasized when I was able to keep in touch with our local media during recent severe weather.Nokia quality is certainly evident in every phase of the N96.
The N96 is a dual slider phone -push up and the keypad is revealed, down and the media keys are revealed.  The phone feels solid, and the slider mechanism is sturdy and clicks into position nicely.  An accelerometer automatically switches the display orientation when you rotate the phone.  A car charger is included in the box, which is nice.The N96 has Wi-Fi b/g, A-GPS, stereo Bluetooth, and AT&T; 3G coverage (it does not support T-Mobile's 3G band, but can be used with T-Mobile's regular network).  Call quality is good, and the speakerphone is loud.For productivity the phone has a robust phonebook and calendar.  Moreover, the phonebook allows for endless customization of the information contained in a contact.  There are programs to open Microsoft Office documents and PDF files.  The phone can also access POP3 e-mail, and be set to download new messages automatically.For entertainment there is a video player, FM radio, and an MP3 player.  The video works well with Amazon's Unbox Video on Demand service.  You can download special smaller files just for use on the phone, and it's easy to transfer them over using Amazon's free software download.  The music player is nicely featured, sounds good, and has a 3.5mm headphone jack making it easy to use your favorite headphones.The HTML web browser lets you view web pages like you would on a computer.  (I downloaded Skyfire, a free browser, as an alternate because sometimes the standard browser does not display pages well). N-Gage is for playing and downloading games, and Nokia maps comes pre-loaded with US maps and three months of turn-by-turn directions free.  Additionally, the GPS receiver locks onto a signal quickly.Being a Nokia N-Series the built in camera is 5 megapixels, with a dual LED flash, and autofocus with an assist light.  Photos are comparable to an entry-level compact camera, and using the GPS you can geotag your photos and view them on the map.  Video can be recorded at 640 x 480 at 30fps, much higher quality than most phones.To store your files there's a huge 16GBs of built in memory, as well as a Micro SD slot for more space when needed.The "profiles" feature allows you to set different ringer volumes and tones for different occasions, and you can time them so it reverts to the standard profile.  This is a great feature as it allows me to set my phone to work mode and it automatically switches back to normal mode at 5:30 when I leave.  Additionally, you can have the N96 say the callers name when it rings.  The "destinations" feature lets you select access points for Internet usage.  Since I have pay per use with AT&T;, I removed AT&T; from the list so I never have to worry about unexpected charges, and I added my home and work Wi-Fi so it automatically connects to them.I have not used the software that came with the phone since it does not work with Macs.  However, I downloaded a plug-in from Nokia's website that allows me to sync with my Mac over Bluetooth using the Mac's iSync, and it works great.Battery life is about 4 days with moderate use (a few calls, some texting, and web browsing).Now for the negatives: 1) The biggest problem, by far, is that sometimes the phone does not ring with the ringer I picked, it reverts to the default Nokia tune after one ring.  I called Nokia about it twice, and tried their suggestions, but it still happened.  They told me to send the phone to them for repair.  I declined and decided to live with it.  I also reset the phone to no avail.  2) The phone can sometimes be slow in operation.  Specifically, when opening the camera and browsing the photo gallery.  3) The dual LED flash is not very effective, you have to be right on top of the subject, and the pictures come out bluish.  Additionally, there is no sliding cover for the lens, and the camera button is stiff and hard to press.  4) For the price, the materials should be of higher quality, it's constructed of average feeling plastics.  5) The included owners manual is skimpy and barely covers all the phones features.  6) The battery depletes very quickly after 3 bars are left.(Sorry for the long review, but it's a very complex phone.)All in all... a feature packed mini computer that happens to be a phone, it lives up to the Nokia N Series tradition.01/15/09 Update: The phone has been reseting sometimes when I get a call and it has not been working well with my Acura's bluetooth HandsFreeLink I can only make calls by dialing on the phone then transferring it over.  If I could, I would take a star away.01/27/09 Update: I got a new SIM card (mine was 2 years old) and just downloaded the new software version 12.043 and the phone runs faster and the ringer and reset issues seem to be fixed.  So I'd give it a star back.03/24/09 Update: Phone still working well, slider still nice and tight and locks into position nicely.
I've waited a month of having this phone to review it to make sure that I give an accurate review of it's pros, cons and quirks.  Here's the "short" version of my review.Switching to the Nokia N96 after using an HTC MDA with Windows Mobile on it for 2 1/2 years.If you slide the keypad down, the numeric keypad shows and the display remains in portrait.  If you slide the keypad up, the multimedia keypad shows and the display goes to landscape mode.  However, if you close the multimedia keypad, the display stays in landscape mode.  This can be a pro or a con, depending on who you are.  For me, this is a con, because I have to move the numeric keypad down to get the screen to go back to portrait.The menu items on the screen are customizable.CallsThe clearest calls ever.  This is the first mobile phone that I have ever used speakerphone where the other party does not ask, "Are you on a speakerphone?"  It sounds the same as if you were using the handset.  I did try using the "Say Caller's Name" function, hoping that the caller's name would be verbally communicated, but the phone froze up and had to be reset after a test call was made to it.MessagingMessages show the sender and the first 30 characters of any message, great for getting the jist of what you're looking for in your inbox.  The left and right buttons allow movement between Inbox, Templates, Drafts, Sent, Outbox and Reports.  Inbound MMS may take hours if being sent from a competitor's service company (this may be an AT&T; issue, though).CalendarLarge, easy to read month and week calendar.  Easy to add appointments, just pick a date and start typing.  Easily swap between calendar views using the * key.NetworkQuickly locates surrounding Wifi, however, once you select a network (even if the connection is unsuccessful) you must manually select a new network by vising the WLAN Scanning setting.ProfilesPhone has Normal, Silent, Meeting, Outdoor, Pager, and Offline profiles which are 100% customizable.  Press and hold the # key and you swap between your preferred profile and silent mode.  Excellent 1 click capability.BluetoothI did not test this feature extensively, but was able to connect to a BlackBerry Pearl quickly.Video CenterVideo starts in portrait, must open multimedia buttons to change to landscape.  Has extremely vivid, detailed video.  Multimedia backlit buttons on keyboard fade after so many seconds of being idle, must memorize which buttons are where.  Thankfully, the "select" button doubles as a pause button.PhotosYou can sort your photos by captured, months, albums, tags, downloads and all.  A very appealing rotating menu of the thumbnails can be used to select which photo(s) you would like to view.GamesI only played PinBall and I hated it.  Having to use the 1 and 3 keys for the flippers with my thumbnails scratching up the bottom of the screen.  Didn't like playing games on it at all.ButtonsLock button is convenient quick slider.  Does have a power button, don't need to hold down the end key.  The volume button is the hardest button I have ever had to press on a phone, don't attempt this one handed.  Memory card slot is hard to open, afraid it will snap off every time I try to open it.  The keypad is backlit in white.  When the keypad idles out, you have the option to have the select button "pulse" in a dim bit of light to that it's easy to find in the dark.  Very neat!Video Camera5 megapixel Carl Zeiss lens is the best I've ever seen on a phone.  The shutter button can be held halfway down, just as any other digital camera to focus.  The phone has different scene modes found in other digital cameras, such as Auto, User Defined, Close Up, Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night and Night Portrait.  The camera also has burst mode that works extremely well!  Video tells you how much time you have left (i.e., 1:29:00) but when shooting video, the time rapidly declined to 1:24:00 within 5 seconds and continued declining from there.  The video does have a video light, similar to a flash for still pictures.  White balance, color tone are other options you can use.  The shutter button is hard to press without blurring the shot if you have the flash turned off.  Zoom is slow.  Lots of options for the self timer.  There is a secondary camera used for a self portrait or video calls, but it is definitely a worse lens, etc., as it picks up a lot of noise in low light and the quality is inferior.BrowserA "pearl" would definitely come in handing.  Using the Navigation button is tedious and time consuming.  Your thumb starts to hurt after a while of using it to scroll, as well.GeneralBattery will show fully charged for days, but as soon as you take a call, the battery seems to drain super quick, almost like when you have a full tank of gas and the guage doesn't move for days, but as soon as it does, you know you'll be out of gas within 50 miles.  This could be quite confusing for a first time multimedia phone user.  Would recommend to see this in a touch screen with a QWERTY keypad.  The backplate is very delicate and it feels like I'm going to break it.The other day the phone said, "No SIM Card" and when I opened the backplate and took the battery out, yep, there was the SIM card.  It had become unsecured.  I'm sure just pressing the battery down would've corrected this, but this could be a pain.  BTW, this happened without me dropping or jarring the phone at all.The kick stand is hard to open the first time, you're afraid you'll break it, however, afterwords it's really easy to open, but not too easy that it'll fly open on its own.If you need to relocate files from one memory source to another, it is a smooth, quick process (i.e., from MicroSD card to 16GB Memory).Quick charging time.The camera lens cover is *not* recessed, making for easy cleaning.FM Radio is excellent, you can use either the handset, headset or stereo speakers.  Also, this has the best stereo sound I have ever heard from a phone, much better than my iPod dock.
I anxiously awaited the arrival of this Nokia N96.  Its included features are enough to make anyone drool.I am using the device with AT&T; Wireless in the United States.  I quickly found that your basic phone functions are more or less easy to use.  Slide down the bottom keypad, and you're ready to dial a number.However, the other features I was so excited to try on the device were somewhat less easy to use.  The small indented power button on top of the device is even a bit confusing.  You have to depress it for a fair amount of time.  This can be a bit of a challenge, with large fingers.The web browser is quite quick, and the silver navigation ring on the front of the phone made it relatively easy to move around webpages.  However, somewhat less easy was figuring out how to connect it to the Internet.  I added my home wifi network, which wasn't too difficult, but I imagine would be a challenge for some users.  However, now, whenever I try to use any Internet based application or service, I have to select what connection I want: my home wifi, the mobile carrier's data network, etc.  It doesn't just connect, you have to confirm and select information every-time you go to do something  Want to listen to Internet radio, get ready to confirm you want to do that and that you want to connect to the Internet, and what connection you want to use. Want to use Nokia Maps?  Get ready to select your Internet connection.  It's really troubling.The phone is also setup by default in metric measurements.  I changed a setting from metric to imperial, but my maps still calculate everything based on kilometers rather than miles.  This does not bother me, for the fact I'm very comfortable with metric measurements, but I imagine others might find this confusing and frustrating. Surely, there is setting to change this, but it is not obvious.Turn by Turn Directions is a bright spot for the Nokia N96.  Nokia will give you a 3 month trial of Turn by Turn Directions.  Then all you need is a connection to the Internet, with your mobile provider, and you can get turn by turn directions from your current location to a destination of your choice.  You can also search for businesses, restaraunts, or anything else you might be interested in driving to.  Walking directions are also available.  I would give the maps and turn by turn implementation on this phone a 4/5.  It works quite nicely, once you get it running, though it is still a bit cumbersome.The camera included with the N96 is another bright spot. For a mobile phone camera, it's one of the best.  It is 5 megapixels, but more importantly it has a good camera lens that take solid pictures under good lighting.  It has an autofocus as well.  Perhaps even more impressive, the video you can shoot with the Nokia N96 is the best quality setting, is also very good.  The video recording capability is one of the things I plan to use the N96 for the most.Connect the N96 to your computer for some exciting options.  On a Windows computer, you can use the Amazon Unbox service, to sync the mobile copies of your purchased TV shows.  This can be good, if you need to watch a show on the go.  It's also easy to use popular music applications (except iTunes obviously) and included software to sync your MP3 files to your phone, such as the ones you can purchase from the Amazon MP3 store.  Videos from Amazon Unbox look quite good when viewed on the N96, and the sound from the Internal speaker and headphones were both impressive.I also tried connecting the N96 to my Mac.  Surprisingly, selecting the mass media option from the handset after connecting it via USB, even my Mac could sync with iPhoto the photos and videos I recorded on the phone!  That is fantastic.  Mac users can still use the N96 to pull the photos and videos they take.  A nice feature.3G - The N96 can connect to AT&T; 3G network where available.  This does allow faster map searching and internet browsing, though drains the battery somewhat quicker.FM Radio - A surprising feature of the Nokia N96 is that when you connect standard headphones, you can listen to your local FM radio.  It may sound like something of the past, but when your device has the capability it is more convenient than you might think.Drawbacks - Again, a big drawback of the N96 is that it is not always easy to use.  You'll spend several minutes, if not longer, the first time you try to do anything.  Furthermore, without a dedicated QWERTY pad, typing messages, emails, or web addresses can be a challenge.Overall, the Nokia N96 brings together a tremendous number of features.  You have a solid phone camera, solid video recorder, multimedia player, music player, FM radio, calendar, web browser, 16 GB of included memory and more.  However, there is a high learning factor, to use many of the features.  Furthermore, with the power and capability of the phone, you sometimes find yourself wishing for a QWERTY keyboard, or a touch screen.The N96 has some amazing capabilities, but for the several hundred dollars the device requires to purchase, I am left wondering how many people should pay that much money, for it.  If you really believe it's the perfect phone for you, I would not discourage you.  However, if you are not completely against getting a contract phone, an offering from Blackberry or the iPhone may be a simpler to use solution.
I've tried this phone out for about a month and a half after upgrading from the N95 (N95-3). Functionally there isn't anything much improved in the N96, it is essentially the same phone with some minor OS tweaks here and there. So in the end what you're paying for is the 16gb storage and a sleeker looking design.So after all that, I've decided to go back to my N95. With 16gb microSD cards being around $20-$30, you could be saving nearly $200 (assuming you buy a N95 from amazon). Plus, Nokia still hasn't released the API for their accelerometer in the N96 so you don't even get the benefits of some amazing third party apps written for the N95.
I bought this phone for my wife who had a 2 year old Motorola RAZR on T-Mobile USA.  Out of the box it worked well, a phone call activated it same day. It is super for web browsing, the web browser is superior to my Motorola Q (sprint).  Wifi works without problems, allowing her to call me on Skype from her phone. 3G on T-mobile is a bit of a hassle, requiring her to manually select UTMS in the menu to get 3G (T-Mobile uses AT&T; towers), otherwise it prefers EGDE T-Mobile data.  3G UTMS is fast, almost as fast as cable internet on Wifi at home. Phone calls are flawless. The keypad and predictive text are not as good as a Motorola RAZR, for heavy texting you need either a phone with a QWERTY keyboard or get a Bluetooth USB keyboard for the N96.Camera images are almost as good as the Canon Powershot SD1000 we normally use, the only gripes are that there is no dedicated shutter button (you must launch the camera app in the menu) and you must hold the camera still for 2 seconds after taking the picture.  It *almost* replaces our canon. The N95 has a much better mechanical zoom camera.The phone occasionally requires a power down reset to cure some glitches it gets, like not dialing out a phone number selected in the contacts.Battery life while using it as a phone is great. Using GPS and internet heavily requires you to recharge the battery daily, one plus is the N96 includes a car charger, headphones (required for FM reception), remote control for watching movies, and a wall charger.  DO NOT be without a wall or car charger if you use the phone heavily. The N95 has better battery life.The rear battery cover does not fit exactly and can shift slightly, giving a cheap feel to an otherwise super phone.Video is awesome and watching a movie is good considering the N96 has a stand to prop it up horizontally. The speakers can be TOO loud at times, which is a welcome feature in a small phone.Watching YouTube videos are kinda grainy, I suspect the server recognizes it is a mobile phone and downgrades the video.GPS is as good as my Garmin GPSMap 76 I use on my boat and with the Nokia Maps or Google Maps is spot on. A-GPS uses towers and is accurate to 1/4 mile or so, the map shows the probable circle of error. Battery life goes quickly using GPS, so use your car charger.In closing, the phone is a near-substitute for its major competitors, the Google G1 Andriod, Iphone 3G, and HTC Touch. I feel watching movies and surfing is superior (except iphone) due to the bright screen and loud sound.The IPhone has a better display and you can expand and squeeze maps and the browser by moving your fingers.  Text input is radically different but comparable. That is, if you dont mind not having a real keyboard or touch screen.  Software is more available but must come through Apple. AT&T; for us was a deal-breaker as it is much more expensive and given the cost of the plan through the contract as well as the purchase price  the IPhone is 800$+ more than a N96.The HTC Touch has slightly better battery life but the case is bigger and I feel the slide is more fragile. A real keyboard is a super plus. Touch Flo 3D is a nice interface too. The G1 Android required a data plan from T-Mobile and the battery life is awful.  Google software currently (Jan/09) is slow to adopt and applications are few and far between. No exchange support. no video player.The Nokia N96 runs Symbian S60-3rd edition and currently it is less popular than Windows Mobile, comparable to Apple, and better accepted than Android. Nokia Maps are stored on the unit allowing navigation where internet service is unavailable. With 16GB internally and another 16GB on the storage card you can store a lot of music and data.  Microsoft Exchange internet integrates with the N96 allowing you to retrieve email.  The Music player is not as good as the IPod Touch, which my wife still carries.Bottom line, if you own the IPhone under contract or the Nokia N95 don't buy this unit. The advantages are marginal. Video is superior to the N95, same as IPhone, and others. Speakers are super loud.  If you are shopping for a multimedia phone and you dont currently own one, consider the N96 as it is a precisely built unit.  For texting or emails get a phone with a QWERTY keyboard.  We are overall mostly satisfied with the N96 with the one BIG revervation of not having a full keyboard.  Byron
I currently own the LG Dare and Blackberry Curve, so I get the opportunity to use a "dumb phone" and a "smartphone" on a regular basis.  This Nokia N96 is sort of a compromise between the two.  It has the strengths of a smart phone while also delivering the pluses of the normal phone.  There are many pluses and minuses already mentioned by other reviewers, so I will not repeat the obvious ones.  Here are a few that really caught my attention:The Nokia Software loads about 700mb of software on your computer which would be fine if it all worked like it was intended.  I spent a lot of time searching forums for help on connecting and updating the device with the software.The 5mp camera is fantastic!  I also like the small camera on the front of the device.  Nice touch.  Though, this device is loaded with so many features and options, it could be overwhelming to the technically challenged.The TV out capability is excellent.  Home videos show clearly on my flat screen and movies display very well.  It's like the Swiss Army Knife of cell phones!I love the FM radio feature.  A good option that should be added to more portable devices.The phone is about the size of my LG Dare, but just a bit thicker.  It fits in your hand quite well.  Calls are clear.  A full querty keyboard would be a welcome addition, though.I use the device on T-Mobile (non 3G).  It works quite well, though you do give up certain features.The 2.8 inch screen is an absolute delight.  Crisp and clear.  Excellent for playing games and watching video.The N96, to me, is more of a designer gadget.  Those that love high tech devices with lots of features will drool over this phone.  It does everything pretty well, but compared with other phones, it doesn't really excel at anything.  It's definitely not the IPhone killer, but more of a trendy substitute. There are a lot of great phone choices out there.  The Nokia N96 would not be my first choice if my choice was utility (LG Dare).  Nor would it be my first choice for a smartphone (Blackberry or Samsung Omnia).  It would rank pretty high on my list of phones if I were looking for an all in one multimedia phone that is somewhat future proof (sans touchscreen and querty keyboard).
beautiful phone..great cool features... and an excellent product from nokia for the people who are tired of touchscreen devices....
This is my first smartphone purchase, but I played around with several before buying.  I bought the phone because it had everything I wanted, including unlocked and no touch screen.  I hate touch screens.  It has a ton of features I don't need, but, hey, you never know, right?  I'll focus more on Cons because that's more valuable to a potential buyer.Pros:Has everything you could want in a phone.  Camera is decent, but a standard point-and-click camera is better.  Image display is good, and speaker quality is amazing!  The phone OS is fairly customizable.  Unlike many people, I don't have a problem with the power button nor shutter button.  The product description does a good job citing the Pros.Cons:My biggest disappointment would be the materials used.  They feel cheap.  When the phone is slided-down and I'm in, for lack of a better word, "gaming-mode," I feel that I may break the phone in half.  I'm an engineer, so I look for efficiency in building, and there is a lot of wasted space inside the phone.  I think that with a little bit more time, they easily could have reduced the size, strengthened the case, or given more features, especially for it's cost.  Buttons are a little small.  Especially the square directional one on the front.  Media controls are redundant, which annoys me.  Not too many apps for Symbian S60 when compared to Android, Apple, and even Blackberry.  Another big problem is the battery life.  It is really annoying to need to recharge so often.
I purchased this after I returned a N85-3 to another dealer, this phone has it all and works as good if not better than the old outdated N95-3.There are so many things to point out it would take me forever to put it all down but from a person that has owned a N73, Two N81's, a N78, a N95-2, Three N95-3's, Two N95-4's, a N85-3 and out of all of them the N96-3 is the best of all.If you would like the best Nokia that is being produced right now I would say pick up a N96-3,it works great and is really fun to use.
For better or worse, it seems that smartphone reviews nowadays can't escape comparison with the iPhone, especially when that phone heavily touts its value as a consumer entertainment device. As it turns out, I'm an iPhone 3G owner (and former Windows Mobile owner) so this review is no different. I'll go ahead and spoil the ending to say that the N96 is no iPhone killer, but, refreshingly, I found that the N96 outclassed the iPhone's similar features in several areas. In fact, I'd say that while the Nokia N96 isn't for everyone,  it positions itself as a strong media phone for those wanting an alternative to the Apple ecosystem.On paper, the iPhone 3G and Nokia N96 are similar in many ways. Both have up to a 16 GB internal hard drive. Both have GPS. Both are designed to play music, games and widescreen video downloaded from the internet. Both have an "app store", where you can purchase and download additional programs. Both have integrated WiFi and both have 3G connectivity (HSDPA).The N96, however, is strong in areas where the iPhone is criticized for being weak. While the iPhone's camera is only 2 MP, the N96 boasts two cameras, one capable of video-calls and the other: an impressive 5 MP camera with a "flash" (really more of a close-range light) and lots of settings. The N96 has a removable battery, It has the capability for expanded storage with a Micro SD slot, it can send MMS messages and, most importantly, the phone is unlocked so you're not necessarily stuck with a single cellular provider!The N96 hardware has some great components and features, as well. It comes with an impressive array of accessories that most phones sell separately (for a pretty penny). Included with the phone are an AC adapter, car charger, headphone/aux extension cord with built-in media controls, and even TV-out cables!  The media and games are controlled by physical buttons which makes it easy to feel the buttons and navigate your music in the car without taking your eyes off the road. The built-in FM radio is great for local stations and, in my case, great for tuning into an FM-transmitted TV audio signal while jogging on the treadmill at my gym. The N96 also has the most impressive speakers I've heard on a portable device, producing enough volume to hurt my ears!Unfortunately, there are also several drawbacks to the N96. The N96's 2.8 inch screen, while sufficient, is smaller than the iPhone's. The Nokia app store doesn't have quite the variety and impressiveness of Apple's store. You can transfer purchased movies to the N96 from services like Amazon Unbox, but you can't  play Unbox movie rentals and the movie purchases you CAN transfer are restricted from playing via the included TV-out cables. The operating system can be difficult to use, especially because of the hardware's lack of touch screen, and lastly but most importantly, there's no keyboard, only a numeric keypad, so trying to compose emails and otherwise enter text is downright painful.All in all, however, the N96 is a very powerful entertainment phone. I think most consumers will find the ease of use and elegance of the iPhone more appealing, but I'd recommend this phone to those wanting to watch movies and play games while at the same time preferring to get their media from services like Amazon Unbox rather than the iTunes store. It's also a reasonable buy for those who travel internationally with their smartphone and want to be able to change SIM cards rather than getting ripped off by international roaming or expensive international calling plans.The price is a little steep, though not completely unusual for an high-end unlocked phone of this caliber, and overall I'd give it a weak four star rating: it's great, but far from perfect. The N97, expected in the US shortly after the first half of 2009 looks to have several improvements over the N96, but for those who want a high-end N-series phone sooner rather than later, the N96 will capably meet your needs.
I upgraded from the N95 8Gig (also a seriously great phone) to this.  I love both, but I prefer the N96 because it has a bigger memory plus the ability to expand.  I added an 8Gig card SanDisk 8GB MicroSD Card  ( SDSDQ 008G A11M)and have loaded lots of music and movies.  In preparation for a trip I am loading other movies on additional cards so I can switch them out.  Although watching on such as small screen takes some getting used to, this expansion feature is enough for me to favor this over the N95.  The quality of videos is excellent, but I don't recommend you try to watch films with subtitles :-).The only minus of this v. the N95 is that the N96 has a noticeably shorter battery life (only on standby and voice calls).  I only had to charge my N95 every few days; this one needs it every day or two at the most.The camera is excellent.  In fact, it is the only camera I used on a recent trip and the still pictures and videos are as good as my very expensive (and very heavy) camera.  Having only one thing to carry in my pocket without sacrificing picture quality was wonderful, (and the phone/camera was envied by all who saw it).The phone has lots of useful features even if, like me, you don't subscribe to a data package.  I use the phone to attach to wi-fi when out and check my e-mail, shop at Amazon, etc. This does not use the cell service and so there is no data charge.I still haven't figured out the GPS system, but then again I haven't spent very much time on it.  Not everything on these phones is intuitive and the written instruction book is lacking, but Nokia has an excellent web site with all the information I have needed to answer my questions.This phone is really expensive, but it is worth it.  Highly recommended for anyone with the desire for a great smart phone the ability to buy it.
i always luv nokia products since they started making the 'N' serieswell, this nokia n96 a lil bit more better than previous n95 8gb that i had. but some people saying that battery consume was high, i agreed with it, no infrared, n application opening seems getting slower compare to n95 8gb.the good thing, it is a NOKIA we talking about over here,it's good, always good.cant wait for n97 that will comes out on julyaccelerometers, arrghh,,, georgous, auto update for the nokia firmupdate software via phone, that's a ++ ( on previous nokia products you need to update via pc suite)n this is about the video n photo quality: even thou n95 8gb that i had is the same best quality with n 96 that i just purchased, but..it's better the n-96.trust mei compared it several times.finally...one thing that made me dissapoint is the color.if you got to nokiausa.com n type on the search product " nokia n96"it will appears that they have the all housing black color ( include the liner side is black ) for the nokia n-96but in fact: there's none.i try to find n searching everywhere, noneevery single nokia n-96 that you'll buy has the liner side silver or dark grey color. if you find one with the black liner side, it might be a fake one or not originally nokia madethat's all my men..
Although this phone is amazingly high-powered and sophisticated, it is greatly lacking in capabilities for the business owner. Having now used an older model Blackberry for over a year, I am regretting the purchase of this Nokia.This would be a FANTASTIC phone for any highschool, college, or media junkie....just not for the serious entrepreneur or small business person.
The new Nokia N96 phone reads like a powerhouse smartphone packed with features. It is a full color, unlocked GSM slider phone with a 5MP camera, stereo sound, music and video features. While it is a quad band world phone, here in the US it works on T-Moblie and AT&T; networks (although AT&T; is recommened for its faster 3G network). Let me start out by describing what you get. Nokia has packed quite a bit in the box. They include cables to hook your phone up to you TV to watch video, a car charger, a sync cable to sync your phone to your pc for updates, video, app and music downloads, battery, travel charger, a remote that hooks into the phone along with earbuds that hook into the remote, (no you can't use the earbuds without the remote and you cannot hook alternate headsets into the phone or the remote),an invitation to use the OVI service (an online backup service with tiered features to backup your phone), a User Guide, Get Started Guide, the Nokia PC Suite CD, an NGage free game offer, warranty info and of course the phone.Now for the phone. It is a beautiful, full color, lightweight device that promises much, but delivers less. Since this is a GSM phone, after calling to switch service, you only need to add your SIM card to start using it. The battery was partially charged out of the box, so it did not take long to charge. Despite what I have read from other reviews, I had no problems adding contacts from my SIM card to the phone. Since this phone IS NOT a touch screen, everything is menu driven. Nokia did not do a good job of letting you know where all the menus are. While a User Guide is included, the full version of how to use the phone is included in the online version of the guide that can be found at the Nokia product page. The buttons on this phone do not stand out as much as I would like. The call and end keys are on opposite sides, but are not as prominent as they should be. The Power key is on top and it takes a few minutes to turn it on. There are "media keys" that work for video or music playback that surround the larger scroll key. The scroll key is used to navigate the various menus, with the usual Nokia context sensitive Selection keys above the Call and End keys. The scroll key is very sensitive, I kept hitting selections that I did not want and it is also used for navigating web pages. There is a menu key that is usefull and a multimedia key which isn't that helpful. The display is beautiful and call quality is excellent. You slide the main section up to bring up the keyboard and number pad. This phone should have had a qwerty keyboard, as the typing on the keypad is time consuming pressing keys until you come to the one yo need.  This is also even more frustrating for the Internet. While the display is very clear, the browser is only a WAP mobile browser, not the full Internet browser that an iPhone or iPod Touch would have. Using the scroll key to move a too small arrow around is a pain. While this phone offers YouTube, the Internet video quality is very spotty. The stereo sound in 3D is very clear and you do not need a headset to listen. This phone is one of the few compatible with the Amazon UnBox service. To try out the service, I installed the Nokia PC suite. It installled a software updater, Video suite manager, photo app, PC suite app, and a Map loader for the GPS function. The installation of the apps was fast, though starting the PC Suite app took a very long time. The Amazon UnBox service is a video on demand portable player to watch video on you PC or mobile device. It was very easy to download the player and install it. Amazon has a nice selection of videos and I downloaded a Stargate SG-1 episode to view on my phone. Purchasing was fast and easy although downloading took a very long time because of the extra option for portable files. The UnBox player interface is nice, but I had a difficult time trying to transfer the files to the phone. The help files say that you can just copy files to the phone, but you actually transfer the files by clicking play. After finally getting the files to transfer to the phone, I was able to watch the video. The video playback on the phone for the Amazon purchase was clear and of excellent quality. Playback on the phone is in the widescreen format. It will play in both portrait and landscape mode, although queing up takes a while unlike an iPod or iPhone. You can slide the main phone the other way to show the video keys in landscape mode. The main 5MP camera with the Carl Zeiss lens is outstanding, the best camera I have seen on a phone so far. It has a flash and is located on the back. There is also a lower resolution camera on the front. Both can capture images and video. Photos look fantastic. The N96 is also supposed to broadcast TV signals through the LIVE TV service, but like most of the Nokia service options, it is not available in the US. Neither is the Nokia Music Store and the Nokia Maps turn by turn service. The phone will play music via the Windows Media Player (no Apple iTunes formats) and podcasts. It also has an FM radio and Internet radio playback capability. The radio feature will only play with the remote and headset attached. You cannot listen to the radio without the attachments, another boneheaded manuever by Nokia. The Maps feature, which is the GPS function to me was useless. After the app opens, you see a 3D image of the planet. You have to install the Maps software before the actual street level option will work and as I mentioned before, the turn by turn doesn't work in the US. My iPod Touch handles GPS faster and easier than this. The N96 is also supposed to be Bluetooth compatible, but I could not get it to discover my Bluetooth headset despite numerous attempts.This phone has a lot of quirks. While it does turn on fairly quickly and you can make calls quickly, Using many of the features means responding to a number of silly requests such as "go on Internet now?" after selecting the web option. I personally prefer touch screen phones because it is much easier to navigate than having to drill down through numerous menus. Some shortcut options are available, but not for a lot of features. I did not try the OVI service, since I already use a wonderful service called Dashwire to backup my phone. The N96 does have a large 16 GB storage with a memory card addition available, it does leave a lot to be desired. This phone is better engineered for the overseas market rather than the US. It would a good option for those who use the Windows Media audio files for music and radio and camera and video fans. It is a good effort, but falls short, especially for the high price.
SummaryThe Nokia N96 is an expensive phone that competes against many rival companies that have done their homework over the years to provide competitive products against this phone-dominating firm. The N96 fails to be able to be a leader in its phone class, with issues that are problematic of a phone years older.  The few positives of the N96 do not command the high purchase price.Background:I used the N96 with AT&T; service in the US.  My local areas has extensive 3G coverage so I was always able to get a solid 3G, fast, connection (Note I do not have any LiveTV service in my area).  My normal phones I use are the Iphone 3G and the Samsung Blackjack II (windows mobile).  I am a rather geeky person who enjoys tinkering with phones and computers so I will provide an assessment from a user-experience in comparison to the two phones I've cited, which I use often on the same 3G service; for those who aren't aware, GSM phones have sim cards that can be popped into different phones so aren't "tied" to a specific piece of hardware (i.e. Verizon, Sprint).Unboxing:The N96 comes in a very nice retail box.  This is typical of Nokia's products, placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging.  It sets off a nice first impression of the product.Build:Overall the phone has a mirrored surface for its LCD and a shiny black glossy surface for the rest of the phone.  The black does attract fingerprints and at first this tends to put people off.  However, after a while the fingerprint effect psychologically diminishes upon itself so you do not really care.The keys are only average in tactile feel and comparable to a regular $200 phone.  This is surprising since I thought a top of the line phone would have quality keys with a firm solid response.  Not so here.  The keys spacing are not conducive to one-hand dialing without looking at the unit.The LCD is beautiful, with crisp text and accurate color display. If there's anything that's very well engineered on this phone it will be the LCD and camera (more on that below).  Truly world-class, I haven't quite seen an LCD look as good as on this phone.The camera is really good on this phone. Quite a far cry from the iphone and other Windows mobile phones.  Pictures come out reasonably sharp in daylight.  Low light is poor, but again, that's nothing unusual from any camera phone and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone. The camera does have a very bright LED that can amazingly light up a dead-dark environment a few feet ahead at max range.The exterior speaker is loud enough but only average in quality with a slightly tinny output.  I believe that my blackjack II's speaker is louder and cleaner in output, not significantly so, but enough to be noticeable.The rear kickstand, a widely marketed feature, is a pure gimmick that is poorly designed. Because it is not directly in the middle of the unit, the weight is not properly balanced. This means that an uneven surface, or a slight breeze could topple the unit over.  Tacky, I was so full of disgust when I tried it myself.  Needs to be completely reengineered or gotten rid of entirely.The ports are that of a micro USB, headphone, and power port. Nokia has decided not to use the USB port for power, however, so you have to lug around the power plug during travel if you take your laptop with you.  Not cool!There are no rubber boots for the ports on the phone.  Not a good sign - -water seepage can end up being a problem here.  And for those who say those boots tear off anyway, that is not necessarily true.  My old Blackjack II phone never had any of its boots torn off even though I heavily "abused" it for a year by inserting an removing countless times.Battery life is mediocre.  I could get about a day's worth of use with heavy web browsing and a few phone calls.  The battery gets much hotter than a normal smartphone does when in heavy discharge/charge mode.  It would be nice if Nokia could address this issue by producing a phone that doesn't feel like a mini hot plate to your face or hand.Accessories:The included car charger is a strange size.  It could not fit into my cig lighter.  Fortunately, I had a car charger from a different Nokia model that was compatible.  There is a proper USB cable included, which is a good thing since not everyone has a microUSB ported type of cable.  The travel charger is small enough.  There is no MicroSD card included, but these are cheap enough to buy for anyone who needs more than the regular 16GB of built in memory.  It's really nice that the memory is expandable like this, compared to the iphone where you are locked out from expansion options.  For music lovers, this means you can have a max of 24GB of memory and 16GB microsd's are on there way over soon, so that would mean 32gb of storage.  Not bad!Interface and response:The user interface is typical Nokia sybian.  That is, the menu set is fairly straight forward in operation.  The phone, however, has a sluggish feel to it.  Programs load sluggishly, making you wonder if you pressed the right button to launch it.  After a bit, the lag finally catches up.  I expect such typical behavior from a Windows Mobile phone,but the fact a Symbian phone does this is clearly unacceptable.  I'm not sure why the phone is so slow in execution; supposedly this phone lacks a multimedia processor and is clocked very low.  Regardless, it simply is slow, and that's all that matters to the end-user who will feel upset waiting at the response times.  This issue likely extends into the browser.The built-in web browser is much better than IE for windows mobile.  However, it is much worse than the Iphone's browser.  Pages render fairly well but loading is slow and scrolling stutters.  Although the phone was capable of launching youtube videos from the regular youtube site, there was so much stuttering going on that it was useless. Resource intensive sites like CNN are too slow to load, making it painful to view.  Zooming was horrible and nonintuitive. Again, this was a common issue on old phones from the early 2000s, but a top of the line phone for 2009?  The Iphone, by comparison, breezes through the most intense sites with ease.  This is sadly not a good web browsing phone. Since a 3G data plan with AT&T; is so expensive, some of us would like a phone that's capable of browsing like an Iphone does.  Can't do that here.The phone does not support an international character set out of the box.  If you want to to view Chinese, for example, you cannot do this unless you mail in your phone to a Nokia service center.  This is a ludicrous option (did we timewarp to 1999?) in a time when extras should be downloadable from the manufacturer, even for a fee.  Since there's only one Nokia service center in the entire USA, you have to wait a long time for the turnaround.  To go without a phone that long is unacceptable.  The Iphone, by comparison, supports International characters right out of the box!The java stack on the N96 is awful.  It's too sensitive to security prohibitions and runs sluggishly, again.  I tried running Opera Mini, a java app, and it kept giving me security warnings every time I launched it, with no way to bypass those warnings.  The Opera mini program ran much slower than on my Blackjack II, a reflection, again, on the slow processing speed of the N96.The included GPS program was incredibly slow (do I hear an echo?) compared to the free Google Maps I've used on the iphone and the Blackjack.  Scrolling just to browse a map was painful and not something I could have any fun with.  In contrast, I love being able to just browse the maps on my other phones because it's quick and efficient.The N96 does have an auto position that uses the accelerometer.  It does work (disabled by default) but not all Symbian programs support it.  Therefore you are left with a rather quirky feature that may not activate when you expect it to.The T9 system is fast and pretty accurate. Honestly it's not going to get any better than this for input with a numeric keypad. The next step is have some hard alpha keys or an onscreen keyboard.As for phone quality, it sounded pretty good on both ends. Then again ,a 3G connection provides the crisp quality so the network infrastructure is more to the reason here.Conclusion:Nokia's N96 feels like a step back into time. It is sluggish in response, has poor included utilities, and its construction is not as good compared to its main rivals -- The iphone and the various Windows mobile platform phones.  The high price is not commensurate with its ability.  In particular, web browsing is awful.  A complete redesign is needed to make this phone faster and more intuitive.
I was excited to try this phone out as I have been using Windows Mobile devices for awhile (currently using the AT&T; Tilt) and never been completely satisfied with their performance. A 16 gig phone geared for music and video looked right up my alley. Having used this phone for several days and tried as many features as possible, I'm not nearly as enamored with it as I hoped. For a $600 phone, I expected something far more polished. This seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems. Let's run down the good stuff first.PROS:- Light, compact form factor. Considerably lighter than my Tilt.- 16 gig of memory. Excellent amount of included space, and can take a microSD card for even more media files.- Beautiful screen. Video is sharp and colorful, although it could be a bit brighter. But hard to complain with the quality of the picture. See below though for more comments on video playback. It also is much more visible in sunlight than my Tilt is.- 5 gig camera with flash and video capability. I debated whether to include this under the "pros" as I didn't find the quality of the images produced by the camera all that great, particularly indoors. But having a flash and being able to record video with it is still at least better than not having it at all.- Excellent sound quality and nice loud speakers. Includes two speakers for "sort-of" stereo playback. This phone can really produce some serious volume, I was quite impressed. Granted, the sound quality out of the speakers is not going to blow anyone away. But it's pretty good regardless. And make sure you turn the volume down before using the headphones, it will totally blast you away! If you regularly try to listen to music in noisy situations where volume is crucial, you will know how important this can be.- Excellent multimedia features included. FM radio, internet radio, podcasts, etc. Most of these I could do on my WM phone, but great to have them included for seamless integration right on the phone.- Good included accessories. Includes a remote with speakerphone, car charger, TV out cables, free game, etc. Better package overall than most phones.Now for my fairly long list of negatives.CONS:- Lack of fullsize keyboard and/or touchscreen. I was surprised to see there was no touchscreen on this phone, that makes it really hard to compete with other smartphones in the same class like the iPhone and any Windows Mobile phone. With my Tilt, I not only have a full QWERTY keyboard (which granted, is not the greatest way to enter text for most people, but nice for things like passwords and WEP keys) you can use a wide variety of entry methods that work with the touchscreen. I personally use ones like Fitaly and Touchpad which can give good speed and yet still easily handle non-standard text at any time. One of the things I particularly find annoying with phones like this that use T9 is that you often have to turn it on and off which requires going to the menu. Likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers, you have to constantly switch back and forth, which takes far longer on this phone than just about any other smartphone I've used. It's incredibly tedious and if you use your phone as a PDA or anything other than quick texting, you should probably look at better options.- Problems using Wifi versus AT&T; data plans. I personally use pay-as-you-go currently as I don't need to pay for monthly cell phone service and almost always have access to Wifi networks. With my Tilt, it's a simple matter of a one-time configuration of the phone for any Wifi network and it will use that automatically versus accessing the AT&T; data network. This phone just would not cooperate with that. It often would switch over and use the data plan and charge me no matter how I configured it, even going into the settings and making my Wifi the default. Worse, you would have to do this *every* time you access a new Wifi network, setting it up as a default and then switching it back, and even then, it seems to randomly hit the data network and charge me for usage without warning. And to make it even more annoying, just about every time it needs to access the internet, it has to ask me what network to use, the Wifi or AT&T.; Why bother setting a default (and configuring it for automatic) if it's not going to just use it?? It's almost like the phone is trying to get you to use the paid data plan whether you have access to Wifi or not. Just about everything else on this phone I can kind of deal with, or work around, but this is so frustrating for me and COSTS ME MONEY that it's a total dealbreaker. So if you want to use Wifi as your primary data access network, and not pay the significant cost of a monthly data plan, you will probably want to use a different phone.- Bare-bones email and web applications. The email and web apps that came with the phone didn't do much for me. Emails with HTML were not properly formatted at all, and the options for handling email as well were very limited compared to what I am used to. When I tried to adjust my settings, it wiped out my custom POP settings and I had to enter them all over again (which due to the lack of keyboard is particularly annoying). The web browser was not quite as bad, but navigating the pages without a touchscreen is slow and tedious and it kept popping up the "overall" page view when it was inconvenient. The back button brings up little thumbnails of the pages but for some reason they were often blank and kept skipping the actual page I wanted to get back to. I was easily able to load on the free Opera Mini browser however, which gave me a far better experience. If you use a smartphone, I highly recommend grabbing a copy of it. I've not yet found a free email replacement, I'd probably have to pay to get an email application that just does the basics that I would have liked to come with the device.- While there's certainly plenty of games on Symbian and for N-Gage, the library of applications is a bit more limited. Also just the fact that it doesn't use a touchscreen makes game play often more limiting and somewhat more tedious as it relies totally on keystrokes, particularly the types of games I prefer (card games, adventure games, etc.) Still, the games offered were decent enough and the graphics top-notch for a mobile phone, and I do notice more places offering Symbian versions of their software. Both my Hava player and Roboform mobile apps had versions that ran okay on the N96 (although not flawless).- Performance issues. My main hope was that this device would be zippier and less prone to locking up than the Tilt. Unfortunately this was not the case. The processor is downgraded from the previous N95 model, most likely done to allow them to also downgrade the battery as well but I can't say if the problems I saw are a result of this or typical for Symbian phones. While the video was sharp and beautiful to look at, I still experienced pauses and skips...particularly with the sample videos included! Almost all of the ones included with the phone did not play smoothly all the way through. I had better luck with some small videos that I synced to the device and a couple TV episodes that I downloaded from Amazon Unbox. While they did not always play perfectly, they were at least watchable for 95% of the time. The phone itself also often temporarily pauses and/or freezes and a few times locked up on me completely. Unlike the Tilt which has a reset option, I could not figure out how to unlock this phone when it froze other than to remove the back and pull the battery out. Very annoying.- Camera image quality. It's important when evaluating cameras to realize that megapixels means little about quality. So getting 5 MP with the phone means mostly that the images it takes will just take up more space on the phone. They certainly aren't of a quality that I would be interested in printing them out which is where the 5 MP would be of any use. They are of similar quality to most cellphones...which means only good for snapshots when you have nothing better on-hand. And indoors in anything other than very bright light, they were definitely worse than what my Tilt is able to take, even though the camera includes a flash.- Battery life. Barely passable, no better than my Tilt which was equally a battery hog. You definitely need to charge it every night and if you use your phone much, you may find you need to charge it during the day as well.- Voice control. This is one of those phones that you don't really train, it just recognizes the names you speak and picks the default phone. Also some basic application control. This type of VR can be problematic if you have people with similar names and I just much prefer training my own names and commands as I can with the software on WM phones. And of course, there's nothing in the manual about how to even use this feature.- Live TV. Touted as a feature, but won't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now. You're probably much better off just getting a Slingbox or Hava which will work with a wide range of phones these days, including this one.- Non-standard USB cable. May seem like a small nit, but things like this just annoy me. Why not use a standard mini-USB cable, which most people have multiple ones of, and also a USB cable that will simultaneous charge the device? It's really annoying when you are syncing the device, moving videos, etc. and it runs out of juice. Using this new micro USB cable means I'll need to buy another one for travel....and probably another cable for charging in different places.- GPS. I only tested the GPS briefly as this was another area where it seemed to insist on using the data plan rather than Wifi. But I just don't see the benefit in using a GPS on such a small screen and paying monthly fees for it, when you can buy dedicated GPS units for as little as $100 these days that are larger and easier to read while driving, and with much better features. This GPS didn't work nearly as well as my simple Garmin unit and didn't even compare with running TomTom on my Tilt which I don't pay any fee to use (other than the purchase cost of the software).- No case or screen protector. For the price, some kind of cheap case would be nice. The device comes with a plastic skin covering the front and back that would do nicely as a screen protector, but for some reason, they plastered a big "NOKIA" over the front so it can't be used. The screen and phone itself really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty readily so a screen protector would have been highly appreciated.- Nokia PC Suite issues. I didn't have too much trouble syncing my Outlook contacts, but had various issues with other parts of the PC Suite. Forget using the music application, for some reason it didn't read 99% of the tags in my MP3s, so had to use Media Player to sync music to the device. The video manager as well did not work very well for me. It handled small videos okay, but as soon as it got to anything with length, it locked up on me. Took me several tries to convert videos of more than 100 meg in size. I want to try and do some conversions myself and see what videos it really can handle, as I have other mobile video conversion software that does a good job, but I know already it doesn't seem to handle Divx video which is a shame.- Bare bones user manual. The manuals included cover the basics, but you won't find much help in them if you need more than just "getting started" information. For instance, I was trying to figure out where I turn on T9 predictive text, but there's absolutely no information in the manual on text entry whatsoever. I went to the Nokia site to see if the support section had a better manual to download, but nope. You better be good at figuring stuff out on your own to use this phone (and yes, I did figure out where the T9 setting was).- Other issues. I seem to just run into random problems with this phone. YouTube videos for instance would not play at all, regardless of which browser I used. It doesn't seem to like most of my album art in the music player, and does not always play smoothly if playing in the background while doing other activities on the phone (web browsing for instance). The microSD slot is harder than most to get the card in and out of. The build quality is very plastic, cheap feeling. And there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market. For instance, there's a settings screen for a "scroll wheel" even though the phone doesn't even have one! Would be nice if it did, but to have settings in there for something that does not even exist on it, makes me wonder how much testing they really gave this phone before releasing.To summarize, this is a phone I really wanted to like. It's got huge potential as a portable media device and phone, but there are just too many problem areas to recommend it over other devices in the same price range.
Here in starts my multiple day review of the Nokia N96.Background: I am an IT person and like to be at the bleeding edge ofgadgetry... I currently use a Blackberry Bold 9000, and an iPhone 3g 16gb. Iwill soon be getting a google g1 and a blackberry 8900.I am no stranger to mobile technology and 3g networks....Day One is Today: 1/11/2009I charged the battery overnight and inserted an AT&T; sim card to get itrunning. The N96 walked me through a quick setup wizard for the usual dateand time, etc... We were up and running in less then 5 minutes. GREAT!...nocomplaints there.I went ahead on an exploratory mission. Having used Nokias in the past, thiswas easy for me. I set up my wireless network at home which is usually atabout 80% signal in most of our home. Setup was easy and I was online withthe N96.I started to do the obvious - I kept navigating through the icons to seewhat features were available, what ringtones were included, sample videos,etc. So far so good....I thought the speakers on the phone were a bit out ofshape...but I didnt expect home theater sound either....I setup my POP3 email account, again very easy, and began to test email,messaging, etc.... This is where my woes began. Every few minutes the phonewould ask me if I wanted to use AT&T; medianet to connect since it had lostinternet connection to the wireless network. This kept happening....forabout 30 minutes...until I finally gave up. I went and checked my router etcand there were no internet issues. I rebooted the router, just in case, andstarted to test the phone again about 15 minutes later. Again...it would geton our WIFI and keep dropping it every few minutes...this time I was about25 feet away from my router.Day 1 is over - Day 2 is tomorrow and I will update the reivew then. Pleasedo NOT Vote for me until you have read my entire review for this phone...I am disappointed thus-far.Day 2 01/12/09One note of caution before I begin day 2 of testing. This is a dual sliderphone....from the bottom up you get the keypad for numeric dialing...fromthe top down you get media controls, play/pause etc. I find that the balanceof the phone is thrown off when revealing the keypad and thus dialing is abit difficult on the go....I am a cross platform computer user but prefer to use a mac for most digitalmedia related solutions. Today I will attempt to get the N96 connected tothe mac and do some downloads. I will also be attaching the phone to mywireless network in the office to see if the problems from yesterdayre-appear. (i will update the review as I see fit during the day).I have downloaded the iSync plugin and the Multimedia transfer software from[...] So far so good...easy to install and get going.The N96 seemlesly integrates with the mac in that iPhoto launches showingthe device and images that are on it. It also allows for synchronizing allphotos onto the device....I like this so far. The Nokia Multimedia Transfersuite allows transfer of iTunes music to the device...and now that iTunes isDRM free this will be a nice feature considering the N96's 16gb of memory.The iSync plugin allows you to launch iSync on the mac and add the N96 as adevice...very easy. I can now sync all of my contacts and calendars from mymac to the N96. I dont think too much detail is required on the above twotopics...they are very easy and work well.You must remember to download the software from [...] asit is NOT included on the CD's in the box. The phone can then be connectedvia micro usb and or bluetooth. (Did I mention my gripe due to the fact thatthey chose micro usb instead of mini usb...now we need all new chargers...)My opinion of the phone seems to be improving a bit due to the connectivity,but the wireless lan still remains as a challenge...I have had to turn ofthe WLAN so that I can test and review the phone.Now on to some other features: (brief one liners)FM Radio - Excellent Feature and very clear reception in and around New YorkCity.Camera - Great 5mp Resolution and can be used as a pocket camera whencarrying a 2nd camera is not feasible. However it should be noted that evenin bright daylight the images show some noise..Allows for music and podcasts, which I love. I am a podcast listener due tolong 3-4 hour commutes.(NOTE that the Nokia Software must be running at all times when phone isconnected via usb or bluetooth)Great applications out of the box, not to mention the very refined SymbianOS which allows for great flexibility.Capacity at 16gb is amazing and allows for all of your media to be stored onthe phone.Application/Game downloads from the phone are easy...when the WLAN works.Now for the final portion of my review - Amazon Video on Demand.First things first...you have to use the Amazon Unbox player which is onlyPC compatible for the time being. The VOD service is awesome and the pricesare great. I have seen friends using this in the past but have not tried itmyself until now. The download of unbox was very quick and installation wasperfect. I was able to install the player on Vista 32 Ultimate, login to myamazon account, and download my rented copy of Hancock to watch on my newN96... My first experience with this type of service (other then itunes) hasbeen great. I have always used AMAZON For mp3's but never for Video....I ama blu-ray type and thus enjoy my home theater experience...however I nowhave an alternative to getting movies for viewing while travelling etc....Conclusion:I feel that this phone has a lot more to offer then what I am seeing as aresult of two days of usage. The overall feature set is nice but it isfrustrating to use at best. Considering the $600+ price tag I am sure thatthere are other smart phones out there that can do what the N96 does andmuch more. The iPhone 3g is a perfect example.The 3g service, while in its infancy in the US, is definitely working wellon the N96. The iPhone 3g and Blackberry Bold will drop out on occasionwhere as the N96 is still showing coverage. I think this is because Nokiahas years of experience running on 3g networks and this phone shows it.I apologize for the long review but I felt that an item like this was worthyof a detailed test run...not a quick and dirty review.Pros:CapacityFootprintStyleMedia Syncing AbilitiesCamera (5mp - a bit noisy)Cons:Bad WLAN UsageBad balance while using keypad.Over priced.Controlling the phone is somewhat difficult.Box Includes:Phone.Battery.Chargers for both AC and Car.Headset for use alone or with adapter that has media controls.A/V Cable to attach to TV, etc.USB to Micro USB Cable for Computer hookup.Documentation and software for Windows.Overall I would say this device is worthy of a great review...but I left itat 4 out of 5 because of the unsatisfactory wlan performance. I love thefact that the software Nokia provides makes it very easy to synchronizemedia and contact/calendar data from both a mac and a pc. The price tag is abit on the steep side.It is very hard to review a product with so much power in a short period oftime, thus I am sure I will be updating this review as time goes on. I amhopeful that a firmware upgrade of sorts will fix potential issues on thisdevice and that the future will be bright.Features I still need to test include GPS and Applications.....updates will be forthcoming.
If I could give this phone zero stars, I would. I just upgraded from my trusty N80 to an N96 and I cannot begin to tell you how bitterly disappointed I am with this phone.Two years on, Nokia have once again been able to take 10 steps forward and 25 steps back. Here are my findings so far...1) The speed. This phone is slow. Believe it or not, but it actually seems slower than the N80. I did not think this would be possible. Selecting my Contacts can take anywhere from 20-40 seconds to load. I'm sorry, but that is JUST unacceptable!2) Voice dialling. ABYSMAL! The N80 would work in almost any situation. The N96 demands complete background silence to even BEGIN to come close. Nokia - go back to the drawing board. This feature, which to me, a busy rep on the road (in the car) is VITAL AND IT DOES NOT WORK! When you hold down the right function button, it SOMETIMES registers it MOSTLY does not. When it does, it plays the little bleep, but then 3-4 seconds AFTER does the prompt come up on the screen telling you to speak. What kind of **bleep** is this? By the time the prompt comes up, you've already said the name, but the phone missed it! WHY NOT PLAY THE BEEPS WHEN THE PHONE IS READY TO LISTEN?!?!!? This is proof that this phone was tested by idiots or school-leavers without a clue. Or both.3) My TomTom software will not install. Well, it says it installs, but does not put an icon anywhere for me to find it. If I'm paying $1000+ for a phone that supposedly has GPS, I do NOT expect to have to pay MORE to be able to use it. Once again, Nokia, you are **bleeping** customers off.4) The headset. I want a NORMAL headset. One earpiece. Microphone close to my mouth so PEOPLE CAN HEAR ME. Not some trendy stereo thing with a microphone that is at my WAIST when I'm driving. USELESS NOKIA, USELESS!!5) DVB-H. Nokia make a big point in the marketing of this phone, but guess what? NOBODY USES IT! No-one transmits DVB-H and so a flip out cup holder would be more useful on this phone.6) Phone Switch. This is allegedly a function that allows you to transfer all you settings from your old phone to the new phone. Guess what? It doesn't work. Not at all. Nope. USELESS!7) The slide. My old N80 used to hang up the call when you closed the slide. Not so the N96. In fact, it just keeps the call going. Is this a feature you can set/adjust? I don't know. The manual doesn't say.8) Auto-rotate. This feature is as bad as it is annoying. Nokia have obviously gone with a cheap mercury gravity switch rather than use acceleration detectors, which this feature, when turned on, annoying rotates the screen if you accidently hold the phone the wrong way. Because the processor is so abysmally SLOW in this phone, it takes ages to rotate and re-orient the screen again after. Sometimes, it takes a VERY long time for it to realise you're actually holding the phone upright again. Back to the drawing board, Nokia.9) Navi-Wheel. It's in the MENU but not on the PHONE! Obviously a feature they DID test and realised it was so bad, they took it out. Well, almost.10) Speakers. Horrible and tinny. Even the N80 sounds louder and bolder with a lot more bass.11) Barely a day goes by when my phone doesn't crash, hang or reboot itself. Using a 3rd party Bluetooth headset can cause BIG problems. Nokia phones do NOT like non-Nokia bluetooth devices.12) A2DP Bluetooth stereo audio. It's listed as a feature, but I challenge ANYONE to get it to work properly. The music skips every 10 seconds like a badly scratched CD. Doesn't seem to matter what kind of device you use.I think it is utterly disgraceful that Nokia pushes this phone on to unsuspecting customers and expect them to do their testing for them. Right now, for two pins I'd send this piece of **bleep** right back and go with an Apple iPhone (which was offered to me in the first place by Optus), but foolishly, I kept my brand loyalty and stuck with Nokia."Get a firmware upgrade", I hear you say? I'd love to, but I can't! Because I bought my phone through Optus here in Australia, I cannot download a firmware update because Optus (according to Nokia's website) hasn't approved it. Upon calling Optus and going through numerous people in their Engineers Department, nobody knows anything about that! Nokia hasn't told them!Why can't they create firmware that is still upgradeable for all other intents and purposes (basic OS, built-in applications specific to the phone)? Why do THOSE (essential) features require the approval of the network operator before they can be installed? It's just ridiculous.That's like telling me that Microsoft Windows Update ought to be approved by my ISP in case it causes my modem/router to stop working. I'm afraid that argument is as wafer thin as my patience with Nokia.I've been a software developer at all levels for 25+ years, and led huge teams of developers. This is a classic example of getting kids fresh out of college working on a major project, with very VERY poor user acceptance testing or quality control.Hard-core, irrefutable evidence of that is that the menu of my N96 allows me to make changes to the setting of a Navi-Wheel, where no Navi-Wheel exists - it was pulled just before the phone went into production. I'm sorry, but that is totally inexcusable.This phone was simply not tested prior to being shipped to customers.The N96 represents the worse-case scenario in any poorly-managed development product. It's obvious there was great miscommunication between the hardware developers and the software developers (who no doubt developed the software on a virtualised N96/S60 platform), and those developers were most likely young, inexperienced programmers working on their first major project, who were no doubt pushed to the limit to reach an unreasonable deadline.I'm afraid this product bears all the hallmarks that very situation.POSTSCRIPT: I sent this list of problems to Nokia Customer Support via a form on their website - TWICE. On each occasion, I got an automated reply thanking me and that someone would get back to me in 48 hours. I never heard anything. I then posted this list on their public forums and got SUSPENDED from the site for 'upsetting other customers'.Is it any wonder Nokia experienced a 96% drop in profits last year when they treat customers like this?
Despues de haber sufrido con celulares Motorola y Blackberry, adquiri el Nokia N96, excelente telefono, facil de usar, bastante intuitivo y poderoso, el GPS sorprende y el 3.5G no que decir. el telefono en general se merece un 10, el unico punto a mencionar en contra es la duracion de su bateria, que en comparacion con otro tipo de telefonos similares es demasiado corta. El software Symbian es sorprendente y mas sorprendente es la gran cantidad de aplicaciones gratis que existen, por lo que no hay que pagar mas por tenerlas, aunque los 16GB son dificiles de llenar en especial en un telefono celular puedo decir que he disfrutado bajando videos de internet y mirandolos en el telefono, la camara de fotos y video es sorpendentemente clara y rapida en el modo de rafaja, el autofocus es bueno y la calidad de la imagen excelente.Si tuviera que comprarlo, sin duda lo haria
I purchsed the Nokia N96 from Amazon.com. I own a Nokia N93 and a Nokia N95. The Nokia N96 is the absolute best Cell Phone I've ever owned. I travel overseas on a regular basis and this phone easily switches networks seamlessly. Just pop any sim card in and go ahead. You will not have any trouble. The 5MP camera is great (could use a zenon lens). Internet browsing is really simple and powerful. All in all this is one of the best phones on the market, and at the price you can get in for on Amazon it is such a bargin. I LOVE THIS PHONE!
I really, REALLY wanted to like the Nokia N96. My Samsung i320 is getting a bit long in the tooth, and I thought this would be a perfect replacement. With the feature-list, how could it not be? Advanced multimedia capabilities? Check. Speedy web browsing? Check. WiFi? Check. High-resolution camera (for a phone)? Check. 3G compatibility? Check. 16GB of storage? Check. FM Radio?!? Check! The N96 would seemingly have it all. Unfortunately, a few glaring oversights and performance issues have left me feeling cold.The first thing that I couldn't help but notice was the Symbian OS. It's slow and dated at this point, especially when you compare it to some of the newer offerings from Apple, Google (Android) and even Microsoft (yeah, my i320, an older Windows smartphone runs rings around this, sadly). This phone is just SLOW. Accessing data is slow, the layout of the OS is SLOW (as in counterproductive, having to press several things to get to a menu option that should be accessible in two), and generally it just kind of stutters along regardless of what you throw at it. I don't know if this is the fault of poorly written code or if the thing is just way too grandiose for the hardware spec of the phone, but it basically makes using the phone a repeated trial.As far as the hardware itself goes, it looks impressive enough, nice and shiny, although the feel is a little cheaper than you'd expect a $500 device to feel. The screen is nice and the interface buttons feel pretty good (it's just a shame the phone doesn't respond a bit more quickly when you press them).Pictures are another area that are supposed to be a strong point for this phone (high resolution for a cell phone), but again, slow-down and sloppy layout hinder its usefulness. The photos look good enough, but don't expect this thing to be point and shoot ready. It's going to take a few seconds for it to become ready, and then getting your picture where you want it to be is another one of those patience-builders.Basically I think the N96 is just a case of Nokia being way too aggressive with its feature-set in order to compete with the aforementioned mobile platforms. The feature list is very impressive, but the implementation and performance is so mediocre that the phone is hard to recommend. That mediocre performance coupled with a price tag that's higher than a lot of the competition means the N96 will more than likely end up as an also-ran rather than a stand-out.
phone is good as it should be, only problem is the language display because I bought the phone in US it can not display the far east language when on line with far east country web site, and they do not have software to add any language except those are build in the phone.
This phone has few drawbacks. The keys are a little hard but I'm heavy- handed and quickly got use to the feel. The camera takes nice pictures. It is so veratile and has great applications. It works with both T-Mobile and AT&T; 3G Sim card. The connection is crisp and clear. I was torn between a Blackberry and the Nokia N96. I'm happy with my choice. If the battery life was longer and it was a touch screen it would be a 5 star phone.
I don't understand why the manufacturer want to produce such a fancy cell without enough competence. The functions of the cell are great, but the speed of the cell cannot take them.
Still browsing all the options. Great Phone, Quality and Look is most important and we get it all.
I think there's not much I can say. All I'll say is that the photos don't make justice to this phone. It's just awesome. The keyboard is nice and responsive and texting on it is just so natural. This phone has killer looks and you can also see it's been well built with a lot of attention to detail. I still haven't tried the GPS because I'm in South America and there aren't detailed maps of the city I'm in. Long story short, this phone is really incredible.
It's a very nice and stylish cellphone but it's too expensive.The best:It allows to create VPNs and access pop mail, you can download games and some other useful apps, GPS works as promised and it's easy to use, good sound quality.The bad:It's too slow, sometimes it freezes when you receive a new message or when trying to open an application, GPS drains the battery really fast; it doesn't include a usb adapter to recharge the battery. Mobile TV doesn't work in Mexico yet.
I have some problems with software it gets reset automatically some times when I try to use the camera funcition, and also the light don`t turn off automatically some times it stay on after use the phone or receive a call or make a call it makes that the battery life goes donw.It would be good if this problem of software woudl be solved asap.
I BOUGHT THE N96 PRIMARILY TO GET A GOOD CAMERA TO USE WITH A CELL PHONE.  THE CAMERA PRODUCES GOOD PHOTOS BUT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE ON A CASUAL BASIS. THE ACTUATION BUTTON NEEDS SOMETHING OTHER THAN A NORMAL FINGER AND THE DELAY TIME IS A FAT 3 SECONDS.THE PHONE CONTROLS ARE ANYTHING BUT EASY AND IT TAKES AT LEAST THREE CHANGES OF MENU BEFORE THE CONTACTS BECOME AVAILABLE AND CHOOSING THE CONTACT ICON IS HIT OR MISS SINCE THE CURSOR SKIPS AROUND LIKE IT HAS A MIND OF IT'S OWN.THIS IS MY FIRST NOKIA - PROBABLY MY LAST.
DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE ONE DAY PRICE DROP LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER MY PURCHASE WITHOUT A CREDIT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE.
Nokia N96 16 GB Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, GPS, Media Player Micro SD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)
I return the item because it did not give me all it says will do.
i seem it is a littel big and the keypad is very but very dificult to write a message , 50% recomendable .despite its 16gb memory it does not rum quycly
I've used Nokia phones for years.Of all the phones I've had this is simply the worst device I've ever used.Don't be duped by the model number. While the N95 is a wonderful phone, the N96 is badly made and unstable
I decided to stay with Verizon instead of switching to ATT to go with the Apple Iphone.I am an early adapter, I picked my omnia over the blackberry storm when both had just come out in january 09.The Omnia offered far better processing speed, immensley better use of the touch screen technology, better screen resolution, full version of MS office rather than just a viewer and the use of Internet Explorer Mobile for internet viewing as well as Opera (not able to view all internet pages).The camera was superior, the integration with outlook was phenominal and the bundled apps were perfect.Learning curve on the Keyboard was tough but manageable.Althouth I believe this product is electronically far superior to the Iphone and Storm, there are some serious issues that have not - and probably will never be resolved as Samsung is already moving on to their next "superphone" without resolution of problems with this one and Microsoft has already (at the announcement of this phone) announced the release date of Windows Mobile 7.0..Although the Iphone is slower and has less memory, it has a far more predictable speed allowing for constant rate of typing and response . . the Omnia - like anything running Windows - bogs down over the course of the day making the search and input speed vary. This is fine until you figure out how to use the keyboard to do email and are maddly typing only to find that the phone is three letters behind you...A simple reset solves the issue but . . . . you dont have to reset an Iphone every day!The battery life is no where near advertized. If I unplug the phone at 7AM it starts complaining that a recharge is necessary by 5PM . . just in time for the evening commute- heck of a time for the cell phone to run out!If you are accessing the internet or listenting to music or a movie, you get about 6 hrs before the low battery alarm starts chiming.Standby time is about 36 hrs - lot of good that does though!Apple had similar issues with their phones and worked some fixes on the early ones, Samsung has no intention.When you are on a high call day . .or watching a video on the phone, the phone gets hot . . my IR thermometer says over 103 degrees . . .Samsung says this is normal and fine . . .dont know about that as there is a Lithium Polymer battery in there and that is getting hot too.I have had two phones and they both acted the same way, this is a design issue not a particular unit.The biggest reason to think carefully about the purchase of this phone is that there are NO aftermarket apps that mix well with Mobile 6.1 and none on the horizon that are reasonable.I tried to find a calculator to figure time cards, the Blackberry progam was 9.99, the palm version was 4.99, the Iphone app was 9.99 and the windows mobile version - with no promise of compatibility with 6.1 - was 49.99.Check on Amazon, downloads.com and try to find aftermarket software for windows 6. . . .not much . . .Go to Apple Store and see how many apps are out there for Iphone . . heck, there is even an app that allows you  to use it as a flute!I like the Omnia even with it's faults but wish I had known then what I know now . . If you have no intention of doing anything other than what this phone has built into it, then it is better than an Iphone. If you want to watch movies and listen to tunes, have some odd and end games for the train ride home at night, then dont waste your time with this phone, buy an Iphone.
First, I bought this phone thinking that it would resolve the problems I was having with my treo 750...HA!  It has created more problems than solutions.  Touch screen doesn't respond as you would expect and as stated in other reviews the widgets are small and sometimes hard to manage.I was so excited to get this phone, windows mobile 6, great internet, email, on and on.  It states in the phone review that this phone is compatable with microsoft voice command.  That isn't the case, at least not for my i900. I used voice command with my treo 750 and it worked great so I just assumed it would work with the i900...it does not.  So while you can receive calls thru the blue tooth headset, you can not make a call and that is huge for me.  This is definitely a big negative.It won't send picture messages as advertised, at least not with T-mobile.  Texting and email work fine.  If the email is set up correctly thru your phone service it works great and you can either receive emails automatically, set it up to retrieve them every few hours or get them when manually requested .I guess that if I had done a better job of researching the pros and cons of purchasing a phone made in Asia, I might have waited.  You won't get any help from Samsung USA as they just give you the excuse that since the phone is European, they do not support it in the US.  As a matter of fact, you get that excuse almost anywhere you turn for support.
23 more months. I too have a Samsung Omnia. As you read the reviews everyone sings the praises of all the "features" of this phone. I bought this phone for 2 things- to take and make cell calls and to access Excel spreadsheets when I'm in the field.Load up a spread sheet and you can see 2-3 rows and 2-3 columns which is fine until the data is spread out over 4-6 rows/columns. Guess I'll keep toting my laptop.Now the calls - you want to put the call on speaker? First you have to hit the little mouse pad to remove the stupid black box, then hit the speaker button -Oh, I'm sorry did I lose the call?Did you miss a call? I don't know. First you have to pick up the phone - shake it repeatedly to switch back to portrait, enter your security code then you may see a box that tells you a phone number. Does it tell you what time or if they left a voice mail - no that would be too convenient.If you are thinking it may be time to upgrade your phone I strongly recommend you go into the providers store and get a "hands-on" experience because it may just turn out the phone doesn't do the simple things. 23 more months, sigh.
I have given this phone 8 months before finally admitting it's the worse handset I have ever owned. 8 months...of resetting, crashing, hanging, fixing .. I doubt I have enough room here to list the problems I have had, so let's think of a few of the more annoying ones, starting with WinMo 6.1 (need I say more)..the fact that syncing music is a nightmare because when you sync 4GB of music the phone "tricks" itself it is full and you can't use the camera ...the Touch Player is only marginally better than the Windows Mobile player..the touch screen sticks or scrolls uncontrollably, the phone/dial screen locks in seconds making it cumbersome to use the keypad in touchtone calls..having to unlock every few seconds, the sms and email notfications decide when they're going to work if at all..the email app  seems totally unable to sync with an MS Exchange Server...you have to constantly remove tasks in the task manager to save on battery and processing memory, it doesn't like 3rd party apps or shells...the stylus hanging from the phone without a cradle was bound to break off sometime (and it did)..the animation/rotation has a mind of its own even when you've altered the settings. The clock and alarm apps decide they're only going to work when THEY want to...the Opera app decides it can't run at all because despite what the memory status is telling you , it thinks there is no more memory left...there is much much more..I had a 2G iphone for a year before the iphone was released here and even with the restrictions I had network-wise made that a more functional handset...I did/do not want another iphone because I wanted a phone that had "more features"...but seriously, I cnanot beleive that I haven't yet launched this Omnia into a wall..
I was seduced--by the Omnia. And what a mistake that was.The good--all of the features that are cited.  Yes, they are there.The bad--virtually everything else.--I have had an iTouch in my pocket for over a year. I have had the Omnia for 2 months (I just replaced it with a Nokia.) The number of scratches on the Omnia screen compared to the iTouch is appalling.--In order to make the touch screen compatible as a phone the approach to preventing accidental entries on the screen is a killer for users.  Eight button pushes, besides the phone number to access an extension phone.link.--I tried to install Windows 7 Beta--the presence of the Omnia on my PC prevented that.--I tried to install Omnia on the Blue Tooth device in my car.  It did not work.--Mobile 6.1 makes using the Omnia like the good old days of 56K Internet.S L O  W--The need for a stylus, dangling at the side of the phone, means that the touch screen functionality is low.  Many of the operations need the stylus unless your fingers have the same dimensions it does.--Batteries are weak.--Establishing the link with my PC took hours of coaching from the cell phone provider.And doing some post-purchase research with personnel at my provider during many service calls had a consistency--when pressed, they all said the Omnia was a dog of a machine.My advice--buy something else, anything else.  In 17 years of cell phone use this is by far as bad as it gets.
I'll start by saying I'm happy with this phone, it does have good looks, works great as a PDA, but need some work as a phone. In short:Pros1. Camera (with smiley option :) )2. GPS3. Radio (with save feature)4. TouchscreenCons1. The caller id shows who is calling, but why does it has to be so small when u have this neat big screen2. I already lost my stylus, it shouldn't be that hard to find a place to put it, the HTC already solved it.Overall the hardware is great, but the software needs some work.
If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  I bought this phone after careful consideration of switching to AT&T; for the iPhone.  I decided to stay with Verizon (for the coverage and customer service), but really regret getting this phone.  It is the most frustrating phone I've ever used.  One paper, the list of features make it sound fantastic, but in practical use it is the opposite.  The scroll feature is terrible - it wants to work like the iPhone but it is a few generations behind it.  Page expansion is terrible and the tilt screen feature is junk.  There are so many problems, it would take pages to get them all down.  The phone also has an annoying habit of not ringing when calls come in.  I checked everything and the volume is turned up and it is set to ring, but it just doesn't work.  I did find a solution to this.  I simply have to remove the battery, pop it back in and restart the phone.  After that, it seems to work again.  I also have the phone "locked" so it doesn't keep turning on in my pocket.  This is another "feature" that doesn't work.  Not only does it turn on when locked, it will also dial numbers in my contact list.  After owning this phone, I will never buy another Samsung product.
well i recently purchase this cellphone.. i like it it has very good features.. but then.. just because it block itself and stop working.. i had to make a huge reesearch to find out..i discover that i had to make some updates to it.. nothing like to worry about ... great product .. i will call my problem a layer 8 .. recommended
This phone is a joke. After 2 months of using it, the phone ringer wont work at all. I now have to wait until I feel the silent vibration notification that I'm receiving a call. The touch screen feature has a built in time delay so that nothing is real time, you gotta wait for the system to respond; the result is that you end up pushing buttons over and over, which disrupts the system's operation. Amazingly the phone did not come with earphones, so I had to buy those extra. The radio does not work. The dialing feature is clumsy and does not respond properly. The menus are not intuitive. The unit also needs to be soft reset continuously, as it gives you a black screen just in being plugged into the wall. Customer support is a joke. This phone is not worth your money.
Just be patient while you learn to use it. But then you just enjoy it a lot. It's better than iphone and other smart phones because it has office applications Samsung i900 Omnia Unlocked Phone with 8 GB Memory, 5 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Windows Mobile 6.1, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Black)
It is a great phone, but it has so many features that I decided to sell it, because I prefer a simpler one and it has a disadvantage: I am a big guy with big fingers and I had to use the stylus to enter digits when dialing a call, because if I used my fingers, i dialed the wrong digit, even on the horizontal view.  It is more focused for using stylus (witch I dont like, and it does not come inside the phone, but hanging from a lanyard), or for woman with nails.It is great, but not suited for me.
The Samsung Omnia is the worst phone I have ever owned.  It is dead after only 3 months.  The software went bad and the phone won't turn on.  It doesn't lock anymore and makes random calls. Also, it won't charge.  The people at the Verizon store checked and said the battery was perfectly fine.  Then they had me talk to tech support on the phone. The tech support guy said that there are a lot of problems with the phone due to all the electronic stuff in it.  They agreed because the phone is under warranty to replace it with the LG enVtouch.  They had the new phone to me by 9:30 a.m. this morning via Fed Ex.  I couldn't even turn on the Omnia to get my contacts out of it.I would not recommend the Omnia to anyone.
So far phone works perfectly. Crashed a few times, but nothing a reset didn't fix and there was no data loss.Only issue I have with this phone is that you'll need to find a better 3rd party GPS that works without the internet since I don't have a data plan in my country for the phone, so getting the internet all the time can be expensive. If you have an unlimited data plan then you wont have anything to worry about.All features on the phone work well. The Samsung keyboard took a little getting used to since it had XT9 but once you figure out how to disable it then you'll be fine since having word completion can be a bit annoying at times.The Transcriber feature is really good, but there should have been a way to do a test(calibration) so that it can learn to recognise your handwriting since everyone's is different.The finger mouse feature is nice for one handed use, so that would come in handy for most users who multitask.I personally think this is a great phone for anyone who, like myself, loves alot of functionality and features.This is a great phone for the price and has all if not more of the features of the high-end, high priced phones in the $800-900 range.At the time I bought this I had issues with the 3rd party seller with shipping to an address and the apt number was missing and they refunded me within a few days, I would advise all users to make their purchase directly from Amazon since their service is more superior than some 3rd party buyers.Another thing to note is that I purchased the 8GB from the 3rd party at $399.99 but after being refunded I decided to go for the 16GB that was being sold by Amazon with better shipping prices (including the Free Supersaver Shipping) for only $402.I hope you do consider buying this phone since it's a great investment for any of you looking to have fun and functionality together in a phone.
I bought this phone when my upgrade for verizon was up. i did lots of research and was between the omnia and the blackberry storm. all of the reviews said that the omnia was the better pick, soo i bought it. The omnia is a phone that is meant for use with a stylus not thumbs. Windows mobile lagged quite a bit... so much to the point that i just had to cancel what i was doing to unfreeze it. the accelerometer( turning thing) can get quite annoying. I am a very big texter.... and this is not a texting phone i found myself dreading having to type on it. luckily i had a thirty day grace period and if i didnt like the phone i could return it, which i did and i bought the storm. And i love it. it is so much more user friendly, you can set almost everything to the way you like it.in conclusion.... if you are looking for a touch phone like the iphone.... skip the omnia and go straight to the storm, with its facebook and flicker built in applications the omnia doesnt compare.
Este telefono es precioso en cuanto a su diseño (muy delgado y elegante), sus funciones y programas son muy utiles. En fin me encanta su funcionalidad y diseño.El problema esta en que su caja o "housing", es muy delicada, se raya facilmente y hasta se rompe su pintura con facilidad, mas si utilizas el "stylus" amarrado a un lado del telefono, este lo golpeo constantemente y proboca este problema.Recomiendo conprarle un "case" para que no se dañe. Yo he tenido que comprar un "Housing" y un "case" para que no se me dañe el nuevo. En USA  no venden el "Housing" tuve que comprarlo en Hong Kong.
With the advent of warantless wiretapping I began to search in earnest for a way out from the major phone companies. It wasn't till these month to month services from the likes of Virgin came along that a real alternative existed. There is no greater con in my mind than the contracts that the phone companies have people sign.That said I needed a solid phone. By solid I mean one that has stable software/network and functions well. This phone fit the bill and lived up to every expectation except one, my alarm doesn't quite work properly. The phone has the basic menus and settings you would expect. It is easy to navigate and the rubbery texture is the nicest of any phone I've owned.However it's not completely flawless. Many of the other reviews are correct in that the outside display is very small and if you use your phone as your watch like I do then you may find it hard to view the time without your glasses on. The speaker phone can be a bit hard to hear sometimes and a bit tingy but the phone costs $20 the fact that it has speakerphone at that price is something I found amazing.It's construction feels cheap but durable. I fully expect this phone to last a good long time. It is thin and light too.All in all I'm delighted with this product a few minor tweaks and they will have a real gem in the next model they bring out.4 out of 5
I only know anything about this phone because my mom currently owns it, so I'll just give you her opinion on it:"I got my money's worth."Yeah, that's a pretty good summary.This phone is obviously not targeted at today's youth, mostly because most kids today don't like flip phones (I certainly don't). Still, even with that in mind, I myself found things about it that were enjoyable. For instance, the keypad is absolutely excellent for texting because of how big and spaced out the buttons are. What's more, it comes in some really neat colors (most notably brown, or as Virgin Mobile calls it, "Espresso"). Honestly, if this phone had a camera, I would have to bump it up to 4 stars.My mom's (and my) only major gripe was that it seems to text slowly. By that I mean that a sent text seems to take awhile to be sent. She texted me earlier and it took around 3 or 4 minutes for me to get it. I don't know if that's the phone's problem or not, but whatever. I'm just saying. :DOverall, this is a 3-star phone. If it had a camera, I'd boost it up to 4, but what are ya gonna do?
This phone is meant for users who have no interest in all the bells and whistles.  It has no camera, no library of apps, no massive CPU that does as much as your laptop.  It's a bare-bones cell phone for those who want to call or text.  What it DOES have is large buttons for ham-handed dialers like me, a high contrast screen, clear sound, and durable battery life.This is a good first phone for those who have resisted cell phones up to this point: your gramma, your Luddite friend, me.  It's also good for kids, since there is only so much they can do, and they can't use up your calling plan on a single trip to the mall.  Because it's prepaid, I also recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to be saddled with a service plan, or anyone who doesn't want to share their credit information with outsiders.This is not a sexy phone, and will not impress the hip kids on your block.  But it's useful, cheap, durable, and handy.  If those are the only virtues you really need, this may very well be your phone.
The phone itself is a great deal for only 19.99 and I am very pleased with the service.  My big problem with the phone is related to the battery.  Right out of the package I began experiencing battery problems.  I fully charged the phone and activated it.  I called myself to test the phone and after 1 ring the phone shut down with the message "Battery low, phone powering down".  The phone was fully charged at the time.  It seems to happen every time I receive an incoming event (incoming call, incoming text, etc).  This is a huge frustration as all of my local Virgin retailers are sold out of this phone.  I guess the saying 'you get what you pay for' applies here.  If not for the battery problem this phone would have at least 4 stars.
I bought this phone @ radio shack for $21 and i thought that was a great price because it was my first phone. my intention was to use it mostly for texting and make a calls every now and then. this phone is superb if you text sometimes and mainly use it for calling. but if text a lot this phone will be horrible for you! every time you're in the middle of texting and when there's an incoming text, the text you would be working on would be automatically sent to draft. every time.there's no stopping it and it gets SO ANNOYING!
It's a tough review to start... So I'll just say that I'm now leaving my camera and laptop at home when I travel for business.  I've had this phone for about 6 months.  The phone itself works well on the AT&T; network in central New York.  I have no complaints about the receive or transmit sound quality or the ability to maintain call quality in areas of poor reception.  The 5 MP camera is very competent and good enough for all uses except very high quality portraits and very close macro work. 16 GB internal and 8GB card capacity mean plenty of room for audio or video or work documents or photos.  Windows pro 6.1 means lots of available applications for everything from photo editing to voice command.  I have partnerships with 2 computers and had a problem syncing contacts on one of them but it was solved by a re-installation of Activesync.  Internet and wi-fi functions are great and trouble free.  GPS is very impressive and has gotten me back home a couple of times.  Great integration with Google Earth.  Bluetooth has worked with everything from my laptop, car, headset and Garmin Zumo. Battery will last about 12 hours of hard use, 24 of light use, and 36 if it just sits.  I would buy this phone again.  If it weren't so expensive I'd have another as a back-up.
Samsung i900, is it or is it not a great phone? That is a good question allot of people might ask themselves. Me personally I think its a neat phone, great phone I think it falls just short of that. There are allot of wonderful points about this phone, Small, Thin, Stylish, 5MP camera, Flash, Space, EXTRA SPACE (if you really needed more), WiFi, FM Radio, Speaker Phone, Great Color, even the appz you can get for it are great. Is it worth 600+ bucks, well maybe depending on how you look at it. I mean its a phone that is UNLOCKED, meaning you can take it to any provider, AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint, and even over on the other side of the world. Since this version of the phone is an Unlocked International Phone. So yeah in my opinion yes its worth the money. Any other unlocked phone of this type would run you about the same in costs. I have a few things I dont understand about it yet but hey its worth learning about. I hope this review helps some people out making a choice on if they should get this phone or not so please the biggest thing I can say is read the reviews before you purchase a phone.......
The display with touch sensitivity on this phone is nice, but doesn't match that of the iphone or htc's g1 (or similar phones on this standard).  The camera/video recorder is above average and beats htc phones handsdown on color hue.  Only the newest iphone (3g S) records videos, the first two iphones do not.Overall, this is a nice phone with a beautiful display, good camera (great media uses in general including radio, mp3 and video player), touch display, and nice user interface.In my humble opinion, if you want a phone with better flexibility in software options (easy software store, lots of choices), go with the iphone or an android based phone. :)
I had a Samsung i900 Omnia for about 2 months. Then it bricked when i tried to hard reset it. It became useless and since it was bought on internet and officially not a US version i sent it to Korea for repair. Another month and a half-no news. So no more Samsung for me.Then i did the research and bought myself a SE Experia X1. What a difference folks. The screen is more responsive, extra keyboard, much better feel and finish, hard ware buttons glow in the dark, better resolution of the screen, doesn`t freeze up as much, better sound, ...and it`s made by HTC.So folks do yourselves a favor, get SE or HTC and be happy. There will be no more wasted time and money on rubbish like Samsung or Nokia. Nokia used to be good 5 years ago. No they simply fail to keep up with technology, and they are completely not user friendly. My N82 died on me after less than a year of use. I re-installed a firmware, it didn`t work out. What a waste.That was just my humble opinion. Please no offense or aggravation taken. Cheers, Val.
I hate this phone. There. I said it. On paper, the OMNIA is a wonderful piece of technology, but I have to think that it was designed BTI - Before The iPhone. The iPhone is in its 4rd generation now, and still we have these Window's Mobile phones that simply don't measure up. That's also true of the Blackberry I have to use for work. When will these companies realize that the cell phone paradigm has shifted, radically, since the launch of the iPhone?The OMNIA is a smidge smaller and a tad thicker than the iPhone. It has a nice touch screen, but it requires the use of a stylus which for the life of me looks like an eyelash brush. The interface is Windows Mobile 6.1, an OS I'm familiar with, having had two previous WM phones. Even so, I had a devil of a time getting the most basic things set up to my liking. I freely admit that my trouble and frustration comes in part from seeing how easy things are on the iPhone.The feature set on the OMNIA is nice, including Wifi, a nice touch screen as I mentioned, Bluetooth of course, and the ability to play back movies. It also has a very nice 5.0 Megapixel camera, a microSD slot, GPS, and the whole Windows Mobile Office suite. But again, how important are any of these features if they're too arcane to get to or use? Amazon is currently selling this phone for $530 without a service plan. Verizon sells it with a 2-year contract for $200. AT&T; sells the top-of-the-line iPhone for the same price with a 2-year contract. `nuff said.
So far phone works perfectly. Crashed a few times, but nothing a reset didn't fix and there was no data loss.Only issue I have with this phone is that you'll need to find a better 3rd party GPS that works without the internet since I don't have a data plan in my country for the phone, so getting the internet all the time can be expensive. If you have an unlimited data plan then you wont have anything to worry about.All features on the phone work well. The Samsung keyboard took a little getting used to since it had XT9 but once you figure out how to disable it then you'll be fine since having word completion can be a bit annoying at times.The Transcriber feature is really good, but there should have been a way to do a test(calibration) so that it can learn to recognise your handwriting since everyone's is different.The finger mouse feature is nice for one handed use, so that would come in handy for most users who multitask.I personally think this is a great phone for anyone who, like myself, loves alot of functionality and features.This is a great phone for the price and has all if not more of the features of the high-end, high priced phones in the $800-900 range.At the time I bought this I had issues with the 3rd party seller with shipping to an address and the apt number was missing and they refunded me within a few days, I would advise all users to make their purchase directly from Amazon since their service is more superior than some 3rd party buyers.Another thing to note is that I purchased the 8GB from the 3rd party at $399.99 but after being refunded I decided to go for the 16GB that was being sold by Amazon with better shipping prices (including the Free Supersaver Shipping) for only $402.I hope you do consider buying this phone since it's a great investment for any of you looking to have fun and functionality together in a phone.
Well I was lookin for a Windows Mobile phone, this is a good option, it is slim, not as heavy or big as others in the market, but I was hoping to get a faster phone when opening aplications.  The camera has a good flash, 5 megas with autofocus, smile shutter, good for what I need in that. The touch screen it's as sensitive with your finger like other phone I had before, so sometimes I have to get the stylus to better performance. Like other window mobile devices, you should close other programs not using to prevent slow performance. But is a nice option IF your like windows mobile phones. BE AWARE with 3G bands, because this phone just have one band.!!
if you compare the omnia with other pocket pc you will find the omnia is great in a lot of aspects the cpu is great , the price is affordable ( and don`t forget it`s unlocked  i even use it now in Middle East and it works just fine)
I love gadgets and I'm a big fan of Samsung, so I figured this would be a perfect match. A friend of mine had an iPhone and it was very cool, but I'm no fan of Apple so I went for the Samsung. I bought my Omnia about six months ago and gave it a good try for about a month. I really, really wanted it to be great. But after those four weeks, I was so frustrated that I put it away and took up my old Samsung slider phone. Then a month ago, I thought I'd try the Omnia again. After all, it wasn't cheap ... and it looks so cool! But I hate to say it ... it's junk! There isn't enough space for all my complaints. It started with the battery - I need a knife or a coin or something to lever it out. The touchscreen is just dreadful. You never know what is going to happen. Sometimes you have to press very hard, sometimes hardly at all. Some of the symbols you need to press, like the volume control, are so small and so close together that there is really no way to do it without using the stylus. The screen goes from vertical to horizontal orientation with very little movement (i.e., when you don't want it to). The finger-sweep function may scroll the screen or it may launch an application - you never know! Some menus are closed by clicking a tiny x at the top of the screen, others you need to press an Exit button at the bottom. I can't discern any reason why there isn't a common way of closing applications or screens. You have to drag the widgets out of the sidebar to use them, then put them back. The navigation bar at the bottom of the Opera browser window is sometimes covered by the tool bar from the Windows Mobile interface. I cannot figure out how to adjust the number of times the phone rings before it transfers to voice mail (it switches after three rings, which means I miss most calls as I struggle to get it out of my pocket in time). Maybe there are solutions for all of these issues but you will not find any in the instruction manual and I have so far been unable to find them in the various Omnia forums out there. Anyway, why should I have to spend hours trying to figure out how this thing works??? It hurts me to say it, but the iPhone is way, way better. This was one of the biggest disappointments ever!
This phone is a joke.  After 2 months of using it, the phone ringer wont work at all.  I now have to wait until I feel the silent vibration notification that I'm receiving a call.  The touch screen feature has a built in time delay so that nothing is real time, you gotta wait for the system to respond; the result is that you end up pushing buttons over and over, which disrupts the system's operation.  Amazingly the phone did not come with earphones, so I had to buy those extra.  The radio does not work.  The dialing feature is clumsy and does not respond properly.  The menus are not intuitive.  The unit also needs to be soft reset continuously, as it gives you a black screen just in being plugged into the wall.  Customer support is a joke.  This phone is not worth your money.
I have this phone for a week. I am so confused. It's very hard to operate this phone. The battery doesn't even last while the phone is locked and in my bag at work. I can make 1 or 2 phone calls on a full charge. That's it!! I have researched this phone and wish that I did not get it. I am going to return it.
I just got my new International version Omnia 16 GB version and the surprise is it is a French Model. The owners manual is in French so i downloaded a Uk version in English so i can read about how to use my new phone. instead of Omnia the phone is called Samsung Player Addict. But it's an Omnia, but the default files and menus are all in French as well as the favorites programmed into the IE Web browser. I have to set up the settings to work on TMobile, but i have the wifi working and its great so far as is the regular phone part. my verdict .... still deciding
This phone has many freezes with frequency and have problem of compatibility with software Windows Mobile 6.1.

The G900 is a worthy successor to the Sony Ericsson P1i. It fact, its is every bit as good and even better than the Sony Ericsson Walkman Flagship W960i.Though it uses the same Symbian UIQ3 platform as the P1i, the user interface has been polished with the addition of easy to use home screen panels. You can add panels for different applications like messaging, music player, application shortcuts, tasks and calender. These home screen panels make the phone much more user friendly than the P1i and the W960i.The G900 also has a much improved media manager for your pictures, movies, and music files. The media application would be familiar to people who use the PSP and the PS3. It has the feel and looks like the media crossbar that Sony uses in its Playstation line.The G900 also has a 5 mega pixel camera with a picture light. The light can also be used as a bright flash light which can be handy in an emergency situation. The pictures taken by the camera can be a little washed out and lack the vibrant colors of some better 5MP camera phones like the Nokia N95.It has a traditional candy bar form factor. It is much slimmer and smaller than the P1i and the W960i. This makes it a lot more user friendly and more pocketable. Its size combined with its easy to use user interface makes this phone attractive to people who want smart phone capabilities but don't want to deal more complex to use phones. Simply put, this is the best smart phone that Sony Ericsson has made to date...until the Xperia X1 is released at least. :)Pros:-Great touchscreen. The screen is bright and vivid.-Very slim and light for a smart phone with so many features.-Easier to use UIQ3 interface with the addition of panels-Excellent media manager and music player-Five megapixel camera with innovative touch focus-Excellent connectivity with bluetooth and WIFI and GPRSCons:-Does not support EDGE or US 3G networks (Supports UMTS 2100 for European 3G)-Though it takes 5MP pictures, the pictures are not as vibrant as other 5MP camera phones-Lack of built in GPS-Base package does not have any memory stick included-The Opera web browser could be better and does not support flash
Bad phone, not recommendedIs an international version and only has 3 languages, English, Chinese and Filipinothe screen is very small, is difficult to see the characters or the menu, to configure it is a headache,  you need a magnifying glass.no Mini-USBUnlocked Cell Phone  no strong feeling,  not pay more than USD100
I got the W980 after my trusty W810i bit the dust. And why did it die? Because Sony insists on using their crappy 12-copper pin input/output/power port. After 2 years of being in a pocket, this port gets tarnished and requires daily cleaning. Or in my case the copper pin fell off and I could no longer charge my phone! But at least Sony made these copper pins much Larger in the W980. Cleaning these suckers should be a breeze! The W980 is great for those like me who need both a phone and a mp3 player. I don't need it for extensive texting or web browsing. And the fixed 8GB memory (no SD card here) is plenty since I don't watch videos on a 2-inch screen or need to store my entire collection of mp3s. It sounds/looks great and is a bit expensive for what you get. No new ground being broken here (looks like they saved that for the xperion).
I bought this phone on a whim.  I normally like to go and look at a phone before I buy.  But this time I relied entirely on other peoples comments and online research.  I'm NOT disappointed!  Overall the phone looks good.  It has very simple clean lines and appearance.  If you text...the buttons are small...but spread apart, so they're still seemingly user friendly if you have big thumbs like me.  There's nothing in the way of a "normal" ringtone so you'll have to buy one or something.  Navigating through the menus can be tricky.  Items aren't always where you might expect to find them, but the book was helpful for me in that regard.  The software can be slow at times.  it could use the cellphone equivalent to "more RAM." The battery seems great.  I've sent hundreds of texts, listened to hours of music, and spent a couple hours talking all on one charge.  with moderate use i average a charging every 3 days or so.  I had some compatibility issues with the ATT network, I "Googled" the problem and was directed to the Sony Ericsson site where they fixed the phone via text message in less than 30 seconds!  amazing if you ask me. It comes with everything you need to put your favorite music into it.  Which sounds excellent with the headphones sony provides.  I like being able to play all my music without opening the phone.  everything can be done on outer display(you can lock the outer display so music doesn't start playing randomly from your pocket) The screen, and photo's you take and look at on it, is crystal clear and sharp.  the camera takes very good photos for a cell phone.  better than my digital camera(which i admit is a little outdated) bottom line...Is it worth the money??  to ME...YES! It's up to you how much value you place on a music playing camera that you can call your friends on.  It's not the BEST at any one of those...but it does them all VERY well in a single devise.
Just what i was looking for.Great sound, 8Gb internal memory!, 3.2 camera, built-in FM transmitter, lots of accesories.I think this cell phone is only for music lovers.Fast Delivery.Overall, ****
the W980 is well made and sounds excellent - BUT:while listening better dont move, since interference may spoil your listening significantly, so for use on a train or in car skip it for a non-mobile phone mp3 player.you will be become screaming mad trying to organize your music/audiobooks on it. the media manager pro software is absurdly slow (no alternative here) and documentation of common issues (ie how to make a playlist for the w980 on the pc, or how treat audiobooks) is nonexistent.so it is a mixed bag this top walkman phone.
Overall gud product from Sony. Audio quality is superb, easy to use interface. Gud buy considering the 8gb flash memory. The only glitch is you might not like the look when flipopen for the first time.....for the fone that boasts of so much features, and a clean crisper outside,when you flip open the phone it somehow doesnt compliments the look.Still wud recommend it as a gud buy for the value n the features.
i would like to know if this phone records calls like the walk man phone and the w760a phone doescan anybody who bought this phone please let me know, how to tell is make a call and when the call is answered go to options and record she b listed last, and it should allow u 2 record the call and save
It was a great deal! The cost-benefit is worthy. I'm a Palm user for the past 10 year and I moved to Balckberry but nothing compares to have all the features (office pack, PDF, video call, and more) back. The only thing I'm not happy with is the battery life. It is too short. I have to recharge on a daily basis.
1. MicroSD slot means you have virtually unlimited space for files, and it is trivial to exchange files with any computer, not just one on which you have installed a files app.2. Speed and multitasking means you can do things like listen to music, edit documents and send emails simultaneously and at the same time.3. Superb Office document management capabilities. 'Nuff said.4. Higher-res screen means documents like Excel spreadsheets are much more practical, but even Word or PDF files are much more readable and easier on the eyes.5. Windows home page (I turned off FLO) means you can see all tasks, calendar, to-dos, etc. on one home page6. Citrix client compatibility meant for me I could control my office desktop from my phone.7. Ah, that lovely keyboard. Besides being surer and faster, when you pull it out to type, you can still see the entire screen for surfing. This provides a much larger effective screen for anything which involves text.Downside: Can't make it iFartI've owned both. I changed carriers and currently have an iPhone.
This was my first pocket pc phone I ve owned, and it only took me a few hours to get the hang of this phone, its really easy to use. The Touch Flo3D screen makes it fun to use, and the full 5 row keyboard is really good as well. The only downside to this phone is the battery. After a few sessions of youtube or the internet and text messaging alot, I usually have to charge my phone twice a day. But this phone beats the G1 easily, and with a upgraded battery, its the way to go.
Superb business oriented Windows Mobile smart phone.  The HTC Touch Pro 2 is offered by all the major US carriers at this time. Some like Sprint have retained its international features so you can use CDMA and international protocols.  I've been using cellular phones since the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS)was introduced in 1983. With the enhancements provided by HTC atop Microsoft Windows Mobile v6.1, the Touch Pro 2 is an absolute delight for the businessperson. With one glaring exception, it can be used as a substitute for a laptop computer in many circumstances. The exception is the lack of mouse support in the Qualcomm Bluetooth stack. Bluetooth keyboards work fine, but mouse functions are not supported. In my eyes, this represents a major oversight which I hope will be rectified in future ROM revisions.  Aside from that, the HTC Touch Pro 2 represents the state of the art in smart phones. It has a gorgeous 3.6-inch TFT-LCD touch-sensitive screen with 480 X 800 WVGA resolution. The screen also tilts which makes airline tray or restaurant table movie watching, RSS feed reading and (where possible) web browsing a pleasure. It also makes working on business documents in Microsoft Mobile Office, DataViz or SoftMaker products a pleasure. There is a five-row, slide-out QWERTY keyboard that is the best I've ever had on a cell phone. While you can't touch type, you can do a pretty good job of two finger pecking.  Some carriers, again like Sprint, offer the HTC Touch Pro 2 with a standard 3.5mm audio jack. What a pleasure to finally just be able to plug in a pair of ordinary headphones!The HTC Touch Pro 2 accepts microSDHC cards up to 16 GB. (I presume 32 GB is also supported.) You can put plenty of music and video on the card, have great audio and a truly luscious screen. I am really amazed at just how well movies look on that screen. You'll be best served with a third party media viewer like the CorePlayer.  The design is very finger-friendly. Some functions, such as browsing with the included Opera browser are adapted to finger swipes for navigating on and between pages and sites. My personal preference, however, remains the stylus. The onscreen keyboard is the best I've ever worked on and works especially well with fingertips. You don't have to be dead-on to type a character. The logic does a very good job of figuring out what character you intended to strike.  The CPU is the same Qualcomm MSM7200A 528 MHz used in the Touch Pro and other HTC cell phones. It gets the job done, but it is not the fastest processor on the block. The allotment of 512 MB ROM and 288 MB RAM is reasonably generous, but like money, you can never have enough.  The Touch Pro 2 measures 4.57 X 2.33 X 0.66 inches and weighs 6.3 ounces. I carry it in a shirt pocket and don't find the size or weight to be a problem.  Bluetooth and WiFi work just fine on this unit.  Some carriers, again Sprint is an example, keep the GPS enabled. While Sprint has an optional paid navigation program, I use my Touch Pro 2 GPS with Google Maps and Microsoft Bing. I no longer use a separate GPS unit this is all I need.  Output volume is excellent and there is a novel conference phone feature built in. Put the unit on its face and the back microphones are started. Fidelity and noise cancellation are pretty good. It is a nice feature for those who use it.  The 3.2 megapixel camera is nothing spectacular. There are no hardware buttons for the camera and it is both slower and more inconvenient to use than one triggered by a hardware button.  There is TV output through an optional cable and a bunch of other features that some may find useful.  A 1500 mAh battery is standard and it will last through a day of strenuous usage. But overall, plan on charging this unit every day or two if you make much use of it. Buying a second battery or an external battery is a wise idea.  Overall, I have found performance to be excellent in every regard. Teamed with a Bluetooth keyboard, I can often leave my laptop at home. Web browsing is a delight with Opera, Skyfire or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Memory problems have been non-existent for me no matter how many applications I've launched. (I do continue the well established habit of invoking the Task Manager from time to time.) The reset button is under the back cover which is, in my opinion, a design error - but I haven't had to use it much. When I need it, though, it is something of a pain. You have to remove the stylus first, then the back cover. It is not a pleasant task under any circumstance, especially when the lighting is low.  Do I like the HTC Touch Pro 2? You bet. I think it is the best smart phone I've ever used. It gets closer to the grail of the highly portable computer that has been envisioned since the 1970s. Yes, the pipeline is already filling with devices running the much faster AMD Snapdragon processor. HTC is about to launch a unit with Snapdragon and a 4.3 inch screen. I suspect that the next model of the Touch Pro will be launching little more than a year from now and I suspect I will be straining on my leash to get one.  In the meantime, the HTC Touch Pro 2 is a dream to work with. If they fix the Bluetooth stack to work with a mouse or if a third party follows through with its promise to release a replacement stack, the HTC Touch Pro 2 will truly be a hand-sized laptop replacement. It is quite the marvel and a delight to use.Jerry
This is a great phone and comes with all accesories the original T7272 (unlocked) came with, the battery is a bit short for heavy users if your a heavy user i recomend that you purchase a bigger battery
This phone is almost perfect for a professional. The battery is the main disadvantage, as I need to charge it daily (even two times a day, sometimes). Also, I miss the headphone jack (it has only an USB port for charging, sync and also to use the included, but proprietary headphone).Besides that, the interface is very cool and we have all a professional needs on a mobile computer:* Outlook e-mail, with full support for Office attachments (it as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint)* Complete integration with Exchange, including security policies* SD card encryption support* Nice integration between contacts, SMS, and e-mail* Support for Microsoft Communicator (Enterprise Messenger software), and SkypeI almost forgot: It lacks a GPS software, but it has an integrated GPS. After installing Garmin XT, you can have a nice complete GPS also.
I got the HTC touch pro from Sprint and I am definitely not happy with it. Not sure if its becos its running Windows Mobile, but its just not very intuitive and user friendly. There is no way to turn it on from the face of the phone and you need to do it by pressing it on the top which is not very convenient. The apps run very slowly and the touch screen operation is sometimes very frustrating - it does things that you didnt intend to do. The bluetooth operation is very flaky. I have also had problems of the phone locking up a few times and you have to reboot it. Do not expect the touch to be intuitive and precise like the iPhone, you will be disappointed. The most frustrating thing is, its very slow in responding when you are searching for a contact or typing something to find someone.  I have also noticed that there is a delay while making or receiving a call - like you have to give it a few secs to respond. So, overall I am very unhappy with this device considering the price.

I had envy when the Tilt was announced, and bought one this summer when it reached an affordable price on ebay. Then, two months after carrying the tilt around, a work colleague asked me if I wanted to buy his HTC Touch Pro for $150. He is a very knowledgeable cell phone person, so I accepted the offer, without realizing just how good this deal was until I got it home and started using it! Wow! This gem does everything an IT professional would ever want to do! I recharge it every other day, and I keep USB recharging accessories at work and at home, so if I ever get caught in a conversation or WiFi session that lasts more than two hours, then I simply plug it in at the next stop. Mine has the Raphael RRE 6.5 ROM loaded, and it is fast and stable. No regrets at all on this purchase.I will keep this one until the HTC Touch Pro 2 (second generation Tilt) gets down to an affordable price. I love this phone.Woody
For this Treo veteran -- dating back to when it was still Handspring -- the Treo Pro is good and bad news.Good: Slick, elegant, light, compact, great touchscreen, every bell and whistle modern smartphones should have. Keyboard smaller than previous Treos, but still easy for my large fingers to use. Retains the unique Palm switch to silence ringtones. (I find it a mystery why other cellphones ignore this simple convenience. Of course, switches have only been around since electricity was invented, so they may not have noticed yet). A nit to pick: The stylus has inexplicably moved to the lower-right corner, where it's hard to see and remove. Really stupid. Fortunately, with the good touchscreen, it's not needed much.Bad: Windows Mobile 6.1 is a shock. "Microsoft Modern" -- clumsy, slow, layers and layers of menus, confusing, inscrutable, given to freezes, crashes. Worse than even Blackberry, which is compatible only with itself and almost as clumsy as Windows. Unfortunately, these two are currently the only choices. (Did I mention that I don't care for either?)But Help Is On The Way! Spb Mobile Shell 2.1 is a software user interface that's what Palm would be had they continued the creative energy that produced its original operating system. Mobile Shell is astoundingly capable, flexible, and fun. (Did I mention that I love it?) A 15-day trial of Mobile Shell can be downloaded at handango.com. Purchase is $[...]. This is the greatest value for the dollar since sliced bread. For those who haven't visited handango, they've got lots of other cool Treo software.Summary: The Treo Pro with Spb Mobile Shell 2.1 is a 5-star almost-ideal-smartphone. With Windows Mobile 6.1, I'd be pressed to give it a 3. Wonderful hardware; disasterous software. BUT....(see above)
I was switched from a Blackberry to the Palm Treo Pro by my organization, so I'm a pretty captive audience.  Two weeks in, I'm on my third one (replaced twice).  The inconsistency in quality is very frustrating.  I suspect that many of the issues are Windows Mobile, but I have to rate the entire package - they don't offer it with anything else.Pros:- Form factor is nice.- WiFi works well (but drains battery).Cons:- Battery life - will not last longer than a day if you do anything with the phone.- Quality - As I said, I'm on my third one.  Different problems each time.- Finish - shiny black should look cool, but it picks up fingerprints, dirt, etc and looks like you ate lunch off of it after 15 minutes.  (can't blame this just on me - 50 other people using this model have the same result).  I purchased a case that reduced this.- Windows Mobile - It is beyond me that this still is still being released as a phone os.  I used it 4 years ago and it was very painful.  I mistakenly hoped that 4 years of customer feedback and testing would have improved it.  Nothing has changed!- Now power off or soft reset - I have to remove my batter once a day to reset the phone back to working condition.Annoyances:When you're on a call the "text message", "missed call" and "voice mail" notifications go off at full volume in your ear.  Ouch.Windows Mobile "ok" key is sometimes "ok" and sometimes "cancel" and sometimes "save" and it's not really obvious.You cannot reprogram many of the external buttons by default (I'm not sure if a third party app will do it).  Other windows mobile phones have a key for voice dialing, or allow you to hold down the Send key to activate it.  This one has not such key, and you can't program the Send+Hold, or the Camera or the WiFi keys, so no obvious solution there.History:The first phone I got wouldn't hang up.  Not with the End button, not with the soft button, nothing!  I had to take out the battery to hang up.The second one started "losing" contacts randomly, even though the Phone History would still have information showing.  Eventually the phone froze up.  After removing the battery, the phone radio was out, so I could no longer place calls.  (I couldn't open Contacts or other things).  Could be windows mobile memory corruption. I had to remove my Blackberry battery twice in two years.  I've done it 18 times with this phone in two weeks.  And even that won't fix the problems.The third phone I now have is having random software issues.  Setting will not stay and it will not allow me to install any software.  It says things install (simple things like a ebook reader), but they don't show up (but memory has been taken up).Boy, oh boy... I miss the Blackberry (8830) trackball.  That's the only way to navigate!!
This was a great buy and worth the money but it freezes and the battery cover is not very easy to remove!  My right thumb went black and blue trying to remove it.
I have had this phone for not more than 5 moths, Mostly happy with it, besides the sluggishness of it.I have read, prior my purchase, several customers complaining about tiny cracks developing on the front of the phone. I Have been a Palm user for more than ten years so I guessed I could trust Palm to service the phone in case this happened.Well... Palm is a new and different company than what it was... They made me waste an hour on chat, and several calls on the phone, plus they ask for the proof of purchase which I send.After all this (a week of hard work) they told me that they don't think this is a common think (you can check online to see how common it is) and they ask me $200 plus shipping (and more time on the phone) for a repair of this phone that you can now find at less than $350. The guy I was taking about was may be in India, and he refused to let me talk to his supervisor, he finally did which of course didn't help.I Dont recommend a Palm product to anyone, I guess one more Iphone user...I now understand the reason they have lost millions of customers.Please read all the forums before you buy this phone and look for the tiny cracks explained there.Don't trust Palm, I don't anymore.Thank you very much Palm.
By far the worst phone I have ever owned. It freezes up and must be reset about every other day.  I'm on my second one.  Palm sent me a new one after several hours of level 3 palm support.  The touch screen works sometimes, sometimes it doesn't.  To many other problems to go into.  Don't buy this phone, you will be sorry!
This WM6.1 Pocket PC is not only very well put together, but it has some extra little features that I have personally been thinking of for years. It has the typical WM6.1 Professional OS and accompanying programs, but there are little settings here and there that make it a little or a lot more handy for some of us veteran WM users who have been observing the slow crawl of advancement that Microsoft has made in updated OS's. And some if not a lot of this may be thanks to the manufacturer (Palm, c/o HTC), but let me give a couple examples.Normally, you have to tap and hold for the context menu of a highlighted item. And if you have an extra program, such as Spb Pocket Plus, you may be able to set a hardware button to do this for you, something handy I've done in the past. But the Treo Pro allows you to press and hold the Palm button (the center select button of the 5-way navigation button), and the context menu comes up. And, even though I relied upon Spb for the Close button, it's nice to see this device (and other HTC devices now) have the Close button option embedded. Another example is you can optionally respond to Ignored calls with an automated text message, something that Spb Phone Suite has if you buy it and install it, but the device comes with this feature preloaded. And there are a few others.Yes, there are a few drawbacks, such as the glossy appearance easily getting fingerprints, and the odd fact that there is no real device-off status apart from removing the battery. The Power button turns the screen off with one press, and turns the phone on or off of flight mode when pressing and holding. To access the Reset button, you have to remove the stylus, and it is accessible right where the head of the stylus rests, WITHOUT having to remove the back battery panel (unlike some have said is necessary to access it).As for the screen, some say it is a little washed out, like too whitish. But two things...first, this has decent battery life even if you turn the screen to full brightness (I have push email and two other email accounts checking email all day, along with text, light Internet browsing, and some phone calling), which makes me have to charge it every night, but I'm used to that. So full brightness is a good option. But MOREOVER, the screen is of a technology such that in the glaring sunlight, it has a special effect where you can read everything still! That is a major plus that I will take any day. And speaking of the screen, some don't like it being flush with the rest of the device, but I like that it is that newer type of screen that is more resilient and scratch resistant, and it is just as touch sensitive as the previous types of touch screens.As far as batteries go, I have an extended life battery (there are 2 types out there I know of), and I can go 2 days on a single charge. (The battery I got has the same gloss and matching appearance, but there's another with a non-gloss battery door...I just wanted my door to match the rest of the phone). Yes, extended batteries make the phone more bulky, so get it if you don't mind that. I personally like the phone a little bigger. It makes it feel more firm and solid to me.Every once in a while, a few of the main function buttons will not work on a Bluetooth phone call, but this has only happened twice to me. Again, I know most handheld devices are a little quirky, so I'll take this any day to the other quirky WM devices I've had with features not quite as good as this one.Hope this review helps...
I am a surgeon that used the windows pda for reference.  I also have handbase databases for billing.  My three year old dell was becoming unreliable.  i purchased this phone with trepidation as my girlfriend had lots of problems with her treo.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  I tried the Nokia E71.  Voice quality was poor and often I had to use  a different phone as reception was too poor.  Their was a lot of other problems with the Nokia and I was surprised how much the phone sucked as the reviews were quite impressive for the phone.  I tried contacting Amazon to return the phone but they didn't get back to me and I missed the 30 day deadline.The Treo Pro was a pleasant surprise.  Great sound quality- it actually works well as a phone.  Voice recognition works great- much better than the Nokia- which was useless. Speakerphone works great and quality is same. WM 6.1 is a nice system.  Have really liked it so far. The only thing screwy is Tasks.  I won't show just active tasks.  It also shows future tasks which really makes it useless if you want something to pop up in a month to remind you to give the heartworm to the dog. WM 5.0 did it right.  Why they went backwards on this is beyond me.  I guess it IS windows. Thankfully,  buy a third party application and its fixed.Screen is nice and readable for the size.  I like the keyboard on the Nokia better, but this one is still ok plus i can use a stylus if I get tired of typing.It works well with 3G.  Seems almost as fast as my dsl at home.  Can plug the phone into my computer and use it as a wireless modem.  The camera does not have a flash and is not as many MP as the Nokia, but the picture is actually better.The phone is very intuitive.  I wanted a phone and  pda combo that was reliable and this is it.Thought about an iphone.  But this keyboard is easier to enter data than the screen on the iphone and I can do more with it.  I might get an ipod touch for the apps and music but for a phone, this is more useful.  At least for me.Battery life 2 days.  I charge nightly.  I am not a heavy user of internet at work.  I have it set up to conserve battery life. I keep a sync cable in my bag and can charge it with any usb port (nice).  This phone has been a useful tool and I am really liking it.Cons.  hard to read pdf articles on the phone.  The screen is small but this is not a con, it is jsut the way it is- can't have a giant screen on a compact phone.  That said- NICE resolution on the screen.  keyboard not as nice as nokia (that is the only thing better on the nokia).  that is about it.I am keeping this one.
Fast, slim, GPS work perfect, I add it a 32 GB micro SD kingston memory and attached via BlueTooth to my car stereo and I have a lot of Music to hear while driving, I prefer this than an Iphone, Also I think it's better than "Treo PRE" (not windows OS)--- If you don't want to have an Internet contract, there are multiple programs that download Maps from Google and you can navigate offline ;) ------ Reception everywhere, and easy to manage contacts with Outlook, sync by bluetooth
I've been using Treos since they first came out (I think I started with a Treo 180) and so I have to admit that switching to a Windows Mobile device left me feeling uneasy.  But I couldn't wait for the Pre as my 680 started crapping out on me and I didn't want a 700/750/800.  However, since I have been syncing my Palm with Outlook for years, the data transfer was pretty seamless.  Naturally I had to redo my speed dials and I couldn't load some of my favorite games, but I knew that going in.  The device is definitely of Treo pedigree, however, and the form factor is a significant improvement. Compatibility with the MS Office suite is a plus (no more dependence on Data Viz).  The device had a lot of menus and was difficult to navigate (kind of like all of the other Windows software I've ever used) but I read a review on the device that mentioned installation of SPB Mobile Shell and that has helped tremendously; it should be the first piece of software that you install!  I also like the unlocked GSM, integrated GPS and the WiFi (all of these were selling points for the phone and worked perfectly out of the box).  Nice job Palm!  Can't wait to see the Pre come out in an unlocked version :-D
I have had this phone for almost two weeks now.  I breifly had the palm 700wx so i only have little to compare to but I think I know some of the subtle yet very useful differences.  Here are the pros:1) it's very simple to turn on/off the wifi, bluetooth, and phone antenna in order to save battery life which i really like2) from using the palm treo 700wx, i hated how the touch screen was still active while on a phone call.  i would have to hold the phone away from my face in order to avoid clicking all sorts of things i didn't want to click.  this phone automatically locks the touch screen while on a call and you can only unlock it using the directional button which was a major plus for me.3) The button on the side can be changed to whatever you want it to open.  the 700wx i was told could only be the camera.the cons (why it's only four stars)1) the volume is low unless you activate speaker phone. it sounds like even when not on speaker that the voices are coming from the back of the phone2) i'm not a fan of how the text messaging is set up. i want to open one message at a time to view and then be able to hit respond. if i click on a text it opens it to another screen which doesn't have a reply button until i click back and then the "conversation" is highlighted. this is the other thing i don't like. it will save every message you have with the same number into one "conversation".3) it comes with no accessories at all.  i originally got a blackberry curve (sent back because it wasn't compatible with my plan which i wasn't told when i ordered) which came with earphones, a holster, the usb charger, a cd, and something else.  this only came with the usb charger and a plug for the wall.  i felt they should have included at least a holster.4) the provided manual is pathetic.  it's basically a ten page pamphlet.  if you want any depth on the functions of the phone, you have to go online5) creating a voice recording is more difficult than it should be. you have to open a program and go through menus in a program just to start one. i want to be able to click program>voice recording and have the app openalthough the cons outnumber the pros, my cons are only minor and pretty specific to what i was looking for. other people may not feel the same way. overall i really like the phone.
I needed a Windows Mobile phone. I spent weeks looking at what was available and everything pointed to the HTC Touch Pro 2 - but that thing is too heavy, chunky/cumbersome and way too expensive in my opinion... so when I saw this phone for two hundred dollars at Dell - I went for it!It's a 3G phone if you use AT&T; but I don't get 3G with my T-Mobile account. That doesn't bother me because I do get 3G where I really need it - in Jamaica, on the Claro network.SCREEN: It's hard to see in sunlight... the fonts are very small - the standard screen "time" is a joke... but all that can be easily fixed with a program called "spb Mobile Shell" which transforms the Treo Pro into a wonderful easy to use device that looks just like the more expensive HTC phones... I would not want to use this phone without spb Mobile Shell!KEYBOARD: Again, at first it feels weird - the keys are made of a gel-like substance that grips your finger tips and doesn't allow them to "flow" with too much speed...but I got used to it after a month or two and now I don't have a problem with it... although it could have been better.FINISH: At first, the black shiny plastic looks kinda cheap. It shows finger prints and smudges like nobody's business... but a quick wipe with a cloth and it always looks new again. Overall, I like it's appearance and I'm happy with it.OPERATION: I've been using it now for a few months now - it works really well. No problems with receiving or making calls. The texting is easy and fast with this phone mainly because of the threaded conversations and physical qwerty keyboard. I've had a few times when I needed to reset the phone - but it's not often and because I'm running third party applications, I can't really complain - again I'm happy with the phones performance.RESET: To reset the phone you really need to remove the battery for a second because there's no convenient switch.WI-FI: There's a great little switch on the side of the phone for starting and stoping wi-fi which I find very convenient instead of hunting through the menus.GPS: It's really fast and works well - it'll find 6 or 7 satellites in a minute or two... much faster than a Nokia N95 that I previously owned.SILENT SWITCH: There's a physical switch for when you go into meetings and you want the phone to be silent - I love this switch and use it a lot. Because of the way it's designed, you can just look at the switch and see whether its on or off (it shows a red color when it's on).For the price that I paid, it's a pretty decent phone... at least until something better comes along!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR NOW!!!
I have the unlocked Treo Pro.  Great little phone. Good size and feel in your hand.  I purchased a great cover and that protects the phone even if it is dropped, so I haven't had the problem with a cracked case.  Good GPS, good volume and like the quick start screen, calendar, and inbox quick buttons.I had a Treo 750 for three years and looooved it (windows 5.0).  I find the print on the screen is smaller than the 750 (although the screen is slightly larger) and that has been challenging. I am not a great fan of windows 6.1. I find that it now takes you to several screens to do small tasks (dialing a number from contacts, checking text messages, checking emails). And why did they take the emoticons (smiley faces) off the text messages?? ughh...how boring is that!!! :-0Overall, I like the phone. My Treo 750 died and I was forced to upgrade. Apps have been easy to download and I guess I would purchase again...
I got this phone a month ago, and It works well for me.The best feature of this phone that I like is that shows you the time, date and any missed calls as a "Screen saver", without having to unlock the phone.The one disadvantage is that the screen size is a little small, and many a times you need to use the Stylus to accurately click.
I have owned several Palm Treo devices and have always been a fan. I purchased the Treo Pro because it offered everything that the 750w I had been using had, but in a smaller package. After 12 months, I am on my third Treo Pro. I take very good care of my phones, so it is not an issue of abuse. It appears that Palm attempted to strengthen the touchscreen with a more durable plastic so that it wouldn't scratch, but this plastic separates itself from other layers of the screen, causing the touchscreen not to work at all. Unfortunately, you need the touchscreen in order to use the device at all. Beyond that, the device is well designed, but a well designed device that doesn't function is nothing more than a paperweight.Another note: Palm technical support is horrible. Normally, I don't mind because I rarely use technical support. In this case I've used web-based chat, where the support staff knows nothing and barely understands English, and phone-based support, which costs money per call and isn't much more help.At this point, I'm not sure if I'll ever buy another Palm device again.Update: The touchscreen on my third Treo Pro died. That's three Treo Pro phones in 21 months. Now I have an iPhone. I've been using the iPhone for three weeks and can say it is infinitely better. Real web browsing! Easier to navigate! I'm willing to admit my mistakes. Buying a Treo Pro is one of them.
I had no problem with the phonesome things could be design betterBut after only 6 months, the touch screen, no longer responded to touchYou could still see screen, but had to use, buttons to navigate.called palm (over the phone techs (idiots))I was told to mail, and it would be 5 to 7 business days to repair.It now has been 12 business days and still not repaired.They keep telling me, that they will put me on the hot list for repair.Now they tell me they dont have the parts, and are waiting on them.To me, it seems that i am getting the run around.The phone is fine, as long as it doesnt need a repair.I paid 479.00 for a piece of ####
I ordered this smartphone (for me it is a PDA which happens to also have a phone) without seeing it, based on the specs, because it offered what I needed. I now have it, and it is perfect. The same ease of Palm PDA, but a smaller, sleeker, easier-to-carry device. I needed an all-in-one gadget. That's what I got. I am a big fan of Palm OS, which was the only fear I had about this purchase. The change to Windows Mobile was fine, and WiFi downloading direct to the phone means no second step of syncing to get programs, books, etc. onto the phone.
I've had my Treo Pro for about six months and I love it. It's small, sleek, and very attractive. The qwerty keyboard is easy to use, even for those with larger fingers. I barely ever use the sylus because it has the touchscreen and it's much easier (and faster) to use your fingers and select what you want. Another feature that I love is the Windows Media Player  to which you can transfer your music and video files from your computer to the phone, and the sound quality is great. The only downside I can think of is that the Treo Pro is not compatible with most bluetooth headsets and you will have to spend lots of money to find just the right one that works with this phone. Lastly, it is a pain in the a** to open the back cover if you need to get your battery or sim card out. Otherwise, it is worth the money.
I bought the Treo Pro a few months ago as an upgrade for my Treo 750. The first thing I noticed was the extremely nice packaging. Very good first impression, Palm! The phone has held up very well over the past few months. I've dropped it several times and it doesn't seem to be any the worse for a trip down the stairs, which is quite nice. Cases are also pretty easy to get and as a bonus, most iPhone cases fit the Treo Pro.Cons:+ The back cover is extremely difficult to get off the first time. The instructions in the manual are absolutely useless and I have never been able to get the back cover off using them and actually gave myself a blister trying to the first time. (What works the best is to hold the device face down in your left hand and to place your right hand on the back in such a way that the tips of your fingers rest on the Palm logo, then simply slide your right hand up. The cover comes right off.)+ The keys on the QWERTY keyboard are flat and not curved like on the 750, making it extremely easy to typo. It took me about a week to get used to this, but I still prefer the 750 keyboard.+ There seems to be a bug with the camera where it performs randomly and abysmally in low light situations. There is also no flash, which is expected, but a bummer.Meh:+ Battery life is pretty average and pretty much the same as the 750.Pros:+ Very easy to set up, I just put my SIM in and everything worked. I had no problems with making/receiving calls, checking voicemail, sending/receiving SMS/MMS messages, or accessing the cellular network on EDGE or 3G.+ The screensaver is AWESOME. I love, love, love how I can check to see what time and date it is simply by looking at my phone. I don't have to turn the screen on at all.+ Windows Mobile 6.1 is a great improvement over WM6. I enjoy Windows Mobile in general, as it is easy to customize, compatible with thousands of programs, and comes with Microsoft Voice Command.+ MicroUSB charger. No more proprietary Palm doohickey! Yay!+ Headphone jack is a standard headphone jack as well. This is super nice.+ GPS is quite accurate. I purchased Garmin Mobile XT from Palm and haven't had any problems aside from the rare program freeze or crash. In most cases, my location was determined and a route set within a few minutes. Definitely a great feature, I wish the 750 had built-in GPS.+ Bluetooth works great. I had no trouble pairing this device with my EeePC or in using ActiveSync over BT.Overall, I'm quite fond of my Treo Pro and I am very happy with it as a replacement for my 750. I almost never use my 750 at this point as it just seems clunky and outdated in comparison. I do kind of miss the keyboard, though. Especially after the sixth time of accidentally typing 'yourt' or 'twittre'.Edit: I ended up using this phone for two+ years. I was very fond of it, but Windows Mobile is frankly no longer a usable OS. I upgraded to the HTC Vivid, which I am very happy with. But how did the Treo look and act after over two years of constant use? The Treo Pro middle button paint (the silver circle) had almost completely worn off, the glue holding the plastic cover around the middle button (over the four surrounding buttons) was starting to come off and peel away, I had dropped it about eight million times (cracks and chips all over the sides, scratches on the back, but little front damage), the L in the PALM logo on the back had come off, and there is dog hair permanently embedded in the phone. I have to say I do still prefer the 750 keyboard. About a year in, the phone overheated and/or crashed if I asked it to do anything interesting (like...run any app). At the time I upgraded, the battery life was extremely poor. If I made a phone call, the battery would pretty much die immediately. It would last about three hours of use otherwise, assuming wifi, GPS, and BT were turned off.
Pros: Design, phone/speaker phone volume, Windows Mobile 6.1 Pro, Standby Battery Life, Screen Saver clock, silent switchCons: Battery life for my real world usage (emails checked every 15 mins., talk about 1 hour a day, 3G web browsing, Stuck in vibrate mode often - after using the switch to switch back to ringing mode, bluetooth stereo transfer problems (have to repair with the Jabra speaker bluetooth everytime to get streo music transferred, otherwise plays on the Treo loudspeaker), gets slow as time passes for some reason (the beachball keeps spinning longer opening the same programs).
I was pleasantly surprised when I got my new Palm Treo Pro in the mail.  I had read all of the reviews listed on Amazon.com, and even watched video reviews on YouTube.Most of the "gripes" that I have read about the device are VERY minor.  The biggest complaint I have is that the exterior is so sleek and shiny, that it picks up fingerprints like crazy.  I am going to take care of the fingerprint problem by getting a silicone case for my Treo Pro.  The sleek/shiny exterior is also the reason that the back is so difficult to remove... HOWEVER, I wanted to offer a tip:  If you use a rubber jar gripper so that you have a good grip, then the back comes off VERY easily.http://www.amazon.com/Maxi-Aids-3-Set-Jar-Openers/dp/B00012K5W0/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1237224322&sr;=8-1In actuality, the back fitting so tightly is a GOOD thing, because it does not allow any space for dust or particles to get down inside of the device.  It also helps the device maintain its sleek, sexy appearance.It is very easy to use, and despite what I read in some of the reviews, I think Windows Mobile 6.1 is a VERY good operating system.  This is the first time I have had a Windows Mobile based device, and I was able to learn to use it very quickly (and I didn't even read the instruction manual, LOL!)...Overall, my impression is that the Palm Treo Pro is the closest thing you can get to a mobile Desktop/PC.  Windows Mobile 6.1 feels just like I am using my PC at home.  I've actually found myself using my laptop less often, because I can just carry the Treo Pro with me!!!The Palm Treo PRO is definitely the BEST business-minded smartphone that I have ever used.
I purchased the Palm Treo Pro last week to replace my T-Mobile Dash.  This thing is a beauty!  The exterior is shiny and sleek.  It feels good in your hand.  The keyboard is easy to use (takes some re-learning time to move from Dash to Treo Pro due to location of some symbols).My business is very Microsoft-centric, as we use and develop software for telecommunications.  It takes minutes to get up and running, syncing with Exchange Server over the air.  I added my Gmail account in a jiffy.  Comparisons with iPhone or touch phones just don't make sense if you're a business user.  The microsoft OS works flawlessly with business applications.  One-hand operation and responding to text messages and email is made simple with the qwerty keyboard.I purchased the unlocked version so I don't have to be stuck in a 2-year contract with any carrier.  I don't get the benefit of 3G data through T-Mobile, but Edge is plenty fast (and much more dependable) for internet and email, and it helps save on battery life.  If AT&T; plan prices and dependability ever get better, I may make the switch, but I don't see any need right now.Favorite things:Hard switch to silence all soundsAbility to resize text in applicationsBrilliant displayComm Manager and hard button for quick wi-fi off/onbattery lifeTime and Date Screen saver when display is offStandard mini pin headset jackProfessional, classy designDislikes:Micro-usb interface/AC (easily fixed with a mini to micro adapter)
I've been trying smartphones for a while. I've had Motorolas, Nokias, Blackberries, HTCs and even other Palms. None of them got me so satisfied as this Pro model.Palm Treo Pro is not the most innovative phone I've had, but also, there's nothing missing there and, the most important, there's nothing that doesn't work well there.You want WiFi ? You got it. Want 3G ? Got it. Want good quality calls ? Got it. The touchscreen isn't innovative as the iPhone or HTC ? No, but it works well. And there's always the good qwerty keyboard. The camera is not the best in th world ? No, but that's why I have a 10 MP camera. 2 MP is fair enough for quick shots.The windows speed is good and much, but much better than the last HTC Touch Dual I had. It's a little bit expensive, but what's the point to pay less for a phone that won't work for you ? So, I think it was a great buy.Just one point Palm could consider to improve: why don't they use a regular mini USB port for the phone ? Using a propietary port means you must buy all cables from them, what makes more difficult to find, especially in Brazil (where I live).So, if you are not into being a pioneer on smartphone technology, here is the right one for you. It's not so cool as the iPhone, but it's much better for real workers and people who need the phone for several activities.
I purchased this product through Amazon, they did their job well.I was not pleased with the product.  I am disappointed in Palm.  I've been a loyal palm user for years.  The Treo Pro might have been a good tool with a Palm operating system.  The windows app is not a good fit with the small screen and general function of the unit.  I returned the unit, again Amazon took care of that process well.M.W.
I've been playing with this phone just a few days and i gotta tell you guys this is a great phone... you can feel and see the quality on it... WiFi works great and everything else too... I'm not the guy that fools around on BB, I think Palm's are great devices. I hope this helps. BTW thanks Amazon
Palm Treo Pro Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MicroSD - U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)I love this phone.  I upgraded from a Treo 750 and the Pro is faster, has a much better screen and keyboard and adds several functions such as GPS and wifi.  My only complaint is the finish which is glossy and slick.  The old matte rubber finish was much better to hold on to.
I work in healthcare profession and have been using Palm products for almost 10 years, particularly for Epocrates, medical formulas etc. Just the familiarity with Palm made me choose this new Palm model. I had a Palm 680 prior to this. But this new model has Windows mobile operating system which is quite different from Palm OS..so the familiarity factor goes out the window right there. I find Winmo harder to use than Palm OS. I loved the Palm "desktop" feature where you could put icons of the most used programs right on the main screen. No such feature on Winmo. Ofcourse, it was an informed decision to buy Palm pro. This product came out in August 2008 and I bought it in May 2009. So a lot of people have already tried it..and as of yesterday there were 41 reviews on Amazon, that were extremely helpful.It is a nice looking phone...weighs almost as much as iPhone. Opening the back cover to insert SIM card was such a hassle. I tried for over 30 minutes to open it..and had to look up a video online for help. But finally got it in. And phone was ready to use right away.On this phone, signal bar is always 1 bar less than other phones..but I can make and receive phone calls. No problems so far. I am overall satisfied with this phone..I got what I expected. I am not a big fan of Winmo though. To open a program, you have to go through layers of menus. For example, I used the clock/alarm function on Palm Treo 680 a lot since I would need to get up at odd hours. The clock/alarm icon was on my desktop main screen. Not so with Windows. You have to click "start"..then settings..then system and finally the clock.I feel Palm should get rid of the stylet function. Pulling out the stylet from the right lower corner is not very easy and I am always afraid that I would drop it somewhere never to find it again. But you need the stylet to go through 4 layers of menu..when I used my "finger"..it would always miss the mark.Finally, the font size is too small. When I get a phone call.. I have to bring it within 6 inches of my face to read who is calling. Surprisingly, changing font size doesn't fix this problem. You have to see it to understand what I am talking about. Since 80% of my use for this device is as phone, it is very annoying.Overall 3 stars. Lot of scope for improvement. I hope people at Palm/Treo read these reviews and make better products in future.
This phone TOTALLY rocks!!  I have been JONESING for a palm windows upgrade for over 2 years....Ever since I got my 700wx, (I briefly tried the dismally disappointing 800w...ugh..)I have been dying for full threaded texting and pic sms....of course there are hacks for this and I did them, but there is nothing like native support for these features.  Well THIS phone has it ALL!!  Full support for threaded texting, pics, video over sms..you name it.  Also got a messaging app with AIM, Yahoo, and Windows Live/Messenger!!  So I dont have to shell out another $40 for IM+ application!!  AWESOME!!  FINALLY sprint catches up with the rest of the world....not too mention getting Office Mobile.My only tiny tiny gripes are that they moved some of the familiar soft buttons around...I was used to having the "menu" on the right bottom of the screen and when you select a picture to have as your today background,(I have my favorite pic of my daughter and I that I always use) it seems to re-position it somehow....keyboard seems a bit more cramped...the familiar "delete" button for my email is now another keystroke away...but hey...these are small complaints for a phone that otherwise is a great product.Form factor is great, and it doesnt feel as "bulky" and awkward as the 700wx felt.at any rate, there you have my 2 cents. it kicks ARSE over the "iPhone"...sorry, but I need the tactile response of an actual KEYBOARD...
Our IT specialist asked me to buy him one; I told him only if i could test it for a week.I bought one for myself the next week; and no regrets so far.
Ive owned this phone for a few months now and can conclude that it is severely under-powered. When writing text messages, I type faster than the phone, further many words are left missing or misspelled. The phone is super slow.Other than the text messaging problem, the phone is very sleek and WM6 is pretty reliable. The phone also comes with a built-in backup software that will backup your contacts/calendar to an SD card (if you have one installed).I previously used the Palm Treo 750W  (wM5) and would recommend purchasing that ($199 from Amazon) over the $400 Palm Treo Pro. It does everything the Pro can do, with the exception of WiFi.
Take this for what its worth, I had been in the market for a smartphone so that I could have the convenience of internet, wifi, outlook and many of the little things that make these little phones essential. I was on a budget and found online an unlocked HP Ipaq model 6900. I read the reviews and some were good and some were bad, needless to say I took a chance and bought this thing. The phone was actually a refurbished phone not by the manufacturer, but by a third party vendor, and I had no way of knowing this since the description was misleading (no, it was not Amazon) I started to use the phone only to realize my worst nightmare, the phone did everything well except make calls when I neede to. I also learned that the battery gauge was always reading wrong from one of the HP forums, and when I thought I had a full charge it was actually half charged and the phone could not work.I have since then learned to live with the mistake I made and use this phone as a really bulky PDA or pocket game playing gadget while in the john. I also found out that Windows mobile 5.0 was not the most robust operating system for a phone, much less this one and provisions to update were not allowed.As time went by I learned that Microsoft had updated their mobile operating system and newer and better phones were hitting the market. I was a bit hesitant to go with any of the newer HP products since they were really expensive and I had such a horible experience with the first phone. I did some research on what windows based phone would be ideal for my situation and when I learned about the Palm Treo Pro I decided to look into it. I wanted to see what it looked like but T mobile nor at&t; had this phone, Sprint did, so I went to one of their stores to check it out and the features as well. I really loved the phone, but I was not able to cancel my plan to go to Sprint, so unlocked was the way to go for me.I received the phone and had read some reviews that T mobile did not work very well with the phone, and that everyone was touting the mighty Iphone. The Iphone has some nice software and it is the rave, but when I installed my sim card into this phone, it was ready to go in just under a minute, it came on read the network ID and autoconfigured itself and worked well. I found out from a friend that the newer phones were having their sim cards replaced with more capacity and better handleing of the data. I went to T mobile and they said that there were some cases of this and agreed to swap out the sim for a new one. At that moment was when the phone woke up and started with crystal clear calls, all data was updated flawlessly from my Outlook account from work, the web pages loaded better and this phone has since been everthing that the Ipaq was not.Like others, my only complaint is on the QWERTY keypad being too small, other than that, hats off to Palm for finally releasing a phone that actually does what its supposed to do, and all the software works without incident, many features like the out of the box self configuration was really helpful, wifi works anyplace there is an open hotspot, the micro SD chip can be installed up to 32GB capacity, it is not a battery hog either; I usually get two full days on a charge when using phone, data, mail push and even GPS.Great phone, if you have a GSM service get it unlocked, if you have no service you may want to try Sprint, and even if you dont sign up with them you can see the phone in action. THIS PHONE IS GREAT!!!!!
I bought this device to replace my old treo 650, and despite the difference in functionallity, I think once you understand how it works, it is a really good option for organizing and for your communications needs (emails, internet & phone) I am really pleased with the solutions provided by this phone.
this phone is great. I really enjoy using the UI... I think is great!Although one bad thing is that it freezes sometimes
i love my palm treo pro! nearly everything about it. it worth every single penny for my busy life. should have had it long time ago! however, as a Palm z22 user (the very first PDA they had), i miss the graffiti function where i can jot down a note in a hurry. other than that, i am very happy with the smartphone!
I have had this phone only for a week however I have not run into any problems with it. Everything is positive. It took me a while to figure out how to change the ringtones but it was right there.(To the manual writers: Once the phone is in our hands we want to do two things immediately. 1. Change the wallpaper. And 2. Change the ringtones and notification sounds. So don't begin your manuals with the lame 'Your Phone and Making Your First Call' sections. I am not making any calls until this thing is set up the way I want it. So begin your manuals there. Geez.)Calls are clear. Remarkably so. And when you are on a call the phone locks its screen to prevent an action unless you unlock it. A nice touch from my previous phone an HTC Diamond Touch which would go wild while the phone was to my ear.I have to say that I love the keyboard. It is logical, easy, and even with clunky fingers like mine, push friendly. It also gives a very satisfying 'click' feedback. I struggled with the Diamond Touch screen keyboard for over a year now and I have to say I prefer a physical keyboard to a virtual one.The programs work well and my phone came with Kinoma FreePlay. This program is very nice and opens the phone to a surprising variety of content that you can tap into while traveling.I have had Blackberries, MotoQ, and HTC's smartphones but I have to say that this phone, out of the box, has impressed me the most. Hopefully in a month's time it will continue to perform to my early expectations.Update:I am now a month into this phone. There is really nothing I can say negative about it. The battery life has been very good. The screen is good. I have had no issues with the keyboard. And except the MicroSD becoming dislodged after a accidental fall off a table onto hardwood the phone appears to be bulletproof. I am anxiously waiting for Windows Mobile 6.5 and then 7.0, however although lackluster Win. Mobile 6.1 syncs with my Outlook flawlessly.It is really a very good phone and I think that with the Treo Pro I will not be disappointed with the phone over the life on my three year contract.
Surely a mobile to keep informed, versatile, and with only the limited functionality that the user is perfect for business.
I'll rank the phone pretty highly, but not Palm. After purchasing a phone at full price as a "die-hard palm user" you would expect a bit more from Palm. Don't expect it. My phone developed a connectivity problem with windows after six months. Two plus hours of support chat, phone support resulted in the conclusion that the device was malfunctioning. I can send my phone in for free repair (and do without for three weeks), or I can pay $40 and get a replacement with a day or two. Thanks Palm! That's really no choice at all.  I spent two hours with tech support and have a warranty that still requires me to pay. For that reason alone I'd be cautious with Palm. I'll be switching myself shortly.
if you're the type who's all business and no fooling around with extraneous apps, this phone's for you!
I upgraded from Cingular 8525 w/slide out keypad. really thick and bulky. The Treo Pro is slim. I traded bulk for smaller screen and front keypad. Treo Pro is much quicker with same speed processor. I still have stylus and data input which is great. Touch screen is much more responsive, so I can makes calls with fingers on virtual phone pad. Wi-Fi is better. I'm using with AT&T;, so have $15 per month date plan. Internet browser works great. Best win 6.1 phone I've tried. I'm business user, so camera, multimedia don't matter. Treo Pro was also a tested phone for Redfly data terminal so now I can use Treo and Redfly instead of laptop, and do that for much less than HTC Advantage. Thanks Palm.
This is the best business tool and has excellent media capabilities as well. Far better than the Nokia E61i, HTC Tilt and iPhone.
This is the most stable Treo I have ever owned.  With the great memory management app on the device, you can make sure you fully close applications and free up the device memory.  WiFi and Bluetooth work great, and the screen resolution is a real plus.  One downside on the design is the ridiculously difficult to remove back cover.  Unfortunately, the battery, the reset button, and the microSD card slot are all located back there.  The keyboard is a bit tight, but much easier to use than many devices I have owned and certainly better than the iPhone virtual keyboard.  The thin form-factor is also a major improvement over the brick-like past Treos - you can actually put this one in your front pocket or your shirt pocket!
This phone broke 2 months after purchase. I am strugling to have this phone fixed and Palm is making this really hard. This is my 4th Treo, I started with a 650 that was great and then I had the 680 and 750 that was not so good. Now I have this Treo Pro, and I'm beginning to believe that Pro stands for problems. I would not recommend this product. My advice: Stay away from Palm service.
I bought the Treo Pro in October 2008.  In terms of advertised functionality, it should be a great device.  However, my experience owning one has been very bad.I bought the unlocked version as my local cellular provider did not supply the Treo Pro.  From the first day, the device did not work properly, although initially the problems were not frequent; the phone kept dropping the data connection and occasionally the cellular connection.  The problems became worse as time went on.  I contacted Palm on several occasions and was told that the problem had to be with my cellular provider.A couple of months ago, my cellular provider started supplying the Treo Pro themselves, and their other customers were not experiencing the same problems.  After a few more weeks of arguing with Palm customer service, they finally accepted, after an ENTIRE YEAR, that my device was faulty and agreed to replace it under warranty.The new device arrived fairly promptly.  It is also faulty; the Wi-Fi just does not work.I have learned my lesson and will never buy a Palm product again.
I've had this phone for a couple of weeks.  The first problem was that I couldn't get the back cover off.  I still have difficulty with it, but most of the time can do it now.  The phone is severely underpowered, and the battery needs much more frequent charging that other phones I've had.  The features are not intuitive, and the manual is a joke--as is the online tutorial.  How about covering  something basic like telling you how to change ringtones?  I have had both Nokia and Blackberry and prefer these hands down.
This is the best Treo yet for business use, preferable to the new Treo Pre.  It is small and light with a very usable keyboard and Windows Mobile 6.1.  Stable and intuitive, a great product.
I have been a loyal Palm customer for several years. I was upgrading from a Treo 680 and was excited to buy the Palm Treo Pro. After loading my data, the smart phone would not work because it ran out of internal memory. I think WinMob, along with my contacts and calendar, took up too much space. It is ridiculous for a phone to run out of space the very first day I tried to use it. I had the phone less than a day. I had to go to the AT&T; store that day to buy a new non-Palm phone and return my Palm Treo Pro. I bought the unlocked version so it was very disappointing to spend that much money on a product that did not work. I hope the Palm Pre is worth the wait because that is now what I have my heart set on. I have to say that Amazon.com processed the return very quickly with no problems. I received a credit within the week. Thank you Amazon.com.
Excellent gadget with all of today's and some of tomorrow's features included in a friendly package.Battery life has reduced a bit compared to older Palm Treo versions, but this still ranks very high compared to other smart phone batteries.Commendable delivery from Amazon.
As usual, I received from Amazon and its providers an outstanding service. The product as required, the delivery time as promised, the wrapping, as needed. There is nothing more to say.Keep up the good work.Hector Moncada Reese
My new Palm Pro works well in and outside of the US.  The best part is that you really only need one hand to operate the device, very helpful when working on the computer.  I like the size,the design, overall look,  the apps I've purchased and the super fast Internet access.  Actice-Sync works extremely well. Well worth the $350 unlocked.
VERY GOOD!!!! I previously had a Treo 650. In Bermuda everybody is hooked on Blackberries, and I have had soooo many people, including my service provider tell me to get rid of my Treo because they are bad news.... I stuck to my guns and waited for just the right Treo to come out... and I love it..It does take some getting used to but I am very pleased.... I am a bit disappointed in the camera and the battery life, but over all I am glad I waited.Now I am just waiting for more accessories like 2 in 1 headsets, more apps and better cell cases.
Es un muy buen smart phone. Cómodo para usar, buena interfase, muy buenos los comandos y botones de acceso rápido. Buena y rápida respuesta. Muy bueno el Windows Mobile. Algo pequeño el teclado qwerty. Tal vez mejoraría con un teclado alfanumérico común. Y esta es una de las principales contras: no es tan cómodo para usarlo como teléfono. Resulta difícil de usar para hacer una simple llamada o un simple SMS. Perfecto como agenda o para sofisticadas funciones de correo y uso corporativo.Contras: MUY POBRE EN INSTRUCCIONES DE USO!!!.NO HAY MÁS REMEDIO QUE "INVESTIGAR" TODO, PORQUE DE "MANUAL" TRAE SOLO UNA HOJITA DE PAPEL MÍNIMO. Todavía no sé cuántas cosas aún no me he enterado que es posible hacer con esta maravila tecnológica, justamente porque no tengo un simple manual.Otra importante. Aún no logro hacer andar el GPS. No trae instrucciones, (noi siquiera en la hojita de manual aparece mencionado) y tampoco aplicaciones para usarlo, más que GoogleMaps. Muy buena. Pero solo útil si uno está sentado en una zona WiFi. Y el GPS, ¡es para la calle o la ruta! No me explico qué pensó la gente de Palm cuando diseñó esta parte!
I have had this phone for about a month now, and i can say it was a huge disappointment! I bought this phone through Dell and only paid about $270.00, so at the time i thought i was getting a really sweet deal,I should have taken the youtube reviews more serious...I will start with some of the good things first.The design is very nice and professional, things are kinda compact in size, but for what it attempts to do, is built into a very slim package. the phone also feels very high quality and lite.phone calls and speaker were always superb.The camera is neat! it takes very nice pictures, records video, and can even do panoramic pics.The battery life is extremely good for a smart phone.here is where things come crashing down...first, there is no off button, serious. you can turn off the screen, turn off wifi, BT, but you can NOT shut off the phone without taking out the battery, so if some app gets stuck or you need to reset to your network, you will have to take the thing apart to accomplish this. dont believe me? google PALM's answer for not including an off button.second, the wifi support is lousy, I would establish a link to my home wifi and my work wifi connections, only to have to reset them every other week because the phone would forget to use them as default.the media player on it sucks! it will play video, mp3. BUT, i found that trying to listen to music on it, tracks would constantly stutter. and forget about using the stereo bluetooth. I had a really difficult time trying to figure out if the stuttering was caused by the headset or the phone only to discover, for some reason, if you shut off the screen while media player is going, tracks will start stuttering, which basically meant, i had to leave it pluggged in with the screen on to listen to music...the final issue i had, was with email. I would go through the process of setting up a pop email account ('gmail', 'work'). things would look good for a couple of days, or even a week, and then all of a sudden I would get error messages indicating 'sent messages could not be sent' or something similar. the email accounts would completely stop working, and the only way to alleviate the issue i could come across was to delete the accounts on the phone and go through the whole process of setting up the accounts all over again.i'm pretty sure a lot of these issues are caused by the fact that it uses 'win mobile'. that seems to be the popular answer. but i would have liked things to have been tested and worked right out of the box. and not have to be a network admin to set up basic wifi...
Palm PRO is the worst phone ever. i bought it the first week of its release..i put up with it for a few months and now i have a BlackBerry Tour. in my line of work i meet hundreds of people everyday. i meet one person who also had the phone and she hated it as well. dont waste your money on Palm coz you'll end up having to remove your battery at least 4 times a day just for it to act right. the phone can shut it self off just by the slightest touch and you wouldnt even know. the phone dosent vibrate half the time. the mobile web takes forever. typing "www" takes at least 8 seconds just for the letters to appear on the screen. the phone hangs up when people calls you and if your screen freezes which it will the call will show up and nothing will work not even the green button. its a piece of trash. it dosent deserve the star i gave it but Amazon wants me to rate it....
I noticed quite a few happy users in the reviews I read, and some not so happy. I personally hate this phone and the HTC Windows Mobile phone before that. Windows Mobile isn't stable and neither is this phone; I'm on my second one now and I may have to get it replaced as the hardware is acting up. It seems that the messaging application just decides it doesn't want to work. You hit the message selection of your choice, you get the spinning beach ball of death and it never comes back. I pop off the back and reboot the phone. Sometimes it just locks up. No knock on Palm as I have had two before this, but not running Windows Mobile. My advice, stay away from this phone in particular; save yourself the headache. I'm going to go out and get a Blackberry Tour.
Everything went according to plan and my Palm Treo Pro is working  just fine.Good work Amazon.com
this phone have good expectative but has some problem sometime frize the phone,in the main screem change the application to other application,ex:you open the internet this change to contact or to other application, onlysync outook.
The Palm Treo breaks.  Then the replacement (refurbished unit) breaks, and then the second replacement unit (refurbished) breaks.  The overall design is good, but the manufacturing appears to be lacking.
I guess I'm lucky that I get a free phone from work and don't have to pay for service.But this phone is hands-down the worst I've ever used.-For starters, my service is through Sprint, the "Not Right Now" network.-It's a pretty phone, but the shiny case and face show every finger and face print.  It's also slippery, so watch out when you get it out of your pocket, and forget trying to cradle it against your shoulder.-There are no profiles.  Only a switch to turn the audible alerts on an off.  You have to assign every event (and there are a pile of them) a sound or vibration.-You can't power the phone down, only turn the service off (airline mode).-If you're on a call and receive another call or text, the alerts are full-volume in your ear.  You cannot disable this.-If you receive a call you don't want to take, you hit the "ignore" button.  3 seconds later, you then have to hit the "dismiss" button when the phone tells you you have a missed call.  This cannot be disabled.-In nearly a year of service, I have yet to get more than 24 hours of battery life.  I have literally had days where the phone has sat on my dresser for 18 hours and completely discharged itself.-Over the course of a typical week, I usually have to pull the battery to reset the phone between 15-20 times.I can't speak about a lot of the phone's features, as they're unavailable most of the time (Sprint's network is horrible as well).About the only positives going for it are the size and shape, and the camera takes surprisingly good pictures.Had I paid for it (or Sprint's non-existent coverage), I'd be really pissed.
I ordered the unlocked Palm Treo Pro for overnight shipment.  It arrived as promised.  A downhill trail from there.1) When I plugged the device into its charger there was no led or other indication that the unit was charging.2) With the unit still plugged into the charger, I pushed the on/off switch.  There was no reaction.3) I simply could not remove the back of the device to insert the SIM.  This is a known issue with this model, but comments by previous reviewers here gave me the impression that the complaint was overblown.  It is not.  With the back of the device facing me, I squeezed the lower right corner of the back to release the catch.  There was no movement, no sound, nothing.  In addition, in order to squeeze the lower right corner of the back, you must - almost of necessity - be squeezing the lower left corner of the keyboard (which is on the front).  This was of concern, as I did not want to ruin the keyboard.4) So I called the phone experts at Amazon. ("Our cell phone experts are here Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST to help you choose the right cell phone or accessory. (For assistance with completed orders, dial 1-866-216-1072.)")  The only option offered or - I was told - available was to return the phone.  You could argue that this was assistance.
OK, I'm writing this one more time, and if you delete it again, I will spread my comments all over the internet about OEM and Amazon together!I purchased Treo Pro couple of weeks ago and it came with a blue spot in the middle of the screen which annoys me every moment I turn it on. So this is my first complaint on Amazon after so many years shopping here and I have owned nearly every model of products from Palm, I never had such screen issue before.So I warn anyone considering to buy anything from OEM Shop to look elsewhere!
I bought it because of the Wi-Fi.  Damn it though it's too much like the rest of the "Gates" Windows junk.  Not very easy to learn compared to the Treo 680 I've been using for years.  Not user friendly.....I wish Palm still used it's "Palm" OS ---- Windows Mobile is for the birds.
The product is great.Shame on Amazon that they don't test the products before sending them. They sent me a defective unit which reboots itself when I'm making a phone call. Now I have to send it back so they send me a replacement but it makes item much more expensive because I'm outside of US and have to pay to send the defective item back to US and to hace the replacement sent to me to my country.Bottom line: Amazon should test their products before sending them.
Despite working with this device for a month, I could not find any way to edit AND sync my office documents with my computer... Docs to Go says they do not have a compatible product for the Treo Pro although they do for Windows Mobile. Figure that out? Also I was not able to successfully set it up with my blue tooth headset - perhaps that was my ignorance but my son couldn't figure it out either. The keys are too small for me to use while driving - I am used to an unsmart Nokia. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I realize I am not an experienced smart phone user and some of these issues might be due to my ignorance. But I did try all the support services options and couldn't solve them.
Absolutely a horrible option for a phone!  If you want to spend this type of money buy a Blackberry Palm is worthless!
Every time I read a review on a mobile device, suddenly Iphones appear as the industry standard. Reviewers have been more concerned about the the rings and bells than the business people needs on the road.The point is that HTC Touch Pro does everything you expect from a 3G Pocket PC device without the glamor others limited phones show.I use my mobile phone all day and the PC capabilities on the road, mainly in business trips. Since I have been with my HTC devices (formerly the Tytn II and now the Touch Pro), I could leave my laptop at home in short trips (9 out of 10)Office combo (read and edit), Skype, MSN, reasonable dual camera, GPS, browser, extended memory card, everything is there.Design and sliding full QWERT keyboard are astouning. HTC did a terrific job in the ergonomics.My only complaint is the lack of a second slot for a second phone line. Traveling people would thank an extra chip, as many times, we need a local number.If you are serious about your mobile needs, I recommend the HTC Touch Pro. If you want to look cool to the gal siting next to you, well, Iphones have also become commonplace, so...
I bought this phone about a month ago, i love this phone all the features are easy to manage, the email service is good and i get all the mails from yahoo,gmail,hotmail. The touch flow is good and the rest of the touch items are real easy to use.. The only thing that i really dont like an is real frustrating is the battery life, its get to a point that i am not sure how long is the battery life... The battery life is so short that i need to check it every hour, is so irritating is no joke...The battery life is SO SHORT... The phone its self is a good phone.. but the problem is the battery other then that the phone is nice...
Muy contento que esta maravilla tecnológica. Como todo tiene sus contras, sobre todo cuando de consumo de batería se trata. Sin embargo es un excelente dispositivo móvil con la flexibilidad del WM6.
I don't believe that I'm being too picky when I say that if I am going to pay 400 dollars for a cell phone I would expect it to be problem free. I have had mine for about 8 months now and I am getting sick and tired of freeze ups, and the extremely poor battery life which especially in the middle of a conversation will not warn you before turning off. By the looks of how my phone is working 8 months into the contract, I'd doubt it will last my full 2 year contract. Be wary when you buy this phone and do your research.
First, this may be too much phone for some people.  If you know that this is what you want, then read on.This phone is amazing.  I can use Skype via wi-fi connection, print to my bluetooth printer, transfer files between my many computers, Micro SD expandable, and a host of other features.  I go all around the world, and since this phone is Quad-Band GSM, as well as WCDMA, everywhere is covered.  I live in Japan, and I can use this thing anywhere!  If I weren't a gamer and movie buff, this would almost totally eliminate my need for a laptop on my ventures!The cons are not deal breakers, but there are some things that should be pointed out.  Sometimes it freezes, and you have to do a soft reset.  This is a mini-computer of sorts, so there is a lengthy boot up time.  Also, the Touch-Flo 3d interface, while pretty and shiny, and somewhat usefull, is sluggish.  If you like phones to where you can dial or flip through contacts or call history and make a call in a flash, sorry 'bout your luck.  Calls don't happen that fast.  Keep in mind this is an amazing piece of tech, that also happens to be a phone.  The sluggish interface, and slow call times are the only cons I have.Other great points, you can edit MP3s on the device to make ringtones.  you can speed up the TF3D with custom roms.  I have yet to do so.  If you love windows mobile, you can turn off TF3D and just use your customised Today Screen for WinMo.And finally, the flip out qwerty board is the best i've ever used.  the buttons are slightly raised, and they have a nice "clicky" feel when pressed.  I've had this for almost a month, and I'm typing novels to my wife in less than a minute.  She's still on a regular cell with no qwerty, and she's like, "can you not just type me smaller messages!?"  To which I reply, "now that I have this shiny new phone, I need to tell you all about my day!"I digress...  If you know exactly what you're looking for, and this tech masterpiece fits your needs, then it will blow you away.
I used the product for my international trip and it works just fine. The dark gun metal color definitely catches the eye. Did not find any glitches
The battery backup for this phone is really bad. It doest even lasts for a day if you make a couple of calls each of around 10-15 minutes. Apart from that it is OK.
This is my really first deception in the online shopping world, because I can't even turn on the phone, I connect the phone to the charger and nothing happens; I couldn't return the phone to the warranty because I'm out of the USA. In a few words I lost 143.98$ and I can't do anything.The seller "Vegabuy" sent me several emails asking me that I remove the negative feedback, and talk with them, so I remove the negative feedback and now they don't answer me my emails.SincerelyGiuseppe Bifaretti
I purchased this phone through Amazon.com from a company called "slickdeals4you". I have to say that I was a little concerned about "slickdeals4you" since they really did not have much of a website that I could find and the only contact was via a hotmail address.But since it was being ordered through Amazon I figured I'd be covered if there was a problem. As it turned out, the phone arrived right on time. It's a great phone if you do a lot of texting since it has the full qwerty keyboard. Call quality was fine. It's a fairly large, bulky phone though.However, after a few weeks it developed a problem with the screen. It would regularly display an unreadable, garbled mess. I contacted the seller via email and received a prompt response. In fact, I ended up emailing him several times over several days and he always responded quickly and politely.He advised me that I was within the 30 day return period and that I could return it for replacement, which I did. I received the replacement phone exactly 7 days (including weekends) from the day I shipped the defective phone to him. Very fast service.
I bought this phone online and this damn thing doesn't work, its not charging, I tried to charge it on different plug points but it wouldn't work :(.I am a big fan of AMAZON.COM and do all my shopping here and this is the first time around i got a defective package :(.I have returned the Phone to the seller and i am waiting for a New piece or refund.Plus The box didn't have the standard accessories like Pouch, SD Card, Handsfree and the String to attach. :(Very unhappy about the product.Hope AMAZON helps me.
I was so happy to get this phone because I could finally text with a key board. The swivel is nice as well. However, there is no alarm which I need daily.How does a cell phone not have an alarm???? It has no calculator. It does not record videos. I have a cell phone that I paid $30 for(the phone the sidekick is replacing) and it has all of the obvious features. Now I am going to have to keep my old cell phone plugged up so that I will have an alarm.
I have received the phone on time, but i found out that it was locked, so i had to take to an expert to unlock it. Secondly, the reception is very bad, i rarely find a signal on the phone, which means i cant rely on it. I wont recommend this phone to anyone, because its a waste of money!!
This is not an htc phone but made by sharp. Also the phone won't web browse using another mobile network.
I order a new unlocked smart phone and what i got was a complit scam the phones was not new was refurnish they just put new stickers on it, and wasen't unlocked, please do not buy at this store
This is a great product for all the different user functions.The phone is great and I only wish that they would make it for AT&T; service.I got an unlocked one because I have AT&T.As; far as product and quaility this phone is a great buy for anyone on the go that needs to access e-mail,and other needed functions.
plainly put, the bold is the best smartphone on the market. I disagree totally with the other reviewer who states its a power hog.....besides its VERY easy to change the battery (unlike the impossible battery changing iphone). Qwerty keys will always be faster to type than touch phones (which are a gimmick) the resolution on the bold os incredible as is the picture (the video is FUSED to the inside of the glass, the result is spectacular)email setup and apps are always superior on rim blackberries as they have the best 3rd party apps on the planetI use at&t; on their 3g data plan, also I have wifi enabled all the time. My phone is unlocked......and can use any GSM networkin short, this is the best piece of hardware ive bought in years
This is a GREAT product! But it lacks support from Amazon.Good support from RIM (manufacturer) and after two weeks BIS services were working with my current mobile phone operator (Vivo Brazil).
Features are nice.  Speedy interface, reasonable browsing, fast typing.  Some external apps are available, but tend to make the Bold unstable.  If you see problems, remove the last application you installed.The main problem is the phone device itself.  It just breaks all the time.  3x in less than a year, and each time RIM takes it for two weeks..I'm nearing the end of my warranty and battling them to get it fixed now before the warranty runs out.I will not buy another Blackberry I'm afraid.
I have been a Blackberry fan for the past 5 years. I'm literally a Blackberry addict.We have a family company that deals with clients and contractors on a daily basis.The Bold is perfect for handling emails, conference calls, texts, and the bluetooth feature is really easy to use. I'm constantly on the road checking the progress of construction sites and dealing with real estate agents when they see a potential investment they immediately picture text me the house text me the location.I love how sharp the the Bold looks. The back has simulated leather texture design and its really sleek. Plus it's not super tiny where my thumbs accidentally hit the wrong key when I'm typing emails.The wi-fi makes the internet faster than 3G and the camera is 2MP so it's really high quality.The Bold is a great deal with any carrier and perfect for everyday use.
It's the best phone of RIM, it work very good in USA and Ecuador (Latin America). The purchased and delivery was fast. All very good.
Its a good phone,but a power hog, I had the 8310 Curve, I upgraded, do not see much value, the 3G doesn't work half the time, the WiFi, if enabled, drains the battery even more , so I disabled the WiFI, Overall its Ok, but they need to improve battery life by 4X,Good Resolution,good 8GB slot to use, better Music Interface,Have used the Video Flash, as my flash lite at times
i have own 2 of this phones, my first one was stolen, and i went for the second one without even thinking about it, it has a great resolution, sound, and the bb pin software is really easy to use and fast, this is the best bb out there...
When I placed the order thought that I buy a new telephone! I received a used AT&T; phone with AT&T; logo on it. The only truth about this phone is that it is open for other sim cards. The phone came in an open and not original box! I wish I could returen it and receive my money back. Amazon should remove this seller from its site. It gives bad name to Amazon.
THIS IS THE BEST BB OUT THERE, MY ONLY COMPLAIN IS THAT THE CAM IS ONLY 2 MP BUT ITS A GREAT PHONE
This handset is excellent value and function. The handset itself enables multiple applications and ease of use.  A definite improvement in the Blackberry range. The price is extremely competitive and delivery in almost instantaneous.  I thoroughly recommend this phone.
When my wife received the UPS package which i sent her as a gift,she told me that the black berry was not found in the package and only accessory was found! it's nearly drive me mad!i try to contact with Amazon to see if there is any chance to return the cargo via email. Amazon reply to me without any doubt that i can directly send them back by UPS and they would refund me!That would be out of mind in china!But it does work in US especially on Amazon.Thanks for the help from Amzon and i really trust the service of Amazon which is 100% worry free!
I love this phone it has many functions with very good software, it is fast whit a great design, also the bb messenger is an advantage with this models, everything is good in this phone I recomend it!!!
I never thought I would own a Blackberry.  In fact, I first bought a Nokia e71.  The Symbian OS was not user friendly and nothing like the standard Nokia OS.The Blackberry Bold 9000 is very user friendly and the UI is intuitive.  Call quality and the speaker phone is very good.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a PDA.
A very good option... even that I've been a nokia fan throughout my entire life!! This is a must have!
I purchased my first Ming about 3 years ago and when I lost the first one, I went straight to the AT&T; store and purchased an iPhone.  Compared to my Ming, the iPhone was an iJoke!  So I returned it, paid the $40 restocking fee, and ordered another Ming immediately.  Recently, I upgraded to the Ming A1600, and I absolutely love it.  For someone who uses her phone as much as I do for both business and personal purposes, this phone is ideal.The only problem so far is that I have not been able to find a site to download an English version of the GPS map system, so my GPS is in Chinese!  However, because I love this phone so much, I might have to learn Chinese just for the GPS system if I can't find the English map.In sum, Motorola Ming A1600 is a FANTASTIC product with a multitude of amazing features and applications that are suitable for both business and personal uses.  I highly recommended it.
i ordered it, it came in how many ever days it said it would come, it came brand new as it said it would and im enjoying the phone very much.its small, cheap, and very easy to use. there's no new technology to it like android or something, its all the basics on the menu but it's got a full QWERTY keyboard. texting is incredibly easier with this phone and much more enjoyable, its also probably one of the smallest full QWERTY keyboard phones there are,i hope this helped!
I purchased this phone 4 months ago and now it won't even turn on. I have never dropped it and water has never gotten into it. My dad and I tried the battery on other phones and it worked, so it's the phone itself that is messed up.
Overall its a real good phone. Freezes up when playing music if you receive a message at the same time. But its a good phone a really nice. Texting is so much easier. I've had it for a week and its been good so far. [...] Great service.
I am a Cellular Phone Dealer.I purchased 2 phones from other source very recently.Thanks to the good design, I could sell them easily.However, they were returned in a month due to the mechanical problem.One said that the screen went black and later she cannot use phone at all.Another said that the phone did stop to work while communicating with others.  I called LG and the unresponsible people said that they cannot give warranty as this is an international model. This phone has structural weakness. Even girls cannot hold the phone a month, who can keep that for 2 years?
Good morning,Well I would to know, that this phone do not have wi-fi...The size is perfect to me.Thanks for your interestMargarita Coronel[...]
I bought this for my husband to replace his very heavy and cumbersome company cell phone. He loved it! As far as direct connect phones go, this one is great. It's just a little heavier then a pair of sunglasses and very compact. It has an extra large screen and GPS. The features are basic but handles as a phone should. It's also very rugged looking. I just wish it had a camera.
I am a beginning runner who lives in the country. For safety, I always carry my cellphone and identification when I run, and I bought this holder to circumvent the fact that most running shorts don't have pockets.This cellphone holder is sturdy and well-constructed, but flexible enough to allow me to slide my ID/health information cards behind the phone. The band, which fits easily around the arm or lower leg, is slightly stretchy for comfort. I prefer to wear this holder around my ankle, where it seems least likely to interfere with normal circulation.While I haven't experienced this, I suppose it's possible that the heavier stitching on the back of the case may cause chafing if the holder is worn over exposed skin, although I'm inclined to doubt that this would be a problem.In conclusion, this is an excellent product for a fair price. It would be useful not only for runners, but for anyone who'd like the hold their cellphone, ID, and maybe a house key without pockets. (This product was, in fact, originally designed for horseback riders.) I am highly satisfied with this product, and would not hesitate to recommend it.
I love to go horseback riding out on the trail, and I always carry a cellphone in case of emergency. This cellphone holder can be worn on the arm or leg for secure, quick and easy access. The item description doesn't mention the adjustable velcro band is also elasticized to help keep it in place. I have worn the holder on my arm, over a slippery nylon jacket, and the holder didn't slide around as might be expected. I purchased the holder in yellow; it's a bright, bumblebee yellow, with black trim, not the soft, buttery yellow shown in the picture. Not a complaint, since it could be just the way my monitor shows it. Whatever color you might choose, I think you will find this cellphone holder a helpful item. Highly recommended!
I received 2 of these today and I first thought they were going to be too small for my Blackberry Curve 8310. However, the entire case is made of a quite stretchy but sturdy material and it expanded enough to fit my phone. The quality of the case is quite good and will not easily rip apart. As the other reviewer mentioned, the strap is elasticised and adjustable and long enough to fit around your leg but can still fit securely around your arm without having any excess stick out. It's perfect for keeping your phone on you regardless of what you're doing.

I've had the LG KC910 Renoir - Unlocked QuadBand Cellular Phone - 8 MP Camera, GPS, WiFi, FM Radio - International Version with No Warranty for about a week, and it's been a relatively good experience. At first, there was a bit of a learning curve; however, in the end, I have decided that this is a great phone. The problems I encountered dealt with the charger I received, setting up the Internet, and the auto-lock feature.First, the charger. When I received the phone last week I discovered one fatal flaw with my purchase, the wall charger was made for charging this phone in another country (I'm in the US). Fortunately, you can charge your phone via a USB cable to your computer. I also ran into trouble with this, but as it turns out, I was using the wrong USB slot. The USB slot on the right only kept the phone alive (it wouldn't charge the battery); fortunately, the USB slot on the left would charge the phone. Whatever. You can easily find a wall charger for this phone at a retail store if you want.The auto-lock feature isn't a bad idea; sadly, it can be incredibly annoying. I suppose this was made to keep you from accidentally dialing 911 or something. But it doesn't really work right. The solution? Just turn it off; your touch screen will go into sleep mode when you're not using it, and it will not come on if you touch the screen. It will come on if you push one of the three buttons on the bottom of the phone. Still, it would be incredibly difficult to accidentally dial 911 or something even without the auto-lock feature. Unfortunately, if you have to call and push buttons on your phone during your conversation, then the auto-lock still comes on. You just have to push the auto-lock icon, and it will go away (at least for a while). I don't know if that part of the auto-lock system can be turned off. Strange, I know.Ah, the Internet settings. I'm using AT&T;, and transferring the sim card into this phone was easy. The phone immediately worked when it came to calling people. By the way, reception was great for me. I've read about people who said the call quality was lacking. I don't know about their experience, but I had no problems. Anyway, the Internet is the one part of the phone that wouldn't work. I finally stumbled upon how to do it the other day, and it works great now. Here's how I got the Internet to work:Phone Setting>Connectivity>Access Point: (Data Setting)Title: AttBearer: GPRSAuth: PAPUser: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COM (all caps)Password: CINGULAR1 (ALL UPPERCASE)APN: wap.cingularBrowser>Settings>Profiles: (Internet Setting)Service Name: Media NetHomepage: [...]Connection mode: TCP without proxyIP: (blank)proxy: (blank)Security: (blank)Access Point: ATTI can't guarantee that the above code will work for you, but it's worth a shot.Other Thoughts -The camera phone is great (not dslr quality but good), the battery is okay, the touchscreen is decent, the eight gigabyte chip (microsdhc class 4) works well, sound quality is good, the included headphones are worthless; wifi works well. Is this phone an iPhone killer? Probably not, but it's definitely close.Week Two Update -It appears that the LG wall charger I bought at the retail store may have ruined my battery. It was exactly the same as the one that was sent with my phone, other than the fact that it works in the US instead of England. I managed to find another battery online, so hopefully this will correct the problem. It does seem that the battery I've been using has been problematic. I've only successfully charged it with the usb port on my computer, and that was tricky as well. So be careful when you charge this phone in the US.Final Update -The battery is working properly now. Not sure what happened but I wont be using that wall charger again. Everything else is good.
I've had this phone for three days now, and all i can say is...this phone is awsome!!! ^_^ this is much better than the viewty.. improved and i like the fact that it has wifi, puls 8 MP camera totally awsome...the video is cool it has three modes: normal, fastmode, and the slowmo (120fps)...for the camera, inorder to get a good performance and great quality for photos, different setting must be done...i just play with it and try different kinds of settings such as the white balance, ISO, Scene mode, etc..for the mp3...totally awsome, i must say DOLBY, great quality...i am not sure whats the max for the memory..i have 4 gb micro hsdc..but im gona try 8gb soon...third party is allowed too...but mostly games and java games...i installed the touch piano and guitar..drums..a lot more and they work perfectly fine..but there is one bit of problem, about the camera...i am not sure what it causes it but..after taking a lot of pictures...the phone freezes =(the phone is awsome im rating it 4 out of 5 for the cam because of the part that it hangs....but it does not really matter to me coz the phone rocks ^_^ but for the phone itself, im rating it 5 out of 5 ^_^i recommend this phone...now i don't have to bring a camera with me anymore..i just pull out my phone and take pictures anytime anywhere ^_^
When I ordered this phone back in march, it was listed as a quad band phone, as in, it would work well with ATT. That was a complete lie and I'm glad to see they've changed it. So if you live Europe or are on T mobile(I can't attest to how well it works with T mobile), this is a good phone.Media / Features-.jar games run very well, smooth with little lag-the interface is good, not great, but that's to be expected from a non smartphone. Widgets are nice and add some flair to the menu, widgets are handled on the Renoir much better than on samsung touch whiz phones.-Web browsing is good for a non smartphone, probably the best I've used. also Wifi is a great addition.-I never used the music or video playback, but divx support is a hugge plus, the radio was clear and functional.Hardware-the phones looks much better in person, the three buttons on the buttons look tacky in pictures but are very nice in person, it's no iphone, but it is a good looking phone. The back is very nice and it feels sturdy, but still plastic-The touch screen is resistive, which is a bad thing. Texting with the full soft qwerty took some getting used it and is leagues behind the iphone. Drawing using the picture editor was a nightmare, even with a stylus. Tapping numbers was good enough, as was basic menu navigation.CameraArguably the main feature of the Renoir is the 8 megapixel camera. It is an excellent camera...for a phone. Taking excellently colored shots with a good XENON(!!) flash, and plenty of in phone editing options, like filters. It is much better than the LG viewty and the Samsung ultra touch camera and comparable to the cheapest point and shoots. That said compared with a  ~$200 canon point and shoot, the Renoir gets blown out of the water. But if all you use your camera for are posed shots in outdoor lighting, this could be an acceptable replacement for a point and shoot. This is probably the best camera availabe in any phone, at least in the top 3.Go to flickr, search LG Renoir for some good sample shots.It also takes decent video, I didn't use it often though.In conclusion, I do recommend this phone for anyone looking a fun, good looking, touch screen feature phone with a great camera. I think the black version is better looking, so I would get that.
I bought this unblocked LG KC910 because I wanted a good camera cell phone to use in Brazil where I live. The phone is nice. The only negative is that it doesn't have a Portuguese language option which I wanted because that is the language spoken in Brazil. Nice pictures.
it is a good telephone, with enough applications and good design, but it has two problems. One of the problems is that ringtone almost is not listened to, that is solutionable altering ringtone in the computer.The other problem if he is more serious. Telephones LG are not compatible with iSync in the Apple computers, I understand that by an own protocol of LG. If you have a Mac you will have difficulties to enjoy the telephone.
By far the worst phone ever!Hard to use, slow, and very user UN-friendly!Save your money!  Do not buy this phone!
No 850 WCDMA (3G), GSM only  so useless in the US unless you can find a WCDMA 2100 cell site..
This BlackBerry is plain AWSOME! I won't get into all the specs since other reviews have done so.  I do have the need to point out, however, that the phone appears to come from a german-speaking country, and as a result the user's guide and phone are in german (so you'll have to walk yourself through the german menu in order to change the language)....also because of this, the Z and Y keys are switched (it's not a phone flaw, it's a QWERTZ layout since in german they use the "z" more than the "y", and also because many german words end in "tz").... that aside, it's a great buy and one you can't go wrong with! Enjoy!
I initially purchased this device in 2008 from AT&T; when it just came out and changed 3 of them since that time. First had a problem with trackball after couple of months of use. The other one had dead pixels on the screen. So I am on my third device now.  My primary aim for this device is usage of chat software(IM+), emails and internet browsing (Opera Mini). This is by far is one of the best and user friendly devices I have used. It is not laggy as windows mobile devices, The menus can be accessed quickly with no delays. And especially multitasking (which iphone lacks) is a very nice feature that has been helping me a lot while chatting, making a phone call, and watching a video or listening to the music at the same time. Of course I had to update it with the latest firmware update. Before that, I had some java errors and spontaneous reboots, but not anymore. Since the last update I can confirm that I had NO problems whatsoever. I have few complaints though which in my opinion are minor ones and I can live with them. First is the battery life. If I am not using internet very often it may last a day and a half but when I am browsing with Opera Mini or chatting on IM+ the battery drains very quickly so I have to carry another battery with me. Another thing I would prefer to have is a nice youtube player which I can't find anywhere (I tryed a couple of them). And the youtube that plays with a native browser is just garbage, which is kind of sad because other phones like Iphone and HTC touch pro 2 can play youtube quite nicely. And last but not least is the camera. Outdoors, on the bright light you can get more or less decent pictures but if you will try to shoot a video it will come out as a total crap, pixelated with distorted lighting. And the flash isn't helping much either. Unlike for example with Nokia n97 which takes pretty decent pictures and videos. But like I said these things are minor ones and since this phone is being oriented more for a business user you can't expect to have it all. Especially I like the ability to operate this device with one hand only, which comes in handy in many situations, unlike some other phones with larger keyboards I have tried. Of course another nice feature is a multilanguage support which you can not have in windows mobile phones (e.g. convert device and keyboard interface in spanish, german or other language at no charge) Now I am only expecting the release of OS 5.0 which I will immediately install on my device. So let's see how that goes. I definitely recommend Blackberry Bold for someone who is searching for a device with push email, chatting and light internet use.
Okay--right up front, I'll admit it: I have been a die-hard Palm OS addict since I first purchased one of their (ancient) organizers back in the day. I resisted switching to another brand for a slew of reasons, none of which were all that valid--at least not when I look back on it now. The Palm platform was nothing if not user-friendly...I've said it before: those who designed the Palm OS simply must have assumed it would be used by simpletons who were barely above the deep-thinking of your average Neanderthal. My wife & daughter both have Blackberry Curves, and after playing with them on and off, I further refused to consider anything other than Palm because I couldn't figure it out all that quickly. But things change...but I certainly did NOT want to, I can assure you that.About 6-8 months ago, my Palm 755p began giving me trouble. It wasn't very frequent--at first...but after a few weeks of spontaneous re-starts, some at the most unwanted times, I really began to become annoyed. Working in radio, I did a live broadcast remote at a wireless location and started to seriously consider a Windows Mobile phone (in this case, it was a Moto Q9c). I began to slowly research the Moto Q and Windows Mobile phones in particular on the web and also here at amazon.com. What I discovered was other than a select few, the majority of reviews from Windows users were by and large disappointed with their phones. The common thread wasn't the quality of the phones, but the stability of the Operating System itself.This lead me to consider Blackberry...reluctantly, but a kernal of hope took root and before long, my Treo's problems put me on the fast track to getting a phone that only months before I had vowed never to purchase. I would've loved to get another Palm, but having played with the Centro, I found the keyboard actually TOO small for me to comfortably use--and I don't have big fingers, so I think that says a lot right there. I considered a Windows phone made by Palm, but gave up after reading way too many complaints about the OS screwing up way too much. The upcoming Palm Pre looks VERY promising, but my Treo simply wasn't going to last long enough, so I took the plunge.The Bold is out of the box, striking. It's wider than my Treo but MAN is it thinner by a rather large amount--nearly half I'd say.  The keyboard is quite a bit different in several ways...let me explain: some of the icons and symbols are in entirely different locations than what I had become used to with my Treo 650, 700p and subsequent 755p. I thought it would take FOREVER to get used to that, but surprisingly it didn't at all. Also, the keyboard takes advantage of the wider real estate and is spread out further...but the REAL difference (IMO) is my Palm keys were more individual and separated and way higher than on the Bold. Now THIS took some getting used to. On my Palm it was rather easy, even without looking to move my fingers from one key to the next and simply know from that touch alone that I was on a different key. This is not the case with the Bold keyboard. It bothered me--at first, but after a few days, I have become attuned to the difference and it no longer bothers me like it initially did.The next major change is the screen...and boy is this a mighty HUGE change. First off, I have become rather accustomed to using a touch-screen now for quite some time...it was one of my biggest problems with switching to Blackberry. I briefly considered the Storm, but after playing with the virtual keyboard, I ruled that out entirely. I MUST have a keyboard--the virtual one's just don't cut it for me. The other thing is the 100% Upgrade the screen turned out to be compared with the Treo. I've read about it quite a bit and I gotta tell you, until you see it yourself, words almost cannot do it justice. This screen is unbelievably brilliant. Frickin' incredible. It's a bit wider and a tad shorter than my Palm but the display certainly looked 2 to 3 times brighter and way more clear. Off the charts a MUCH better screen. I have yet to see its equal. I cannot tell you how many times I went--out of habit--to grab the stylus in order to tap it on the screen only to realize my phone no longer has one. I hear rumor that RIM is coming out with a Bold-like phone with a keyboard and touch screen...now THAT will be a phone to look out for...but back to my Bold...I'll be honest, it is quite a change switching to an Operating System so dramatically different than the moronically simple one employed by Palm. Breaking old habits seem to be harder the older I get. Where Palm was intuitive and just plain obvious, Blackberry has been difficult and almost imposible to figure out. I chalk this up to my stubborness more than anything else...but the fact remains: the OS of my Blackberry suffers in comparison to how ridiculously easy Palm phones are to use and figure out. While I am STILL working on getting used to my phone, it DOES have some nifty features NOT found in any Palm device (yet)...for instance, the one thing that sets Blackberry's apart from EVERYTHING else out there is e-mail. This certainly is one place where the Bold not only beats Palm, but embarasses it entirely. The set-up was easy enough that even my Grandma could figure it out and within less than 10 minutes, I had 4 separate e-mail accounts up and running without a hitch. Too easy and it is definitely where the Bold shines (other than the screen).The trackball also takes some getting used to. It's nice that you can adjust the sensitivity of the ball, (much like using a mouse) so if you like to scroll quickly, you can, or if you'd like a bit more control, don't worry, you can do that, too. Another place where the Bold wins hands down is the speaker. It actually has TWO separate speakers which delivers actual stereo sound, quite loudly, I might add. Another really nifty thing if you ask me. It paired up with my Bluetooth quite easily and the sound quality from what those on the other end have told me is noticeably better than on my Palm (which was notorious for having Bluetooth issues).One thing I honestly wish Blackberry did differently is allow the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time. I always figured my wife just couldn't figure it out herself for why her's never did...but as it turns out the phone will vibrate first, and THEN ring. You cannot switch it to do both simultaneously...why, I simply have no clue. The addition of WiFi is a nice added bonus. At work I can surf using the wireless network at my office, also at home and at several friends houses out in the country where service is spotty. Another major advantage over Palm...although in fairness many newer Palms have built-in WiFi...but NONE of the models I have used ever did. 3G service is pretty nice, too...but my Treo 700p and 755p were both EVDO equipped, which are essentially the same thing, so no big difference there. Downloading websites and attachments via email online is a breeze.A couple places where Blackberry can take a cue from Palm (and I realize there aren't that many) are the lack of a switch on the outside that allows you to turn off the ringer instantly without using the screen. I also wish the button to turn on the speaker during a call was situated on the screen and activated via the trackball rather than having to push the tiny $ key on front...it just seems a bit harder to find, even in the dark with the backlight on. A small annoyance, but a valid one all the same.While I have heard many complain about the clarity of the camera, I gotta tell you its WAY better than the measly 1.3 mega-pixel standard on the Palms I've used. I snapped a photo of my little son and sent it to my wife's Blackberry Curve and she wrote back wondering where I had got the photo never once considering it had come from my phone. Sure it'd be nice to have a 3.2 mp camera like on the Storm and 8900, but all in all I am satisfied--especially having come from the inferior Treo camera. The video recorder is noticeably of less quality than the camera is, which strikes me a little odd, but I don't usually videotape much using my phone, so I don't really see that to be a problem for me--but you never know.All in all, I gotta admit--and while it was a LONG time in coming, the Blackberry has won me over. The lack of almost ANY advance in the Palm OS over the course of over 10 years is pretty inexcusable if you ask me. Seriously, my original Palm organizer (no phone) looks relatively unchanged (other than color vs monochrome) from my old Treo 755p. Sure there are a few cosmetic changes in that time, but overall, the OS looks essentially exactly the same as it did from the beginning. That certainly made it easy to figure out when you upgraded over your previous model, but come ON...really? That is much too long to hold onto an outdated OS. The upcoming Pre certainly looks way cool and is an obvious 100% upgrade on the OS, but it just may be a little too late for some--it certainly was for me.If you are a die-hard Palm user frantically becoming disillusioned with your phone, its time to seriously consider moving on and putting the old away in exchange for something enirely new...just be prepared to take a while to get used to it...knowing that alone will make the conversion much easier to handle.Kudos to Blackberry on such a fine product. Conversion complete.*****UPDATE*****I am STILL working on getting used to Blackberry's entirely different Operating System. I find myself continually reaching for a stylus that isn't there, but I am slowly adjusting to a non-touch-screen phone (emphasis on s-l-o-w-l-y).The battery...? Well, let's just say as long as you have WiFi turned off, it's reasonably okay...which is to say on par with my Treo 755p...well, maybe a shade better, but not by much.The trackball...? Surfing on the Web using the trackball is MUCH less efficient than being able to use a stylus (or my finger). I find when I want to scroll down to the bottom of a particularly large page, it can seem like forever having to scroll down so slowly. I wish it were differently--and who knows? Maybe there is a work-around that I am unaware of...The e-mail set up and usage is simply FIRST RATE I have to admit. I haven't bothered to check my e-mail using my computer in several weeks now because I simply don't NEED to. I still send e-mail using my computer because even with the QWERTY keyboard, actually writing a message is still easier using a regular-sized keyboard...but I do find myself not even trying to access e-mail online much...thanks Bold!WiFi IS VERY convenient! The only minor gripe I have is that when I am in an area with less than stellar AT&T; coverage, I turn on WiFi and the phone STILL tries to use the almost non-existent signal to go online. I naturally assumed that the phone would use the strongest signal available, but as it turns out, that isn't the case. Now that I have that figured out, it's simply a case of figuring out where my signal strengths are and remember to turn off and on WiFi and phone receiver. Yes, it IS a bit of a problem, but my Alltel 755p had poor reception where my bedroom is and I was plain SOL if I wanted to check something online--at least NOW I have an option, however inconvenient it may be (I assure you, this is a minor gripe at best).The mp3 player is incredibly easy to use--unfortunately the built-in equalizer isn't all that great and the volume isn't quite what I'd like it to be--but seeing as I have managed to mis-place (lost) my Sansa Clip mp3 player, this is at least a nice alternative that otherwise wasn't available.I downloaded Transformers and Eagle Eye recently and I MUST say, this is yet one more place where the stunning screen simply SHINES beyond the competition. Add to that the fantastic stereo speakers, and watching feature-length movies in the palm of my hand couldn't be more cool & simple.I DO wish the button to turn on the speakerphone was a bit easier to locate and turn on...once again, adding a button to access the speaker ON the screen with the trackball, well that would be a giant leap forward for this device if you ask me.I am still finding it difficult to access a couple of books I downloaded using Mobi Pocket (ie I cannot access them at all), but otherwise, I am still impressed and VERY happy.
...experience I am having since the invention of cellular phones. I am trying to switch from Verizon, unfortunately, because daughter wants the Blackberry Bold, which is available only with AT&T.; So I am going through this horrible experience. I believe I am entitled to write this under this product because you cannot get this phone unless you get the terrible service together from AT&T;, so in my view the phone and the service go together.That said, here is the rest of my predicament.I have received the three phones under a family plan for almost two weeks now (recd March 30th, today is April 12th). I am with a company which has a discounted plan with AT&T; for its employees so I have to call AT&T;'s Premier Support for activation. And if this is AT&T;'s 'premier' support I cannot even imagine what their non-premier support is like.I am in Mountain time. AT&T;'s 'premier' support closes at 9PM EST each weekday, so I've been trying to get home in time to try them between 5-7 PM my time, so that our phones don't get cutoff mid-day.Each time, I go through half a dozen prompts to end up in a waiting queue, then after 10-15 minutes I hear a couple of rings like I'm getting into someone's phone, but instead I hear a click and the line goes dead.Been going through this all past two weeks. Was then looking to the weekend when the 'support' would have more overlap with my time zone.Saturday, I start calling at 9AM MST and lo and behold now after the last prompt I'm thrown into a voice mail to leave my number for a call back.I leave my home number because I don't want to call on a line which will be deactivated, so I get stuck with my home phone. Half of Saturday goes by then I try again, leave another voice mail. Did I get a call back? You guessed..  Sunday, same thing..Then, I looked up and tried a different support number to perhaps get to a supervisor. I go through several prompts then I get an announcement 'sorry, we are having technical difficulties' and the line goes dead.I am now trying to convince my daughter that quality of support is more important than a phone and I have absolutely no desire to get stuck with inaccessible support and a terrible company for two years, no matter how good the phone may be.Have been with Verizon for 10 years. Can call their one number anytime and talk to them about anything, changing plan, my company discount, anything, all in one place. And have never waited more than five minutes on line to talk to someone.You can draw your own conclusions....
I was led to believe that this was a new and unlocked phone.  When I took it to Indonesia it would not work.  Was told that it was indeed a refurbished phone and not completely unlocked. I was very disappointed.
I have had this phone for a couple of weeks I looks and works great. I didn't give the phone five out of five for the fallowing reasons. I had trouble finding the correct setting for inter net and mms. I still can't access the 3G network. Other than that the camera is great for video and pictures. These are the setting I found for at&t.;Phone Setting>Connectivity>Access Point: (Data Setting)Title: AttBearer: GPRSAuth: PAPUser: WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COM (all caps)Password: CINGULAR1 (ALL UPPERCASE)APN: wap.cingularBrowser>Settings>Profiles: (Internet Setting)Service Name: Media NetHomepage: [...]Connection mode:  proxy onIP: (66.209.011.032)proxy: (8080)Security: (blank)Access Point: ATT
if it actually came with the Sprint logo,Just putting this out there,because this can become false advertisement,contact me asap..you have my email hunted1820,I am not mad ,just a bit pissed off that I did not get what I see here..I just called up sprint to be informed,that they cannot do anything over the phone as far as changing me from my rumor to this 6700,and I was really looking forward to using this ,Asap!!
A few points to start with.....I'm a long time (9 years) Blackberry user, and I kind of understand the way they do things.  Its not perfect, but the software is mature, and the approach is reliableI'm a business guy, and reliability and consistency are the most important things to me.  I rely on the phone and email constantly.  Cameras, MP3 players, web browsers are all nice extras, but those are secondary features.  If the camera never worked, I wouldn't care.I'm also very very satisfied with Verizon wireless, and their service has never let me down.  I've always had a Verizon phone, as well as a Blackberry device (which also tended to included a GSM phone on either Cingular and lately AT&T; for the past 5 years or so), which I used internationally as I travel pretty heavily.  AT&T; has been very very unreliable in the US, which is why I always have made sure to have Verizon, as it is been totally reliable for myself and my large family.  The Storm is a "World Phone" and includes a GSM transceiver and SIM card.I made a horrible mistake recently of trying to make an LG Dare work as an adult phone and email device, and after 5 months of banging my head against the wall, with its terrible reliability, awful screen handling, and non existent email capabilities, I finally surrendered and went and bought a Storm.On the StormI waited until now to get the Storm, so I have the benefit of all the bug fixes of the past month.  One reason that I decided to go back to Blackberry was that RIM actively maintains and updates their software.  The LG Dare experience was awful, with only 1 (and a weak one at that) software update since its initial release 7 months ago.  The RIM and Blackberry experience are not the same as an iPhone (which I probably would have bought if it was on Verizon, but AT&T; has just let me down too many times)I think its important to understand that if you are a Blackberry user, and understand what their whole thing is about, the Storm will feel comfortable to you.  If you are expecting a trendy cool iPhone gadget to show your friends and watch youtube videos on all day, you might want to look somewhere else.The hardware is typical RIM quality.  It is heavy and built like a tank.  The buttons are familiar BBerry buttons.  The whole chassis is clearly made to take abuse.  The touchscreen has an interesting "push/click" thing going on, that makes it pretty easy to use the interface.  The LG Dare and iPhone have a less definitive touch screen, although the Dare gives nice feedback when you hit keys.  But with the Storm I find it much easier to navigate and select, with less "false" selections.  You navigate, then click.  There are still some "false" selections, but very very few.The phone call quality is very very good.  Probably the best I've ever had with a RIM device.  My most recent BBerry was a Curve through AT&T; which had awful call quality in the US, but was decent everywhere else the world.  The Storm is very good, which is what I expect from Verizon.Email is of course RIMs main franchise, and as usual, it is terrific.  Its just state of the art, amongst the best that there is.  It uses the usual Blackberry software hierarchy and menus, so if you understand them, and find them useful, the Storm will be good for you.  Navigation will take some getting used to, because the touchscreen eliminates/consolidates things like the wheel or small joystick that past BBerrys have used.  But the new approach makes sense after a while.As far as configurability, the Storm is terrific.  You can set the hard buttons to do all sorts of things, change the screen functions, and reorganize the phone to your liking (something which the Dare did not allow).I would give the browser a 8/10, as either it has a mind of its own, or I haven't mastered it yet. It has some automated magnification functions that work well, until they make the web page unusable.  It might be operator error on my part.I haven't really used the Camera yet, although my kids say its nice.  But I already have a camera, and have never been much of a cell phone camera user.I am a huge music lover though, and so far the MP3 player seems useful, it can be set up as a normal USB type flash memory device so you can simply copy your songs onto it.  One unfortunate thing about it is that RIM has for some insane reason selected Roxio to provide a media manager (along with the atrocious Rhapsody/Real DRM and adware infested disaster that Verizon has been swindled by).  The choice of Rhapsody/Real or Roxio is like choosing between sawing off your own head with rusty chainsaw or doing rootcanal on yourself with a jackhammer....  just an awful choice of 2 adware infested, computer destroying pieces of software.  Not good.  I'm still experimenting with other media players to sync up music.All in all, the Storm works for me as of now.  I'll try to update this as I learn more about the Storm.  But from what I can tell, it is as good a piece of hardware as RIM has ever made.  And if you are looking for a decent device for a few years, its really a decent choice, as RIM completely understands how to maintain software and fix bugs.  It seems that only Apple, RIM and the Windows Mobile devices will stand a chance as being long term platforms that you can rely on.  All other "smartphones" don't seem to be built by companies with attention spans longer than 10 minutes.UPDATE:  April 23 2009Been living with the Storm now for several months.  There are some observations worth adding to the initial impressions I had above.Overall, the Storm is a vintage Blackberry, with typical navigation, menus, selections, and features that Blackberry users will understand.  Even though it is a touchscreen, it still feels like home, after having Blackberry devices for the past 10 years.Call quality continues to amaze me.  The radio is absolutely tenacious....  it will hold a signal longer and better than most phones I have ever owned.  Dropped calls are very very rare, even in sketchy areas...  we are skiers and spend plenty of time in mountainous regions, and it even holds onto calls in those terrains.Touchscreen operations are an acquired taste.  I have gotten the hang of it and have really begun to enjoy the flexibility.  This is the same for any touchscreen device, phone or otherwise.  The touch and click approach has turned out to be extremely useful, and it prevents false selections.  I never find that the phone called someone when I put it into my pocket.  This is a nice feature, and I wonder why anyone would complain about it.Email is absolutely stellar.  I have several accounts running on it.  The method of aggregation of all communications is great.  Nothing else need be said.  Blackberry IS mobile email.  There is no better.Media operations are simply excellent.  I have abandoned my faithful Sansa MP3 player in favor of the Storm.  It is an excellent music player, bar none.  Music players are a commodity, the functionality is well understood and pretty simple, and the Storm is just fine in this respect.  Videos look terrific too, although I don't use it for video that much because of my middle age eyes...Bluetooth functions well, even in my brain damaged Acura (which thinks its good, but is very very not good).  Sound quality via bluetooth is quite good.The major area of complaints about the storm, revolve around navigation and strangeness associated with touchscreen operations and navigation.  While RIM has released many updates for the Storm, Verizon has failed (miserably I might add) to release ANY updates to the Storm since it was released by Verizon.  Now, I love Verizon wireless, and they are extremely reliable, however, they are SO SLOW with software updates on their phones, it has become downright ridiculous.I understand that they have a HUGE customer base, and a tiny bug that may affect a tiny percentage of their customers could flood support lines and stores.  But its been 5 months, and nary a peep from VZW about Storm bug fixes.  The screen does crash, and the motion sensor does get confused.  But this has been addressed in numerous updates that other wireless carriers have distributed.I did indeed install another carriers RIM OS on my Storm, which has GREATLY improved navigation and screen problems.  I just wish VZW would get it together.All in all, I have really come to rely on the Storm.  And once I updated the software, nearly ALL the screen problems went away.Its important to note, that the Blackberry Storm (like nearly ALL Blackberrys) are complex devices and not fashion phones, or toys.  For folks looking for a device to help them conduct life and business, it is a great device.  For those thinking it is a fun toy for watching youtube, and doing all sorts of trendy webby kind of things, the Storm may not be for you.
Note that anyone looking to buy this phone should consider two things.1) Most early reviews were based off of a pseudo-beta initial release of the phone software (v65). The phone has since been updated and works exceptionally well. Look for reviews AFTER 12/15/2008.2) This phone is a powerful productivity tool, NOT a toy. For users wanting an entertainment device with plenty of games, buy the iPhone. For users wanting an unmatched phone, email client, contact/task database, all rolled into a high-res screen with sufficient multimedia ability, buy the Storm. Many reviewers are blaming the phone for their own inability. Yes, it might seem complicated at first but it gets the job done unlike any other phone. If you want a simple toy/ipod, again, look elsewhere.Also, the iPhone vs Storm comparisons are getting way out of hand (see first review: Grant). These two phones are completely different with one exception, the touchscreen. To prove the point, below is a cut/paste from a post I ran across in another forum (note I can't vouch for all info, still it should be useful when considering this purchase):Hope this helps.MD-----------------------Storm vs iPhone (aka: Storm DOES have, iPhone *DOES NOT* have):- 3D click-through screen (capacitive touch PLUS tactile click)- MMS (TXT messages with pictures attached)- ability to record videos- WMV video support- WMA audio support- 3GPP RTSP website audio/video streaming- copy/paste via multitouch- better camera (3.2mp vs 2mp = 60% improvement)- 2x digital camera zoom (vs none)- camera flash- camera autofocus & image stabilization- better screen resolution (480x360 vs 480x320 = 12% improvement)- full QWERTY keyboard (PLUS SureType)- second mic for active noise cancellation during phone calls- removable/replaceable battery- better battery life w/ 1400 mAhr (5.5-6.0hrs vs 5.0hrs = 10-20% improvement) (+ even more with Seidio extended 1600mAhr battery!)- replaceable metal backing (vs plastic, non-replaceable)- MicroSD memory card expandable up to 32GB- 10x hard buttons (4 front, 2 top, 4 side)- voice-command dialing- global phone: CDMA/EVDO.A/UMTS/HSPA/EDGE/GPRS/GSM (works on VZW and includes a SIM card for travel abroad)- true, lean email push w/ compression (vs battery draining ping-pong workaround)- DOD-level encryption and security (with remote management via BES or Unite)- syncronize contacts, tasks, memos, calendar with Yahoo! PIM, Outlook, Lotus Notes, etc- save attachments & send attachments from media card or internal memory- open PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT files- invite attendees to calendar meetings- ability to use any music manager (vs iTunes-only restriction)- high-speed PC modem via USB tethering- third-party application multitasking (aka background applications)- Assisted GPS for turn-by-turn voice navigation with third-party applications (VZNavigator, Garmin, TeleNav)- mass storage mode (allows drag/drop of files via Windows Explorer)- BlueTooth 2.0 with stereo headset, A2DP/AVRCP audio streaming, file-sharing, wireless printing, etc- horizontal charging dock for "clock mode" and movie viewing- better Verizon contracts and cheaper price plans- better 3G network (Verizon EVDO Rev. A vs AT&T; HSDPA scarce coverage and slower uploads)- open architecture app install (vs Apple collecting a buck for EVERYTHING you buy)On AT&T;, spotty 3G coverage requires the WiFi alternative...VZW 3G coverage is everywhere, hence no need to compensate with an additional chip that would raise prices and reduce battery life.iPhone, game over.-----------------------
There are some pretty chatty reviewers here so I'll just bottom line it for you. As a web browser and general all-around application tool, the Storm is far superior to the Bold (and the Curve) due to it's large touch screen. As a mail READER, the Storm is also superior.As alluded to by numerous other reviewers, the only non-superior aspect of the device is the maximum speed at which a user can type out a message. For generating email & text, a traditional quality keyboard such as on the Curve (and to a lessor extent the Bold) will actualize your maximum typing speed... if that's what's most important to you.For me, the ease of navigating screens and applications (to include READING email) via the touch screen is far more important than maximum typing speed (I have an office computer and a notebook with broadband; either of which I will use to generate most of my wordy emails. I use the blackberry mostly to keep abreast of what's going on while away from those primary computing tools). Using the trackball of the Bold and the Curve is much more cumbersome for the regular away from desk tasks of reading email, browsing the web, updating Twitter, etc.There is also currently a socio-capitalistic elitism to be enjoyed by having the touch screen of the Storm (sure, deny it if you want, and hate me for bringing it up, but you know in your heart that like me, you enjoy having the coolest new toy in the office, and this is it!).Summary: I read 30 email messages a day on my phone, but only respond or generate a few... the keyboard's maximum typing speed is of secondary concern for you if you share my same use model (and the web browsing on the Storm, like the iPhone, is absolutely joyous!)
Hello everyone, I've had this phone for the past 3 weeks and felt I was ready to write my own review for it.A bit of background on me so you know a little bit more of where i'm coming from.I'm 18 years of age so still rather young compared to most others, but I have quite an busy life which includes college, family, 2 jobs, and yes, bills. I am also rather tech savvy, at an intermediate/expert level.Blackberry Storm 9350!I'll give you a bottom line right off the bat for this product:If you want a phone for it's entertainment and good - not the best - business applications I would go with the storm.If you want a hardcore business phone go with the Curve or Bold as it's more suitable for emails and is much faster to type with if your on the go.The reason why I say this is because this is the first Blackberry with so many entertainment features like free news sent right to you phone you just click on to read, your own customizable ring tones, an amazing screen for ultimate video, a great camera (takes some time to actually take the picture but it's the same with other quality cell phone camera's), great email abilities, coming out with good applications making it a formidable foe to the iphone once again, free google maps and other browsers for your various needs, including the firefox alpha and opera mini!The only cons that I have found with this phone have been the fact that not as many applications that i'd like to get have been released, but that is not the phone's problem since it hasn't been out very long. Also the fact that if you purchased music from Itunes you have to tamper with it to transfer that music to your phone, I don't buy music from Itunes but I still don't like to be limited in that sense. The last con I have for this phone would be that when I go to actually answer the phone it has a bit of a lag, a time difference when i switch the phone from landscape to portrait or vice versa, and that makes it difficult if you want to ignore the phone call, as you can answer it using the actual answe button an the bottom of the phone without a problem.In the end yes this phone is a multimedia tool with the blackberry backbone for some good business tools, and as of yet I cannot find a valid reason to give it any less than a 5 star review as I believe for the price of $150 and verizon's coverage you can't go wrong with this smartphone.
I've had the Storm now for nearly 4 months.  Got mine the day they released them.  In that time I've grown quite attached to this device and the closer they get to the "Gold Code" operating system, the better it gets.  Yes, I do think it got pushed out the door a little before it was ready, yes I think it still needs a little tweaking to the O.S. and yes I still think it's the best thing since beer.  The combination of GPS and internet has gotten me to and from places I was unfamiliar with, my email gets to me within a minute after it arrives, voice quality is good, bluetooth functions perfectly (and does stereo too!), SMS/MMS messaging works nicely, it records video, and the camera 9while it could be a little faster) takes amazing pictures even as close as 1.5 inches from the lens.  It's GREAT for taking photos of text documents and what not...something most cameras (especially on phones) can't handle.  And to top it off, it links to my car stereo via bluetooth for MP3 playback, which is the coolest thing ever.So yeah, I love this phone!  Is it for everyone?  No.  It takes a couple weeks to get used to how it functions and using the keyboard.  Once you get it down tough, it's great.  Anyone who gave in after only a day or two should have tried a little harder, but they're missing out. ;)
This phone is fantastic.  The touchscreen takes about 20-30 minutes of playing with to get used to the click, especially if you are used to the iPhone or iPod Touch.  Also, the Blackberry operating system takes about a week or two to fully understand.  After that initial learning period, the Storm is great fun.  The battery life is excellent, it lasted about 8 hours of constantly playing music and is very durable (I accidentally dropped it about 4ft with no damage).  Mine had no software problems, though I do know someone who did.  The service is excellent, the software is excellent, and after the many negative reviews I have read, it is shockingly phenomenal.
I liked this phone at the beginning, but after having it for a year, I've changed my mind. Compare this to an Iphone or Android phone, and you'll be disappointed. I was pulling for Blackberry, but my emotional connection has given way to my intellect.Lets start with the applications. Blackberry App world is abysmal compared to the competition. The App World icon disappears from my phone every time I download an app and have to restart, so I have to use the web interface from my laptop to send a link to my phone. Convenient huh!? One of the most useful features about the new smart phones, are the apps. Unfortunatly many of the apps for the Blackberry are not written for the Storm. Whatever you do, if you get this phone, don't look at the apps available for the Iphone or Android phones, you'll be very disappointed. If they are available for the Blackberry, they don't have the same functionality or visualizations that you'll get on the competitors phones.Sometimes when I'm on a call to some customer service number, when I bring up the keypad to press a number, I get a disfigured keypad with only a couple of numbers and some symbols. Not the greatest when the days of the human operator are in the past.The Blackberry internet browser isn't nearly as good as the browser on Android or the Iphone. Sure you can download another browser, but they're still not as good. Blackberry has promised improvements in this area, but still hasn't delivered.A reboot of this phone takes 3+ minutes and is required occasionally when the phone freezes up, or when you install or uninstall a new application.Blackberry phones are great, but stick with the traditional Blackberry. They've been left in the dust by the competition when it comes to touch screen smart phones. Don't fool yourself into thinking you'll be happy with this phone if you want the functionality of an Iphone or Android phone.
Executive summary:Not ready for business phone use.  Too slow, and freezes too often. Excellent email capabilities, but all Blackberry's (BB's) have that.  Fun phone with a lot of easy to download third party applications, including free GPS.  Phone will either crash (Which requires a battery pull and about a 5 minute reboot sequence) or freeze for 1 min+, once or more a day.  As a result of this, it is not reliable enough for business use.  For personal use, these things are not that big of a deal IMHO.Full review:So you've read a million different reviews and they all seem to be either it is the greatest phone in the world, or it is the biggest piece of crap that Blackberry has ever made.  So who is right?  Well, like all things, it would depend on what the person values in a PDA.  I will try to reserve from personal judgement as much as possible and just list the facts.A bit of background on me, I am a techie, and have used smartphones for both business and personal use for about 4 years now.The Cons of the Storm:1) Slow rebooting time, it is not an exageration to say it is over 5 minutes.  This would not be as big of an issue if the Blackberry Storm did not crash so frequently.  As I've owned it for about a month and I think I can count on one hand the days that it hasn't crashed so far, this can get very annoying and is completely unacceptable for business use.2)It will frequenty freeze for no reason ESPECIALLY when there is an incomming call, making it impossible to answer.3) The portrait "Answer" button and the Landscape "Ignore" button seemingly overlap, so if you are picking up the phone and turning it, you may accidentally hit ignore to a call you meant to accept, or worse...vice versa.  Being that when you pick up the phone, you will almost definitely turn it...this is unforgivable as a business use device.4) If you are using the keypad and a call comes in, you may very well fall victim to what happens in # 3, as depending upon what you are clicking when the call comes in, you will either be answering or ignoring the call before you even know it happened.5) Many people complain that it sounds like you are talking through a wall unless you put your mouth directly over the microphone.  Oddly enough, this issue is 100% resolved when you put the person on speakerphone.6) It is slow.  It can take 1-2 seconds to go from screen to screen.  This may not seem like a lot of time, but it can get frustrating to some people.  I have seen some video comparisons with the Storm Vs. The Pearl or Curve, and the lag on the Storm is VERY noticable when looked at side by side.7) The media player is difficult to navigate and takes an excessive amount of time to go from song to song (4-6 seconds).  Also, quite frequently, it does not carry the volume you listened to the previous song onto the next one.8) A lot of backlight comes out from all four sides of the screen...this is worrysome as that means that a lot of dust gets in, and in the long run it could mean that your Blackberry may break sooner than it should.9) This is more an Apple issue than a Blackberry, but just to confirm, (although Apple "claims" they are doing away with this), you CAN NOT use any song that was purchased on Itunes on your Blackberry.  There is a Blackberry program that uses tricky verbiage to make you believe otherwise, IE "Copy your entire Itunes playlist to your Blackberry."  For clarity purposes they should add "Unless the songs were purchased through Itunes directly, as the Data Protection Management will block the transfer."  Yes, there are ways around this but it would take someone with extra time on their hands and a bit of tech savy...or $30-$50 to purchase a program that will do it.  As I said, this is more an Apple issue than Blackberry, but I know some people want to know this, and it is rarely posted.10) No Wi-Fi, although, apparently the Canadian version will be getting it and making it available on both AT&T; and Verizon.Those are the Cons I can think of (I will update this posting as more come up, or the priors are fixed)The Pros:1) Interchangable battery, this shouldn't be a "pro" but since one of the biggest cons of the Iphone is that you can't, it is definitely a plus for the storm.2) Comes with an 8 GB Micro SD card that is upgradable to 16 gigs.  Also something that you can't do on the Iphone, you get what you pay for.3)  Very easy to set up email, including Outlook Web that works just as well as regular enterprise activation, but without the additional charge from Verizon.  The difference being no Outlook calendar or automatically synced contacts.4)  A lot of fun third party applications, games.5) You can instantly turn any song on your phone into a ringtone for free, or you can just copy your mp3's into the "ringtone" folder from your computer to your Blackberry.  This is a nice, unmentioned feature.  Any Mp3 you have (provided it's not from Itunes) you can just plop in your Blackberry and it's a ringtone.6) GREAT speakphone, both in people hearing you, not hearing background noise and you hearing people on it.  Easily the best speakerphone on any cellphone/smartphone I've ever used.7) The call screen has easy, big buttons to put it on speakerphone, mute, and add an additional caller.  Ease of use makes this a big plus in my opinion, and not having to flop around to a side button that you aren't sure if it does what you think it does is nice.8) The browser works very well, and I haven't had an issue with any web page clicking through.  If a page isn't work correctly with the click of the phone, there is an option to click on a button that gives you a mouse cursor, and just putting the mouse cursor over any clickable link always works.9) The screen is larger than the Iphone and looks absolutely brilliant, vibrant, bright, etc...pretty much imagine a high end LCD computer monitor shrunk.10) Average battery life.  If it's used heavily, it'll last your work day...if used lightly (IE, no video and no internet) it'll last a full day.  The ability to swap in a backup battery though makes this a pro, as really with two batteries, you have an unlimited amount of time as the batter recharges extremely quick (From near empty to full in 2 hours or so).Bottom line:If you are using it for personal use, you'll love it.  If you are using it for business use, you are going to hate it.
Have had this phone for almost 2 months.  Already had to exchange the first one and will be taking back my current one for similar problems. Phone has shut off on its own many times and gone to white screen, then takes a couple minutes to turn on again.  Sometimes I press screen and it does not work! sometime screen flips to wrong side for viewing (if I'm holding it upright, the picture is running 180 counterclockwise and won't display correctly. Have gotten SOOOOOO frustrated with this phone!! I have small skinny fingers and have problems getting it to hit the right letters! Sending texts is nerve racking! somehow every time I go to hit "send" (which is inconveniently hidden and have to press extra buttons as it is)--it registers as save draft, and then I have to waste more time going back to find the file, open it up, and finally sending it.  Not a user friendly phone--everything takes much more time! making calls, txt, and checking your message ALL take much longer than they did on my cheap little razor (I almost wish I never gave it up now for a blackberry).  I end up waiting to get on my home computer if I need to google something--because that is a whole nother pain in the @$$! I hear the curve is better and easier.
I think the reviews this phone received were unfair. In fact, I originally didn't give this phone a chance and got an Omnia instead (which I hated and returned, btw. winmo needs to die). Finally in frustration I tried the Storm, not expecting much. Since I've had it, I've grown to like the phone more and more. It's a great alternative to an iphone, if you're going to use it for music, video, internet, etc. The phone is no more laggy than an iphone (it just doesn't have the flashy transitions that iphone does). If you need a real qwerty, get something else, but I rarely type long diatribes on my phone, mostly short responses, and this is more than adequate for that. The screen on this thing is amazing (better than iphone), plus you can multi-task unlike the iphone. I regularly listen to Slacker Radio and surf the internet, which I can't do on the iphone. The surepress thing took a couple days to get used to. I don't think it adds much to the phone, but it doesn't subtract either. You gain some functionality, like the ability to select an option and open a contextual menu without activating anything; but typing is slowed to an extent.I get through an entire day of use- watching tv shows, listening to and downloading podcasts, calling, sms, internet, with some battery life left. I get a couple extra hours over the Omnia, which I used for a month.I also want to give an extra shout-out to podtrapper. I listen to podcasts a lot, and podtrapper is an excellent program for downloading and listening to podcasts. The best I've used.I'd highly recommend people take advantage of the 30 day guarantee and try this phone out. It's worth it to be able to stay on Verizon!
If your in the market for a new cell phone contract and smart phone, in my opinion, the Blackberry storm is the way to go. That is not to say that the storm is without faults but really all of the new smart phones do. Just so everyone know I DO own a storm and have been using it for a about week now so I feel I can offer a true opinion about the phone.Lets start off with the good...The number one reason that I choose this phone over the others is the Verizon network. I have been a Verizon customer for over 6 years now and only once have I ever had drop call. I recently drove from Boston, MA to central Florida and the phone never lost a bar the entire time I was on the highway (my Acura displays the phone batt life and signal strength on the dashboard). On top of the network there is a really cool phone. Besides owning a Blackberry curve for one day, I have never owned a smart phone and have very little experience with Blackberry. This give me an unbiased opinion of the phone without trying to compare to other Blackberry phones.The phone is fast, I streamed a local radio station through a free app called flycast for a couple of hours without any issues. I also love that the included software with the phone syncs all contacts with your computer. Just the fact that you can copy, paste, and edit makes this phone a great choice. Some people complain about the clickable screen but once you get use to it, it helps reduce the accidental button press. The build quality, battery life, removable battery and memory card, ability to open word and excel files, and great speaker are just a few of the awesome feature of this phone.The bad...There is a learning curve with this phone. If you used an iphone or ipod touch, this phone will drive you crazy at first but once you realize that it is a different phone with different feature you'll quickly realize that the phone fun. My biggest issues with the phone is the apps available. The iphone/ipod touch has an awesome apps store where the Blackberry does not. (I hoping that since the phone is so new that in time it will get better. Another big disappointment is the lack of wifi but since the Verizon network is so wide and fast it really is not as big of a deal. My wife and I did a race with the storm on Verizon and Ipod touch one Wifi to a website neither one our devices had previously visited. In three raceses, the storm won 2 out of 3 races.Over all the phone and network are great. There is some room for improvement so that is why I only gave 4 stars. Also note that I purchased the phone with the latest OS update 4.7. It is my understanding that the previous version had many issues. For anyone with the old software I highly recommend updating. Just remember that this is not an iphone and has its own personality. Once you get past that you will really love the phone like I doP.S. I highly recommend installing opera mini web browser, flycast radio stations streamer, and vlingo which is a speak to text software that lets you text, email, update facebook and search the internet all with your voice.
Blackberry StormFirst, full disclosure, I did not buy my Storm from Amazon. I got it directly from Verizon (new every two discounts, gotta love 'em!). As such, I can't rate the Amazon buying experience and this review will focus solely on the phone--hardware and software.Onwards to the phone then. I considered myself somewhat of a fashionable Luddite. I am generally adverse to complicated devices, however, I am a total sucker for a pretty face. Here the Storm performs well. It's a great looking device. Sleek in the hand and on the desk, it is the epitome of modern design. Black as night with streaks of chrome. Slim lines and simple buttons. I may find myself in the minority here, but I prefer it's look to the iPhone. Something about Apple's products doesn't sit well with me--too many rounded corners perhaps.In terms of complication and ease of use, again the Storm does well. It has buttons (thank the Lord), all of which make sense, the green button answers the phone the red one hangs up. No reinventing the wheel here. The escape button was almost certainly designed by a man who has spent countless hours on a Treo trying to undo whatever he just did (not that he has any idea as to what he just did). There are two programmable buttons on the sides. I liked this as they did not do what I intuitively thought they should, so I simply changed their function. Lock locks, Mute mutes and the volume buttons do the volume button thing. The Blackberry button does everything else. And I mean everything. Send an email. Take a picture. Reprogram the email settings. Kill a man in Reno, just to watch him die (watch out for that function!).The Blackberry button is in itself a revelation. This is my first Blackberry device and the inclusion of this button has sold me on all of their products. As long as their devices have this button I will buy their products. I was initially worried that it would complicate things; that  my inner Luddite would grow tired of cycling through menus. In reality, by having almost every feature work using the same process you find doing things with the Storm--even if you have never done them before--is almost instinctively easy. I firmly recommend, when you get your device, to learn to use one feature, email, for example. Learn everything about it and you will find that you already understand how to use other features without ever having tried them before. With the sole exception, perhaps, of the clitoris I have never been more enthusiastic about learning to manipulate a little button.Other great features: the web browser is superb, the screen renders wonderfully and when the on-screen keyboard disappears very easy to read. Email is brilliant and simple to set up. Although, I would warn newcomers to the device that Hotmail will put up one hell of  a fight--this is not fault of the Storm which actually does a great deal to compensate for Microsoft's intransigence. Media player works great, although the interface is very simple which I approve of (again, Luddite) but which may bother people more used to the current lineup of iPhones. Copy and Paste, Word, Excel and PowerPoint are all excellent features you won't find on an iPhone.There are some areas that I like but which could be problematic for others. The screen, love it or hate, there is no middle ground. I love it, and sincerely hope this technology is exported to other devices. My girlfriend, on the other hand, hates it. The thing with the screen is, love it or hate it, you need practice. It is not a natural sensation to push in a screen. Years of cultural conditioning telling you to keep your greasy fingers off the screen need to be overcome before you can use the Storm comfortably. The Suretype keyboard is another love-it-or-hate-it features. I actually like it now but initially it drove me nuts. Again, with practice it comes naturally. Besides, if you really hate Suretype just turn the phone sideways and boom, there is a Qwerty keyboard ready to go.The keyboards have their issues, however the clickable screen makes using them easier on the Storm than on the iPhone. In the end, there is no replacement for a physical keyboard, but I feel confident is saying this is the closest anyone has got--this far, anyway. Move you thumb over a letter on the screen. The key you want is surrounded by a blue halo then you press down to confirm. You quickly get used to this system. I will also say the Qwerty keyboard is by far the hardest to master (little keys, smaller halos).And now onto things to worry about. By now, everyone has heard of the original Operating System bugs. RIM and Verizon rushed the Storm before it was ready. These bugs have largely been erased by software updates. But be aware, there are still some problem areas. The accelerometer is not nearly as quick as the one on the iPhone. While an iPhone feels like an extension of your body, the Storm remains distinctly mechanical. There is the odd freeze, this happens every now and then. Usually the freeze is just long enough to give you a heart stopping, anus contracting fright before the Storm shakes whatever was bothering it off. Occasionally these freezes last, in these cases simply take out the battery, wait 30 seconds and put it back in. Bada-bing Bada-boom the phone is back to its happy little self. *A quick tip, be sure to close all applications by using the Blackberry button's 'close' feature as opposed to the red hang-up button, this helps prevent crashes. There is also a bit of a lag when opening certain functions such a the photo gallery. When I bought my Storm the Verizon guy said a new software update was due soon, Internet rumors seem to confirm this. All I can say is that if they do what they should have done in the beginning and get the software perfect, this phone is going to be epic.In all, this phone is a little marvel. Easy to use and understand, it works well. It will take some getting used to, there is very little that will prepare you for that clickable screen, but if you can handle having to put some practice in it is worth the effort. Any quirks that are still hanging around are regrettable, maybe even unacceptable, but still the Storm makes up for them in a variety of ways.
I just purchased this phone yesterday and I was super excited.  I'm totally keen on an iPhone but we have Verizon and I just can't switch to AT&T.;  I love it except for one thing... it keeps crashing!  Seriously, and it doesn't matter what I do.  On a phone call, typing, reading an email.  I'm going to exchange it for a different one to see if it is any better or else I'm going to swap it for a different Blackberry.
As our own President Obama can attest to it, it is really hard to go back to any other phone once you become accustomed to using a blackberry.I am usually all things apple.  I use mac, own several of ipods..etc, but when it comes to mobile phone use, I just couldn't give up using a bberry(coming from Curve & pearl).  ( I played around with iPhone for a month but it really wasn't any different than ipod touch that I had because the phone was pretty much useless with all the dropped calls)With the Storm, I'm no longer require to carry a business phone, personal phone, ipod or a portable DVD player.About the only "con" I can think of about the storm is that, I can not type as fast as I used to on the Curve.( but then again, I don't think i can type as fast on any touch screen phone)also, the plug is micro USB instead of miniUSB.  which mean I can no longer use the car charger from my other bberries/or motorola chargers...MotoQ or razr.By no means, this is a perfect phone.  It has it's imperfactions.  But then again, other winMO, treo or iphone have their share of short comings or faults as well.  Yes, storm does freeze, resets once in awhile(which seemed to have stopped with OS upgrade).  But to me this really isn't a "con" as seeing that every other phone out there will all freeze/reset occasionally.  That's just a nature of electronics.  I mean, have you owned a smartphone/mac/PC that didn't freeze or stall on you once in awhile(ctrl+alt+Del)??Having few months under my belt, I can say that lot of the problems people have addressed in their reviews are fixable with OS upgrade and/or by having settings set correctly.  I've been an early adapter for phones like MOTO Q, Treos, and iPhone.  Compared to those phones, I think RIM is coming along just fine as far as working out the kinks and having bugs fixed thru OS updates.  Even the iphone fanboys have to admit, it took them almost a year before iphone became where it's at current state.Now to some things I like about this phone.- Verizon network coverage..  Call quality is superb as usual just like all of my past Bberries.  not 1 dropped call.(might be a RIM hardware thing, cuz my Moto Q used to drop calls once in awhile)**set aside all the bells and whistles, this should be your most important factor in choosing a phone.  I'm not suggesting Verizon has best coverage in your area..  I'm sure there are areas verizon lacks coverage where others excel at.- instant email & Blackberry Messenger  (2 things that no other phones can compare/compete with and what makes it my "crackberry")- being able to use AIM, Yahoo MSGer, google talk all simultaneously  (waiting on Jivetalk to come out with  the update, which will enable me to use 1 program for all IM programs)- visual voice mail(being able to check vmail without having to call in...shows lengh of msg, who it's from..etc before you even check the actual message)- shooting videos, being able to upload online(eg. youtube) rightaway, or sending via MMS- takes great quality of photos (easy upload to flkr, facebook..etc)- using Trapster, getting warnings about upcoming speedtraps, camera lights is a lifesaver($$$ saver too)- streaming online radios (Moodio, flycast..etc)- Being able to wirelessly sync(google sync) contacts, calendar with Google acct.- Full fuctional GPS with 3rd party apps.  (trapster, Nav4all..etc)- Full HTML browsings  (if BB browser doesn't do it for you, check out BOLT browser)- being able to just drag&drop; movies, songs, ringtones, pics straight into storm without 3rd party app. (both on Mac and PC) you can use it like a flash Drive or external Hard Drive.- Great Media player  (viewing photos, music, Video)  Watching a full length movie on the storm is amazing.  Really no other phone out there can compare to quality of this screen  except maybe Blackberry BOLD.- Being able to listen to music/movie via bluetooth headset/speaker or having it piped thru my car stereo via bluetooth using (Motorokr T505)- not sure what other documents it can open/view, but I was able to open MS word, Excel, Powerpoint slide show, & Adobe PDF files no problems on storm.- being able to tether via bluetooth to use as wireless modem for my laptop.- Being able to changeout batteries and micro SD card.  (Those long plane rides are not so long anymore with 2 extra batteries and a extra 16GB cards along with 8GB card that came with the phone)*I covert my DVD's to 600-700MB sized file, so you can imagine how many movies I can carry on a 16GB card.-being able to Multitask.  eg. I can listen to streaming radio while my AIM is online in the backgroud and I'm checking my email.- Being able to have it "Unlocked" - took me about 5 mins with Vzw rep to have my phone SIM unlocked.  This means, even though it is a CDMA phone here in US, when I travel overseas, I can just pop in a pre-paid GSM SIM card from that country without having to pay for roaming fees(this makes a truly world phone for me).  I did test with my buddy's AT&T;, T-Mo simcard to make test calls/txts and it worked flawlessly.**I'm not saying other phones aren't capable of these things.  I'm just stating some things that I like doing on/about the storm.With few more OS updates and upcoming Apps store in March, I would never trade this for any other phone that are currently out in the market.  (Bberry Bold & Curve 8900 would be an exception, but then again, AT&T; & T-MO really can't compare to network coverage and Quality of Verizon in my area)
I have played with the iPhone, mostly when friends put theirs down and I started to mess with apps or oogled the rotating screen, or while loading music or video for long drives, but the iPhone was just that: a toy. I contemplated getting one and was conflicted between using an upgrade to get the Storm or switching to AT&T; to get the iPhone. Luckily, a friend of mine talked me out of getting the iPhone (then after messing around my new Blackberry Storm the day I purchased it, he made the switch the very next day as well).-Learning Curve: if you are an iPhone user it may take some time getting used to the Blackberry Storm, but having never owned an iPhone, I found the Storm itself incredibly easy and intuitive to use.-Stability: I hear nothing but complaints from friends and family over the iPhone constantly crashing, dropping calls, and losing outgoing emails or texts. This Blackberry storm has been incredibly stable and reliable, and I generally have better reception with it in most areas than iPhones when I compare bars and call quality with friends and family. Part of that is the more stable Verizon Network I use as compared to AT&T;, and part is the phone itself, since I've heard Blackberry's on the AT&T; network are much more stable than iPhones as well. Something about either the iPhone's hardware or software is incredibly unreliable and buggy.-Messaging: Within a few days I fell in love with the ability to view and manage email with my Blackberry and rarely have to check my email from home or work. Anyone that has ever used a Blackberry probably already knows all about this, but it was an eye opener for me. I doubt I will ever be able to go back to a regular phone.-Software: First, the software that came with my Blackberry does not work with Vista, so you have to go find it online and download, which was a minor annoyance. The software is a bit sparse and tougher to figure out how to use all the options than the iPhone, but it does seem to give you a lot more control once you have it all figured out.-Media: The Roxio media Manager is slow as molasses, so I don't recommend it for anything other than converting video to MP4 if you have nothing else to do that with. The great thing though, is that there is a Media Sync that you can use with your iTunes playlists. All you do is setup a playlist in iTunes and then you can sync it with your Storm when connected to your computer. You can even sync your entire library. The only problem is that you cannot use this to sync video (at least I haven't found a way to do that yet). Transferring music and video to the iPhone is hands down easier. On the other hand the video picture quality on the Storm absolutely blows the iPhone away. Something about the screen is simply superior (it also handles sunlight much better, so you aren't left running for shade when watching video or messaging).-Apps: This is where the iPhone really shines, and why I consider it more of a toy. The Storm's apps are blown away on every level, but then again the iPhone has had a lot more time. I really hope more apps are added as time goes by, because things like Yelp and movie times would be nice to have at your finger tips. I do find the maps and GPS navigation on the Blackberry to be comparable to the iPhone, so perhaps as time goes by we can expect some more decent apps to come down the pipeline.-Voice Quality: It can often be tough for people to hear me unless I speak directly into the mouth piece (which pulls the phone away from my ear so I can't hear them), but the iPhone is even worse. Most people I know with iPhones have to use a headset just to have conversations with people.-Other thoughts: Get the screen covers. I thought I screwed up my screen for life when I used a 5 year old monitor wipe on it without realizing how old the thing was, and left it scratched up. Fortunately they provided a screen cover for me when I bought the phone (they did not inform me of this) and my screen was perfectly fine underneath. I bought a bunch more and just replace them every once in a while (a standard LCD microfiber cloth is all you need to clean the covers, and often they come with one).
First off, I'm usually an early adopter, and am extremely picky about my personal electronic devices.  As a 30-plus year computer veteran and high-tech worker, my use of this device does not enter into the realm of Blackberry Enterprise Server or anything else to do with work.  This is my personal phone, and I love it!My previous phone was the Samsung Flipshot, which has a really nice camera included, which I used all the time.  The camera in the Blackberry Storm is pretty good comparatively, however there is so much more to the Blackberry.  I can still do all the same things I could do before: MMS the picture to another cell phone and send an email, for example.  With the Blackberry, I have a Flickr app that integrates itself pretty well with the camera interface.  I take the picture and one of the options is "Send to Flickr."  Pulls up a very familiar Flickr interface loaded with the options you need, including privacy settings and image scaling, and the image is submitted - done!I also own an iPod touch 2G (16G) with the latest software update (3.0) and I can honestly say that BlackBerry has missed the mark, comparatively.  I've already seen at least one exhaustively comprehensive review on this product, so I'll stick with my own personal experience.  The accelerometer is useful, for sure, but the reaction delay is annoying.  People often see me giving my phone a little shake to get it to react, and have asked me if this is a part of the method for switching it between modes.  Personally, I think it's just a habit I've picked up while waiting for the screen to catch up with the device's orientation.The iPod touch screen is glass, while the Storm's screen is plastic.  Now I always install a screen protector on all touch-screens the moment they are taken out of the box.  I remove the plastic protective sheet, and immediately install the plastic protector.  If you scratch your screen with keys in your pocket or purse, or drop the unit, you may be surprised at the damage a plastic screen protector will take.  I also purchased the Verizon clear case, which I like because it only adds a little space to the unit, while protecting it from mild drops.  The only problem with placing this unit in any form of semi-permanent case is that you cannot use the phone with the desktop charging base that Verizon is selling at the time of this writing (without removing the case, which is annoying).  So either buy some other form of case that is compatible with the base unit, or skip the expensive base unit all together and just use a standard charger or USB cable.I've played with many applications and games on both the iPod touch and the Blackberry Storm and I can say that Apple's offering is clearly more snappy, almost instantaneous.  The Storm is just not as responsive in all ways.  It's not a terrible lag most days, but even from a fresh restart, there's a noticeable delay between any action (button, touchscreen, accelerometer event) and the unit's reaction.The speakerphone on the Storm is nice, I use it all the time.  Decent loudness and clarity for a cell phone, and the speaker is on the back, far enough away from the microphone that I rarely (if ever) have any feedback.Two must-get applications:  TalkLock by CellAvant and QuickPull Pro by SteelThorn.TalkLock: When you talk on this phone, your face will press against the screen, and you WILL have problems with muting, flashing, dialing digits, speakerphone activation and deactivation - you name it.  Get TalkLock and save yourself the trouble.  It's cheap, works well, and you'll thank me!QuickPull Pro: This is a multi-processing device.  You can have multiple applications running in the background, and this eats up memory and CPU cycles.  If you're an average user, you may forget to exit applications and wonder why the phone is dog slow.  If it's dog slow and you don't want to go to the application switcher and shut down each application, just use QuickPull and have it restart your phone at, say, 2:00am (or whenever you're least likely to use the phone).  When you wake up in the morning, your phone will be freshly rebooted with no extraneous applications executing in the background from the day before.  Nice, right?I appreciate Blackberry's introduction of the Compatibility Mode, consistent physical button interface from previous Blackberry models and application permissions, which let you control how your applications can access your phone - and private data you have on your phone.Compatibility Mode:  For those of you who just can't live without applications (Shazam anyone?) that were designed exclusively for the non-touchscreen Blackberry units, there is Compatibility Mode.  Switch this on, and your touch screen acts like the rollerball with click from previous models.  Not bad, and it seems to work pretty well.  This disables screen rotation, apparently, but I do believe that more companies are porting their applications over to the Storm, so it's usually only a minor and temporary set-back.  Plus, you this allows you to use your old apps while you wait for the developer to finish the port!Consistent Physical Buttons:  I love buttons.  It's the only reason why I bought the Storm: for it's "clicky" screen, and four physical buttons.  Had I not physically picked-up the Storm that my co-worker had just purchased, I would have never known how physically tactile the screen actually is - the unit in the Verizon stores had always been used so much that the screen was squishy and it was not clearly apparent that it physically "clicked" like a single button when you pressed it.  I like having a Talk and End button, dedicated.  I like the color coding.  The Blackberry (Enter, Menu, Do It!) button, and the Back button are a welcome addition.  I know that if I want to go back (like CE on a calculator) I simply press back.  If I want to exit out of things (like C on a calculator) I just press the red End button.  NOTE to RIM:  Please give us the option to exit and CLOSE applications with a single keypress.  If I am in an application and I press the red END key, I expect that the application will QUIT, not simply go into the background.  This should be an option. I like my Blackberry clean, and the QuickPull is simply a band aid.Application Permissions:  As a security professional, I can tell you that it's nice to know that there is enough granularity within the application permissions to allow or deny almost any action for any application.  For most, this is simply just a "feel good" thing.  You set the default application permissions, never looking at them again, and hoping that they are set properly.  Just make sure that you are purchasing/obtaining your applications from a known-good source, otherwise, someone may write an application that does nasty things to your phone (places calls you don't want to place, e-mails your contact list to a third-party without your consent, forwards all e-mails to another party, or pictures...you get the point).  Your life is on your phone.  Be careful of what applications you load on it to keep it clean and safe, and your data relatively secure.Screen lock button - upper-left.  Although there's a lag when entering and leaving this screen lock mode, it's nice to have it.  Lock your screen before you put it into your purse or pocket so you don't make accidental calls, or forward a spicy message from your significant other to your boss.  Make sure you set your contact information so that if you lose your phone, and someone picks it up, your name, address, phone number and e-mail address will be immediately visible - so an honest person can make an attempt to return this rather expensive (retail) phone. You don't want to have to buy this phone again before the contract's up, trust me!Headphone jack:  Okay, this is a slight bone of contention with me: I realize that they needed to use the four connector jack: ground, microphone, audio left, audio right.  However, why did they choose the non-standard (for cell phones) size?  Now, it is nice that they shipped a corded headset that works just fine, and I can also use my Motorola ROKR S9 wireless Bluetooth headphones with them, but I cannot easily use my favorite wired headphone from Jabra - even with the Verizon adapter.  Before you buy the Verizon adapter, make sure you test it in the store with the headset you want to use - save yourself a trip.  I've returned one, thinking it was defective, only to find out that it was simply the way it was designed.  Test it in the store by placing a call, making sure you can hear the other party, and the other party can hear you okay.  I've reverted to using the headphones-with-mic that came with the unit.  Not bad for a freebie.Packaging:  I know people want to feel like they "got something" when they spend more than $100 on a product, but why all the crazy, expensive, potentially not recyclable packaging?  I think RIM should spend a few research dollars designing a box and packaging that is more Earth-friendly.  The iPod touch wasn't too bad: one piece of plastic or two, a few small manuals.  I was cleaning my basement this past weekend and had to sort through all sorts of shrinkwrapped useless garbage to recycle most of it.  If a phone is intuitive, you shouldn't have to read the manual, and what's up with shipping phones with sixteen different languages?  If you're selling a phone in the United States, it should most likely be in English.  If the customer needs another language, it should be available on-line, for free.  I get a Citizen Watch periodically, and am amazed at the well-designed but completely useless packaging that accompanies it.  So I keep the box on the shelf, and it's never used, taking up space, because I hate to throw it away.  Companies: make your packaging lighter, as attractive as it needs to be but not over the top.  People should be throwing this stuff away or recycling it.Frequency of Mail Checking:  I haven't found a way to fix this, and would love to find a solution, but the mail is checked all the time.  There's a reason why these are lovingly called Crackberries.  As a person who would rather be notified every 15 minutes, 30 minutes or even an hour at a time, I'm shocked that there's no ability to control the frequency of the mail checking and/or notification.  There should be a way to either check for mail less frequently, or to notify you only at certain times.  I get a message, the phone notifies me.  A minute later, I get a new message, the phone notifies me.  I'm like a Pavlovian dog.  The filters are nice, but I still think we should have a way to scale back the mail pull/push and/or notification on the web-site or phone.I took off a star for the overall responsiveness of the unit, the lack of automatic or intuitive application closure and the Bad Design of not having a built-in auto-locking feature while on the phone.  Did they not test this unit with a few phone calls?  Seriously, without TalkLock, I'm pressing the touchscreen every few seconds.  I'm shocked they didn't catch this and, having caught it, surprised they didn't release a quick fix.  How hard would it be for RIM to write a free, official, integrated auto-lock application, or just buy out the TalkLock company.Overall, I love this phone, and don't know what I would do without it.  I hope that the next iteration of the RIM touchscreen offering is faster to react, more intuitive for the average user (application closure and memory are two big points of contention with this unit) and potentially has a GLASS screen.Not to plug Verizon's applications too hard, but I do like two applications:VZ Navigator: I'm never lost and can perform searches here or anywhere.  Nice to be able to find my closest library or vegan restaurant.VCast Song ID: Want to know what that song is playing in the store or on the radio?  I've had this application on my phone since its inception and it's awesome! Give it your e-mail address and it will send the song's information to your e-mail automatically.  If you're into buying your music in a digital format, you can even make the purchase directly from Verizon's store but...yeah.  You might want to buy the CD later.  The e-mail feature rocks and is free; buying stuff (music, ringtones, ringbacks) is on you.With the Blackberry, I pay a monthly fee for the VZ Navigator, but it is included with some plans.  Make sure you ask about charges when you pick the unit up.  The VCast Song ID is, I believe, free - but you need to have a data plan.  Again, check with the service provider to see how that works.Important note to Verizon or RIM:  All of the demo Blackberry Storms I experienced in the four stores I visited before I made my purchase had "squishy" touchscreens - to the point where I didn't realize that the touchscreen is actually a physical button.  I strongly dislike touchscreens, but I like those with tactility.  Swap out your demo units when they start to lose their spring, and you might sell more to people like me.  The only reason why I even considered buying this unit after my negative multi-store experience was physically taking my co-worker's brand-new phone away from him while he was on his desk phone.  The phones in the store should not be broken!
I have had my storm for two weeks, and I must say that I love it.  I read plenty of the negative reviews and was very skeptical on getting the phone.  Now that I have it in my hands I can actually say I love it!  I love the big screen and once I got used to the touch screen keyboard typing was a breeze.  When the phone first came out it was buggy but that's the price you pay for having to have a phone on its release.  I waited until they had a reasonable software update before purchasing this phone and I couldn't be happier.  I have read so many reviews on here comparing it to an Iphone.  It's not an Iphone.  Take a blackberry for a blackberry.  Blackberries and Iphones are not even marketed to the same group of people.  Iphones are not business phones.  I think ppl wanted it to be like the Iphone, and when it wasn't they were disappointed.  The only phone that will be like the Iphone is the Iphone.  Get over it already.  The storm is a nice blackberry and the apps being developed for blackberries is up and coming.  Apps for the blackberry is a relatively new thing but there are new apps added daily.  I actually like the surepress of the screen because I am usually sure of what I am clicking on before I press. I think when deciding whether to get the storm you have to ask yourself do you need a physical keyboard?  If the answer is yes get a Tour.  If you want an Iphone get and Iphone, but if you want a touch screen blackberry get the Storm.
I'm a business consultant, and so when choosing a phone I was looking for a smartphone type device that would be useful in terms of remote access to email and the internet when traveling; be able to look up flight status, and allow me to browse the news or listen to MP3s. Given how most of my friends and family were on Verizon, the iPhone wasn't an option, and the Blackberry Storm was supposed to have some features that the iPhone didn't (such as stereo bluetooth). Although promising, the Blackberry Storm functions like a prototype that should have never made it out of de-bugging.My device's operating system corrupted, forcing the Verizon technicians to give it a complete wipe. Even with this, the phones problems persisted.The Good:- Gorgeous screen- The camera takes nice pictures, and uploads them to facebook or wherever else without issueThe Bad:- Accelerometer has an extreme lag (over 10 seconds, and there are times when the screen will not go from portrait to landscape mode at all when texting)- Locking the phone has up to a twenty second lag- The browser's cursor mode has poor responsiveness, does not click where it is supposed to- The long awaited app store contains applications like "Fartin up a storm", but nothing of any real use or substanceThe Ugly:- The phone freezes completely, unable to accept or make calls (incredibly embarrassing when trying to talk to a coworker). I do make it a point to close every application completely when not using it, so I know it's not a free memory issue.- The phone randomly reboots itself (completely, as if you had yanked the battery out of it)- The phone has terrible voice quality unless you are talking over its speakerphone. (This I was informed about by my family.)As a traveler who depends on his mobile phone for reservations and communication with family members, clients, and co-workers, this phone is more aggravation than it's worth. For a teenager or individual who doesn't depend on their phone, it might be worthwhile.
Although the Storm is great to view pictures and videos as well as listen to downloaded music, it is a total nightmare to text on. It is very difficult to text and can not be done unless you are looking directly at the phone.It is very sensitive and very easy to hit the wrong keys. I had a Palm TREO as well as the LG EN-V and would much rather go back to one of my previous phones than use this one. I have even thought about just buying another phone in that not having the "buttons" for the letter keys just makes it too much of a hassel to compose a text message.Sending an email is a very labor intensive ordeal and I swore that I would never do it again. I'm hoping that I will eventually become accustomed to it, but it has been over 3 months and I still regret this purchase.
What's this, the new BlackBerry? Woah, it has no keyboard. And...did it just click? You've never clicked a screen before, is that supposed to happen? Is it supposed to feel so...tiring? And why is this screen wiggling around, am I supposed to be seeing the circuit board? Why is it so heavy; the iPhone isn't this heavy? The interface is pretty neat, but why are page transitions taking so long. Did it just flip orientations on me? I didn't even move it. Wait, now I did move it and the orientation isn't following. What's going on, I thought this was supposed to be an iPhone killer? This is what RIM and Verizon is putting their muscle behind? Really?It's unstable. Typing is atrocious and unbelievably inaccurate (seriously, there were times when I couldn't even decipher what I had just typed.)The screen, oh man the screen. It's pretty darn gorgeous, but I can't get over how it moves. It was literally the first thing I noticed when I picked the device up, and our exact reaction is "why the hell does this thing wiggle?" It's very disconcerting, and makes the Storm feel incredibly cheap. There is play in all four sideways directions, and a lot of it. I'm not talking a little wiggle, I'm talking gaps big enough that you can clearly see the circuit board below. I realize it's probably necessary and alleviates stress when clicking the screen, but man does it cheapen the device.First off, if it worked perfectly it might be a different story, but it doesn't. Lag is present throughout the device (more on that later) but most frustrating with the selection process. There are times when I found myself clicking on an item, but the Storm only registered the highlight. It wasn't common, but common enough to be a legitimate gripe. It is also inconsistent. In the commercial I see the mysterious hand swiping across the home icons, and the highlight following his finger. This doesn't happen in real life, at least not on the homescreen or main menu. In the Media application, however, you can do just that with the icons at the bottom. Again, minor gripe but it's just an illustration of the ill-executed nature of the Storm.  Most importantly is typing, especially since we're talking about a BlackBerry. To say the Storm misses the mark is an understatement. This may sound like hyperbole, but I cannot think of a keyboard worse than the Storm. Ever. Touchscreen or not.  Messages on the Strom were often unreadable.  As I slowed down I got more accurate, and tweaking some of the sensitivity settings helped a bit, but at full speed it just plain couldn't perform.  The software just isn't that good.Lastly, typing is tiring. After just a few messages my thumbs began to feel fatigued, and I'm not alone in thinking that. Keep in mind this was just after a few quick text and PIN messages, typing out a full email was downright exhausting on my thumbs. I often found myself wondering how RIM could have ever passed this device through beta testing, not to mention release it and market it as the iPhone killer.  An "iPhone killer" it's not!To use the term "half-baked" is too generous.  Try "microwaved" instead!  A cheap substitute deal for the real meal.  I LOVE the iPhone but hate AT&T.;  I LOVE Verizon but hate it's selection of phones. I'm dropping this piece of junk today and going back to the iPhone!
-Brian Mahony, [...]Updated on March 17, 2008 (I guess I feel lucky).As I promised, I have now had a chance to set up and use my new BlackBerry Storm for a couple of weeks. Since one of my pet peeves is reviews that don't go beyond the challenges of the initial box-opening and early learning curve, I made sure to withhold judgment until I had a good feel for the device.BackgroundOK, first a few disclosures. I have been using the BlackBerry 7250 for about two years now. As I have stated previously, I am both a packrat and an early adopter. I will jump on cool new technologies but I also hold on to them until there is something new that represents a significant upgrade to what I already have. That is a high bar usually, since many times "new stuff" really is yesterday's meatloaf with a few new features. For me to upgrade, I need to have a step-level improvement in features or functionality.So I have been using the 7250 for about two years. Before that, I had a series of Nokia and Motorola phones that really hadn't changed much in core features for about ten years. I switched to BlackBerry in the first place, probably a couple of years too late, because I wanted a serious business email device. The 7250 did that for me and I felt I achieved an order of magnitude of functionality from what I had before. Most of the time, new business technology actually only makes you more miserable. It gives you more work to do and further invades your personal life. But in the case of the BlackBerry, it improved my life. Before becoming a "CrackBerry" user I fell victim to severe laptop addiction--anytime I tuned the thing on, no matter what reason, at least 3 hours would fly by. But now with my new BlackBerry, I could do email triage with confidence, reducing the times I had to boot up the computer at work or at home by about a third.So it was with this background and anticipation I ordered the new BlackBerry Storm as soon as it was available.Major caveat: Software UpdateOK. Before we get into the detailed review one major, huge caveat--- RIM clearly shipped the Storm while the software engineers were chasing the first crate from China down the block, trying to get their latest version of firmware into the thing. The Marketing/Sales guys won the arm wrestle (or foosball) match that day. After first unpacking, charging, and firing up the BlackBerry Storm I was ready to throw the thing against the wall after about two hours. It was horribly slow and buggy. Some applications (e.g., camera) seemed to crash the whole system and the keyboard which uses a sensor to change its horizontal orientation took seemingly forever. The device was almost unusable. In my desire to be fair, and having launched products like this myself (I was the evil Marketing guy with the engineers chasing me down the block, but I am exceedingly good at foosball), I luckily tried to find a software upgrade. It worked and the review below assumes all of you do the same. To avoid being dainty or obscure--- first download the latest version before trying to use the BlackBerry Storm!Update March 17, 2009: I also hear they have a new firmware update coming out soon that should help improve the acceleramator and camera.Initial ImpressionsAt first glance the new BlackBerry Storm was only OK. I guess I expected a form factor that was bit more revolutionary. Instead, I got a device that looked a bit plain, but for the nice color screen that covered 80% of the face. For one thing, the Storm, like the 7250 before it, did not feel very sleek or even stable in my hand. Instead, it fell like it would fall out without a firm grip (which in fact has happened several times). I was disappointed in this because I figured, after all these years, BlackBerry would finally build a smart phone that was easy to hold in both typing and phone modes. Instead, another phone with nothing for my fingers to naturally curl around. Another phone where I felt like my fingers were always invading some space, some button, where they didn't belong. My fingers asked the Storm to dance, and she flatly declined.Update March 17, 2009:I have indeed dropped the Storm several times. The good news is that it survived every fall.But let's talk about that pretty face-- the vibrancy and crispness of the Storm's colorful screen really is unrivaled in a small device. I can't say enough how bright the colors are and visible the resolution even without having to zoom.So while the 7250 could be used as a browser only as a last resort, the Storm rivals the browsing of my laptop. For one thing, it allows a few different browsers, including the native BlackBerry one, a truncated mobile version, as well as a full browser that uses a combination of window scrolling (both horizontal and vertical) and zooming to achieve a high degree of usability. Suffice to say the Storm vastly exceeded my expectations as to what a mobile device can do for Internet browsing.If the beautiful colorful screen and Internet browsing exceeded my expectations, the multi-media and video streaming functions delighted my soul. I admit I have only played around with this feature a bit, but what I have seen is very impressive--some movie trailers and Internet short clips, all in high enough definition to make you forget you are staring at a small screen.Before we move on from the screen, we really need to discuss the primary input device-- the touch-screen and on-screen keyboard. For many BlackBerry users, especially business power users, the ability to crank out a barrage of emails, IMs, and texts with a high level of confidence, without going back to correct typing mistakes, was one of the main draws of the BlackBerry. While there has been some debate about the keyboards of various models over the years, including size, lay-out and whether a full keyboard was necessary, I for one resisted all of the non-QWERTY varieties. I had become so adept at the two-thumb and occasional index finger approach that nothing else could intrude on my love affair with the BlackBerry's reliable text input buttons. The feel of those raised pads was so enticing, so gratifying.So when I saw that the Storm would take the very iPhone approach and forgo the physical buttons, I was worried. Until I saw that both a QWERTY and 2-button-share soft keyboard were provided, including what some were calling a "tactile, clickable, interface." So, after almost three weeks of usage, I am sad to report that text input is marginal at best. Sure, Research in Motion introduced some wonderful innovations to make it easy and gratifying. Keys, whether numbers or letters or characters, light up as you caress the screen to ensure proper finger alignment, and only trigger entry when one actually presses down on the touch screen (yes, the screen depresses slightly and gives the sense of clicking a button- very cool). This allows you to get better over time--first by staring at the screen to see what keys your fingers are triggering, later by flying along and then checking your work. At first, my data entry was horrible, which I chalked up to user error and the learning curve. But after several weeks, I am still only at about 85% success rate, which might seem good until you consider that every 9th or 10th letter in an email or text you have to go back chasing after to correct, adding 3 or 4 multiples to the time you would expect to compose new messages. Also, I have found that the onscreen keyboard is optimally used with both left and right thumbs working in unison, since the engineers at RIM seem to have skewed the virtual buttons a little to the left or right depending on what side of the screen they are on. So all in all, the BlackBerry storm has functional text-based inputs which can be cool or annoying depending on how you use them, but in the end, unlike its browser, it does not have you thinking you can replace your computer for serious email or text composition. Sigh, opportunity lost here methinks.Update March 17, 2009:The keyboard has gotten much better over time. I don't mind it much anymore really, and the "sure-type" intelligence is very smart. For most emails or texts, I never have to go to the full QWERTY keyboard since it usually knows what words I am trying to type (the obvious exceptions are acronyms or special characters).Some other major positives of the BlackBerry Storm:* Telephone network-- Verizon has by far the best voice quality, network coverage, and fewest dropped calls. I know that from both my background as a telecom technologist, and as a user of both Verizon and AT&T; and Sprint/Nextel over the years. iPhone's exclusive availability on AT&T; was one of the major reasons I did not even consider switching from Verizon.Update March 17, 2009:Still love Verizon (gushing).* Telephone voice quality and features-- I was a little worried about this since the 7250 had weak voice quality. I had trouble hearing folks in noisy rooms and people always complained they could not hear me. On the Storm, while I thought the voice quality initially was a bit tinny, its phone capabilities have really grown on me. For one thing, the volume is really loud if you want it to be and the speaker-phone is excellent. But just as important, after several test, my friends and family assure me they can hear me quite well whether in regular or speaker modes. Thank you RIM for this necessary improvement.* Easy email setup-- RIM has perfected this. Whether it is personal email or work email through the Enterprise BlackBerry server, you can have great confidence in retrieving the messages that matter to you.* Desktop synchronization-- Once again, BlackBerry excels at synching not only email, but tasks, calendar items, etc. The Storm also has very reliable functions for reading and composing Microsoft Office applications like Word and PowerPoint and Excel--a business user's life blood.* Visual Voice Mail-- I strongly encourage you to pay the extra few bucks to subscribe to this service. As a mobile warrior like many of you, I often struggle to get through all of my voicemail, sometimes over 20+ per day when I am on the road. Sometimes I am listening to messages at a noisy trade show, or want to skip through previously saved messages, all tasks that are frustrating with a typical telephony number pad-type interface, especially when you can never remember the correct commands. With visual voice mail, your voice mail messages are treated like email messages with a audio recording attached. You can sort through them by sender or timestamp, and easily skip, rewind, or delete messages.Update March 17, 2009:I am giving up on this feature. It just is not accurate enough in synching to my "real" voicemail. Too bad Verizon, you'll be losing my $5 a month.* SMS and IM functions-- Worked like a breeze. Set up Yahoo IM in seconds. Sweet. Now I just wish I could stop my little teenage nieces from texting me all the time. At our annual Christmas party, I caught several of them texting each other-- from across the room! Why do they do that!?Update March 17, 2009:* Bonus function-- Two words: Word Mole! Totally addictive game and great for killing subway stops or hours on the plane. Please email me if you can beat my high score: 6,742 (this score is quite ridiculous since I was in the "zone" and my previous best was 4,358) or my best single word high score: 135.Update March 17, 2009:LOL. My new high score is 11,500. Beat that!Mixed or TBD:* Music-- Couldn't get the thing to work. It is supposed to support Rhapsody and Verizon's V Cast. I will stick with my iPod for now.Update March 17, 2009:I actually use the Storm as an iPod now. There is a feature for randomly synching songs from your iTunes list. Works great when your iPod is out of batteries. Storm earbuds sounds better than standard iPod ones.* Navigation-- Ditto. You are supposed to be able to use the Storm's imbedded GPS for turn-by-turn navigation. I tried for 30 minutes, including calling an 800 number that put me in IVR hell, but couldn't get the thing to work or Verizon to help me. If I eventually get the thing working (which would be great and another of those "step-level improvements" I was telling you about in the first paragraph) I will update this review.Update March 17, 2009:To be fair to our friends from Networks in Motion, I haven't had a chance to call Verizon to try to get this working again.* Menu system-- I am still a little lost here. Sometimes you need to press a button on the on-screen keyboard (they are different for each application). Sometimes you need to hit the physical "menu" button at the bottom of the device. Sometimes you need to speak Latin incantations while standing upside down (maybe not this last one, but you get the idea). After several weeks, I still find myself searching for when to hit "back", when to hit "menu" when to scroll or search around for a hidden option. My trusty 7250 had a simple and easy to remember menu system and scroll-wheel ( I really miss that little wheel) while the Storm has you wondering and wallowing too often. Of course the Storm does a lot more too, but you would think there would be some mean, grumpy, menu-system-enforcing engineer that would have driven simplicity and consistency.Update March 17, 2009:I have gotten used to the menu system now. It doesn't really bother me.* Unlock key-- Oh my goodness. Put the Storm in your pocket and the thing locks without any explanation on how to unlock it. For newbies like me it took several minutes and key combinations (and a little Latin) to figure out how to get out of it. FYI- the unlock button is on top of the device to the left. Please send $5 to...Update March 17, 2009:What, no checks?Awful:* Camera function-- Just terrible. This was one of the worst things before the latest software upgrade but it has only gone from completely unusable to completely impractical. The camera menu system is kludgey. The camera itself snaps several seconds after you press the button and is almost always out of focus. After taking a picture, there seems to be now simple way to quickly take another picture before backing out of a "save as" function the pops up. This is a bummer since I was really hoping this function would add to the reasons why I switched from the 7250.Update March 17, 2009:Still awful. The new firmware update is supposed to improve the camera but don't hold your breath.* Video camera-- Same as above. Don't waste your time.Update March 17, 2009:To be fair, I have actually gotten some decent utility out of this when I needed to record a demo at a trade show. It still crashes and freezes up about a third of the time, and almost always when I try to record beyond 3 minutes. As a result, I am looking to buy a Flip or Vado.Review SummaryAll in all, the BlackBerry Storm has delivered on most of its promises. It is indeed a major improvement from earlier models, and more than competitive (if not superior) to rivals like the iPhone. If you are looking for the latest generation smart-phone with all the support for business applications you have come to expect from Research In Motion and improvements that make it a great quality phone and mobile Internet browser and multi-media playback device, the BlackBerry Storm is for you. As a primarily software-based device, we can only hope and expect some of the annoyances I have outlined above to get better with future releases (those engineers are only getting better at foosball I hear). The color touch-screen is truly beautiful. The surrounding apps are solid. The input keyboard is functional but could be better. The desktop synch is strong as always. In short, all the things you will use most, line up to make the BlackBerry Storm the right device for me. And maybe for you too.Update March 17, 2009:I am sticking with the Storm. It has grown on me and I am confident that most of the negatives will be fixed with firmware updates. The iPhone is still not an option for me due to the poor quality of the AT&T; network.Please comment with your feedback.-Brian
I always check the reviews of a product before buying it. When I first saw the reviews of the BB storm I was very disappointed. But even with such low rating I was convinced with some of the higher rated reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this phone. When I finally got it let me tell you, I was disappointed with its performance and how difficult it was to text (so in my head I was feeling as I should have followed my habit of always buying a product taking account of it's reviews). So I decided to investigate a little more about this problem and found out that you could fix almost every problem with the phone by just upgrading the OS. Let me tell you the difference is amazing. Its now really easy to text, apps work smoothly, and let me tell you.... it has become an iphone killer. The quality of audio and video (resolution) is so much better. The 3g Internet is much faster than the iphone.. So in conclusion if there are any bad reviews about this phone it was because the engineers over at rim, had not yet deciphered the right software for this phone, now that you can download the latest OS I think it'll start to get much higher opinions. It really is a great phone.
I've tried to give this phone a chance, but it really is garbage.  In trying to be everything, it does nothing well.  It's slow to respond to EVERY command and just gets more frustrating to use the longer you have it.  My fingers are unfortunately a little bigger than pencil erasers, so typing on the keyboard typically results in being off by one letter.  Want to call a contact?  Be ready to focus and push about five different buttons before you get there (including 2 you didn't want to push). I'm surprised there haven't been more car accidents attributed to this phone... definitely don't try to use it when you drive. Applications are really limited - don't bother trying to upload any games... the software is way too slow to let you play anything other than solitaire or board games where there is no action.  Stay away until they come up with a new one or figure out how to write faster software.  I was a Blackberry fan until they released this... hope this doesn't take them down Motorola lane... I know they can do better.  Get an iphone... get anything... just don't get this.
I bought the phone online through the Verizon's website the night it first went on sale so I've had it for a while now. Yes, I've experienced all the issues other reviewers described. It would freeze, camera was crappy, couldn't save videos. But all the issues went away after I upgraded to the new OS (4.7... something). You can upgrade wirelessly from withing your settings menu. Bottom line, I love this phone now. First of all you have all your email accounts right under your fingertips. Typing emails is actually better than iPhone's - I like it when touching the letter will highlight it and then you press it to actually type. This device is also the best mp4 player among all smartphones - iPhone not even close. Many of my friends and pretty much all of my co-workers have iPhones so believe me, I got to play with iPhones a lot. Storm has a bigger brighter screen and much louder speakers (surprisingly loud for a phone)and most importantly a micro SD card slot. So I DON'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW PHONE when I need more memory. I have 8gig card the phone came with filled with mp4 movies, shows and music clips. Internet is kind of slow (slower than in verizon commercials of course) but definitely not slower than AT&T;'s. I'm constantly checking news, sport scores, facebook without any problems. Not to mention that the phone looks and feels amazing (girls might say it's a little heavy). Most one-star reviews I read here are ridiculous. You have a problem with your phone - try taking it to Verizon store!Anyway, just update your OS and spend a little time getting used to it - you'll have the best mobile device you've ever owned.
I bought the Storm on the Verizon network due to excellent international capabilities and network coverage in the US. I thought about the iPhone but AT&T; coverage in my area is spotty.I find the Storm to be very fiddly. I am not a fan of the Storm's touch screen, and for typing it is a major headache.  I try to avoid using it for emails now, which basically defeats the purpose.  It also has major delays (for example, if I have not used the phone for a couple of hours, and I have an incoming call, often the little "clock symbol" pops up in the middle of the screen which means you can't do anything with the phone until it stops.  Which means I miss my calls).  This seems to be rectified (somewhat) by removing the battery once a day, but that's a bit of a silly way to keep your phone working properly.I don't hate the phone, and it has its advantages for travel, etc.  But I think they need to improve the responsiveness of the touch screen and work out these delay-causing kinks.  (sorry, I'm not very technical, not sure of the correct verbage!)I'm middle of the road on this phone - I wouldn't tell people not to buy it, but I would suggest they use it in the store for a bit to make sure they like the touch screen typing.For myself I will go with a more traditional keypad in the future, unless BB makes improvements on the touch screen - though I have two years to wait now!***Not even two months later and I am editing this review.  The Storm is dreadful and will not work over 50% of the time it is turned on.  The touch pad constantly malfunctions.  Humidity seems to cause the problems.  Kind of silly to have a phone that cannot handle simple humidity.Really, do not buy this phone.  It is so not worth the money.
Enough of the negative reviews by all the Apple Fanboi's.The Storm is a very solid phone, works great, works like a blackberry. I use mine as a media player in addition to the phone, and it is very good. Much better sound than an ipod/phone... and the camera is one of the best I have ever seen on a phone.Plenty of apps and it is fast, browser works well.I am very happy with mine.
I have several co-workers who are using iPhones, and they were definitely one of my choices.  Would have gotten a better discount through work with AT&T;, but chose to go with Verizon and a Storm for the following:Pros:I like the size of the Storm, it is easier for me to type on and keep a grip on. While the thinness of the iPhone is convenient for pocketing, the Storm's size is much more comfortable to me.I've had bad experiences with AT&T; coverage and customer service in the past and did not want to give them my business.  (Co-workers have stated they are having to deal with dropped calls)I like the click-screen on the Storm, it took a couple days to get used to, but the feedback is helpful.Verizon is consistently one of the top wireless providers, and since they are combining with Alltel's network, coverage will be even greater.Cons:The number of applications available for the Storm does not compare with what is available for iPhone.  This wasn't a dealbreaker for me since there are versions of the Google products I use, mobile websites work the same on both, and the Blackberry comes with standard applications.The iPhone interface does win on performance and usability.  There are times when there is a lag for the screen to switch when tilting the Storm.I like the Storm and the features that drew me to it in the first place.  After a couple months of use I would still choose it again.
BlackBerry Storm is like a beautiful woman with a personality disorder: It will charm you with its gorgeous screen but make your life difficult with slow & buggy software that constantly freezes! Like you have an urgent call to make and phone is locked up for 2 minutes!BlackBerry Storm has hung up 3 times in one week that I have had it compared to my previous Palm Treo 755p which did that only twice in last one year. Once it freezes, you have to remove the cover,  take the battery out and put it back in and then it takes 2-3 minutes to boot up. Buggy & sluggish software feels like Windows Mobile rather than Palm or iPhone.Pros:1.Beautiful high resolution screen2.Very Good email device3.Great Verizon coverage and better voice compared to other networks.4.Fast 3G compared to iPhone although browser is not as good.5. Bluetooth modem tethers and works well but I got download speed of 198 Kbs compared to 700-900 Kbs that I used to get with Treo 755p through the cable.Cons:1.Half baked software that freezes a lot.2.Very sluggish software, takes a while to respond - compared to Treo 755p & iPhone.3.User interface nowhere close to user friendliness and slickness of iPhone or Palm Treo 755p. You have to go through several menus and taps to do simple things for example you have to go through two screens and taps to put phone in vibrate mode.4.Voice quality inferior than Palm Treo 755p but better than iPhone.5.Poor desktop sync software. On Mac it either syncs contacts & calendar with PocketMac; or the media with iTunes with MediaSync- not both. And once you install MediaSync, you cannot use PocketMac!6.Only syncs playlists, not Podcasts.7.Unable to play audiobooks from Audible.com, as of February 2009.8.Does not fast forward or reverse audio or video.9.Long shutter lag with camera and even though it is supposed to be 3.2 megapixel, picture quality is not very good.10.No Wi-Fi.11.Fairly heavy at 155 gm and not easily pocketable like Palm Centro.12.Bluetooth plays stereo but constantly disconnects.13. Accelerometer very sensitive, keeps changing keyboard from portrait to landscape and vice versa even when you do not want to.BlackBerry Storm replaced my Palm Treo 755p which I really liked except for its bulk, browser and lack of Wi-Fi. I was hoping to replace  2 devices - Treo 755p &  iPod - with Storm but its software is buggy & sluggish and voice quality poor compared to Palm Treo 755p; and media player does not sync Podcasts and play as well as iPod.  After using BlackBerry Storm for 2 weeks, I returned it in my 30 day trial period and replaced it with a snappy Palm Centro that responds instantly to pressing the button. And now using Storm seems like a bad nightmare!
This is the worst phone I have ever had.  I had a regular Blackberry before and loved it.  First of all, it's very buggy. The amount of time between when a button is pressed and when it actually registers is frustratingly long.  Typing is a nightmare that takes forever and almost always registers the wrong key (I'm a female with relatively small hands).  The auto switching between portrait and landscape is frustrating because it often does it when you don't want it too and when you do, it takes forever.  This phone is NOT user friendly.  You will have to read the book to figure out even simple features.  Lastly, it is poorly designed.  Some genius decided to put a mute button where your ear is.  Therefore, when you talk on the phone and try to hold the phone with your shoulder the mute button gets pushed. Then it takes forever to find the screen, switch mute off, etc.  This phone is so frustrating.  Since I've had it, I don't think a day has gone by without me saying "I hate this phone."On a separate note, the Verizon customer service rep was extremely misleading about the monthly costs of this phone.  We have two phone and he told us it was going to be $110 a month.  What he didn't mention, was that the service plan required for internet, email, text messaging was an additional $30 per phone, the regular plan is an additional $10 for the extra line, the gps is an additional $10 per phone.  My bill came to $200.  When I asked to remove the internet and email he said that would mean I couldn't ever send text messages unless I switch to a regular phone.I would give this product 0 stars if I could.
So far I love it. The salesperson I dealt with today was wonderful. He explained everything to me today and guided me through the process. He set everything up for me and transfered everything from my old phone to my Storm. I find it real easy to use, so the touchscreen doesn't bother me. This is my frst blackberry and touch screen phone. Even my classmate was able to master the touch screen in a few mintues. It took me 30 mins or less to figure out how to text on it. ALso depending on which keyboard I want, I just turn my phone that way.One thing the sales person did tell me was that to make sure I close out whatever I was doing, just don't push the end button, it could really slow your phone down. Also if you go on facebook don't stay signed on forever because your battery could drain from friends constantly updating.I found browsing the Web easy too. To make it bigger all I hbvae to do is tap the screen or push the zoom button. The camera was easy for me too.I also got the cradle charger and I love it. I think people need to stop comparing it to the Iphone and just accept it for what it is. If you want an IPhone need to switch over to AT&T.;
Blackberry does not honor their warranty.  If you must get one, buy insurance.  The USB connection breaks because of poor design.  I have had two fail.  One had insurance, the other did not.  Blackberry claims that this does not happen and WILL charge you $180.  There is no escalation.  I got the device back with a broke screen and no battery (new one too).  Poor design, poor software, and the worst customer support.  You have been warned.
Let me tell you all the things I hated about my BB Scorn, which I just returned to Verizon in favor of the beautiful and functional Samsung Omnia:1-BB Storm software from BB is horrendous. It is rife with bugs and error messages. Workarounds I gleaned from the Web only served to make matters worse. I'm talking about all that important software for synching music, contacts, and so forth. I had to wipe my handheld three times because it got hopelessly bolluxed up, and i am not technologically inept by any means.2-The camera is awful. Long lag time between snapping the pic and actually having it take the photo. Few options for adjusting the image. A lousy zoom. Poor photo quality at the highest settings.3-Poor sound quality unless you hold the phone in PRECISELY the right position relative to your mouth. And I mean precisely.4-I found the push button screen better in concept than in execution. Ultimately just makes the thing more annoying to use.5-From what I can tell, the Omnia comes complete with a full version of Microsoft Word on the Go. BB comes with a basic version that won't let you actually originate a document on the Storm. YTou have to spend 69 smackers to upgrade to the Premium via Dataviz.6-the onscreen keyboard, in landscape mode, seems buggy: sometimes, the keys nearest the two bottom corners just don't work. no biggie unless you want a nice, responsive typing experience. :)7-no wi-fi. Omnia, which is now cheaper but just as fully functioned, has wi-fi.Getting the picture? I'm telling you, trust the reviews that said BB and Verizon dumped this thing on the market before it was really quite ready to roll. They even smile and quietly acknowledge this to be the case at Verizon itself.That's my story, and I'm hoping it convinces at least a few people to avoid the headaches that go along with this lousy piece of technology.I have an iPod touch. I'd go with the iPhone if I didn't have huge problems with ATT's network and reliability. But when you try either of these devices and then try the BB, you'll immediately feel you've taken several steps backward.The Omnia is the same thing: a nice, elegant, clean and usable device that does everything i had hoped the BB would accomplish.
General Comment:  Worst piece of technology I've seen in 3 decades.Experience:  I've owned it for about 5 months.  I'm reasonably tech savy, having worked on computers since the early '80's.Pros:  Intuitive.  With some practice the keypad isn't bad.  A single screen combines all phone logs, text messages, and emails for instant overview of all your communications.Cons:  Heavy, chunky, sluggish, unstable, unreliable.  Reboots constantly (known problem - check around).  Reboot takes forever.  Poor sound.  Poor voice recognition.  Screen constantly flips between vertical & horizontal mode, regardless of how it's held.In Detail:  Actually I like my Storm much better now that I smashed it against the dashboard and I finally succeeded in breaking it beyond repair.  I have had it for about 5 months and I paid plenty for it.  That said, the satisfaction of smashing it made it all worthwhile.For starters, the interface has a response and feel I can only describe as wading through an 18" deep lake of frozen molasses.  Want to play games on it?  Foggetaboudit.  Sound is weak and scratchy.  Voice recognition is poor.  It's chunky and heavy.All that aside, that isn't the major problem.  Shortly after I got it , it sharted rebooting multiple times per day (like 10).  Bad enough, but on top of that, it takes 5-10 minutes to recycle.  10 hours of tech support (really!) with Verizon improved it to about 2 reboots every 3 days.  Unfortunately, over time, it became worse again - much worse - finally rebooting every time someone tried to call:  i ring - 1 vibration - reboot.  Oh yeah - and it didn't save the number either so I had no idea who called.  After it did this to me about 15 times in a row over a period of 3 days or so, it hit the dashboard.FYI Verizon AND Blackberry customer service was abysmal.This happened 2 days ago (4/14/09).  I bought an iPhone.  It's killer.  I love it.  For the record, I've been using cell phones since they weighed pounds, came in bags, and air time was $2 a minute.  I wasn't born yesterday and haven't smashed anything since I pounded a keyboard when the PC ate my spreadsheet and cost me 4 hours of work - I think that was back in '87.As of this writing, Blackberry has yet to upgrade the operating system and it is 100% a Blackberry problem.  These are in no way ready for prime time and should never have been rushed to the market.If you're a masochist and like being tortured, this is definitely the phone for you.Else, if you really want a useful, elegant, stable, and smooth as silk touchpad smartphone, then do what i did, suck it up and buy an iPhone.Consider yourself warned.
I saw the commercials for the Storm2 and decided I had to have this phone (yep I'm a sucker for cool effects). So I called Verizon and asked about it. The Tele-Sales rep said to me why not just get the original storm, it now has the same OS but the only real difference is that the original storm doesn't have wi-fi. I don't use wi-fi anyhow so the deal sounded good as the phone was only 49.95 with a 2 year contract. I got the phone and couldn't have been more disappointed. The click keyboard is a hassle to use. It shouldn't take me 30 seconds to dial a number. Most of the apps cost extra money per month. The web browser didn't even work. The media player is fair and I have to say the phone is LOUD! When the phone goes from normal to landscape it takes too long. Loading music is a chore, the software convoluted and it just plain bad design. It should not take me 3 weeks to learn how to use a phone. I have had it under 30 days so I am turning it in and probably getting a Motorola Droid A855 Phone (Verizon Wireless) or Samsung Rogue SCH-U960 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless). Stay away from this piece of junk.
I've had my Storm for a year now, and have been debating whether to upgrade to the new Storm2 or the Motorola Droid. I had the opportunity to play with both phones, and I can confidently say that the Storm is the true winner! I like the fact that you can touch the screen but need to actually "click" down on the screen to open an app --whereas on the droid it opened whatever my fingers accidentally touched, and had stuff opening all over the place just from handling the phone!  The touch keypad is much more accurate (and I had less mistakes) on the Storm than on the droid. I also like that the Storm, now a year after its release, has become MUCH more stable due to consistent operating system upgrades. The new OS is much faster and more reliable. The camera and video camera work great, I have 16GB of photos & songs on the media card - which play as good as (if not better than) an ipod, there are TONS of apps and games, and the Bluetooth sync'd to my car is awesome! I also like how everything is organized much better, and easier to find (in logical places and menus)- which I could not find in the droid. I also use my Storm as an MP3 player and a radio when outside thanks to the Slacker Radio app and my Bluetooth headphone! Apps that I have installed on my Storm are: a GPS app that is very cool and works w/ the Blackberry Maps; a Level app that turns the Storm into a level tool; a Flashlight app to use the phone as a flashlight; a task reminder app; Bartender app; Photo paint app; a Travel/Pedometer app; Weather app; Unit convert app; YouTube, and of course Facebook. In playing with the new Storm2, the only thing I can say is it is a little bit faster, has more app memory than the Storm1, and has wi-fi. I believe that the Storm2 with wi-fi will really speed up the browser.  I think I will be upgrading to the new Storm2 rather than the flakey droid that I had the opportunity to play with. If you want the best, go with the Storm!!!
I would give it 0.5 stars if allowed. I've gone through 3 of these Storms already because it stops working so often (usually the buttons). But beyond that, the software and touch screen are terrible. RIM rushed this half-baked junkpiece out for show. They wanted a "touchscreen smartphone" on the market so the business briefs would say that and investors would think "OK, they're competing with Apple." But scratch the surface and there's nothing substantial to this product at all.The Storm truly is the worst, most frustrating, and least trustworthy phone I've ever owned.At times it's worth less than the cheap plastic it's made of. I've wanted to break it in half, stomp the living daylights out of it, and toss it in the deepest hole I could find.OK now that I've vented, let me give you some details.You know how you want a device that just works? Well this one just doesn't work. Its menus are confusing, redundant, and annoying. It has to pause and think about requests. It sometimes pauses for no reason at all, preventing you from making a call or sending a text or what have you.Another problem: select a contact that has multiple phone numbers. Press the phone button to make a call, right? Seems straightforward. Not for the Storm. Instead of then asking WHICH of the multiple phone numbers you want to call, it dumbly goes to the plain phone app and gives you no phone number options at all (short of typing the number in yourself)!The keyboard is OK, but just OK. Nothing great, and sometimes frustrating because you can't actually see what key your (OK, my) chubby finger is depressing. Thus many typos.It also pauses while your typing, too, so you can't enter text smoothly.The camera is atrociously slow, grainy, and dark. I infrequently get a decent picture that I'd like to save or share to my desktop, but too bad the interface software doesn't work (see below). So I end up emailing pics to myself. Not elegant.The interface is kludgy, non-intuitive, and again slow. ARGH!The software for linking to your computer is utterly worthless. Not only does it not work (slow, crashes, freezes 90% of the time), it is again nonintuitive and of near-zero utility. The software engineers should be ashamed of themselves for letting this get out of the gate.If I weren't locked into a long term contract, I would have dumped this device in favor of another BlackBerry (NOT the Storm 2, mind) or the iPhone. Heck I might do that just to save myself from going postal with this thing. Save yourself the heartache and look elsewhere, folks.
This is the best, most useful phone I have ever encountered overall.First of all, while I always prefer a phone with a real, rather than virtual QWERTY keyboard, the click-touch interface at least gives a tactile response to the user.  This interface also helps distinguish between merely selecting (highlighting) something and commanding an execution.  One of the great things about this interface is that it uses the type of contact used in the IPhone, where the device recognizes you with a mere laying of your finger onto the screen.  Having previously used a Voyager which requires a physical push of the screen to recognize anything, this electrical type of interface is much easier.  Unlike the push touchscreens which have a hard time discerning between merely selecting and executing a command, the fact that Research in Motion added a clickable aspect to the screen makes entering commands easier and more clear.  By the way, even the IPhone can have that problem as it has to recognize a mere placement or swipe of the screen (highlighting) and a tap (executing a command). There are those who feel that the clickable screen slows down texting.  Yes, that will be true compared to a real QWERTY or the IPhone's keyboards, but less mistakes will be made on this virtual keyboard.  When selecting a link on a web page, for instance, you merely slide your finger over the screen until you get to the link you wish to click on, then push down with a click and you're where you want to go.Speaking of the browser, it's quite quick (The new IPhone also has a WiFi option, which IS really quick, and that's what you're using when you're in an Apple store.).  On top of that, there's something pretty great with the Storm I have not seen on other phones (just to say that I may not be aware of any, not that there aren't).  You can set the internet browser to appear to the web page you land on as either a Blackberry mobile device or appear to the page as either a Firefox or Internet Explorer browser.  Why is this important?  Some sights work better with Internet Explorer or Firefox browsers.  Sometimes, you don't want to get the webpage's mobile site.  For example, The Boston Globe's mobile website,[...], is very limited.  When I go there, I usually switch from the Blackberry mobile browser to either Firefox or Internet Explorer where I can get the full website.  This phone has no problem with most full websites.  I have encountered sites where you need to put in a user name and password and find that the full browser works better.This phone has an accelerometer.  I'm not sure HOW they work, but, like the IPhone, it automatically changes its orientation depending on how you hold it. If you hold it vertically, it gives you a vertical orientation, etc.There are so many features built into the phone, including a GPS, which will map any area and provide directions, but no voice help.  For that, you can use the Verizon VZNavigator, but that's an extra charge.  The media player can play many types of music files including straight .wav files (which is the file type used on CDs, so you get the same quality sound you get from your CDs.).  Most players can only play the very compressed .mp3 files.  You don't even need special software to download files from your computer (though the Blackberry comes with a few programs to help you do this).  Simply connect the Blackberry to your computer, then drop and drag the files you want from your computer to the Blackberry drive using Windows Explorer.The phone can multi-task.  There is a task manager, which allows you to switch between open applications without closing them.The screen itself is pretty spectacular and the phone comes with a preview to a film just to show you how much it's capable of.  While most downloaded files are not of great quality, I have streamed .mp4s and they show up quite sharp.The built in 3.2mp camera is sharp, but not spectacular.  It's color correction is not adjusted as well as it could be, but overall it ain't bad.  There is a built-in flash.There are lots and lots of applications now available for the Storm, and they take advantage of the power and screen quality of the device, including a dedicated YouTube interface.  There is a Prodigy for Blackberry.  This was really Blackberry's attempts at rivaling the IPhone for sure.  Someone said to me that this is an IPhone for business people.Here's the downside to the phone and it's why I haven't given it 5 stars.  The documentation for users stinks.  A lot of this capability I only found through  trial and error or talking with either Verizon's own Blackberry service (they have a separate group that handles Blackberry only) and Blackberry's own people.  Comparing Verizon's literature that came with the Voyager and other phones I have used which talked about the littlest minutiae, Blackberry's documentation leaves a lot to be desired.  Thank goodness I'm pretty intuitive in this area and I know to poke around.  Still, there are things I would have liked to know from the documentation that are fairly basic.I'll cite just a few examples:You like that one can drop and drag files directly into the Blackberry Storm by using Windows Explorer?  Nothing in the documentation on that.  I found discovered this while talking to one of the RIM guys up in Canada.Want to customize your screen to eliminate icons of programs you won't use?  Or how 'bout how to customize the "desktop" of your phone?  Well, there's nothing in the documentation -- not in the booklet accompanying the phone, nor on the accompanying the CD, nor online.  I went to the Blackberry website and did a search from the front page. I put in "icon" into the search.  The only thing that came up were pages on how to create your own icons.  Again, a tech was able to explain how to do this.Third example:  When using the camera, there are several icons or numbers across the lower camera screen.  Some of them are obvious, some are curious and one, as it turns out, isn't used (the designers intially put it in and then opted not to use it, though it wasn't removed entirely).  There is NO explanation in the documentation as to what each of the icons or numbers represent.  Contrast this to the Voyager's documentation which explains each and every button and visual.  No stone unturned in that documentation.  Yes, the flash can be turned on automatic mode, off mode or forced mode, but is there anything that mentions this?  No.4th example:  That wonderful feature allowing you to switch browser-type I mention above?  I only learned about this by talking to one of the techs when I was having trouble working on a website.  Again, there is nothing in the accompanying documentation about this.So, there is a myriad of ways to customize the phone in terms of its functionality (not so much visually).  Most of these are found by using the Blackberry's menu button.  Unfortunately, some things you want to alter may need to be altered while in the application and others from the home screen.  You'll have to learn which are which strictly through trial and error.Contrast this to the IPhone.  Apple has mastered user intuitiveness.  The IPhone's interface is so obvious, at least to me.  I hardly needed to know the phone to know how to use it and how to get where I wanted to go.  The IPhone does have an open platform so many designers are coming up with apps for it.  The interface is quite elegant.  The home screen is simple and then drilling down is intuitive.But I can download files of all types and attach them in emails using the Blackberry.  An Apple rep told me that someone is working on a application which will allow downloading of files and attachment to emails.  When that happens, I'll consider it.  And while Blackberry's monthly fee is higher than Verizon's, it comes with unlimited data AND video and picture messaging, and I believe, the fee is less than AT&Ts; monthly fee.Bottom line here -- the Storm is INCREDIBLY capable.  The user interface just isn't as elegant or intuitive for the non-computer type users.  If you can be patient, and will to make a few phone calls to the techs (Clearly, they value Blackberry users business, as you get right through, no waits and all from US call centers.), once you have learned the quirks (the learning curve on this is much higher than on the IPhone), it's a wonderful and very useful phone.  The up and coming Storm 2 will apparently include WiFi (useful), but may not have the click screen (I, personally, would miss this feature, but I understand it can slow down the person who is a fast text message wiz.).I'm curious about the new Droid phone Verizon is touting.  I stick with Verizon.  Everyone I know who has tried AT&T; has not been the happiest with the quality of the reception they get when in the US.
*******EDIT******* RIM issued V5 software update. My Storm now works the way it should have from the beginning. It is very fast, no more waiting between apps. The camera focuses faster and the keyboard seems more responsive. It is like getting a new phone.I have been using the Storm since Apr of 2009. It seem to work very good for me. I have not experienced all the issues that some of the other reviewers have written about. I have had maybe 2 or 3 issues with it freezing up in the almost 6 months I have had the phone. Now I will list the positives of the Storm.Pros:1) E-mail works great2) Texting is nice3) Typing on the touch screen is much better than on my iPod touch. Have not used the iPhone4) Still camera works excellent for a phone camera5) Video camera works great6) Syncs with iTunes ok, also works well with my Mac7) I have over 1200 songs on my SD card. Media player works great8) Calendar and notes work great9) External speaker is nice to and the sound quality is ok for a small device.10) Alarm clock functions are greatCons:1) It is heavy2) During restarts it does not always find my music, requires a second restart3) Mobile office apps have to be purchased at a steep price compared to the same apps for iPhone4) Screen needs a lock feature so the mute button does not get pressed by cheek during calls5) Software updates are few and far between6) Very few decent apps for the phone7) Time does not auto change when traveling to another time zone, my old cell phones even did that.All in all I like having the Storm. I would have gone with the iPhone but I have heard bad things about the AT&T; quality and customer service. Verizon has been great and very reliable.
Just a quick comment. I lasted about a week with this phone before I traded in for a tour. I text alot and it wasn't at all user friendly. The tour has this one beat hands down..
I bought this phone when it first came out, man, I was counting the days until my contract was up! The touchscreen is the worst! There are many features this phone doesn't have. Lucky for me it broke and I was able to replace it with the Tour. The software is the same but has a regular keyboard and is easier to use. The storm also crashes a lot!
I've had mine for a week and it is going back.It looks great, has tons of sexy features, it's a real attention getter; but it's useless in real world application. I do a load of e-mail and texting when I'm on the road. That requires a decent keyboard.  The touch screen keyboard on this device is simply unusable for ordinary typing, it does not work.  I thought it might just be me, but many of co-workers and other users I've check with have the same complaint.  Someone in an earlier review said this is "an incredible productivity tool".  I'm not sure how that is true if you can't type on it.  Save yourself the frustration, get one with keys and wait for the next generation of touch screen - hopefully one that works.As an aside, the sound quality from the MP3 player is mediocre. It is okay for speeches and spoken material "books on tape", but lousy for listening to music. My Sansa Clip sounds about 100 times better.  That was not the primary reason I got the phone, however, I was hoping a good built in media player would let me get rid of a standalone MP3 device - one less thing to carry through airport security.  No luck, the sound quality on this is weak and the EQ settings are a joke.Overall a great looking device, very ambitious product, crappy execution; this is not ready for prime time.
I just got the BlackBerry Storm last week, and I already despise this device's pathetic attempt of being a smart phone. While it looks amazing and truly has some amazing qualities, this phone seriously takes like 5 seconds to transition between screens. It's the slowest phone I have ever seen. The phone has many flaws in it. I don't know if it's the operating system or whatever, but it's extremely slow and freezes all the time. It's so bad that the Verizon Wireless worker even warned me that the phone has a lot of "lag" in its transitions, but I didn't think it would be that big of a deal. Wow, I was really wrong. It feels like I am on dial-up internet when I'm just simply going through the menus and pre-loaded programs.Bottom line, if you are going to get a BlackBerry, don't get the Storm unless you have oodles and oodles of time to sit around waiting and waiting and waiting on the phone.
****** Update:Ok so I wrote one review ripping on it as junk. Went through two Storms in 4 days. Freeze machine. Slow. Horrible. Then I tried this before I took back the second phone and it seems to be working MUCH better. Overnight it went from unbelievable junk to something very workable. I still gave it one stars because it's only been two issue free, happy days in a row...:Make sure you have the latest OS- .148Select "Options">"Mobile Network">then the blackberry key>"diagnostic test">"Run".It goes through it's motions then emails you some numbers when it's finished- a couple of minutes at most. I've now got the phone I actually thought I was getting a week ago..... Try it as see if it works for you.***********************Ok spent the first two days with this phone rebooting, taking the battery, watching the "stuck" clock hands go 'round-and-'round, wating for 40 seconds to disconnect after a call(when I could actually make one) then exchanged it for another. Spent the next two days doing the exact same thing. It amazes me how a company can put crap like this out and get a way with it. They've taken a page out of the software companies manual and put out garbage and shaft the consumer. They sell an "idea" but implementation falls far short.I can't stress again how much of a piece of junk this phone is. My software is up-to-date so that's not an excuse, I'm on my second piece of hardware so the chances of that being the issue is diminished. I posted my disappointment on my FB account and got inundated with stories of the same. I haven't been able to make two phone calls in a row without an issue, surfing the web between freezes is a joke, texting actually worked fine between reboots. As for video, when I did get the phone to actually take a video it was hit or miss on whether it could actually play the video back. I mean I took the video with the camera then the camera says "play back of this file type not supported" WTF!!I compared internet and app speeds with a friends iphone, between reboots/taking the battery out, and it was a joke. Oh and the camera appears to have less the 1 mp worth of resolution. 3.2? I don't think so..I honestly can't fathom what the idiots at RIM were thinking by letting this useless piece of turd out.Tomorrow it goes back yet again but this time no exchanges. There's enough feedback around the web to realize this thing is literally a piece of XXXX and no amount of software updates is going to change that. If I were a lawyer I'd sue for the aggravation this falsely advertised hunk of junk has caused. Not to mention numerous business calls lost.At least the clerks at the local Verizon store have been friendly, though not very helpful. I guess they're used to getting these phones returned.I curse the day, a meager 4 days ago, I let the salesmen talk me into buying this thing. I went in for a Tour and came out with the shaft......I'm copying this review and posting everywhere I can. I've honestly never been so disgusted with a product before in my life and am going to do my part to make sure as many people know about this piece of garbage as possible.
After six months of suffering through using this phone I've finally resigned myself to the fact that it is a terrible piece of electronic equipment.  The phone freezes up up to six or seven times a day, in which I have to remove the battery to reboot.  Often it takes up to ten minutes for me to make a phone call because the computer is "thinking" - and it occasionally during these periods that it freezes.  My phone calls are sometimes registered in the log and sometimes they do not.  Sometimes when I try to answer the phone, the computer is thinking and I miss the call.  While the interface for my email is excellent, the phone is terrible, the internet is slow and clumsy, and keyboard is also slow and often makes mistakes.  Ever since I downloaded Verizon-Blackberry's latest update software the phone has started jamming more often.  I'm not sure how anyone running a business or in an executive/management position could use this phone and still keep their job or business (I am a college professor so time is not as pressing).  Out of eight phones I've used over the past 12 years this is far and away the worst.  Buyer beware!
I've had this phone since it first came out. Mistake number one on my part!I thought that with the Blackberry name would come a solid phone, with maybe some problems. But I didn't think it would be this bad.First off, this is a very nice looking phone. Beautiful screen, real nice color. But thats about the only thing good about this phone. It is in a word, "Junk".This phone should not have been put on the market. The software is really sluggish. When you click on a program, or go to check your email, you get this little clock that spins and you have to wait for it to finish before your program launches. Then if your phone is in portrait view, and turn it to landscape, you have to wait. Some programs might stop working because of memory issues. Heaven forbid if you need this phone for an emergency, good luck as you wait for the little clock to stop turning in order for it to be usable.And anyone in the blackberry world will tell you, that just take out the battery to reboot it. Sure that works for a little while, but by the end of the day, you're back to where you were before you pulled the battery. IF you have to pull the batter every time it starts running slow, it tells me that something is not right with this phone. Why doesn't RIM do something about this. Don't they see all of the bad reviews and bad ratings this phone is getting. Or are they finally figuring out that, yes the iPhone is a better phone, and you jumped on the bandwagon just a bit too late!! If you have a choice and you're with Verizon, get a different model blackberry, or a different phone all together. If you can jump to AT&T; and get an iPhone, do it. I know so many people that have one, and they are extremely happy with them. Solid phone. The Storm needs a little work..... a lot of work!!
It took me a long time to decide to buy the Storm.  For someone like me who is happy w/Verizon, the iPhone was out.  For someone like me who does not text, I had no preconceived notions about keyboards and texting.  I don't give a hang about that.What I wanted was email access and a replacement for my old Palm C3.  I found it.  I've loaded two email addresses (I am uncomplicated) and sync'd my old Palm desktop calendar (my Palm died months ago, but I love the Palm calendar) via Google.  With the aid of Compulink, it was a piece of cake.I only say all of this to establish a baseline for your consideration of what I have to say:  I love it.  I've loaded email, some news links and Pandora for radio (I absolutely love that!).  For someone like me who is not big on texting, the various keyboard apps built in work great.  The B'berry version memorizes my own commonly used words and smartens up as I use it.  Love that.
Prior to this phone I had a Treo, so I thought there could only be upside to the Storm.  But this phone is worse.  Typing on this phone is virtually impossible unless you are extremely patient.  The numbers are too small resulting in almost every  word having a typo.  And I have tiny fingers (my ring size is a 3), so I can't imagine how it is for the average person.  The phone also is really slow.  When typing there is a delay, making it difficult to see if what you typed is correct.  And it's virtually impossible to go back and fix it because it's hard to get the curser to go where you want.  But it's not just typing that is slow.  Making a call has a few second delay after you've hit the number.  And when I'm trying to make a call the phone often sticks/freezes in the address book.  And when I'm not trying to call someone and just trying to navigate through the phone it will call someone.  Basically it's a very poor user interface/navigational experience.  There is  nothing I like about this phone.  And to top it off customer service has been horrendous.  I'm in grad school and it took no less than 5 five calls to get my enterprise email to work (connect to my school's email).  Every time I called they would tell me something wasn't "turned on" on their end despite them telling me it was all set up during the last call.  And when I got home from abroad they turned off my enterprise functionality when I had my global phone plan removed.  Every problem I've had, I've needed to call them multiple times to fix, and these are not complex problems.  Additionally they lied to my husband when he bought the storm, telling him it wouldn't extend my contract.  However they did extend my contract two years and won't honor what they told us originally.  It is unacceptable!  Don't buy the storm and stay away from Verizon.  I've been a loyal Verizon user for about 6 years now and have totally changed my attitude toward them.
As merely a cell phone, the Storm would be mediocre at best. In fact, my prior LG clamshell phone was a better phone in terms of handling, use and overall experience. But the Storm was not designed to be merely a phone, and I didn't buy it for that purpose. The Storm is a multimedia device, and after having the phone for three weeks now, I can say that I had my doubts, but am now satisfied and intend to keep the phone. I did my homework on new phones and went with the Storm once the Blackberry App World received glowing reviews within days of its launch on April 1, 2009. There is a learning curve with the Storm, but once you learn how the device works, it can be a useful and functional computer in your pocket. Many reviews complain about how buggy and slow the phone can be (and prior models and OS were apparently), but I have learned that the key to optimum performance for the Storm is managing the application memory. Close all applications properly, do an occasional battery pull (or get a free app to simulate one) and learn a few other tricks and you can have a wide-range multimedia device on a network faster than AT&T.; Pandora is now available for free through the App World, which, as a music lover, is worth quite a bit to me. Not to mention the ability to take pictures with the Storm's 3.2 mp camera and upload them on my Flickr account within seconds. Like I said - a multimedia device.The instruction manual Verizon provides with the phone is virtually useless for anyone vaguely familiar with how a Blackberry works. But with an investment of time online at [...] and a few other sites you too can unleash the Storm's full potential. This is a strong touchscreen debut for RIM and the Storm will only get better with time (may I suggest a trackball/touchscreen combination).
I looked forward to testing this phone, for RIM and Verizon made quite a big hype out of the BlackBerry Storm when it was first released.  I waited until RIM made the necessary software updates to fix whatever bugs the phone came with.  Well, let us say that I'm glad this phone is just for testing.  The touchpad sort of touch screen, where you have to click in order for the letters or whatever to appear on the screen, is very tricky.  Texting and e-mailing are a major pain with this phone.  I always made a mistake while typing, and it takes forever to do something that would ordinarily take seconds to do.  I have small, thin fingers, so I shouldn't have had trouble with this feature.  The accelerometer is also faulty.  Firmware updates fixed this problem, but it is still somewhat sluggish.  Sometimes it took twenty seconds to switch from landscape to normal mode and vice versa.  Voice recognition couldn't be more annoying.  Sometimes I had to shout at the friggin' phone just so that they could understand what I was saying.  (And no, I don't have a heavy foreign accent or mumble when I talk.)  There is also no wifi, a big deal-breaker for me.  Then again, none of the Verizon phones I've tested have had this feature.  Verizon's 3G network is quite good, but noticeably not quite as good as the Sprint network.  (Or at least the Sprint network works better in this area.)  So, in this case, the 3G network is not a good substitute for wifi.  (Which kind of means that I will never switch to Verizon.) But not all of it is bad.  The huge LCD display is beautiful.  The videos look absolutely wonderful in this phone.  The only one that rivals such a display is the BlackBerry Bold (AT&T;).  Visual voice mail is also great.  The browser is pretty good, much better than previous BB browsers, even better than the one in the Bold.  The entertainment parts -- like video, MP3, etc. -- are quite good.  The RIM app store is not quite up to par with Apple yet, but it's not bad either.  Then there are the things that make the BlackBerry special: push e-mail, fast and reliable MMS, voice notes, calendar, etc.  The Storm's look is also quite slick.  It's got that BB look we all know and love, only edgier and sexier.All in all, the BlackBerry Storm is no iPhone killer.  It is by far, in my opinion, the worst touchscreen smartphone on the market.  As a BB fanatic (a.k.a., "CrackBerry"), I was disappointed with this phone.  No wonder Verizon has lowered its contract price and is making cheap promotions on various websites.  If you're in the bargain for a touchscreen smartphone, go for the iPhone 3G S or, if you're not an Apple fan or AT&T; subscriber, go for the Palm Pre or the newest BlackBerrys like the Curve 8900 or the just-released BlackBerry Tour 9630.  You'll thank me later.
I purchased a Blackberry Storm three months ago. It was my first "smart phone." I wanted to stick with Verizon and this seemed like the best choice. Last week, however, I cancelled my Verizon Blackberry service and switched to an iPhone. Yes, I had to pay a cancellation fee to Verizon, but I don't care. This review explains why I made this switch and I'm GLAD I did.The Storm is not really a bad product. It does some things very well, i.e., those things that Blackberry devices as a group do well. If your major concern is to gain access to email quickly and efficiently, the Storm will not disappoint. You can configure the Storm for multiple email accounts and have all of the emails come up in a single "messages" folder, something you can't do with an iPhone. It's also convenient to have the choice of deleting emails just on the device or on the server, as well. I found the SureType system for entering text to be easy to use once learned. Many people hate SureType, but with some patience and practice I found it to be terrific. For those who prefer a traditional full keyboard, the recent software upgrade incorporated a full vertical QWERTY keyboard to complement the previously provided horizontal one.I found the click screen adequately responsive, and the incorporation of swiping and finger-hovering functions is useful. Inputting calendar entries takes a bit of practice with these swiping/hovering techniques, but after a few days I had mastered the skill. The calendar function itself is sophisticated and integrates well with the phone and contacts features. The option to create multiple calendars is a useful feature. And as other reviewers have commented, the clarity of the screen is excellent. The browser system is good and includes a convenient "home screen" where one can search or access bookmarks easily and quickly. The battery is removable, and media can be stored on removable mini-SD cards (an 8 gb card is included).The various features of the Storm are accessible via small, iPhone-like icons on the home screen, which can be arranged as one wishes. Phone features are quite extensive, although the audio quality of phone calls leaves something to be desired.So--as a "Blackberry," the Storm performs adequately and its touch-screen features make it find of fun to use. Moreover, recent software updates have ameliorated some of the performance issues that plagued early users. That's the good news.Now comes the bad news. The Storm has been billed as an "iPhone killer," competition for Apple's highly successful product. It's in this head-to-head competition that the Storm falls significantly short. The fundamental problem seems to be that whereas the iPhone was designed from the beginning to be a multifunction device, the Storm apparently was based upon a design that is not really ideal for what the engineers were asked to accomplish here. The most annoying problems stem from the fact that the Storm is endowed with only very limited application memory. Apparently each time the Storm is started up at least some of this limited application memory is taken up by all of the installed programs. If one installs more than a very few "apps" that use significant memory, the device's overall performance suffers. Moreover there are continuing problems of "memory leakage." Over the course of a day during which apps are opened and closed the available memory slowly seeps away until the Storm slows to a crawl and to regain speed one has to do a "battery pull" to reboot the system and free up application memory. It is telling that one of the most popular applications used by Storm owners is "Quick Pull," a program that functions to reboot the system without the necessity of physically removing the battery.One can slow this memory leakage by using the pulldown menus to close apps each time they are used, rather than simply hitting the "red phone" stop button to put them away (still open in the background, apparently). This can be a pain: sometimes closing out of an app requires a multiple-step process that becomes laborious. Even if one  carefully closes each application the memory leakage proceeds anyway, albeit more slowly. I could never get through an entire day without rebooting the device at least once. Since this takes several minutes, it can be truly inconvenient.This memory problem poisons the entire Storm user experience. With much fanfare, Blackberry opened up its "app store" not long ago. There are not nearly as many apps available as there are for the iPhone (that's putting it mildly), but theoretically, most of the tasks that iPhone apps perform can now be accomplished through corresponding Storm apps. The bigger problem is that whereas iPhone users can add literally scores of apps to their phones will no real loss of speed, Storm owners must be oh, so careful not to overload their devices and thus slow the operating system down. I recall that when I finally decided to delete the preinstalled Verizon VZ Navigator program the Storm suddenly performed much better overall.As an entertainment device the Blackberry is barely adequate. It includes a music player that exhibits good sound quality but the system for adding music and synchronizing media with one's computer does not compare with Apple's iTunes. I ultimately found it easier to simply remove the 8gb mini-SD card and transfer my own music files directly to the card, rather than downloading the overpriced Verizon V Cast media or trying to synchronize and upload my music using the provided buggy, slow Roxie software. Moreover, some music fans (like me) will be disappointed that there is no gapless playback with the Storm (meaning that successive tracks that are meant to play nonstop with no gaps will exhibit an annoying instant of interruption).The Storm can play movies; in fact, the device comes preloaded with a very impressive film preview clip ("Babylon AD")that appears bright and bold on the screen. However, it is difficult to impossible to buy or rent videos to download to the Storm. One can buy programs that enable users to rip DVD's and configure them for the Storm, but compare this "convenience" to the availability of prepared videos for sale or rent via iTunes.As a photographer, I can attest that all cameras incorporated into cell phones are terrible. The Storm's has some nice features, including a tiny flash and a (digital) zoom function, but the resulting images (and videos) are not very good. The iPhone once lagged in this area (i.e., no video camera) but with the release of the new 3Gs model the devices are now equally mediocre when it comes to photography.Other Storm problems: It's a good idea to lock the screen when the device is not in use; otherwise pressure on the screen can accidentally start programs and problems ensue. The iPhone uses a top-lock button to lock its screen and finger-slide to unlock it. The Blackberry has a top lock button to both lock and unlock the screen. The problem is that sometimes one clicks on the button to unlock the screen and there is no apparent response. Naturally, one clicks the button again, only to find that the screen finally unlocks but then locks again. This small performance issue can be quite annoying when one is trying to access Storm features during a busy day.Also, the Storm lacks WiFi. This is not a fatal flaw, but since WiFi where available is faster and uses less battery power, it's something that really should have been included.Overall, the iPhone is faster, easier to use, can do more, and definitely more fun. Apple excels at creating user-friendly products that get the little things right. The Storm is Blackberry's first attempt at a consumer-oriented smart phone, and it's clearly a work in progress. There may eventually be multifunction phone products that will rival the iPhone, but the Storm is not a serious challenger.
With every phone, your not going to know it right off the bat. You're going to be messing up and hitting random keys until you learn your phone. I wanted the Blackberry Storm every since it came out last fall. I'm not one to drop big bucks on phones, and did A LOT of research before even going into the store. If it's one thing I want people to know, it's that you need to be as smart as your phone. I saw nothing but negative reviews about this phone everywhere I went. The fact is: they all over exaggerate problems that are fixed with service packs you download from the site itself. I also came to another conclusion, people who have love the phone, do not write a review on it. People who hate the phone and have nothing but negatives to say about it, write as much as they can (kind of like me).This phone is everything I thought it would be and more, its an iPod, a digital camera, touch screen, and worth the money. It does take some getting used to as far as the touchscreen goes, but anyone with a brain can work it. The ONLY negative thing I have to say, which is probably something I've not figured out yet, is that I bump it unlocked sometime throughout the day. I would like to see more of a sliding unlock to where you really have to want it unlocked for it to unlock...Go out and get the Blackberry Storm, then write a positive review so that people aren't scratching their heads wondering if they should buy it or not! :-)
I bought the BlackBerry Storm 9530 in February from the Verizon store. Before owning this BlackBerry, I had the Curve 8330. Going from a QWERTY Keyboard BlackBerry to the touchscreen was definitely an adjustment. It does take some getting used to, but once you give it some time, you will definitely love this phone.Pros:-SurePress Touchscreen-Vivid Resolution for photos and videos-8GB MicroSD Card included-With upgraded OS, the BB is quite fast and easy to use-All applications work seamlessly together, increasing productivity and your own happiness :)-Quality MP3 and Video player-Extremely fast internet browser (obviously depending on service in your area)-Definitely easy on the eyes, great conversation starter-All the capabilities of previous BlackBerries, including e-mail, organizational applications, etc.-Verizon Network is by far the best in coverage and customer service (again, this is based upon your area)Cons:-You need to keep up with the leaked OS updates, if you check out CrackBerry, you won't have any issues. If you keep the latest OS upgrades, you will get the full capabilities of the phone.-Takes getting used to if you previously owned a full keyboard phoneOverall:At first I had some trouble adjusting to the touchscreen, especially the fact that it's a SurePress touchscreen, meaning you physically click the screen to select something, but as I played with the device and got used to everything, this is by far the best Smartphone I have ever owned and I believe it was worth every penny.
If this phone worked as it should it would be acceptable at best, but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to avoid.The email feature is very good, although it only checks for email from most ISP servers every 15 minutes, and there is no way to force it check for new mail at your convenience. To get around this you must have all your email forwarded to a service like Hotmail or Yahoo, which means you will get copies of your email immediately. However, if you want to reply, you will not be able to change your reply-from account from Hotmail to your main ISP email provider. You'll have to wait 15 minutes until the original email comes through.When you are in a call, the screen goes dark quickly, and it requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to press keys during your call or even if you want to switch to speaker phone mode.Trying to type an email or text takes real perseverance. The default "Sure Type" mode that suggests words is cumbersome, and changing its suggestions can be maddening. Even in landscape mode with a QWERTY keyboard, an auto-correct feature takes over and requires constant vigilance. And just TRY to use the touch-and-click screen to reposition the insertion point and make a correction several letters or words back; it's really frustrating.The manual that comes with the phone and the various online tutorials don't begin to cover what you need to know to use the phone's features; you will need to attend a Verizon workshop.All of the above assumes that phone actually works as it's supposed to. After spending hours with Verizon and BlackBerry support staff, I finally got the phone to the point where it works much of the time, which is a giant step up from the way the phone came out of the box.Here are some of the problems, all of which BlackBerry acknowledges as "known issues" and which Verizon will tell you SHOULD be addressed in a long-promised and long-overdue software upgrade (think Windows Vista):* Voice-command dialing (e.g., via Bluetooth headset) sometimes results in a white screen that locks up your phone and requires one or more reboots (a reboot means removing the battery for 15 seconds, replacing it, and waiting 4 to 6 minutes until you can use the phone again).* The battery drains quickly and sometimes continues to drain when plugged into a charger; it may require one or more reboots to start charging.* Synching the Storm with Outlook can result in errors that prevent this feature from working until you spend many hours with support staff trying to find which record causes the problem; the fix will last a couple of days, before the problem recurs.* The network connection turns itself off occasionally, and you won't be able to make or receive calls until you notice that the network is off and you go into the options to turn it back on.In order to get around the Bluetooth lock-ups, I purchased a BlackBerry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset, which the manual recommends. It has cut down on, but not eliminated, the number of lock-ups.The most helpful support person was a Verizon tech who had me "wipe" the phone and start over (choose the "Options" button, then "Security Options," then "General Settings," then press the menu button and choose "Wipe Handheld"; all the software reloads automatically, but you will have to reload any personal data). That helped with most of the problems, including the Outlook synch problem, which hasn't recurred (it's been 10 days).
Is it any coincidence that co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak also carries a Blackberry? Fact is that Blackberry still reigns in the business world. As intrigued as I am by the iPhone and the huge application offering, the Storm is still king in the smartphone arena. I won't give up my iPod touch anytime soon though!I've had a couple Blackberry products, so by no means am I new convert to Blackberrys. I upgraded to the Storm and received it the Saturday after released. Friends waited in line on release day for many hours, and in all honesty, it only ended up being 12-16 hours later that I got mine from Fed-Ex by the time they made it out of the stores.Out of the box, the operating system (OS) was by no means stunning. It is a good looking phone though! Shortly after the release and the problems of typing and rotation issues, the beta OS'es were hitting the web. These made for HUGE improvements in the functionality of the phone. The downside is that RIM/Verizon is SLOW to release an approved version. The current release is still .75 which fixed all the initial huge problems. All phones are delivered with .75 today. I just completed the installation of .141 this morning, which is rumored (aren't they all?) to be what will be the next official release. I have my doubts, but it is huge improvement over many of the previous beta releases I was running.The memory leaks are FINALLY gone (went away for me with .132). I am running with ~40mb of free memory, and it stays there! Before I moved to the previous beta release of .132 I had to reboot the phone daily because of memory leaks. The upgrade to .142 gave me about 8mb additional free memory.A pointer like box was added in recent beta releases which makes corrections much easier when composing an email.As strange as it may sound, typing has been consistently getting better with the OS updates. I didn't think that this would be possible, thought it was a problem with the implementation of the touch screen.A nice drop in dash mount for my leather Piehl case has also allowed me to replace my Garmin GPS. I chose the Verizon Navigation software as it is discounted through my corporate discount plan, and most importantly traffic is offered in my area. The Garmin BB software didn't offer a manual route around detours which was a problem where there isn't traffic coverage and you are notified of a road closure.The application offering is ever expanding, my favorite of which is Pandora. That replaced my Sirius subscription, and best of all, it is free.The camera isn't half bad for a cell phone, this again has been improved with newer beta releases. Geotagged pictures are pretty neat as I have a pro Flickr account which has built in integration to the phone.<update 5-13-09>I downgraded from the 142 release, and since installed a Hybrid OS running leaked version 141 and a beta of the upcoming 5.0 base OS update. We're in for big things. The 5.0 Bold platform browser which is coming to the Storm is a huge leap forward. The browser is SO much faster under 5.0.Memory utilization is vastly improved as well. I hang in the mid 40mb free range. Mind you the OS shipped on the phone will be less than 10mb and require daily reboots (battery pull unless you get an application-free to do a true reset).Version 141 was rumored to be the next official VZW approved release OS, but it didn't pass QA. I do have a Bluetooth stack issue under 141 where BT cuts out from my S9 headphones after every song. It does the same thing when connected to Bluetooth in my car.
This is like the days of vapor ware. All kinds of promise but much lacking. The orientation of the screen hangs constantly. Try texting from the profile mode for alot of frustration as well. Battery life is 1 day with lite use. How many people have called me to ask why I have called them after the touchscreen auto dials. Listening to messages is a challenge as your ear stops them by activating the pause button on the touchscreen.Verizon called me out of the blue and asked me how the phone was doing after I had it a few months. They know the phone is a goner.Today I called to get some help as the browser/internet is connecting but a joke to use with touchscreen. Way to touchy and takes you many places you do not want to go. Try doing a stock trade...it is bad. They wanted another 30.00 a month to fix that so it could be teathered to a laptop.Goodbye Blackberry, we hardly knew ye.Update 3/28/2009Hope everyone realizes if you run out of battery power with this phone that loves to consume it rapidly, you cannot plug it in and use the power from your car/wallsocket to make a call.It must recharge first. Bad news.Update 6/16/09Phone, along with many others, self destructed after a security update taking all 170 Names and numbers with it. The 8 gig card in it does not back up your names and numbers it turns out. Imagine that. A engineering disaster this phone.
This Black Berry storm, was made to have some aplication like iphone. But doesn't have  multitouch sreen application like iphone. I phone leads some aplication but not too far.Blackberry storm 9530 is a more mature desing and aplication, but the big deal is this storm model dies have bluetooth and wifi. Why!!!!! Hardly too believe. Black berry made another storm with bluetooth Storm 9500, with a more faster interface but not with WiFi. Twice the same sin. I have to punish this with a star, but for some people maybe is not a big deal.This phone brings virtual qwerty key board, not very confortable to used, if  you write a lot. I found people that this is not a problem, but for it does.I you like the storage pic, music and videos, this item can suply all ur needs. OKWhy you should choose this over other black berry?Of the family of Blackberry, this phone is the biggest display, for see video, the display is owesome nice resolution.does it work for office?Yes, has every aplication you want if you like to typing a lot, the qwerty display, is not very confortable, made the other blackberry, can be more confortable.Display or keyboard, is the fisrt anwers you have to choose.Why a Blackberry than other?Well, Black berry has special desing of the keyboard,  but they oriented cell for documents and emailing archives.Iphone or Blackberry?Well, iphone is the best of the best, but i don see big diferent beside the multitouch funtion. The aplication is good enougth for regular needs.
If email & text messaging are amongst the major reasons for getting a high-end cell phone, you can pretty much forget about this Blackberry Storm.  I found it very difficult to type fast on this phone.  It is so BAD that I have decided to give up...and I am not a person that will easily give up.  I know this phone has other fancy features.  However, if I cannot type fast on it, all the other features are secondary and trivial.  It is like buying a car.  The car must be easy for me to drive.  Without easy driving, the car will be totally useless to me even if it comes with the most comfortable leather seat, bath tub, toilet, kitchen, big screen TV, bulletproof glass...My final choice, after looking at iphone, Samsung omnia & G phone, was Blackberry Bold!  iPhone is the easiest to type among the phones with on-screen keyboard.  However, the Bold keyboard is better than any on-screen keyboard.
This is a copy of a previous review I posted. I cannot BELIEVE The people who have serious complaints about this phone! I think the title of my review indicates how I feel about some of them.Pros: Touch screen, apps, function, well thought out, sync with Outlook, camera, email set up and function, call quality, speaker phone, speakers, music player, 8 gig micro SD, standard headphone jack...Cons: Embedded menus a bit much, some menu screens a bit austere, browser seems a somewhat slow.Quite simply: It is arguably the best "Smartphone" out there. Yes, it has some flaws, but they are FAR outweighed by its function. After a few spins around the block, it is one magnificent device. (As long as you have the latest firmware update.)It does anything and everything you want, and does most of it well. The feedback from the click screen is a great feature, imo. (When I use my iPod Touch, I end up attempting to push the screen in!!)I have had them all, and to paraphrase a well known slogan: "You can have my Storm when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!Updated on Jan 18, 2009Still LOVE it-Ideally, I would like it to be a bit "snappier," and responsive. It needs just a bit. I trust that will be taken care of with subsequent firmware upgrades. To me it's a joy.
I've had the Blackberry Storm for just about 2 weeks now.  Yes, at first it took some getting used to - but that goes for any newly owned product.Going into my 2nd week now with the Storm, I'm finding it easier and easier.  Many of the problems and issues other reviewers have posted, well OK, may "have been" true, but if you know the right fixes - the Storm is terrific.For a message board/forum for the Storm, do a Google Search for "Howard Forums Blackberry Storm".  It's the best thing I've done since having this phone.  Besides being able to ask a question, there are several posts already there that explain and give a how-to on so many aspects of the Storm.  There is a section called Tips & Tricks.Hopefully, others will change their review after making the proper adjustments and settings in the phone options.  For one, my battery life is much longer since I made some adjustments.My only problem with the Storm now is that I don't want to stay off it.  Way too many uses (but I guess that is really a good thing).I gave only 4 stars (for now) as I haven't utilized everything yet (still in the learning phase).
Touchscreen is a nuisance, key selected usually lights up the key next to it. It's very slow, it's buggy, it freezes constantly, its message display indicator shows there are still messages when they've already been deleted, the camera is the slowest thing ever (have to hold camera still about 5 seconds after you snap the photo or all you capture is a blur). The Verizon store says to just take the back off the phone every few days and take the battery out to re-boot it; it will run a lot faster, as well as remove the message alerts for non-existant messages. Just the worst piece of electronics ever. If you want a Blackberry, get a Curve.
I have had the storm for 6 weeks now. It took a few days to get used to the typing and was a breeze after the learning curve. I have had no lock-ups.Pros: LCD is very crisp  Verizon 3G network  sound is very clear and alerts and ringtones are loud  battery life (I us text, phone, email, and Internet through out the day and need to charge every other day)  Browsing is fast and if the link on a page is tiny, I just zoom in  Ringtones for people in Contacts  Great size - not cumbersome. Light-weightCons:  Not many apps yet.  Price dropped after I purchased it (story of my life)I really like this phone.
I've had this for a few months now.  First off, there are two problems with it that I have had:1. After a couple weeks it became very sluggish.  I was about to return it, it was so bad.  I found out the problem, which is not as well documented as it should be, is that I had about a dozen apps running and bogging it down.  You need to close apps as you exit, not just go to the home screen.  That could be more clear.2. Typing took some getting used to.  I had to get used to covering the key I was typing.  I'm now pretty good, and the predictive software is pretty good too.  Still probably not quite as easy as using the mini keyboard on a Curve for instance, but it's pretty good now.  If I were a high volume text'er it might be annoying, but I've gotten used to it.With those two caveats aside, this is an absolute gem of a device.  I've had a dozen different cell phones (several pda types) and this is by far the best.Almost weekly I'm surprised by the quality and simplicity of a new feature I uncover:- Basic phone use is great.  Reception is excellent.  There's even less lag than I'm used to with typical cell phone use that seems a little like an out of sync movie.- Email use works great, which is clearly a strength of blackberry vs. my previous windows based phone.- Camera - took a high quality picture on the ski slopes, hit a couple buttons and it was uploaded to my facebook account.  Cool- Music - I upgraded my Rhapsody account for an extra couple buck a month and now my storm is included on it.  I dragged over a few playlists and within a few minutes I had the best music device I've ever owned, with complete access to everything on my PC, plus with the subscription, pretty much every song ever on Rhapsody.- Voice recorder - I needed to dictate some notes on a drive recently.  Found a built in voice recorder.  Works right through the headphones included with the device.- I'm a big fan of gmail and use google calendar, et al.  They have a nice little sync app, now my google calendar and contacts are live on the storm.I imagine you'll find a different set of features that you care about, but basically, this has become an amazingly powerful device, well beyond what I expected when I bought it.If you can get used to the typing, I think you'll love it too.
I wanted to love this phone but having a screen that clicks just was not a good design.  The mere fact that you have to press, then let go to register a click makes it inherently slow. Plus you cant type without making a lot of racket, like during a business meeting or at the movies.  Maybe RIM should give you the option to turn clicking off so u can use it like any old touch screen.The device actually has gaps between the screen and the rest of the body, allowing dust and dirt to get into your phone!  On some on the shipped storms, clicks were not registering on the outer edges of the screen, necessitating uses to stuff paper, etc. in the battery compartment to make the storm work correctly.  Are u friggin kidding me? lolThe worse part of typing is actually the keyboard software itself.  Try typing any combination of numbers and letters and you are in for an experience.  Too many button presses are required to alternate between numbers and letters.  Touch screen keyboards have been around for ever.  You'd think RIM would give you something new that works well.  The storm landscape keyboard isn't as good as my old win mobile on screen keyboard from years ago.If you are use to bb's with a trackball, you are going to find navigating the storm a pain.  Try scrolling any long page.  It takes forever.  Maybe they will put a trackball on the next storm, or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone.I wont even mention the slow camera, check error, random reboots, slow accelerometer, bad browser, etc since those things may get fixed if they haven't been already.  Just dont expect to be able to run lots of apps like you see on the iphone.  It's simply not going to happen.I'll be using the bb curve until verizon release the bb storm or the palm pre.
I have owned mine for two months now and have very little to complain about. I love the true touch typing. I have tried typing on the iphone and it really does suck. I love the fact that it uses Verizon and not AT&T.; I know plenty of people with the iPhone 3G in Washington, DC and the coverage is terrible.Bottom line it is great for e-mail, perfectly fine for playing music, other media. It does a pretty good job of rendering web pages. It isn't as good as the iPhone browser, but nothing out there is. Of course it doesn't have all the cool apps and the app store (yet), but I find that a nuisance more than anything. WiFi would be nice, but I really haven't had a need for it yet.Again, bottom line is that the iPhone is a toy and the Storm is a professional's tool. If you need a device to reliably get e-mail off any type network get the Blackberry. If you want a toy to surf the internet get the iPhone. I love the Storm. I really can't complain about it.
It's a totally different product from all of the junk you are reading from late 2008/early 2009. There is a new OS for this phone and with the new RIM system for the Storm, this phone is a tremendous machine! It's a great tool, useful friend, and beautiful phone! It lets you do everything you would expect from a Blackberry, and more.I have very long nails, so I was worried that the typing would be an issue, but no. I've become a pro in less than a few day! The screen is gorgeous; the applications standard with the phone get all of your organizational work done, and more. New features are coming out every day. I live in a pretty small town where service with Sprint was never too great (which is why I swapped to VZW); internet and data use is fast, network is the best, and call quality in general is much improved. The Storm has great features that help improve call quality too. I would encourage any businessman or woman to indulge in this phone - esp. if you are already a believer in RIM products. For newbies, I say, DON'T HESITATE READING OLDER REVIEWS. The newer Storms that ship out have the latest OS, but there are even leaked OS's out there that are a few kicks better than the "Official" Verizon downloads. I installed OS .151 as an international version/multilanguage from RIM's Spanish website and the phone is a dream.I am a long time Blackberry owner. Went from the World Edition 8830 - to the Curve 8330 - Now the Storm 9530. So far, so BEST.
I just bought this phone after the keys kept sticking on my Curve. I had read all the bad reviews and decided to try it anyway--with Verizon you have 30 days to try it and return if you don't like.  I have to say I love this phone!  Right out the box from Verizon it had the older OS on it, even though the rep told me was up to date.  No big deal, took me 30 minutes or less to download .148, the new OS.  I have seen none of the lag problems that people complain about.  The camera takes awesome pics, and the larger screen is crystal clear.  I am already getting better with the touch screen.  My brother has the iPhone and said even on that it took him a few weeks to get used to typing on it.  Would I consider the iPhone if my work email was compatible?  Maybe.  But I am more than satisfied with the Storm after a week of using it!  I definitely would recommend it.
Well, perhaps hate is a strong word here. I don't hate the Storm. I wanted to like it so much that I gave it a solid week even after telling myself I was returning it the next day. Bottom line is, what I really wanted was an iphone, but I didn't want AT&T.; So I went with the Storm, as I think Verizon's network is simply the best. So...Pros and cons of the Storm (with .75 update):Pros:Excellent looking screenDecent AppsReceiving E-mail is greatIt's a BlackberryCons:The screens flips to landscape at odd times and then lagsActually using the phone was a cumbersome pain; sound quality is poorUsing the tactile click seemed cool at first, but texting was abysmalEverything was very, very slow even after shutting down appsCamera would turn on for no apparent reason; unacceptableMy ear would actually select another voice mail when using visual voice mail.Did I mention typing anything was a huge pain in the derriere?So, on day six I decided to get the ipod touch 16Gb (no, not the phone). I was literally blown away at how smooth and responsive it was. The Storm was a clumsy oaf in comparison with the interface and apps.The next day, today, I went to the Verizon store and returned it for an LG EnV Touch and the thing is great. I mean, I can actually use the phone and feel like I am talking into a real phone. I can text with ease and not be frustrated. It may not be the powerhouse that the Storm is, but I'll take usability over flash any day.Suggestions: The Storm could be great if it were quicker, much quicker and if it gave the option between simple touch or the tactile click.
I've had this phone for about 2-3 months now- switched from the LG VX8700 during the buy-one-get-one offer.  This has to be the worst phone I've ever used, the only reason I've kept it is the fantastic email service, web-browsing, and the Verizon network.  The Verizon network gives pretty great web speed (Im located in Manhattan) and the email service is easy to use, set-up, and has some great search functions. The phone has great call clarity and a very sensitive mic that can pick up any street noise.  Just about everyone around me has an iphone and the verdict is that this phone in no way shape or form can even touch the iphone.Everything else about the phone is awful.  I've just spent the last hour taking pictures with it (not by choice) and it crashed after every couple of pictures.  This is not uncommon.  The phone loves to randomly crash, during anything!  Verizon may have the best network but that doesn't mean anything when the phone itself is prone to randomly shutting down for no reason.  And it takes a long time for it to boot back up and verify security.Time is a common theme of this phone.  It likes to use a lot of it.  Switching between apps? Oh lets sit at a black screen for a few seconds.  One of the best features of the phone is its 'clock display' but to leave this mode will oftentimes freeze up the screen for 1-2 seconds.  If you think, oh thats only a second it doesn't bother me, I promise you it will after 2 months when everyone around you has technology that doesn't lag like an AOL dial-up browser.The accelerometer is the most frustrating implementation of technology ever.  This phone can NEVER figure out which way you are holding it, portrait or landscape? up or down?  My a** or a hole in the ground?  It will never switch to the proper layout easily.  And this is a HUGE problem since the landscape keyboard is the only one that works.Switching between applications is like gambling.  It might be quick it might take all day or it might just crash the thing again.Making phone calls is a nightmare.  If you press it just a little too hard against your ear it will switch to speakerphone or 'flash'.  Making a call that involves entering a button code or sequence is always fun because the screen will shut off after the call has been made and you are left guessing where to hit the screen to bring up the button pad.  And it just might crash in the process.The battery is just atrocious, it will not last a full 24 hours with bluetooth, gps, and the network on and regular use.  If you don't charge it every night you will have problems unless you shut off gps and bluetooth and use minimal email/internet.Also, if you own a mac you have to use beta software to sync it or 3rd party applications.And once you have your music synced it will never shut off your music player unless you stop it and close it all the way (which takes a few seconds of navigating menus - not just hitting 'end call') - if you pull the headphones out, say at a checkout line, it will just switch the music to speaker at whatever volume you had.Along those lines, 'end call' does not shut off any applications, you have to shut them off manually by navigating the menu.  if you have too many applications running in the background the phone will be slower and crash more.  Also since the phone does not automatically shut down applications by end-calling out to the main menu the phone has a propensity to accumulate background apps that you THOUGHT you had shut down.overall, do not want and kill it with fire. from space.  just to be sure.
If  you are a QWERTY keyboard typer and understand the whole asdf, jkl; type of keyboard set up, this phone has a perfect keyboard that you can't skip a beat on.  This phone is a patient phone as there are some many features and you have to be confident with the phone, when you select a menu once, and then hit return 5 times or select another menu when the first one is trying to load, just like a desktop computer it will get a little lathargic on you, take a breath of fresh air, be patient, now proceed.  This phone is a phenomenon, I love it and it's the best phone I've owned, it got the media basis for games, music, movies, and fun, and also so many 3rd party people making a slew of awesome extra apps for the phone from, Pac Man to Slacker Radio, but the phone still retains that Harvard, Yale Blackberry cell phone image of class and sophistication, I love the phone and if you buy this remember it's a smart phone so read the manual and tech guides and ask a Tech at Verizon about the phone as it does require some daily maintenance like setting your phone to automatically shut down all the way for a few hours daily while you sleep so that it can reboot, I have done this feature and my phone works perfectly.
I had my old LG cell phone for about 4 years and decided to treat myself to an upgrade.  I work at a University and thought the Blackberry would be helpful in keeping track of my appointments and student emails.  There was so much hype surrounding the Storm that I figured I would give it a try.  This is honestly the worst cell phone that I have ever had mainly due to the extremely buggy operating system.Pros:The phone looks nice and feels sturdy in your hand.  The call quality of the phone is also very nice and clear.  The screen is brilliant and very colorful.  The various applications that you can download for the phone (although still no centralized 'app store' yet) make it a much more useful tool.  I particularly like the weather bug, google maps, and AP news applications.  The browser on the phone works well and the web pages come in clear and load reasonably quick.  It is really handy to have a gps unit built into the phone.  It is particularly useful when traveling to new cities (which I do often).  The Verizon Navigator is also a very useful program, although I don't think that it is worth $10 a month.  The phone also came with an 8 gig micro sd card which gives the phone ample memory for most functions.Cons:I actually like the click through touch screen but, unfortunately, the operating system makes typing very difficult.  If you are using this phone to send a lot of text message or emails, you will find yourself quickly frustrated.  It seems that no matter how diligently I attempt to type, typos still abound.  The auto-correct feature is also not all that useful as it does not correct the majority of typing mistakes.  The biggest problem with this phone is the operating system.  Shortly after the phone arrived, I was notified that an upgrade to the operating system was available.  I did the upgrade.  I noticed some small improvements, but not enough to make the phone enjoyable to use.  The main problem with the phone is that it freezes and locks up at least 2-3 times per day.  When I go to use the phone, I press the screen to activate it and very often I'm met with the little spinning clock in the center of the screen.  I wait and watch it spin, and spin, and spin, and spin sometimes for as long as 3 minutes.  When you want to do something simple, like make a call, and have to wait 3 minutes for the phone to cooperate, this is unacceptable.  I blame both Verizon and RIM for rushing this phone to market for the holiday season.  I'm sure both companies knew about all the OS problems (hence the quickly released updates with more on the way), but the companies chose to try and cash in.  Shame on them.  I'm stuck with this phone for a while, but will think hard when my contract is up as to whether I will get another Blackberry or re-sign with Verizon.  I am also disappointed that Verizon will not unlock the phone so that I can use it on the GSM networks while overseas.  Initially, the Verizon rep told me that they would unlock it after I had the phone for 3 months.  That time has come and gone and now Verizon said that they will not unlock it at all.  They also tried to tell me that the SIM card was bolted into the phone and could not be removed.  Honestly Verizon, how dumb do you think I am?
The 9530 did have some serious problems when it was first released. However, it runs great with OS 4.7...and even better with OS 5.0 I love my Storm and recommend it very strongly.
The Storm is my 5th BlackBerry in the past 3 years. I like BlackBerries, but I won't waste your time with an exhaustive list of the Storm's faults (such lists are posted in many places and, surprisingly, I think most are "spot-on"). IMHO, the Storm's faults greatly outweigh its positive points and the Storm should not be sold because it is a work-in-process not yet ready for market. I wanted to like the Storm, was excited in anticipation of its arrival, but intend to replace it with a Bold asap. In summary, RIM has totally missed the target with its execution so don't waste your money and time on the Storm.
Concept and presentation = A++Implementation = CAs a Blackberry fan I was really looking forward to this model. I'm still a Blackberry fan, but will wait for the next iteration of this model because the keyboard implementation isn't up to RIM's usual standards. The concept and presentation of this Blackberry are really, really nice, but the implementation of the keyboard functions needs further development and debugging. If you're reading this RIM, don't give up on the work you've done with this, just get it matured. The long and helpful review by Dan has all the details.
I recently upgraded to the Blackberry Storm, primarily to be able to integrate my calendar, tasks, and emails with an easy-to-use mobile platform.  Obviously, this is the purpose of a Blackberry, and so I must say that the Storm does what I wanted it to do.  My only frustration with the Blackberry is that it is sometimes slow - especially at startup.  The video player is extremely impressive; the camera is good (exceptional for a phone...); and its application features are more than sufficient.  There are, of course, faster and more advanced smartphones available now, but for the reduced price of the Storm it has incredible value.
Blackberry should stick to Keyboard BB and don't try to compete with iPhone. The main issue with this phone is you just can't type (please get rid of Surepress). I have used iPhone and you can type very accurately and fast on it but on this don't ask. I actually tried my best to use it for about 6 months and after that I switched to BB Bold, what a difference.Other issue is the OS hangs randomly and when you press on certain icon something else gets pressed. In my opinion its still a beta quality after 2 OS upgrades from Verizon (RIM). May be with BOLD 2 they will fix all the issues, till then stay with BB BOLD or Tour depending on your provider.
I have never been so disappointed with an electronics purchase.  My storm is slow, sluggish, randomly shuts off (about 5-6 times a day with a 4 minute reboot period).  Not to mention that there is so much dust trapped under the screen that I can't see it on a sunny day.  Add to that that the battery life is horrible, and the reception is even worse, equals a lame attempt to make a cool phone.  But hey, it looks sleek
I've had this phone for approximately a week now. I upgraded from my VX 8700 flip-phone to the Blackberry Storm. So with this in mind, my perception and exprience with the newest Blackberry addition my vary from more experienced smart phone users. Here's the first thing I noticed:The phone looks smooth and the screen is very bright and vivid. It looks pretty basic- only 4 buttons, large icons, it just looked simple yet luxurious.  The main downside to The Storm, is the touch-screen.  In a way it sort of evens itself out. Because although the keyboard and Sure-Press capability may not be that easy or accurate, it does make up for it with its large screen. I text a lot so when I first got the phone I tried to text and found it extremely frustrating. It got to the point where I just stopped and if I received a text message I would be upset because I didn't want to attempt to text them back. However, with the switch to any new phone comes adaptation.The features that come with this phone don't seem very clear or easily accessible. For example, today I woke up and my phone will not connect with the internet. I tried searching ways to fix this or for a number I could call, but there it's confusing when trying to flip through all the options.I'm keeping this review short because I've only had the phone for a week and I don't feel like I have a complete understanding of it yet.  I'm sure I will become more comfortable with it.
Ok so I bought my first Storm in December... by January I realized I had a phone I despised. by February Verizon send me a new Storm. One of the many problems with the phone is that you can not put the phone on your shoulder and talk... it will inevitably press the touch screen and either mute your conversation or put your caller on speakerphone. I do enjoy the ease of text and having music on my phone.... but I have an Ipod so... I dont have to have music on my phone... but it is easier to just have one item to take in for a man... since they dont carry a purse like us...after seeing all the problems I had with my Storm my husband decided he didnt want to get a storm that he is picking something else. He also says he doesnt like the reception when he talks to me on it.
This phone looks nice on tv and it draws you in when you see all the neat features however, I have only had this phone for about a month and the phone has already froze up on me twice.  I had to remove the battery and put it back in in order for it to start again.  I have a friend who has the same exact phone and his crashed completely.  He had to call Verizon and they replaced the phone immediately.  I hope that I dont have that to look forward too.
The storm is by far the most satisfying phone i've ever owned. With that said, it took a lil effort to get it there. When you first purchase the phone. You'll notice the lag of the OS. (Can't miss it) Everything you want to do, down to making phone calls becomes a hassle as you wait for the phone to respond. When the Storm does what the storm is supposed to do it's a great device. I recommend anyone thats serious about purchasing a Storm check out Crackberry.com prior to their purchase. You can see issues that most have, the remedies, and work-arounds. With an OS update, pretty much all of my issues i had with the Storm were taken care of. These are NOT official OS updates. As verizon has not released an Official update to the OS that ships with the Storm. Hope I helped!!
This is, BY FAR, the worst phone I've ever owned.  I've had it about a year, and I tried to give it an honest chance.  But it seems that this was a rushed product with numerous bugs that seem to get worse with every new software update that comes out.First of all, I am not a power user.  The only additional software I run on it is a Twitter/Facebook app, Bloomberg, and occasionally Slacker radio.  I also have two email accounts hooked into it.  In other words, I'm hardly pushing the envelope.  Even so, there's considerable lag in the OS, and I run current official updated software.  Today, my auto spell check stopped working.  No explanation, no reason, and all the correct options are checked.  The screen dims to an unreadable level - again no matter how the options are set.  It insists on vibrating and ringing when a call comes in, again despite the options checked.  Oh, and did I mention that I'm on my THIRD one because of the instability of the OS?  One thing I will say is that Verizon has been very cool about replacing this crappy phone.  Whenever I explain the issues I'm having, they don't argue, complain, or even look surprised.  They simply swap it out.  Nothing is ever that easy - I'm guessing they know it's a crappy and unreliable phone.The biggest mistake I ever made was not return it within the grace period.  Don't bother with this phone at all.  It's junk.  And if this is what I can expect from RIM going forward, this was my first Blackberry and it's certainly my last.
I foolishly figured I would be different...they would have fixed the problems by the time I got my two BB Storms last week (Feb 09). Yes, I got latest generation with the latest version.WRONG!!!These phones are the most bug-riddled electronics I have ever purchased:Ringer goes silent on its own, miss calls all day long.Constant lock-ups.Hard reset by removing battery ten times a day.Sloooooooooooooooow response to key presses.Press one key, another responds.Nothing short of complete trash.Oh, and these $500+ phones don't come with User Manuals. You have to use the CD version. So sitting down and reading through the manual ain't happening.Both are going back tomorrow.  Beleive all the negative comments you read about these phones.  Maybe by version 10.0 of the software the phones will be tolerable, but at 3.02 now, they are nothing more than a brick.OLT: It is a shame I have to give these phones at least one star to leave a comment. They deserve ZERO.
I am totally in agreement with the reviewers who have given this phone a one or two-star rating.  I use an AT&T; Blackberry for work and my personal phone was a Razr.  After becoming familiar w/the Blackberry at work, when it  was time for  me to upgrade my phone w/Verizon, I wanted to get the best; so, I purchased the Storm. It took me three  months to decide which new phone to upgrade  to.  What made me choose  the Storm is my boss, who likes only the best, had recently purchased one after owning the Treo; she said that she preferred the Storm over the Treo, citing that the Storm is easy to use.Well, as far as I am concerned, nothing could be farther from the truth.  I have had the Storm for four days.  I have learned to use the basic functions using the built in "Help" since the manual was vague. If I am talking on the phone, I find it too easy to inadvertently touch the speakerphone button.Verizon told me that if I returned the phone it would cost me $35 to reshelve it, but I am beginning think that it  is worth  the reshelving fee just to get rid of it.  I am seriously thinking of changing my service  to AT&T; so that I can get an Iphone.
There are good and bad things about the Blackberry Storm.  If you're reading this, chances are you've already researched this phone a bit and you've probably read other reviews.  Obvious comparisons are abound about the Storm vs. the iPhone.  The Storm is a well built phone, but the interface just doesn't compare.Pros:Organizing your life with the Storm is easy.  The calender, alarm, notes, and navigation are a little tough to learn at first, but are easily mastered.  If you have used a Blackberry before, you'll have no trouble picking this up and going on your way.  Hey, this is the main feature of a Blackberry...right?The build of the phone is nice and sturdy.  You don't have to worry about breaking this when you throw it in your pocket.Micro USB standard charger - this means a lot of your electronics will use the same charger.The internet is fast, if you can deal with the touch screen.Jim Halpert is featured on the commercials!  Big tuna.Cons:I've used the iPhone and the LG Dare, so I know touch screen phones.  The Storm is a nightmare to text on.The touch screen clicking takes a bit to get used to.  I didn't like it, although I'm sure some will.  When I highlight an application, I expect it to open...I don't expect to have to highlight something, THEN click it again.No built in internal memory - you'll need to pick up a micro SD card if you want to put videos or music on there.The screen isn't as impressive looking as either it's touch screen counterpart the iPhone or it's AT&T; brother, the Bold.The bottom line is - if you can get used to the touch screen, this will be a fine phone for you.  I didn't like the touch screen, so most of the features didn't do what I needed them to.  This phone is just too young - wait for the next version.
RIM was way too hasty in getting this phone to market.  It is extremely slow at opening all applications, even compared with three year old models of Blackberry Phones.  Lots of glitches with the keyboards, the accelerometer, and applications crashing.  The phone would often drop calls and loose reception just as you are trying to load a page or reply to a text.But by far the worst part of this phone is the screen, which makes quick typing w/ any accuracy impossible.  the fact that you need to click the screen down for each letter means you cannot begin pressing the next letter until you have allowed the screen to move fully into the up position.  so if you like to type quickly this will really bug you.  The blue haze which is supposed to let you know whhich letter you are on is completely useless and often misleading since it lags your finger position.  The software on the iphone which shows the letter above your finger on the screen as you touch would be a nice addition to this phone.Overall VERY Disappointed, RIM needs to rethink this one  Returned the phone after 4 days.
I really WANTED this phone to work.  It looks awesome, the screen is sick, and it just feels nice to use.  However, the functionality is just not there.  I only had it lock up on me once in my 30-day trial and with the latest software it was rarely sluggish.  The accelerometer on mine was responsive, but sometimes it had a hard time deciding which way was up.  I really like typing with surepress as long as you took your time.  I actually had Rhapsody prior to this phone, so that compatibility was a plus and subscription music worked no problem.  So overall, everything worked, with patience.In the end though, these are the reasons I traded it in for a Curve:1. Correcting errors in messages is insanely frustrating.  I mean, just stupid.  Using your finger to pinpoint a spot in the text is nearly impossible.  (One fix is making the text super giant size.)2. Actually, call quality and dropped calls were a problem for me.  It's a phone first so let's get that right.  I was coming from a Q, which is not a powerhouse, but that phone worked 2x better with 50% less dropped calls.3. Micro USB connector.  Are you effing kidding me?  How difficult is it just to use a regular mini-USB? (I guess not enough room.) No Wi-Fi was not a big deal for me, but this is just cause it makes me mad.4.  The outside buttons are completely worthless.  They are so easy to push inadvertently that you need to turn them off anyway.  The battery cover tabs catch your pocket sometimes and I don't see those lasting long.5. General functionality.  Again, everything is just more difficult on this phone because of the interface.  The concept is great, but the push action of surepress makes you select wrong things and get into all kinds of trouble.  Browsing isn't that intuitive because fingers are just not that precise.  You end up zooming and loading a page 3 times before you can accurately select a link.  The cursor function is a joke.So for those of you stuck with Verizon and really wanting a solid touch-screen phone all I can say is just be patient with this little guy or wait for it to get better with upgrades or the next version.  Seriously, all this thing needs is a trackpad/ball and it would be the goods...which defeats the purpose of touch screen.Oh PS.  I just think it's funny in the Storm commercial on TV with the guy in the park.  That's about as slow and deliberate as you need to be.  Also, when he motions to scroll the screen it moves the opposite way that it actually does.  Silly people.
I thought it would be cool to get the latest gadget, but I really regret it. I've been struggling with it for nearly a month. I've always disliked my Blackberrys, but this one I find virtually useless for business purposes.  I'm not much of a techie and find it frustrating that the tricks to using Blackberrys successfully require tapping into techie folklore rather than a users guide.Positives:- Beautiful screen- Separate menu for email vs. SMS (yay - finally!)- Great for viewing emails, presentations, speadsheets, etc.- Seamless operation with my Rhapsody music subscription account- Camera with a flashNegatives:- Anything that involves typing - so simple things like unlocking the screen, calling someone, sending a text message and sending an email are very frustrating and time-consuming events that I now avoid.  Sadly, these functions are why I have the phone.  Typing on the QWERTY screen works best, but errors are continuous and time-consuming.- Two hands are required to operate phone at all times- Operations are mysteriously slow at time. Sometimes I can't answer calls.  Sometimes the keyboard orientation won't change.- Access to contacts is difficult and time consuming. Scrolling was much easier.- Use almost requires a Bluetooth headset.  If you smile or bump the screen with your face while talking on the handset, you will turn on the "mute" or "speakerphone" setting.  Very irritating.- General handling of the phone. The phone screen cannot touch anything or it will "click", activating a function.- I haven't found the webbrowser to be very useful either. This is probably something for me to work on.If I didn't need email access, I would be ecstatic if I could return to a regular cell phone and texting.  But, if one must have a Blackberry, I would recommend the World Edition or Bold over the Storm for certain.
It's very simple:  I've had this phone for 3 weeks, and it's basically unusable because the phone will crash every few hours.  It will crash (and become unusable unless you take out the battery and wait 5 minutes) sometimes when you take a call, make a call, take a photo, take a movie, send an email, play some music, etc.The phone is simply not reliable, and unless you don't mind losing calls or having your phone crash when it's supposed to wake you up in alarm mode, this phone is not for you.
Purchased the BB STORM 9530 cell phone a few months ago with great anticipation.  It has been anything but!  First off, I am very disappointed in in the "touch" screen itself!  Yes, you have to slightly depress it to get that clickish feeling, but it is a MAJOR hassle to type a text / email.  If you don't place your fingertips directly over the letter / number, you will be constantly correcting your mistakes.  There is NO WAY one can type at a fast pace on this phone!  It seems like you are relegated to almost "one finger" typing in order to complete a text.  Plus, the auto dictionary feature keeps changing routine words to other words, so you have to backspace, then hit the space bar to proceed.  Very annoying, to say the least!  The other thing about the screen is that is is NOT sealed around the edges, so dirt and moisture can seep in underneath it.  I accidentally found this out when I spilled a little water on it.  I quickly dried it up and figured I had saved my phone from catastrophe.  The next morning, my imaging on the phone was "cloudy" plus the BB kept turning itself off!  I took the battery out and let the phone "dry" itself out.  This worked, but a sealed screen would have prevented this!  (Also, make sure you have a screen protector on it to avoid smudges on your screen.)  My last complaint is that the browsing experience is very slooooooooooow and tedious.  Again, the touch screen is not user friendly in this case, either!  To be honest, surfing the Internet on ANY cell phone is not even worth the trouble.....I'd rather do it on my PC at home.  If I had to make a sound choice on a BB, it wouldn't be this one.  (It does have some nice features plus is sleek and stylish, but not enough to overcome these issues!)  I actually like the newer BB TOUR 9630.....it's more my type of phone.  Oh well, the STORM is my phone until my official upgrade date arrives.....in 2011.  (Sigh!)
I really love this thing.  Since upgrading to the newest version of the OS (4.7.0.151) the interface is extremely fast and beautiful to use.  Data transfer speeds are great and the screen quality is better than an iPhone.  They just dropped the price making this phone even better.
So I 've read all the reviews and did plenty of research before buying the Storm. I have had it for a few days now and really have nothing bad to say about it. I am coming from an LG Venus but have used the Palm Treo in the past and they don't even come close to the Storm. I haven't had any issues that you will be sure to find on here, no crashes, no lagging and everything works as it is supposed to. I bought this phone, not expecting it to replace the I-Phone, I have an IPOD Touch for playing games and listening to music. I have added a few applications to the Storm and they all work flawlessly. I shut them down when I am done using them, which is really no problem. The touchscreen really only took a day to get used to ( I can type just as well on the storm now as I could on my old phones.) It basically comes down to what you will use this phone for. E-mail, basic internet browsing and social networking sites, this phone is perfect. If you are looking for games/apps and want to be able to drink a "beer" from your phone then by all means go buy the Iphone (I hear they have picture messaging...... Coming soon) Overall, it may take a day to get used to, but it is well worth it. Added Wifi would move it from 4.5 stars to 5, but not having it is by no means a deal breaker.
This is an example of a product being released before it was ready. I purchased the Storm as soon as it came out and have used it for about nine months. I can't count the number of times the phone has locked up, dropped a call, or been impossible to answer. I was a Blackberry fan with simplicity and reliability being key factors. The Storm doesn't offer either.Word Mole is fun and a great way to learn to use the keyboard. Having messages and emails separated was nice compared to the older Blackberry. The browser is nice but many pages still don't render properly due to the size and the lack of usability of some sites.For me, it seemed that at the most critical times the phone locked up. The battery had to be removed and replaced to reset the phone.The phone is also heavy for a portable device. The intent was good with this Blackberry but I believe additional R&D; is necessary prior to another release. For a minute, I thought it was a Microsoft product.
typing is really annoying on this phone one of the worst touchsreen phones i have ever used if the typing mechanism breaks your sol and have to buy a new phone
I was excited to get the BB Storm when I upgraded from the BB 8830.  I spent about two weeks with it and it was not at all easy to use.  The touch screen is nothing like the iPhone and was a total drag to use.  There was a delay between when you touched the screen and when the button you pushed took any action.  Dialing from your address book was also a pain in the neck.  I had high hopes for this model, but Blackberry blew it on this.  It seems like they rushed the touch screen to market and didn't really fine tune it to make it perfect.  The Blackberry Storm is FAR from perfect.  Also, the touch screen isn't touch sensitive, you actually have the press the screen in in order to activate the key you are pressing, thus slowing typing down considerably.In conclusion, I sent this unit back after two weeks of struggling with it.  It was a very very poor design and was not nearly as easy to use as my previous Blackberry 8830.  I went back to the 8830 because it worked so well.
Recently bought this phone used off Ebay. It has been great and not laggy to me hardly at all. Yes if you're trying to run 10 apps at once it's going to lag pretty bad, but it is not much different than Windows OS. If you close stuff down that you don't need anymore and move on to the next app you should be fine. The only problems i've had with mine hanging or being laggy so far are from poorly programmed third party apps.Before this phone i had an LG Dare so I will compare a little here. Also, note that I love my Dare and the only reason i switched was because i wanted the ease of the email and data plan. The Storm is quite a bit larger than the Dare, as far as cellphones go. Screen size is very nice on the Storm and the weight from Dare to Storm increase quite a bit. The Storm feels a lot sturdier than the Dare. I LOVE the click in screen. No more accidental button pushes from brushing the wrong key! With the release of the .148 firmware the Storm now has the full keyboard in portrait view also which is what i almost always use.Has a very nice assortment of downloadable apps. If you're looking to play the ocarina or drums on your phone then get an iphone... You won't find those here. At least not yet...On thing that i see that can be a big pain for people is going from a Curve or similar BB to the Storm. If you are use to the trackball and physical keyboard you may not like the Storm's setup. Just a fair warning. This is my first BB so it does not bother me. I love it!All in all a great product as long as you know what you're getting!
I keep debating whether or not to pay the ridiculous fee to downgrade. I definitely do NOT get my money's worth each month. I have to constantly take out the battery to reboot it because it freezes all the time. I miss calls on a regular basis, sometimes calls don't even show up in caller ID and go straight to voicemail. There tends to be a tinny ambiance when talking on the phone and can be hard to hold a conversation. I can charge the battery all night, and 10 minutes after taking it off the charger, it's already down a bar. Sometimes I charge it all night and it doesn't even charge at all. Many websites for the internet require Flash player, which I have yet to find an app for with the BB Storm. There aren't too many free apps available either. The camera sometimes pops up for no reason at all or the screen just goes blank or gets "glittery." The camera sucks. You push the button and have to wait 2-3 seconds for it to take the photo. Sometimes my custom alerts don't work, and the default sound plays. I have yet to figure out how to get the voicemail to stop from automatically entering my password. Why bother having a password if the vm is going to enter it for you? I wish it had a normal mini-USB port, but then again, it's all about making money by having its own port. I had to buy a new car jack (which didn't last long, and I can't take it back now) since the only one I had was a mini-USB. I have a Mac, and the CD software that comes with the BB Storm doesn't work on it, so I had to go searching on the BB website for software. I think truly the only thing I like about it is that I don't have to be in a wi-fi hot spot to use the internet, I can get my email, and I can attend to my Facebook addiction. I also enjoy the screen quality since I am a photographer and keep some sample images on my BB Storm to show people.
Does your computer ever give you the busy signal when it's processing something?  You know, the turning sand clock thing?  The storm has a similar thing, and it comes on A LOT.  (So I guess storm processes a lot...very slowly...).  For example, I'd get a call, I'd click the "unlock screen" button, and would then get a busy processing clock signal.  As I wait, I hear a beep, and still a processing signal.  Finally screen comes on and lo and behold the person has gotten voice mail and left me a message, while I had been sitting waiting to pick up the phone.  What the heck?  Phone didn't do it's phone job!!!!  I call that a failure.It's fun and maybe if I used it for a few months I'd get used to it.  Everyone I've spoken with says this phone has a "high learning curve."  That's dumb.  A phone should be easy to use, and I shouldn't have to 'work' to get used to it.  It should be blissful right off the bat.I recommend getting something else.  I'm personally gonna go with the Samsung Saga.  It's touchscreen, plus has a stylus, plus has a mouse, plus has a full keyboard.  Easy to use.  Great.(Iphone is a similar pain in the neck...people say typing on that is also a huge hassle until you 'get used to it' which means you have to try typing something 3x before you actually get it.  Ach.)PS. I DID take my phone to the store to exchange it because I thought I had a bad one, but the folks said that was "totally normal."  Also, the phone takes 5minutes to restart- so forget battery pulls to speed things up!  And trust me 5 minutes feels like forever when you need to make a call. (I thought this was an indication I had a bad phone, but the store people said this was totally normal as well.  Plus many sites online say it's typical for the storm.) booo.
I have used several different makes and models of cell phones and I can say that the Blackberry STorm is the very worst of anything I have used.  The keyboard will type letters that were not touched...the lag time is too long... the voice dialing does not work half the time...I could go on and on but I just wish I would have gone with the Iphone.  At this point I am stuck with a phone I hate and a two year contract-Joy!
Disappointing across the board.  Slow function, slow camera, freezes up, switches modes without reason, and worst of all, has a terrible microphone.  People complain about not being able to hear me all the time.  A failure across the board.  I'll buy an iPhone the day it becomes available on Verizon without looking back!  Great potential, terrible execution.
I recently purchased the Blackberry Storm after carefully reviewing similar products available such as the IPOD Touch, Motorola Krave, etc.  The Blackberry is by far the much better choice.  It feels great in my hands and has fantastic response time.  I'm not experiencing any of the slow reactions that one blogger recently documented concerning the Storm.  If surfing the internet is what one wants to do, it's done very easily and quickly.  I like the way in which the screen orients itself when the user tilts it to landscape left or right.  Folks, touch screen phones are the way of the future--What better way to stay in the loop with a quality device from the premier manufacturer of smartphones today?  Blackberry forever!
First I'd like to start by saying that this is my first BlackBerry and while there are a lot of cool things about the Storm, there are some drawbacks when compared to other devices.  I have used a Windows Mobile phone for the past 4 years and have enjoyed easy wireless sync of email, contacts, calendar and tasks to our Exchange OWA server.  I'd like to mention easy because it was just that. No hassle, no IT involvement and best of all, no additional cost beyond having an unlimited data plan.  So this is the standard to which I set my experience.  Keep in mind that this is mostly a comparison of "over the air" sync.So why switch...well, I got tired of the inherent lag/sluggishness of Windows Mobile phones and wanted a change.  Figuring that the BlackBerry has been in the email market the longest, it seemed a safe bet.  Unfortunately the email sync was probably the greatest disappointment of the entire device.  It's too bad too because the rest of the phone is very well put together.  Since most other email friendly smart phones have ActiveSync built in, they can seamlessly sync over the air with Exchange.  The Storm however cannot if there isn't a corporate BES server available. If there is, you need to purchase the more expensive data plan at $45/mo as opposed to the personal data plan at $29.  I don't understand why but that's just how it is.  Only with a BES server on the back-end, will you enjoy full email sync including calendar and contacts.  One other annoying thing is how it's charged/sync'd.  I purchased the OEM cradle and while the single USB cable will charge/sync simultaneously, it won't do either if your computer goes into standby, which mine does after 20 mins of idle.  I woke up this morning to find my phone fully sync'd to the PC, but with a dead battery.This is probably what will prompt me to return the phone and go back to my Windows Mobile.  I'm disappointed too because the responsiveness of the phone is very good and I am really enjoying the push screen.  It makes a world of difference over other touchscreen only phones.  Plus, the built-in email, calendar and contact apps are very well designed.  The layout is nice and easy to read and edit.  Yes you can use a cable to sync calendar, contacts, email, etc but all devices can do that so I don't really consider that a reason to buy.I'm looking for a phone that supports easy wireless sync of email, contact and calendar, voice-dial via BlueTooth, plays media, supports MMS and has good performance (not a WinMobile).  The Storm and the iPhone come close but neither can do all of these things.  I will probably purchase the iPhone however since it at least supports my core needs of ActiveSync.I hope this helps you all.
The Good:Video camera and cameraThe Bad:Clumsy (and slow) media playerInability to stream media (i.e. Pandora) through 3G networkCannot load Flash player onto browser (for YouTube)Absolutely cannot text with one hand!Keyboard is VERY tough to use.  I text a lot less because the keyboard is so tough to use (could be a blessing in disguise)As you can see, the bad outweighs the good on this phone - I recommend waiting until BB figures out how to improve on the keyboard and upgrades the software.SatNav system is additional $9.99 per month!
have fun waiting 6 seconds everytime you press a button, and if you press one by mistake have fun letting this processor figure out what you want to do while you stand there in public looking at your crackberry.  takes 30 seconds just to re-vert the screen.  video and music is great, but when i need to make a call when its important this thing allways fails...  ive had it for a week and the screen is getting glitched lines already, and it gets stuck on a white load screen,  ive had he phone for 2 weeks and the thing barley starts up,not even worth the time i spent adding my contact.i can barley get the thing to turn on,  it takes 10 minutes to get off this blank white screen,  i swear this phone is going to last me another week.  \
...well using this is not even close to being as easy as they show in the commercial (a commercial being deceptive, who'd of thought?).  The whole OS for this thing is very flaky (and yes, I purchased this in February of 2009).  Here are my gripes:1. The pointer/cursor disappears when you need it.2. Movement around the web browser is very sluggish.  Mind you, this is happens on websites that are built for mobile web browsers.3. The pointer/cursor will often show a magnifying glass while over a clickable button.4. Touching the screen sometimes makes you zoom, when what you wanted to do was pan.5. I tried to edit an Excel sheet in it.  It was nowhere as easy as it is to do with a PDA with Windows Mobile.  In fact, I couldn't edit the sheet at all.  It kept giving me an error message regarding an unsupported formula.  The unsupported formula was "TEXT", which is a basic Excel formula.6. You click the send button on a phone message, and all it does is take you to the phone screen, where you have to type in the phone number/address (from memory).  On most phones, you click the send button on any phone message, it starts a call to that person.7. The VZ Navigator, one real advantage over the iPhone, costs 10 dollars a month extra.8. No wifi.9. With the SurePress feature, it takes me longer to type out a message than if I had used the regular keyboard.  In fact, I have to struggle just to get it to type one word.  If someone out there knows of a good tutorial on how to use this (not the one that verizon/RIM gives), I would like to know.  As it stands right now I can't use SurePress.10. There are no keys on the keyboard that allow you to move the cursor within the text field.  If you mistype something in a message or field, you have to delete all the text right up to the point of the error.11. The selection mode is, once again, flaky and difficult to use.12. When transitioning between portrait and landscape, the screen will sometimes lock up on me.  It will also give me portrait when I clearly have the phone in landscape and vice versa.  I have found that shaking it sometimes gets it properly oriented.If many of the problems above are due to me not being acclimated to the OS, then I think that RIM should have some sort of physical tutorial on how to use their OS.  I've had this phone for 3 weeks now and it is still very difficult for me to use for many of its features.I wish I would have gotten the iPhone instead.
I returned the phone. crashes, slows down, restarts, volume control issues. why pay $200 for these kind of problems. My friend has the same phone, same issues and is in denial. If you're courious about the phone,try it, but dont feel obligated to keep it. In this economic struggle, play the roll of the consumer. Force big companies like this to not cut corners and make something good, not just make $$. Find out return policies. BB, Verizon, Rim, did nothing to help with the problems.
Like the title states there are some issues with the OS. I received it with the .75 OS on it and updated it to the .90 leaked OS.  The .75 OS is a little more stable that .90, but .90 runs much faster. Since launch the OS has improve ten fold and RIM is continuing to work on the issues with as show by the the leaked OS.  If there was no OS updated I would stay stay far away from this phone.  The phone is great.  It takes a day or two to get use to the set up and the click screen, but once you get use to it I think it is much better than the Iphone. even though I miss some of the touch screen feature the Iphone/Ipod Touch has.  There is not a ton of 3rd party apps for the Storm yet but they are coming.  Some that are a must is Orb, Talklock and Flycast/Moodio.Basically if you need a smartphone that is as good as the IPhone right now and can't afford to deal with so small OS issues that are being worked out than don't get this phone.  If you can that run out and get it now.  I've had it for a little over a week and love it and can't be without it.
Please listen to the reviews this phone is horrible. I am a programmer and figured I could get around the issues, thought that maybe people were exaggerating but everything is true. It constantly freezes, shuts itself off, takes forever to come back on after pulling the battery, the screen does not flip properly(flips when it should not flip). Do not waste your money this phone is horrible nor is it reliable.
I received this phone December 25th 2008 by April 2009 it was already defective the detent was just about gone. Verizon had me trade in my new phone for a reburbished phone. This is nothing at all like a Palm Treo device. This is not a true touch screen.The response from this phone is only slightly better than the original phone I purchased. It lags badly whenever something is going on like just dialing a phone number manually.What really frosts me is the fact the sales associate says there were improvements in the works. This phone was released to the public way before the bugs were fixed in an effort to keep up with AT&Ts; I-Phone at least in my experience and opinion.It has very Impressive features but if you don't intend to use Navigation, Email, or all of the bells and whistles.Don't Buy this phone just yet, and if you do, exercise your right to return it. If you do have a problem or aren't quite satisfied you will be stuck with it if you let the window close on Verizons return policy.I am told the new software update fixes many of the existing bugs prior to June 1st 2009. The Jury is not in yet.
Pass on this beta product and get another phone or blackberry.I've had the Blackberry Storm for over 6months.  Initially was intrigued by the touchscreen - but the newness has worn off.  Verizon and RIM have yet to issue an update [its the end of May 2009] while other carriers have issued newer versions of the operating system software.Yes, it does have copy and paste which the iPhone doesn't have - but I can almost never get the cursor into the right position to actually cut and paste what I need [apple's approach to highlighting things - as in the safari browser window would be appreciated].  So I end up retyping most thingsThis thing has a memory leak like a sieve.  It needs a battery pull at least daily to restore the usable memory - if not it will have ZERO memory available and it will bog down and run VERY SLOWLY [ie switching between apps].The accelerometer is also slow - but how much of this is due to the memory leak slowing it down.....don't know.There are more apps coming online [small plus]Verizon's vaunted network is HORRIBLE where I live [but is ok when I travel] - I'd like to see the network guy and the network follow me at my kids ball games and have the 'service' drop out.Also the apple/mac sync software is barebones and really isn't very good, either.
I thought the Storm would be all I'd ever wanted and more.  And if it were working properly it would be!! When I opened the box and powered up the phone it had someone else's stuff on it.  Called Verizon, they walked me through how to wipe it.  Everything was great til I tried to use the camera.  Spent nearly 3 hours on the phone with a Verizon tech guy. We went through every step/optin that RIM had to fix it and he determined the hardware is bad.  No wonder the last person returned it....  We'll see how my replacement phone works - it's in the mail.
This is my first Blackberry, I was so excited to start the New Year, organizing all my business contacts, calendar etc., into one unit. Well, that is not going to happen with the Storm keyboard unless I have lots of time to type and re-type when it chooses the wrong letter, under my finger. As you can tell I am not a techie, but was hoping to get up to speed, I guess I need to go back and start all over with the Curve. I know from all my colleagues that it is practical and works.
PROS: I had been with T-Mobile for over 10 years and in spite of ATT and Verizon having better phones I remained a loyal T-Mobile customer until the STORM!!!CONS: I early termed my contract with T-Moble and purchased what I though was the MUST HAVE Storm.  I was a little concerned after the first day but, by the 3rd day I was utterly frustrated with too many issues with the phone.  The accelerometer frequenly would get hung up. I would turn the phone and have to wait a second for the screen to adjust to the new position.  The lag time was crazy.  I actually liked the touch screen concept but even with the  blue guiding light you can not tell what damn letter you are touching.  If you send a lot of e-mails or other text well, take a deep breath and try not to throw your phone against the wall.  And the keyboard -- has a mind of it's own.  Appearing out of nowhere,  there is no shortcut key to "hide keyboard".  Also when I put the phone to my ear,  I would either end up hitting the mute key or the speaker key.  The Iphone has sensitivity built in which hinders this when the phone is put to your ear, the Storm does not.CONS: I was not impressed with the browser which lagged and some pages would never open.  I aslo wish there was an App Store. The camera takes forever but that is not a major issue for me.  The lack of WiFi was a major mistake.  Scrolling through items on the screen is not smooth or fluid as the iphone as there seems to be a bit of a stagger/studder.  Navigating between menus is not a smooth process long and in some cases progams freezed.PROS: Now the screen display is amazing and puts a real hurting on the iphone.  The Storm has so many features. I loved and purchased the Ringback tones--this feature allows you to assign music to individuals so that is what they hear when they call you.  The Voice GPS was perfect very time. The sound is in stereo and I was amazed at the qaulity.CONS: The problem for me is that the features about the Storm that I like are already found in  my digital camera, my iTouch, my Ipod and my Garmin.  What I desired most in a phone the STORM lacks.  Had RIM waited longer to fine tune the Storm, they would have really put the iPhone in check.  Now that being said, I left my 10 year relationship with T-mobile and purchased my Storm on 12/24 and by 12/31, seven days later,  I returned to Verizon and cancelled my contract (well within the 30 day period).If I was going to stay with a touch screen I felt I might as well go with who has the best at this time so, on 12/31 I joined ATT and am the happy owner of an Iphone -- Pretty close to perfection.  There is no Storm...not yet...just a mild rain. I am still shaking my head because I really was expecting so much more.
I was very excited to get this phone, but i do have to admit that once i had it for a few days i was disappointed. I also have a Blackberry Curve, and it has stood by me through everything. I think i could drive over it with my car and it would survive. Always, the Storm had a lot of hype behind it and i wanted to get one.Some of the good: I loved that you could turn the phone to its side and get a horizontal keyboard. This really helps with texting and sending emails. You are also able to send MMS something the iPhone doesnt offer. I love the blackberry platform, and the ease of use for the phone.The Bad: The phone froze a lot, and i found myself having to remove the battery to do a reset. It took sometime to get use to the fact that i had to press down the screen and "click" it. This was different that what i was use to with the iPhone and the Instinct.I got rid of the phone, it seem to always need something looked. I think it is like the first iPhone, and they have some kinks to work out.
I just purchased a BB Storm for $99 from Amazon.  Everything worked perfectly.  The device arrived in two days via Prime, my number ported from Sprint in 3 minutes, and Verizon was excellent in configuring my service plan.  All in all, I can rate the purchase experience very highly.
The best way to put it is...Love mine!, the point being that it takes a while to get used to it, but once you do, you get the unbeatable blackberry email and almost everything else you get in the iphone.The screen resolution and brightness is totally HD!I went for it over iphone as I needed the Blackberry email, calendar features etc. and now that I have it for a over a month or two, its hard to put it down. Am totally comfortable with typing as I don't need to email Grey's anatomy every day (it's a thick medical reference book:-)...you get the point.The way i look at it is that if your work environment is blackberry based, which i believe is true for most corporate environments, you'd certainly feel more comfortable with blackberry over iphone.For all rest, iphone may represent better value!Gave it four stars as RIM still has their work cut out on the software side, but don't be mislead by it, they seem to be on top of it and should have it sorted out soon.In the end, both devices represent great value, you need to work out what serves you better!
This phone is terrible. I have had every blackberry known to man since 2003. I love blackberry - and have loved all of them until now. It's slow, sluggish, and hangs up. If you are using blackberry for business applications like myself - skip it. Keep the curve or get the bold.
where to begin. It regularly freezes up and crashes, the touchscreen keyboard is slow to respond, but it does have a nice screen
As my title reads, once you update your 9530 to the latest Verizon Wireless operating system, your good to go.  The new OS fixes many many many bugs, and is basically a whole new phone.  I use my phone for business and personal, so I have email popping up on my phone and also use many different social network applications.  The App World was a great addition to the blackberry devices.  It takes maybe a week or so to get used to typing on the storm with its "clickable" screen.  Overall it's a great phone for business centric people,  it's not an iPhone, so get over yourselves people (you know who you are).I also have over 7GB of music loaded on my MicroSD card and I can honestly say that the media player on the Storm is pretty decent, I'd give it 8/10 points.  You can have album art and it's search features work very well.If your not going to use this phone for business related matters, then I would probably look at another "touch screen" phone, but if a large portion of your phone use is business, then i'd pick this bad boy up (update if thereafter) and get using that sexy touch click screen.
Get with AT&T; and buy an i-Phone, I have had the storm for about 6 months and it is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned. Tech support is non existant screen is slow and un-responsive and now it does not work. It is a royal pain in the butt!
I got this phone thinking it would be a lot better than it was. It is so annoyingly slow. It has lots of bugs and drives me crazy. Nearly every day I want to beat it with my hammer. I would rather have one of those old brick phones than this piece of junk. Don't waste your money!!!
If you love blackberry than you will love this phone. awesome screen and features like navigation which is an extra cost item along with visual voice mail. Great features just not includd in amazon unlimited cell monthly fee.
Blackberry/Verizon is doing a superb job of supporting me on this incredible phone. It can do incredible things - but there is a learning curve!
I've had this baby for 48 hrs and am lovin it!.I think many reviewers here are so blindsided by the iphone; that they are just too harsh with the storm.Phone-VW beats ATT hands down, thats the MAIN reason I did not choose the iphone.(If you have no connection, what good is a fancy App?)Core Blackberry functionality-unbeatable-Typing was NOT a big issue for me-I'm sure if you are a maniac on coffee,with a Type A personality to boot-you may have to slow down a little bit.Media( camera,Video cam, music etc) excellent .the big screen continues to blow me away.Its $99 at VZW. Get it now. worst case scenario-you'll return it for a restocking fee of $35.Here's a little update.Still love the phone. Although I believe you can be stuck with a lemon.The software is definitely buggy-but have had to hard reset only once.Browser crashed once-but the one time hard reset fixed it.Charge lasts about 36-48 hrs with regular phone use( not heavy use).VZ navigator is awesome.VZW's 3G network is just perfect for this device.VZW sent me a used model when I asked for one on one-so returned the other one( had multiple scratches! with dirt inside the screen!!)would still give 5 stars.3 month update.The phone has held its own till date.Total reboots needed ~2 in the last two months.Cons @3 months: minimally slow software, poor reception(?)and average sound quality, minor software glitches. camera better than most phones but poor for 3mp camera, charge last 18 hrs with average useagepros: VZ network, awesome internet browser, instant email, decent calender and reminder system, VZ navigator if needed.One year now and still love it as much as it was a day old. Excellent software updates and still performing strong. Love me Blackberry storm!i'd say 5 stars.
This got be the worse phone I've ever used.I've had the iPhone which I loved then had to switch to a blackberry for work so I jumped on idea of having a touchscreen blackberry. Bought it and after two weeks just hated it. The phone looks great, but the software is just terrible, slow, buggy. This is another of a series of crappy phone by Blackberry. Cherishing their monopoly on instant emails, the quality of their phones have drastically decreased and it is too bad. Hope the new curve will be better than the Blackberry Storm!
I generally only bother to write a review when I have strong positive or negative feelings about a product, and in this case, they are profoundly negative.  This is easily the worst-designed phone I have ever used, and a major disappointment coming from an outfit as generally reputable as BlackBerry.Some annoyances:Very slow to start up, and for that matter, to do anythingMicro USB port not compatible with any existing accessoriesSignificantly poor battery life in standbyGenerally less-than-intuitive interfacebut the real killer is:the touch screen is totally dysfunctional.  I really cannot believe that a major company would bring to market a product with such a clumsy touch screen as the primary input method.I have never before returned a phone, but this one is going back before the 30-day window is up.
If you are even remotely intelligent, do not buy this phone.  I'm an idiot and fell for the cool look, graphics, and apps and I have been kicking myself since.  THIS IS NO I-PHONE!!  I lose an average of 2 calls per day (do you hear me now, Verizon?  You suck!).  The phone freezes up about 3 times per day.  It takes 10 times longer to text or e-mail, etc.
I received by BB Storm with much anticipation the other week and it took me less than 2 hours to conclude that although well intentioned, the BlackBerry Storm fails to meet expectations. For those of you who are keen Amazon.com review watchers, let me brief and specific:1. Typing is impossible for anyone who wants to use the device like an older blackberry or smart phone. The typing program is probably meant for a younger generation of users that don't need to be bothered with proper punctuation and grammar.2. There is a problem with the software in that when one types at any decent to fast pace, you get occasional freezes and delays. Simply put, the device cannot keep up with quick typers.3. The phone quality (sound of a voice call) is good but because of the touch screen technology, when you are on the call, parts of your face can trigger actions on the device such as mute and conference call.4. When you hold the phone in landscape for a full QWERTY keyboard, you can only see 2-3 emails in a list at a time and there is not enough white space to scroll through it.5. There is a delay with the tilt screen no matter what program you're using which can be annoying when you're trying to fire out a quick email and you can't get the screen to "right" itself.6. Finally, instant messages don't appear in the mailbox with emails. I don't know if this is a settings issue (and I don't care to find out because I am returning the Storm this week) but if it can't be changed, I find this very inconvenient.
when i first saw the commercials, i first thought wow a touch screen phone like the iphone? but NOPE, this phone you have to click if you wanted to text or go to other programs. the advertisement deliberately tricked us into thinking that its a touch screen which it isnt. when i try to text faster the keyboard disappears on me and you cant try to text fast because you have to click one letter and a time and if you try to click more than one letter at a time it wont let you. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE ! ITS A PIECE OF CRAP !
Worst ever!!!!!! I stood in line until 10pm waiting to get this phone when it first came out. I've had it now for a couple months and it's frustrating I'm seriously considering leaving Verizon for putting out something this. Their commercials are totally deceiving. It freezez constantly,shuts itself off garbage please trust me on this do not waste your money.
The eagerly awaited BlackBerry Storm 9530 is a serious contendor in the cell phone marketplace. With so many new varities available (and the iPhone taking the lead) it manages to take the best from the iPhone while retaining the BlackBerry features most users prefer.It's strong suits are the clear, crisp display and the exceptional audio quality. Whether you are using it as a phone or a MP3 player, the Storm performs magnificently.  The camera is also quite good and even has some basic but very necessary (and appreciated) cropping features.The Storm, however, falls short in its sensitivity issues. Typing on the keyboard (especially in PORTRAIT view) is a nightmare as it is quite determined to enter the word it wants to, not the one the inputter has in mind. Also in need of improvement is the fact that it settles on a view mode (let's say LANDSCAPE) and it is quite a hassle to change it to PORTRAIT (or vice-versa). This manages to frustrate the user and wastes valuable time. Another negative flaw (and one that I am sure BlackBerry will correct), is the touch screen.  While a slight jar will move the screen view from Portrait to Landscape, it sometimes takes several attempts to get a response when you click on a SAVE or CANCEL button.  I'm afraid that all the jabbing (quite hard at times) will damage the screen. Also, there have been many times when I thought the unit had frozen. Nope. It just refused to accept the touch command.On the whole, it is a sturdy unit but it was unrolled too early to really be the kind of the hill.UPDATE:It won me over. It is still a bit "sluggish" at times but I find myself relying more and more upon the STORM.  The typing is still a bit tricky (try it in landscape mode - it's a bit easier) and there are times when the response between pushing the screen icon and the program coming to life make me think the unit is frozen (it's not, just slow) but it is a durable unit and you become quite addicted to after a period of adjustment.
If you read the "5 star" ratings you would think that this is the best phone ever made. Having owned this phone for 9 months I can tell you that:A: The rave ratings were, in my opinion, either written by RIM/BB employees (or other shills) or are very old reviews that were written when it was newly released and exciting - I myself might have written such a review when I received my first BB Storm (currently on my 3rd).B: If you are a business user and have this phone, I feel your pain.C: If you read this review along with the multitude of other negative reviews and STILL want a Storm...then let this serve as a proactive "I told you so".PS: I have nothing against other BB's...and I plan to replace this piece of %$#@ with another Blackberry model, because as a business user I can't effectively do my job without the BB email capability.Hope this review serves to prevent for others, the extremely unpleasant experiences I have had with this "Smart Phone". What were those experiences? Read the other "1 star" reviews...my thoughts exactly.
Great phone, though the software needs to be hashed out a bit more (which RIM is doing).
RIM's CEO has indicated to the WSJ that we need to learn to live with buggy OSes on our new devices.  No - no we don't.  The current official OS for the Storm makes the device slow.  Slow to launch applications, slow to transition, has poor memory management, and renders the camera/video camera essentially useless.  Thousands if not tens of thousands, have sought refuge in one or more of the many leaked OSes for the Storm.  While they have sped up the OS and many aspects of the device, they have broken a great deal of the functionality at the same time and all the leaked OSes have been subject to numerous random reboots, and freezes that require the user to pull out the battery to reset the device many times a day.As a long, long, long time BB user I was most disappointed in the keyboard.  It is slow at best, difficult and error prone at worst.  After 6 years with the same BB password and with only 1 or 2 rare occasions in the bitter cold when I made an error entering it; in the  2 months of use, it can still take me 5-6 times each time just to get my p/w right!!  Not to mention how error filled quick e-mail replies have become.  (Quick is btw a misnomer, by the time I fix all the errors, it generally takes me 3-4X as long to send a response.)The Storm is a great idea - poorly executed.  It was to be a marriage of business and consumer oriented desires.  But rather than working together, these 2 sides of the device feel to be in constant conflict.  Neither getting fully what they want and reluctantly make poor compromises.  You will feel like the ignored and torn child of this marriage.And I have not even started on the hardware.  Dust under the screen, screens that do not click consistently in all areas, dead spots on the screen, and some which lose all touch sensitivity.If you ignore me and get this device, you can return it or exchange it as many times as you like in the first 30 days.  Do not wait to do this.  Make sure you get a device that works.  Remember, it is better to come from a broken device than to live with one.
I have seen the Blackberry Storm in operation by employees at work who have it. It is better than the old chunky Blackberry, but the touch screen needs improvement in sensitivity. The BB Storm is still too thick and heavy. It is a also a shame that Blackberry finds it necessary to sign exclusive distribution agreements with only Verizon, whose service also sucks compared to AT&T; and Sprint. I give the Storm a one or two star rating. Perhaps it will be improved next year. I will wait till the touch screen has been improved or superseded with a better version and is available to AT&T; or Sprint. The iPhone is lighter, thinner and has a better tactile feel, but it locks up. Good reason to not spend money on either Blackberry Storm or iPhone until the bugs have been corrected.
I am so glad that I ignored negative feedbacks but went with my instinct. If you know how to use this device, you will Absolutly love it.
I'll give you three "P"s for that "O" I got to spend an hour in the Verizon store today waiting to return a headset that I was mistakenly told would work with my brand new Blackberry, that being the Curve and not the Storm, which it turns out is beyond the capabilities of a 43 year old, far-sighted woman, who did not graduate with honors from MIT.I should have known when I was talking to the probably 24 year old male customer service agent that "storm" and I were not going to go long term because when I asked why he thought it was a good idea to hook up with this particular blackberry, he told me it was because it was:Customer Service Rep: "Awesome" and "The Best one ever."Now, this is not to say that the "Storm" is not a wonderful device for some.  If you are one of those people who love spend your time doing things like pressing the letter P over and over and over again even though you really want the letter "O" or like to draft an email only to lose it because you tilted the f**er thing eeevvver soooo slightly to the left, well then don't walk, run, my friend as I know for sure at this moment that in L.A. proper there is at least one "storm" waiting around with your name on it, well IF your name has a lot of "P"'s in it that is.....
anyone who has effortlessly used a mousepad on a laptop or the iphone If you remember seeing the early iphone commercials and the effortless transitions, remember that is the iphone and don't assume the blackberry is quite so smooth. I have loved almost every new blackberry I have had, but this one was the bggest dissapointment of all.I will admit I didn't read the instructions to see if there was anyway to soften the deep click you must tap through to a selection like punching out the back of a sinus pill container.i tried it and for the first time, i met a blackberry i didn't like.
Don't buy this phone expecting it to funtion as a tethered device for your PC. I did, it doesn't work. I tried a ATT air card, it worked. I tried a Alltel air card. It worked. This doesn't. Verzion claims it is my problem. What a load of XXXX.  The feature they advertise are non functional, I even got a store employee to admit that. If you want a device like this keep in mind what it does well, Email, music etc. Verizon's support really sucks. I expected better, didn't get it.
I was one of those that tried to purchase on launch day, but had to order and received it bout 5 days later.  This is my first time owning a Blackberry and purchased it for $100, including rebates and plus I was an existing customer.  I was pretty disappointed with this phone, but ended keeping any ways.  I had a LG Voyager and loved it and waiting for the new one to come out and I will jump ship as soon as the new one comes out.  I updated the new software but still the same.  All I can Say is even though all the experts are saying the Iphone is better.  I will never ever buy anything from Apple, cause I just think their products are garbage.  I still can't believe the new 3G Iphone still does not support music streaming and the Itunes software is trash.  Well enough bout my babbling on the piece of crap Apple products. I just hope RIM fixes all the bugs or they'll lose many customers.
BlackBerry Storm 9530 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)Amig@ si realmente quiere un buen consejo NO COMPRE este celular. Sinceramente es muy bonito y a primera vista parece un tremendo celular... pero la verdad es otra1. NO TIENE WI-FI para mi eso ya es una desventaja enorme en comparación con otros modelos de BB. Lamentablemente yo me di cuenta de esto luego de haberlo comprado.2. Si usted es de las personas que escribe bastantes mensajes de texto... pues quedará muy decepcionado de lo molesto que es escribir con este telefono... es un telefono realmente torpe... muchas veces ocurre que si tiene tomado el telefono en forma vertical, la pantalla se queda como si lo tuviese tomado en forma horizontal o viceversa. Cuando esté mas apurado, créame!! su BB Storm hará lo posible por "NO" ayudarlo.3. Se reinicia sin motivo alguno... Similar a los pantallazos azules de windows.Ármese de paciencia.4. En ocasiones la cámara se activa y no permite volver al menu principal o a alguna de las otras funciones... hay que sacarle la pila al telefono, para poder tomar el control nuevamente.La verdad NO LE RECOMIENDO este teléfono. Busque otros modelos como el curve o el bold. Es la peor compra de teléfono que he realizado... me dejé engañar :(
avoid verizon - their service is poor.  This phone is ok but the company that stands behind the phone is very important too.
VERIZON IS A KEY CORPORATE SUPPORTER OF EXTREME RIGHT WING PAC 'FREEDOMWORKS,' BACKERS OF OF THE RADICAL RIGHT WING TEA PARTIES.  IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU ARE GIVING FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE ALLIES OF GLENN BECK, RUSH LIMBAUGH, AND SARAH PALIN.BOYCOTT VERIZON!
I won't begin to judge fellow reviewers and their knowledge of WinMo phones but will say that you simply cannot judge this or any current multi app piece of hardware by the same standards as other phones.Nor can this be judged on how it performs 'out of the box'. Like a laptop, you can only cast an opinion when you've uploaded your favorite software, got it to run your prefered media player and tweaked the OS to your own personal specs. Judging something this high tech as it is, is like admiring your new plasma TV but not adjusting the contrast or brightness or tuning in any new channels; or to test driving a car on half a tank of petrol and then focusing your complaints only on the fact that it ran out of fuel. You got to fill it up to go the distance!Out of the box, on UK Vodafone, this is as chunky a brick as ever was produced. The keyboard is gorgeous, a tactile joy and a beautiful piece of kit but the rest is slow and unresponsive. The Windows Mobile system (WM6) is cumbersome for a phone OS, the touchscreen is slow with a noticable delay between press and reaction. The panel system, although novel and full of possibilities has been woefully under supported by Sony Ericsson (The X1 is very obviously a test bed for future X-series handsets!)And this isn't my first touchscreen, HTC or Windows Mobile handset, so i'm not comng down hard on the Xperia through inexperience...However...I've had my X1 for a little over a month. The Vodafone ROM has gone. The OS is tweaked and touchscreen responsiveness is immaculate. Screen pop-ups, information messages, unwanted screen closings etc. are gone. IE has been swapped for Opera. WM6 has gone in favor of the touch friendly WM6.5. Youtube works, Synching doesn't need Outlook, video playback is faultless and (the high point for me) the infinitely adaptable customisation that Windows Mobile supports means the handset is tailored exactly how i want it.Yes, i had to do some research; downloading, resetting and repeating on occasion. With previous generation handsets that kind of effort for a mobile could simply have been dismissed as pimping my ride; chintz and bling, but for this kind of device it's more the equivalent of putting enough fuel in the tank and getting your driving position right.You HAVE to put the time in to get the most out of it.This is the best phone i've owned. It's not as innovative as the iPhone and it doesn't yet have the apps support, but Sony Ericsson have created, after a bit of personal tweaks, a wonderfully intuitive, highly adaptable, beautiful piece of kit. It works fine as a phone, an email client and media player tho it is lacking in games. The 3.2MP camera has a great flash and gives excellent results for a mobile camera. And for internet use the X1 is incomparable. Turn it to landscape and the touchscreen coupled with the motion sensitive touch pad make browsing a joy.True, the $600.00+ price tag is steep but you are paying as much for the potential of the hardware as you are for the hardwear itself. Just remember you have to use that potential or what's the point?!? I think it's a bargain and don't see myself changing handsets for at least a couple of years.
I bought the X1 after extensively using the iPhone (I still have), G1 and the touch pro (both returned)First to clarify, yes this phone would not have 3G data on T-mobile. You can still make calls and use EDGE but that defies the purpose and the price. For that matter G1 would not work with ATT 3G, this is true for most phones. And if you need to blame someone, its T-moble. They have weird freq for their 3G which nobody else use.Next, the Xi (the one sold here) has only 1900 freq but ATT uses both 850 and 1900 for voice so you should be good and most places have both the freq (I have never been to a place where my iPhone has better signal) but theoretically 850 is better.This was one point I was worried, but believe me I don't see a difference. I lived in Atlanta (where 3G is great) and in Denver (where 3G is sketchy at best) and I don't see a difference. In general I drop more calls with my iPhone and I get better signal in places where my wife's phone(which has both 1900/850) doesn't have any.So the choice is simple, if you live in US and don't mind the silver shell (I hate it) then go for X1a. If you even like the black a little better, get the x1i.Now comparing to other phone and OS. I'll get this out of the way. right now, the x1 is the best windows mobile out there. Only the Blackstone (HTC touch HD) is comparable but that has no 3G in US (ATT and T-Mobile). So that leaves the Touch pro and Diamond. Touch pro looks great but the body feels cheap and i felt the phone will be in two pieces by the end of the week. Diamond is good but no GSM carrier. And at full price (to use it with ATT) its not all that cheaper to X1.So I see the iPhone and G1 as its close competitors, G1 is great but the looks will def put people off and the OS feels like its still in beta. the iPhone is amazing (I use it in the weekends because I would want to find restaurants and movie theaters on the go and its so easy to use while driving) but you def don't get the unique feel, as 8 out of 10 people have it. So I take it that unique is what you are looking for if you are even considering buying this for double the price of a iPhone.Ok here are the plus and minus of this phoneGreat:-1. Crystal clear display (480 by 800). The best so far2. The finish (though some have complained about cracked body) is great in mine, I actually returned the first X1 (though it was the fault/inadequacy of the ATT support staff) but both x1 were great.3. Def has a 'exclusive' feel4. Great hardware, has everything in the market. Speed test shows the x1 for most part is faster than the Omnia (o, i hate that phone)Good:-1. I like the keyboard, though not as great as touch pro2. Loads of physical button, though some may find it cramped.3. Amazing forum, you can do virtually anything in the software side. They have already ported TF3D and other goodies from touch HD. But HTC (made and sold) devices like touch pro and HD have a bigger following.4. This is more like 3a. You will def have 6.5 and even 7 ported to this phone (Not officially though)5. Even though the OS is not touch optimized, it still feels like you can do anything with it. I love it (this is my 6th WinMo device)Bad:-1. No Captive touch screen, meaning you still need a stylus most of the time. But the TF3D and Panels make life a little better.2. OS is like a siss army knife, Most would be overwhelmed if this is their 1st smart phone3. Doesn't have accelerometer (the one which turns you screen landscape when you turn your mobile)4. Comparing it with touch pro, touch pro has impressive list of sensors. For example it know when the stylus is in or out. Big deal? yes. For example you can auto launch notepad when in call and you pull the stylus out. You can do million things with these sensors. I had the pro pick my call automatically as i pick the phone from my desk. The x1 has none of these sensors.Bottom line is if you are a vivid WinMo user and like spending hours setting up your phone and then flash it again and start all over. This one is for you.Others try the G1 or the iPhone or wait for WinMo 7PS:- If you do get this phone, the first thing you need to do is flash it with a custom ROM. Just google it
Had this thing for a few weeks now. First impressions weren't great but they've improved.The hardware is nearly beyond reproach. Slick piece of gear that feels of good quality. I might wish the screen were a bit larger, but the extra resolution is great. Sunlight readability is at least as good as the iPhone I have. After several weeks, it pains me to stare at the iPhone screen again, the resolution is too low.. The keyboard works fine for my fingers and I vastly prefer it to the iPhone virtual keyboard. No complaints about calls really. Touch screen is okay.GPS works and the geo-tagging of the camera is a nice touch (available on the latest ROM's soon or a separate software download already). The camera is nothing to write home about though, but decent enough.My first Windows Mobile device ever. And it's a piece of s**t compared to other cell phone OS. Sony Ericsson has (like other manufacturers) tried to hide it behind their own interface, and it works to some degree. So, to make this a loveable phone, here's my tips:- Use the Sony Xperia panels and CUSTOMIZE it! Put all your most use functions right on this screen. Users have complained about "lags" from touches, but I've found that's only when you switch Panels. If you just stick with the one panel, everything works fine. I used the iPhone layout as a guideline.- Download the latest patches, especially the geo-tagging for the camera and other fixes. With this, despite the resistive touch screen, browsing is almost as slick as the iPhone OS.- Download the YouTube panel- Download the Xperia Tweak software to get rid of some WinMo annoyances.It should work nice out of the box. Unfortunately it doesn't, and that's a shame because it's a nice piece of hardware, let down by the crappy OS. It is nice to see that SE is still supporting and upgrading firmware/features. With a bit of tweaking, the phone works just fine.Not sure if it is worth the full MSRP of $799, but if you can pick it up for $500-600, you might have a reasonable deal. This is a good alternative for those who NEED a real keyboard in their "smartphone".I didn't pick it up for the full price, and after a few weeks, I am happy enough with my purchase. I a preferring it over the iPhone and all signs point to new updates/fixes by SE to making it even better.
Definitely Sony Ericsson did it right.  The Xperia X1 is not only a very good mobile phone but also a great windows based portable device.  Maybe the only improvement I would request is it's battery performance specially if you are a Wi-Fi or internet applications fan. Yes the price is high but I still believe it worth it.  Also I would like to have more panels online to load and use them as user interfaces for frequent aplications but I think it's a matter of time.If you are a windows mobile adict and want to integrate it to your mobile phone The Xperia it's your choice.
Got this unit on time and found there was something wrong with the unit after open the box. The maunal was non English, and key board was even with funny keys and definitely not English key board at all. AC adapter was also not US type and no way to plug in outlet for sure. Return the units after few days due to not used to use non English Keyboard. Bottom line, X1 is a good PDA with perfect Specification except No Voice Dial basic Cell phone function. Amazon was provided perfect service on RMA and credit / refund process. Great service, I rateed 5 star for this particular service.Friend of mine order the same product from Amnzon and got an English version of Manual, Keyboard, and US type AC adapter, Friend encouraged me buy another one, may be Amazon currently carried units are from same batch as he bought and could be English version, Gave the try and cross the finger and hope the unit will be English version. The unit has scheduled deliver next Mnday.Looking forward to see the unit.Sugget Amazon should do the Quality Inspection after International Version Cell Phone received and before ship to US customers which could definitely save RMA process cost.
This is a beautiful phone, but it is very over priced. you can find phones with similar feature and far more durable for a cheaper price. some keys on my keyboard does not work no more. my old sony ericsson p1i is even easier to use and have features that you'll need daily than this xperia.Similar Products I Own:sony ericsson p1i
I bought this phone just as it came out at a sharp discount, by purchasing it from a UK cell phone dealer at a deeply discounted price (~$650) compared to the $700 to $900 most were paying. The downside was that I received a Euro charger, but I purchased a Blackberry one at Best Buy and it works fine.I'm a Sony fan and I've owned a number of Sony Ericssons in the past, most recently a k790 (which I accidentally bricked) and a C902. First of all in terms of build quality, this is the worst SE phone I've owned. Sony usually has the best craftmanship in the industry, but the X1 is an exception mosltly IMO because it is built by HTC (a Korean smartphone firm). Not to bash on the Koreans but their electronics and automobiles significantly lag behind the Japanese in terms of quality, with a few exceptions such as Samsung or LG. Anyway, my X1 looks like I've had it for 10 years rather than 6 months: the painted metal back is terribly scratched and has never fitted perfectly, the silver on the top right hand button underneath the screen has completel rubbed off, the paint on the speaker has partially chipped off, the "Xperia" marking on the back is almost completely gone, and the "Sony Ericsson" marking has started to disappear. I decided not to buy a case for the phone, since I never need one, and I really paid dearly. The keyboard itself has really held up fine, and the sliding mechanism still works well also.The phone itself is pretty good, but not stellar. The good thing about WM is that you have access to a lot of very useful apps. such as Adobe Reader, MS Office Suite, plus a whooole lot of free downloadable apps. Now, the bad thing is that it's Windows--it freezes often, and the interface is bad. Opera Mobile is the best app included with the phone, and Internet Explorer is probably the worst; they might as well have not even included IE. One thing that is a real plus is the use of "panels," which can be used to access programs or alternative interfaces, the latter of which makes the phone soooo much easier to use. My favorite is the spb Shell which looks much cleaner than the windows interface and is so much easier to use with your fingers. Apps such as the SE Media Player panel (much better than WMP) and Google Maps really make the phone much better.All in all it's a decent touch screen cell phone (much better than the iPhone), but I would only recommend it for $500 or less, not the regular $700 MSRP. The poor build quality and the Windows Mobile interface (which can't be fully escaped even with the Shell) don't justify a price over $500.
The phone is great, the only thing bad is windows mobile....Que paso con Symbian??????If you download the panel Spb from sony ericsson webpage, is much better..... With Spb Panel navigatgion experience is good.Fish panel is cute, but no sense for me.Resume: Its ok, if you can live with windows software.
I got this as a replacement to my ATT Tilt. I also have a Sony W880i which I really like. I picked this one up for slightly below $600. While the build quality on this phone is fantastic compared to the ATT Tilt, in all other respects it is almost identical to the Tilt, albeit with a much better screen.I also have an itouch, and I have to say the itouch multimedia capabilities really blows my Xperia out of the water! I am mentioning the itouch here since I guess that is what the iphone must be like as well.The problem here is the Windows mobile OS which has a terrible touch screen interface. Also, my phone requires rebooting on a daily basis especially if I browse the web.Overall there is nothing wrong with this phone. If you're looking for a great Windows Mobile phone this is probably the best. However, with other smart phone choices such as Blackberry, Nokia and iphone I am not sure the OS here holds up to the competition. This phone like my Tilt has great stats on paper, but the implementation is what really matters and that is where Microsoft has let the product down.Just to be clear, I am not a Sony or MSFT basher. I love most of my sony products - and I own a lot of them, but this isn't really worth it to me and I would not recommend this to anyone who is willing to look at a non MSFT Smartphone OS.
After hours of Internet research + calls to Sony-Ericsson support and T-Mobile support, I have to return it. T-Mobile said flatly that NO PHONE OTHER THAN THEIRS WOULD WORK ON THEIR 3G OUT OF THE BOX, due to the frequency 1700 that no other phone handles.The amazon.com website says UMTS 850, 1900, 2100, that should be OK to use with AT&T;, but the phone comes with UMTS EU1/US2/EU8, that is 900, 1900, 2100. There are only 2 US operators that could use GSM phones, and neither uses the UMTS frequencies this phone has:1. AT&T; 3G needs 850/1900 , so you need Xperia X1a, and not X1i that ships from amazon.com, and2. T-Mobile 3G needs 1700/2100 (both frequencies are needed, one is for upload, the other for download).So, if you plan on using 3G, you'll not be able to use this phone in the US. Sorry!
I was really looking forward to buying this phone but when I did I was horridly dissapointed. It may have a lot of nifty functions but it miserably fails with the basics that a phone should have.Here are 2 such examples:1) On your main panel bar on top you can either choose to show the time or the battery bar, but not both, why I don't know.2) The alarm only repeats itself three times so if you are a deep sleeper don't even bother to buy this phone.Customer support for this phone is also lacking so if you buy this phone you are pretty much on your ownupdate on this review:I have had this phone for a while now and everyday I regret ever buying it. It is not a reliable phone in any way and a complete waste of money. The battery dies at the most unexpected times, and you have to always hope and pray that it is charging. The text messaging keypad freezes at least once a week which can be bloody annoying when you are on the run. And sometimes the phone doesn't even alert you of calls. The number of times I have been accused by friends and family that I hung up the phone on them or didn't answer the phone when in fact I didn't receive a call or the stupid battery died, is just ridiculous. It also wastes battery at the stupidest things. I mean if the bloody battery is low why does it insist on vibrating when it switches on or off---it is just bad design.Also the calling interface is a joke, the screen always turns off automatically a few seconds into the phone call, making it a bloody nightmare when you have to press keys when you are on one of those automated call.I mean I can go on and on about what mess this phone is but I think you now get the picture.I leave you with one piece of advice that will save you money and sanity:DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!
I was very excited to get this phone when it first came but I have to say that it was all disappoints to follow.First flaw with the phone is that they chose Windows as their operating system.  The phone crashes a lot, you can't control the speaker levels (bass, treble, etc.) and the things take forever to load.  My husband uses the Iphone and it is SO much better.  I am sorry to say that for the price...this is NOT worth it.
great nokia phone. I travel frequently, and this GSM works in asia, europe perfectly. I don't need a PDA, just a small solid phone with a good battery life. This one fits the bill.
I threw my high tech touch screen against the wall - entirely to finicky and 'touchy'!THIS PHONE IS BASIC, RELIABLE, EASY TO USE!  Bogus graphics of a dog - but that is irrelevant when it comes to function and reliability.
Touch screen is not sensitive enough. GPS software (Smart Navigator software) that come with it is really bad. Smart Navigator has a very poor user interface compare to OCN8. I couldn't use any other GPS software (TOMTOM, Iguidance). You can install them, but they wouldn't start. Garmin XT (One of the worst GPS software) works and Finally made OCN8 working by doing some editing.  Build quality is very poor. Feels plasticky. Very low call volume. If you are in the city you cannot hear anything. Poor battery life. Compare to HP iPAQ 910 Business Messenger it is very slow. In my opinion if you want a QWERTY keyboard enabled Windows Mobile device buy HP iPAQ 910 Business Messenger (it also has poor battery life).
From the specs, a wonderful smartphone. Except that voice dailing is unsupported. And that it apparently doesn't work with bluetooth certified devices. And let's not forget the GPS that can't find a satelite at night. Or the company's refusal to provide warranty support if you received one as a gift and therefore don't have a receipt.Let's also not forget the poor battery life and the microSD slot only accessable with the battery cover removed. My advice: buy anything else.
Got the Nokia N85 sight unseen from amazon as an X-Mas present to myself. I have had it for 2 weeks and the battery life is great. Reception and call quality are excellent. AM-OLED screen is terrific. The phone came with 8gb microSDHC pre-installed which was a nice surprise because this was not apparent from the Amazon descriptions. Pictures are good for a cell phone digicam. I used the GPS once and it locked down the Sats plenty fast from a cold start but I haven't tried turn by turn directions yet. MP3 player outputs nice and loud by selecting headsets option when plugging in my AUX jack for my car stereo.So far am very happy with the phones swiss army knife options lists and performance except that (and I am not sure how the other amazon reviewers missed this)the N85's plastic housing is very cheap and flimsy. The battery compartment lid is loose and rattles like a cheap dollar store toy made in dime store factory. The plastic finish also scratches very easily. I am very afraid of dropping this phone and so immediately ran out to get a good snug case and belt clip for it. My last phone was an all metal Motorola SLVR L7 which was built like a Sherman Tank though options wise and call quality cannot compare to the N85 but in contrast the N85 falls way short of the outstanding build, materials and finish of my old SLVR L7.Lessons learned is that this is the last time I will buy an expensive unsubsidized phone without seeing it in real life first. Had I done that I would of passed on the N85. My advise to Nokia is to go back to tight fitting aluminum or any other high quality metal casing builds and keep plastics for the $200 and under phone lines or I will not be a repeat customer for their $400 and over smart phones ever again.Btw, Amazon was great with their overnight shipping and I had the N85 in my hands the day I had to fly out of country just before the holidays. Amazon did not dissappoint me but Nokia kinda did.
I've owned several Nokia phones over the years: 2190, 6190, 8890, 6310i, 6230, 6133.  These were all "dumb" phones, although I think they were all quite capable for their times, especially the last one.  This time around, I decided to go with a Nokia smartphone and picked the N85 because of its amazing array of features, compact dimensions, and a very reasonable price after rebate.Being a novice S60 user, I won't write a lot about it.  It is obviously a very mature and powerful software platform that's also easy to use.  Sure, there are a few quirks, and a couple of things seem like they are done a little better in Series 40, but, generally, this thing is a joy to use from the software perspective.  Like the other current Nseries devices, this one is a true multimedia powerhouse.  Unfortunately, I am disappointed in the hardware.The biggest disappointment is the OLED display.  I don't understand why everyone raves about it.  The problem is that it is incapable of producing any shade of grey, which is immediately obvious when the default Nseries theme with abstract grey figures in the background is selected.  The grays look brown.  Even with the brightness set to the maximum level, the grays still have a hint of brown in them, and with the brightness control set in the middle, everything has a brownish tint.  I also don't really like the material that the phone is made of.  It looks better on pictures than in your hand.  I prefer matte plastics that don't show dirt and fingerprints so much.The next problem is the center button and the Navi wheel.  They are loose and imprecise.  The center button makes a rather loud clicking sound.  The Navi wheel is too narrow, and the center button is too close to it, so I constantly hit the down scroll button and the center button simultaneously, which produces an even louder clicking sound.  Luckily, hitting both the buttons still yields the desired result, but these controls can prove tricky even for small fingers.  The touch-sensitive Navi wheel is a gimmick that works sometimes; it's easier to just use the scroll buttons.  The other buttons on the front of the phone are a little harder to press than I would like and also make loud clicks.  I see that Nokia may have addressed this issue in the N86, which appears to have separate buttons, whereas the soft left menu, soft right menu, main menu, and clear buttons on the N85 are all a single piece of plastic.  The dial pad is good though.The camera in this phone also fails to impress me.  Don't expect it to replace your regular point-and-shooter.  It is nice to have a 5-megapixel camera on you all the time, just in case, but you'll still want to bring your main camera on trips and to events.  Same issue with the built-in stereo speakers: I've never seen or heard a Nokia with decent speakers.  Sony Ericsson phones sound a lot better.The phone is a little heavy and nearly impossible to use with the slide closed, because the buttons are so close to the bottom edge, but it is alright with the slide open.  The spring-loaded slide mechanism works quite well, but opening the multimedia side is not as easy as opening the dial pad side; I feel like I'm going to drop the phone whenever I try to get to the multimedia keys.  The battery cover is a little loose, but it's not really a problem.  The good news is that it's easy to remove and put back, if you have to replace batteries and/or SIM cards often.So, what can I say in conclusion?  In my mind, the versatility of the S60 3rd Edition FP2 and the vast world of available applications definitely make up for the problems with the N85's hardware.  I'm sure I'll get used to it.  Had it been more expensive, I would've seriously considered returning it and looking at other options, but I think it's worth the $300 that I paid for it (after rebate), and I'm happy with it in the end.UPDATE AFTER HAVING HAD THE PHONE FOR 2 MONTHS:I'd like to add that my opinion has not changed after I've had the phone for 2 months.  As I expected, I got used to the phone and its shortcomings, which are easy to overlook.  I was a bit skeptical when I first heard Nokia label their Nseries devices "multimedia computers", but I have to say they were right to do so: this phone really deserves the title.  The software is just a little buggy, but Nokia has already released a major firmware update for the European N85 variant, so they will provide one for the North American model very soon.  If you're still undecided, I highly recommend this phone.  It's the best value right now.
So I currently have an N75. I had a 6230 before that. I went from a candybar 6230 to a flip N75 and then to this slider N85.I did a TON of research on which phone to get. I've read practically every N85 review available thru google and then some. 3G was a must along with a good camera.I looked at the N79, N78, N82, N95 and the N95 8GB.I ruled out the N79 and N82 because they didn't have 3G (I have at&t;).The N78 was good because it brings me back to the candybar style (I'm not sure about the durability of sliders) but the camera didn't have a cover and it was only 3.2MP. Plus, most reviews said the software was buggy and for practically the same price you can get this N85 and get more features. The clear button being on the bottom was a deal breaker, also.So I went to a Nokia store and was stunned by the N95 8GB screen. The thing just looked massive. I considered a regular black or red N95 but its screen was recessed and I didn't like that (hard to keep clean). And the thing just looked THICK. Plus, it didn't have a dual LED flash and no lens cover or FM transmitter.I narrowed it down to either the N95 8GB or this phone.I finally decided the OLED was better than LCD (for battery life and viewability). And the navigation key was larger and has the added bonus of having a navi wheel. The n85 also had a lens cover and dual LED. Plus Euro 3G compatibility on top of the US3G. Plus Symbian OS 3rd w/ feature pack 2.So I was sold and I've been trying to play with the phone the past week...Build Quality..Somebody said it was made in China so it must suck. Well, my N75 was made in Finland and that thing was horrible. It fell apart after a few months (hinge problem). So for this phone I read both ways.. some said it was solid, some said it was flimsy. I've held all phones in my hand and this one feels pretty solid. The slide doesn't wobble when opened or closed. The plastic does not feel cheap at all. It doesn't attract thumb prints or grease like the N75 did. Or maybe you can't see it as much since it's all black.MP3 player..It came per loaded with an 8GB card with some music and accompanying album art:Blind Sorrow - Pritchard, Banks, Coons, DilkBring the House Down - Ben WheelerHot Nights - Ian Clarke, Simon PainterLove Forever - Vanessa CondevSee Me Alive - The WinylsWaste - Robert J. Walsh, Rober GradWhenever You Say Love Me - Day ElevenWon't Let Go - NegativeYou Got the Message - Leigh GracieNavi wheel works great while browsing your songs (feels just like an ipod scroll:)Software..Everytime you get on a menu and you stop for a second.. you would have to tap the buttons twice. Once to wake it up then another to actually select it. Kinda annoying but I got used to it.Games Included w/ Free trial:Block Breaker - I've played it before and didn't like it. Deleted.Space Impact Kappa Base- kinda like Galaga shooter w/ excellent graphicsTetris - no change from a typical tetris gameSnakes Subsonic - horrible. Confusing and graphics suck.Asphalt 3 Street Rules - nice graphics but short run for trialFifa08 - once you picked a view (landscape or portrait) you can't change it. I picked landscape thinking it was the sideways option but it ended up being a portrait.. so i can't use the side buttons.World series of Poker - nice gameBrain Challenge - pick the answer by moving the selector up,dwn,lft, rightBounce - long install (5+mins) and long load times fire it up.Sims2 Pets -Creatures of the Deep -Midnight Pool -Reset GenerationI haven't played the last four games so I have no comment on those. The Ngage app is pretty useful for a few minutes or so to waste time but certainly not a psp or ds replacement. The side buttons are just too small. It will make your hand cramp.Now here's why i love this phone:Joikuspot Light -This app turns your 3G phone connection into a wifi hotspot. I use an ipod touch w/ version 2 software to connect to the internet. If I use the open option it keeps dropping the connection while you're on idle. The  WEP Shared did the same thing as well. The WEP Open works great and keeps the connection until you disconnect. The only limitation I found was that it didn't connect to any secured sites. IE the bank of america app on the ipod touch wouldn't connect. 3-4 hours of use with a fully charged battery.Internet radio -Inculdes FM radio broadcasts from your area. Some AM radio, too. Not as good as pandora (no album art or music background literature) but good enough. Plenty of ad free music and it can be broadcast thru your car radio with the FM transmitter! Full charge battery lasted about 3 hours with just using this app non-stop.Google Maps -I read somewhere that 3rd party apps couldn't access the GPS but that's not true. Google maps acquired your position within SECONDS. Or sometime a couple of minutes. It does drain the battery, though.Nokia Maps -Turn-by-turn voice navigation is free for three months. I tried it out and works fine. Had to restart that phone because it couldn't get a GPS signal for 30mins. There's no tone to let you know when to actually turn it just comes on and says.. 'NOW TURN RIGHT 200 YDS THEN LEFT IN 2.1 MILES' I think it's a great backup GPS but not a replacement. I say that because I can't keep it on the dash and I don't have car charger. It drained from a full charge to halfway within 45mins.Download!An app/link that shows you all the available software that can be downloaded over the phone. Most are free trials and most are useful. I have the Accuweather Bug (Forecaweather is nice but you have to pay for it!). Fring is an all in one IM (yahoo, gtalk, aim, etc) and it's free. It also lets you make VOIP calls thru wifi but I haven't tried it.Overall, the feature pack 2 is definitely an improvement over the N75. It's hard to explain but some little things that irked me about the N75 have been substantially fixed or changed this time around.The front panel green button (call) and red button (disconnect) are actually separate buttons which is good. I couldn't see that from the pictures.FM transmitter -I thought I could broadcast my phone call through the radio but that doesn't work. What works is having the Internet Radio/ Podcast/ MP3 player on + the AGPS voice guided Nokia maps. You have commercial free radio/Music that fades out when the voice nav comes on, and fades back in when it's done giving directions. Awesome.Battery Life -2.5hrs with Internet radio3.5hrs with just Joikuspot LightInternet on/off, light texting, a few calls - 6-8hrsOLED -Reminds of that time I took the cover off the 6230 and saw the LCD screen 'naked' and thought 'Wow, this is really clear.' Direct sunlight does make the screen unviewable. But indoors/ inside a car, it's an excellent screen.Keypad -Obviously smaller than the N75 but practically the same size as the 6230 so I have no complaints. It does get some getting used to txting/typing on a flat keypad but I got used to it after a couple of days.What I didn't like about the phone:-USB charging port ONLY. Although it did come w/ a USB wall charger, there will no more going to a friend's house and borrowing their Nokia charger.-Front keys are little hard to press. Compared to the N82 navigation button it's definitely more difficult to press. The N82 felt like butter this one not so much.-The naviwheel is not perfect. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.-FM transmitter was a little weak. Anything farther than an arms length and it fazed out.-Music store is not avail yet for the US.
This phone has a mighty length of features.  Simple stated, it has all the features that you will ever need and more.  The OLED screen will blow you away. But the build quality is unacceptable.  The actual numeric keypad is nice and usable but the D-Pad and the keys around it are horrible.  They are hard to press.  The plastic is cheap.  It creaks and looks like put together with some cheap glue... really bad quality.  I tried my best to hang on to it but at the end returned the product for this reason.
Nokia N85 Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Copper)As a former Nokia employee I am both a Nokia fan and slightly more informed critic.  I have a Nokia N95 & E66.  I was hoping to find a replacement that would marry the software improvements of the E66 with some of the functionality of the N95, particularly the camera.The N85 software is stunning.  The best Nokia has done by far.  This now also supports over the air firmware updates so hopefully Nokia will try to deploy minor improvements more frequently than in the past.The camera is awesome.  It supports geotagging.  So, you can take a pic (or movie) and upload it to a photo service like Google's Picasa and the location will show up on an accompanying map. Totally, totally, awesome stuff.  The media library viewer is awesome.  It incorporates the functionality of the formerly separate Nokia LifeBlog.Like I said the software is awesome.  It pains me to return the phone.However, I live in San Francisco, CA, a city with marginal coverage which is worsened by dead spots created by hills everywhere.  Despite this environment my E66 and N95 can hold a connection from the bottom of Twin Peaks all the way to the top without dropping a call (the E66 most dependably).  Unfortunately, the N85 doesn't just drop calls it looses signal for much of the journey.Also, the Bluetooth interface performs poorly.  Firstly, it is very difficult to get it to pair automatically with devices that pair with no problem to both my E66 and N95, for example Sony Ericcson HBH-IS800 headphones or my Apple laptop.  Secondly, when it does connect to the headphones its looses signal often.  I can't put my phone in my pocket or audio will cut in and out.  I have to hold it in my hand or place it somewhere with a clear line of site within 3 feet or so to prevent audio cutting in and out.  Both my N95 and E66 connect easily and rarely cut out.I think these wireless link quality issues will be difficult to remedy with firmware updates.  They are dependent on the types of RF and analog/digital processing components built-into the device as well as the antenna placement within the device.  Also, I have a feeling that the N85 is a lower price to either the E66 or N95 because it has fewer processing cores.  I'm guessing that on the E66 and N95 the bluetooth processing gets offloaded to a dedicated processor whereas on the N85 it is done by the main processing core in parallel with multiple other functions.In any case, the software improvement on this phone is without question.  The form factor is simple and elegant.  It feels great in the hand.  It is so much closer to the smart phone I had always hoped to have.  BUT, the lack of wireless dependability makes an otherwise great phone, with all its great software improvements, meaningless.  So, I am returning this phone.
I have really enjoyed this phone and am quite pleased that I purchased it. I read a lot of reviews on this model and many other similar Nokia models and also other brands but have always had excellent luck with Nokia. The one thing that I really notice about this phone is the reception....I live in very rural WY and, while the towns have pretty good cell reception, away from town doesn't always.  I use this phone for both business and personal and have had NO problem sending or receiving calls or text messages.  The features are very functional, the display is bright and easily readable, the camera takes phenominal pictures and it has been very sturdy.  I am still playing with and learning about all its features and how to use them.  Overall, I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.
I have been using the phone for 2 weeks now. I can say for the price on Amazon dont hesitate on this phone.I read many reviews before deciding to give it a try. The phone is well put together despite being made out of plastic and made in China, but not as good as my various SE phones, HTC phones and not as good as nokia e models (well, look and compare prices). I understand now why people called it cheaply made because when I press its buttons it makes little creaky sound, and that's exactly the result of the design ( 2 flat piece of plastic cover most the buttons and the keyboard), I dont mind this, the phone is stunning looking both on and off.The symbian s60 on this n85 is a really good. It will take some learning for all the short cuts but very nice compared to window mobile 6.1 on my htc wing phone. (the os did freeze one time in 2 weeks use and required battery removal)I'm from Orange county Calif, and the phone pick up satelite signal very very quickly, it feels just as fast as my garmin 680. Google map around here is better than Nokia map. But I dont use any GPS that much (returned the Garmin)Music player works just fine, FM transmitter work nicely, internet radio sound good. (have not try OTA radio)Camera is one of the things  I get this phone for and I'm happy with the result (Camera performance is not as snappy as SE). Video recording feature works beautifully, no freezing or zittering.Web capability is quite good, s60 browser is fast, even though I wish it has optical d pad as in say samsung innov8. Wifi is strong, no problem bluetooth connection with my motorola headset.Cell signal is strong and voice quality is typical good nokia phone.I recommend this phone. (Dont buy houses, cars...such an exciting time  to buy so called "cell phone")
PROS----* It has all the features that you would ever need in a cellphone.* Excellent screen.* Superb cell phone reception and voice quality.* 5 MP camera very impressive for a cell phone.* FM transmitter works well - this is very convenient in old cars that don't have an aux audio input. Just make sure you choose the right frequency to transmit your music.* GPS works very well, but the Nokia navigation service is too expensive. Get a Garmin Mobile XT or some other navigation software. It will be much cheaper than paying a monthly subscription fee to Nokia for navigation.CONS----* Build quality is not good, battery cover rattles, plastic feels cheap.* SIM card slot is poorly designed - it is very hard to take the SIM card out.* Alarm function is needlessly complicated and not user friendly - if you hit snooze, you will have to re-enter the original time for the next day!* Beware that Nokia may not honor the 3 month trial for the voice guided navigation, even though it is listed on the front of the box! I called Nokia three times to resolve this issue but got fed up of the customer service. I hope I don't have to make a warranty claim in the future because Nokia's customer service in the US sucks.* You can use the USB cord to charge the phone from your computer, but it won't work if you try to use a car charger with a USB adapter. The hardware fits just fine, but the N85 tries to connect to a computer even when there is no computer at the other end of the USB cable. This is not a big deal, you can just pick up a car charger for about ten bucks.Overall this is an excellent phone for the price. It is not a perfect device and there are many areas for improvement, but the pros easily outweigh the cons. I was actually considering buying a netbook for travel (Asus EEE or some other 9" netbook), but the Nokia N85 is far more portable and does almost everything a netbook can do, and has a GPS, camera and FM transmitter in addition!If you are going to use it a lot from home, you can make very cheap calls by connecting to skype through your home wi-fi (you will have to use an application called Nimbuzz). Combine it with a t-mobile pre-paid plan and you get a very affordable cell phone service.
Model = N85-3 (whatever that means)NOTE: Amazon had super speedy delivery on this; I think I ordered on a Saturday and received it on Monday, via regular free shipping!Pros:1. GSM World roaming --> 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz.2. Highspeed Cellular Internet --> HSDPA.3. Wi-Fi that supports WPA passwords.4. Bluetooth that supports data transmissions (MP3, pictures, files, etc.) to/from PC.5. Decent still Camera that also works half-decent at night when taking pictures of people (i.e. not far distant objects).6. Video Camcorder that also takes decent video, but not stellar.7. FM Transmitter to an FM radio so that you never need another cable or CD again to listen to "your" music in the car, woohoo!8. Charges phone over USB while connected to PC, very helpful and useful since all you need is one thin cable in your notebook backpack. (I've read elsewhere that this did not charge the phone, but mine does charge via a USB to USB connection on a PC.)9. Installable applications onto the OS for "missing" functions such as Skype, Googlemaps, Google translater, Joiku (turns phone into Wi-Fi access point for a PC), etc.10. Nokia maps are decent and useful; download them on your PC and then upload to phone since they are quite large, i.e. 85MB for a US State11. Can play converted movie videos12. Loud volume for those of us that don't like to strain to hear13. The box includes all necessary cables to perform all functions of the phone, (USB to USB, USB to AC Charger, Earphones, Volume control cord, hands-free, etc.)14. NGage installable games are plentiful and fun, but see comments in "Neutral" section below...also Java games can be added too...15. Sharp, clear, crisp and bright screen that is easy on the eyes and very readable.16. It is unlocked and thus I just popped my GSM card in and it works!17. Can display Acrobat files and such....18. Lithium battery came pre-charged for use right out of the box ;)19. Comes with 8GB card already installed and formatted.20. Has nice camera lens cover slider that changes the phone to camera mode automatically when the lens cover is opened.  Very convenient for taking quick pictures.  But see "Cons" number 8. below about the video mode.Cons:1. GPS is waaayyyy tooooo slow and finicky to be useful...it can take 3-4 minutes to get a lock on 4 satellites (the minimum required).  Moving around near buildings makes it drop the sat connections.  Obviously does NOT work AT ALL indoors...!2. GPS is not usable inside a CAR!?!?  Yes, it's true; you must hold the phone out under the windshield to get the necessary 4-sat signal going.  Pulling the phone back in front of you (i.e. under the car roof where you are normally sitting) will cause the sat connections to drop.3. After 1 week of continued use, the plastic button covers are starting to squeek and creek, looking like they are going to crack or just plain fall off.4. Symbian OS is way too slow and convoluted to be useful.  I've never used it before and I must say it is like learning MS Windoze all over again...yyyuuuucckkk!  Menus on any hand-held device should never be more than 2-layers deep and always be intuitive by title.  This uses 4-5 layer deep menus and is NOT intuitive by title, which makes it extremely difficult to impossible to find stuff without the manual.  COME ON people?!?!  This is the 21st century for crying out loud, you can do better than this!!!5. Voice quality on earpiece and speakerphone is mediocre. (garbled). I expect much better than this on technology that is over 25 years old!!! How hard can it be to make an earpiece and loudspeaker?  My 5-year-old Sony Ericsson phone sounds way better than this all the way around, and I don't even like SE phones.6. The whole "bar" and "slider" concept for a phone in general.  I can't imagine that A LOT of this style of phone doesn't get cracked screens more frequently than clam-shell type phones...  Do people really like these bar/slider phones with exposed screens?7. Sometimes the OS appears to "lock-up", but if you wait, like, 5 minutes it eventually frees itself up.8. Recording video is jerky and not smooth, freezing every 3-4 seconds and then continuing on, then freezing, so on and so forth...Neutral:1. Music on stereo speakers is mediocre2. Mechanical slider rattles a bit, but not excessively; it shouldn't rattle at all really...4. Too many modes to set when connecting to a PC (1. Nokia PC Suite, 2. simple data storage drive, 3. multimedia mode - pictures & videos, 4. copy-protected files mode).  Should only be one mode that detects what you are doing in software and switches transparent to the user (with manual override if necessary).  Obviously, the engineering didn't have time to sort this out before production began so they went with the "4-mode" quick-fix.5. NGage Games don't play as smooth as Nintendo DS or PSP.  My understanding is that the N85 is missing a 3D graphics card that was present in other Nokia phones, and this is apparent in the game graphics quality.6. Web surfing is ok, but difficult to really navigate that much on the web.  It does allow you to reduce the size of the displayed page to 75% and 50% size, but at this rate you will need a magnifying glass to read some of the web content, even though the screen is very sharp and crisp)7. Battery life seems ok, but not great and not bad either.  Lasts 2-3 days on a charge using all of the functions listed above (i.e. GSM calls, FM tranmitter, GPS, movie player, still pictures, camcorder, games, surfing web, etc.).Conclusion:I really, really wanted to like this phone and keep it, but I just can't justify the well over three hundred price tag for a flawed product.  My second choice is a Sony Ericsson G705 (but I'm hesitant about SE), but it lacks some major functions the N85 has, such as FM Transmitter, user installable Apps like Joiku, Google maps and Skype, and a gaming platform like NGage.  Nokia tried hard but just couldn't pull off the merger between Cellular, GPS, High-Speed Wireless Internet, Wi-Fi, MP4, Camera, Camcorder, FM transmitter, document viewer and Gaming since the merging of all of these together just isn't there yet...!  Bummer!I really, very much hope that Nokia addresses these problems in the near future.  If so, I would without question definitely buy two phones and recommend the N85 to everybody I know.  But as it stands now though, I'm not going to keep even one... :(
Frankly, this phone has lot of positives but unfortunately they got one of the most basic feature all messed up. To me, that happened to be very very important and hence my low rating. [...].First some good things:1. Very very cute little phone.2. I love the styling and build quality (assuring those who are on sidelines about all the build quality complaints this phone is getting). No slider rattling.3. Keys have a good feel to it and you know you pressed it.4. OLED screen makes this phone shine!5. Great camera for a smartphone.Now, the bad things (I think common to all new N series phone).1. When you add a contact you have his/her Home, Office, and Mobile numbers. Each number have labels to say that along with small Home, Cell, and office icons. Well this phone has same icon for Office and Home number. So, what is the problem? Read on..2. Call logs on this phone are utter useless. If you dial to a HOME or OFFICE number of your friend it appears with Mobile icon in the logs. So, if you go back to logs to dial back you will have no idea which is home or office or mobile number. Also, in logs there is no 'Open' option for the contact to get more details of contact like all other phones have so you can dial to his other numbers. Because of this messed up logs you always have to open contacts, search for the friend and dial. THIS IS A PAIN and drove me nuts while driving as I almost always make most of my calls from Call logs.More details of this known issue which I found after owning the phone:[...]3. Nokia Ovi contacts sync is a big joke. It is supposed to be a online backup for all your contacts on phone. But when  you sync it only syncs one number, one e-mail, and one address per contact. If you contact has 3 phone numbers, 2 e-mails and home, and office addresses, it will one backup one from each category.4. For lot of online applications it keeps prompting do you want to connect online with AT&T; Internet, AT&T; WAP MediaNet, or WiFI every single time. It gets worse for application like Google maps with latitude as they are continuously trying to connect to internet. I checked all options to connect without prompting and it doesn't have that option.So, anyone looking to own a Nokia phone for the first time consider the logs problem before you buy the phone. If you don't use call logs often, then this phone is a lovely one.
The N85 takes the best pictures I have ever seen on a phone, as well as the best video. The sound quality on a good pair of headphones is top-notch as well. The call quality is pretty good, and reception is better than average. The FM transmitter works well only if the channel you're using has no signals near it in frequency, but when in my car i use the auxiliary input instead. Another welcome surprise was the internet radio quality, which lets me stream music mostly uninterrupted. INternet is speedy on 3G, but flies on a wi-fi network. Tethering is also possible with the right circumstances.With any new phone, there are bound to be bugs, but this phone has been out for over 6 months, and still has buggy software. The phone sometimes freezes during music playback, and unfreezes only when slid open or closed. The audio switches from headphone to speakerphone when you get a message, which can be quite annoying. The video recording sometimes freezes, a problem caused apparently by fragmentation on the microSD card. If you can put up with those issues, then this phone will work well for you.Some other notes. The slider has some give, and makes the phone feel a bit flimsy, but I have dropped it once with no repercussions. Purchase a good pair of headphones, and IMMEDIATELY apply an invisishield cover to protect from scratches, to which the N85 is quite prone.Also, do NOT install the Nokia software suite unless you have to, as it will run a process on your pc which will slow your pc way down. Simply hooking the N85 to a pc running Vista or XP lets you do most of the things you need to flawlessly, including syncing with windows media player, and uploading pictures and video.
I bought this phone a few days ago and love it.  Reception is great and it hasn't locked up on me yet. Phone has a very solid feel to it when it is in your hands and the build quality is excellent. I carry my phone in my pants pocket and it is like it isn't even there.  Loads of features  and easy to use.  I put my AT+T sim card in powered up the phone and it automatically setup the internet settings for me.  It knows based on the sim card that I have AT+T and configured eveything I needed to access the internet.  Also has a program to help you setup your gmail, hotmail, yahoo or whatever PoP3 or imap account you have.  The 5mp camera is very good for a camera phone and has a flash.  To many feature to go into here.  Great phone, the only negative I would give it is the soft keys tend to be a bit stiff, but nothing that is a deal breaker.
I have mixed feeling while writing this review for Nokia N85. This phone is good but as most of have said despite being equipped with 5 MP Carl Zeiss optics camera it can't replace stand alone camera such as Canon powershot series ones.The call quality is overall good. Never had any listening problem like I had with my iPhone. Screen is sufficient in size, overall good for even casual browsing experience. Phone gets slow when many applications are opened, this shows either the downside of multi-tasking or inability of Symbian OS, 8 GB memory could have been used as partial memory for swapping stuff but I guess it is not (not sure though).There wasn't any native support for Avi Video files for which I installed Divx mobile codecs but I can certainly see video is not rendered properly and hangs after some time. Point I want to make is despite Symbian allows developers to make applications, they are not tested properly enough on all handsets.Built quality is ok, I think the body is unstretchable under normal use, better to use some shield on screen to prevent scratches. Sometimes I can feel slider being pushed backwards heavily and not in a balanced manner.GPS I tried using but failed to use since it doesn't go beyond initial earth rotating screen so can't write about it now.[Update-: It works for me now with Att Media Net plan]Music player is fine and good enough for casual listening.[update] it has FM radio, Internet radio[very good], FM transmitter which can play music through your car stereo using FM frequency[/update]Now coming to software portion, I like updating my every gadget to latest firmware number but I am not able to do so in this case, because Nokia Software Update fail to launch under Windows Vista environment and it doesn't support Mac env..[Update-: It automatically updates from the phone, no need to connect to PC, didn't knew before]Gaming is horrible since I have iphone background, partially the reason is most Nokia N series/ Ngage handsets don't have dedicated GPU chip( exception is N95) so Nokia decided to make non GPU dependent games. iPhone has PowerVR gpu.[Update]Email both POP and Imap can easily be configured, internet can be accessed on Laptop using 3rd Party software called Jaikuspot which makes it WLAN hotspot, so surf whereever you like bus, train, airport, restaurants where 3G is available. Fring is another free cool app which has all IMs and social networking tools such as Facebook, twitter. 3rd party GPS app can be installed such as Garmin XT mobile which works awesome.[/update]I would have given it a 3 star but considering limitation of today's cellphone capabilities I am giving it 4 stars, also due to the fact there are so many 3rd party applications available for free, it is worth neglecting some shortcoming from this phone.[Update-: Should have given 5 stars but 4 stars are ok]
phone of the dream! great camera for a phone. no problem so far! definitely worth buying
I ordered this made in China Nokia N85 cellphone, with all those wonderful bells and whistles, on 16 Feb 2009 and received it the next day.  On 4 Sept 2009, the handset stopped working in mid-conversation.  The person I was talking to heard me, but I couldn't hear anything. I can still use it with the loudspeaker (not very private in a crowd) or headset (not very convenient). Today, I sent the phone back for repair (still under warranty).  Luckily, I still have my ancient made in Korea Nokia 1320 that never had a single problem.  There is absolutely no reason why a barely 6 month old cell phone should not work perfectly well, other than shoddy workmanship.  I am so sad that Nokia doesn't seem to produce the high quality products that I have always had with all my previous Nokia cell phones.  Even though Nokia is going to repair the phone (and may use refurbished parts according to the information provided by them) I shudder to think what the future may hold for me...what else will go wrong with this very expensive phone...and whether or not (probably not) it will still be under warranty when the next problem occurs.BUYER BEWARE!Follow-up:  After repairing the audio problem in Sept and returning it to me, the same audio problem happened again in Nov 2009.  I could only use the phone with a headset, not as a handset.  Nokia refused to replace it and instead repaired it for the second time.  I got it back and the phone worked OK until April 6 2010 and it stopped working again.  Now Nokia says that it is out of warranty and will  neither repair nor replace it.  Mine was truly a lemon!  It sounds that maybe others have had a better experience.
It's now over a couple of months, using this phone. Now they updated the Firmware Version to 30.019.201.3. I think this phone has remarkable improvement over N95 and holds worth compared to N97. I am using 16GB Class 5 MicroSD card with it.. now, over a month and with no issues. OLED display and FM Transmitter makes it a unique phone.
The Nokia N85 is an awesome phone!  The display looks great and all the features work nicely.  The auto-rotate feature isn't very responsive when trying get it back to vertical, but other than that, only praise for this phone.  The camera looks really good and the built-in GPS makes this phone a real 3-in-1 bargain.  I did read a review that said "this phone is painful to message on if you're a major texter" which I am, and it did take some adjusting to since my Nokia 6263 had a much larger keypad and the buttons were out-pressed.  It does get easier and after a while I couldn't text on the 6263 anymore.  I think a case is a good idea but beware before buying one that this phone slides up and down to expose the keypad and music controls, and the case I bought online didn't allow the phone to slide.  Real pointless considering you need to slide the phone to text or dial a number.  This phone also has quite a bit of internal memory and comes with a 7gb memory card.I recommend this phone!!
This phone is not worth buying for the following reasons.Cons*If you text a lot then don't buy this phone... the keyboard in tiny and flimsy.*The phone locks often and you have to turn it off and then back on.*The camera has a lag before it captures an image causing blurry shots, when you do manage to get a clean shot(in sunlight)it's very good.Pros*Sound quality of the music player is very good.*Screen is awesome for showing images.*Lots of storage space for music and images.Final Review: Below Average for the constant locking of the controls.
What can I say about this cell phone? That it has the best camera Ive seen, incredible battery and sweet FM trasmiter? Well, maybe. All I can say is that this is the best phone Ive had myself. Outstanding features in an outstanding prduct. For sure it has things to improve (like it could use some more processing speed), but its nothig that takes its winner position.I Love itA bit more detail.Things that are very good or perfect- FM Transmitter- TV connection- WIFI- Camera at "normal" light- Built in SW set- Picture edition built-in- GPS mapsThings that could use some improvement, but are still good- Camera Flash (or night shots)- the plastics arround the NaviWhell(r)- Processor speed in some operations- GPS navigation
I recently bought the Nokia N85 Unlocked Smartphone and couldn't be more pleased with it. It has almost all of the same features as the slightly more expensive bigger, and older brother, the N95. The build quality was quite excellent. It felt hefty enough in my hands that it made it seem like a sturdy and substantial smartphone. Not too much so that it was a burden on my pocket or for leisure carrying. This item should satisfy most anyone looking for a new smartphone. It will also satisy most anyone who is looking for a multimedia rich smartphone too.Have fun with yours, you won't be disappointed.Vernon

 Length:: 3:19 MinsThe Nokia N85 is the latest Nseries Multimedia Computer, here are my first impressions about this device, I bought right here at Amazon. Check out the-nseries.com for info about Nseries.
I've had the phone for six months and am completely satisfied.  I'm amazed at the number or featuresin this small package. All the features work as advertised except the FM transmitter in my 4Runner, probably because the car's antenna is, I believe, in the back glass.  I moved up from a n75 which had terrible battery life; the N85 is, maybe,five times better.On a side note, I dropped the phone and it would no longer charge.  I thought the phone was outof warranty, but on calling NokiaUSA to see about getting it repaired, it wasn't.  They immediatelyeMailed me a UPS shipping label and directions.  I took the bare phone to a UPS store and they tookit packaged it and sent it on its way.  One week later a new phone showed up at my door. No money out of my pocket. In the future I'll need a real good reason to buy any other brand of phone.  Also, the replacement's fit is about the same.  That is to say, there is a small amount of play in the slider parts.Of course, there has to be some play for parts to slide under different temperature conditions.I don't find this a problem.
I really wanted to love the Nokia N85.  But after 6 months of using this phone, all I can think of is the many ways it has failed me.I bought the phone for it's all-in-one features, phone, email, gps, music player, camera, games, even the FM radio.  Just about every one of those features has not lived up to expectations.  I brought the phone on my honeymoon in Europe to take pictures and video, use the internet when I had wifi, and watch some movies during my downtime on trains and planes.  Unfortunately about halfway through the trip, my memory card somehow became corrupt and all my videos were gone.  By the end of the trip, just about all the images and videos I took over the two weeks had been lost. Just gone, *poof*.  Luckily I was able to retrieve the images using a windows program to retrieve lost images from a corrupt memory card, but the videos are gone forever.The music player is nice when it works, but it too somehow became corrupt, and none of my music appears in my library any longer.  The only way to play those songs is to use the file browser to navigate to the folder where the song is saved and play each song individually.Sometimes the phone gets in a state where it will not make any calls from the contacts list or recent calls.  The only way to dial is to manually type in a number -- the only way to fix this is to reboot.  The most fundamental feature of this device, making calls, is broken.  Go figure.I downloaded the trial for Age of Empires III through N-gage to try out the gaming features of the phone.  After I played the game and exited, I could not launch any other application on the phone until I rebooted.The camera flash is so incredibly bright that if I take a picture of anyone, they are always squinting.  (The flash comes on before the shutter in order to focus).The one bright spot of this phone is the quality of the video recordings. They are very sharp and clear, with good stabilisation to make up for shaky hands.  The rest of the device is just one disappointment after another.  Nokia needs to do a way better job of quality control and testing of their firmware before releasing a product like this.
I think that this phone is the best from NOKIA, have all the features that the comun people need. I use this phone in Venezuela and I am very happy for this recommendation from Amazon. Superior phone !!!! Thanks Amazon .
I like the phone. Just does not have great range. In town, it can't be beat. Out of town, hope and pray you get a signal.
Takes very good photos, though not in low light.  Hardware is sloppily built, lots of wiggles, not tight at all.  Keys are unusable.  S60 OS is mature and runs well.
excellent product, a nice 5mp camera, 3g capabilities. ita has everything you can ask in a mobile phone
I bought this phone about three weeks and I must say, The more I use It the most enthusiastic I got into it, has lots of useful functions, looks sweet and fancy. I would buy it if I had to choose again.
There is no other phone on the market as rich on feathers as Nokia N85 for which I love it!Poor built quality for which I hate it.
Expensive but nice phone. Nice size. Able to download and play Ngage games. Has all the features you could ever need. Nice build quality. My favorite thing about this phone is, your able to listen to your text messages. It's so funny to hear some of the pronouncations.Not so good: Finger print magnet. Buttons creek.
At first glance the Nokia N85 seems to have it all: GPS, good camera, 3G features, etc etc etc.After owning one of these for over 2 months now I believe it's safe to say it's one of the best disguised useless gadgets I've ever seen, and here's why:1. After buying it, I spent countless hours searching, installing and configuring stuff that should be in the phone already, like a simple chronometer/timer;2. Things don't work as expected a lot of the time, enough to draw attention to the phone itself. After a while it will become one of those time black holes, instead of saving your time it will make you spend it on the phone trying to figure out how to make it work the way it should;3. The email client. Herein lies a reason that by itself is enough for anyone who demands BASIC functionality from a smartphone stay the hell away from this piece of junk. This item is a little complex but I will try to make my point as clearly as possible. 3.1. If you choose to use the internal client and connect directly to your server, you can download all messages or just the last "n" messages, only in PLAIN TEXT, but:  3.1.1. If you choose the POP3 protocol, you can either download just headers, messages limited to a certain size or all messages and attachments. No option for entire messages with no attachments. Plus no access to "sent" or "trash" IMAP folders. STUPID.  3.1.2. If you choose the IMAP4 protocol, your only option is to download just the headers (headers are just "from", "time received" and "title" fields). EXTREMELY STUPID, because if you're connected over a slow connection it will take you AGES to view each message (as if not enough it takes quite a while for this miserable thing to open a connection). 3.2. Now things get really, really annoying. You also have an option to read HTML mail, but guess what? For that to work you have to CREATE AN ACCOUNT at email.nokia.com, and give them your email address AND PASSWORD. Cute isn't it? On top of that, the servers are offline for days, some times even weeks in a row. You will probably read the words "push email" here and there - THAT'S A LIE, the phone performs scheduled downloads from their server. Then WHAT IS THIS GOOD FOR, you'd ask? It's very simple: it will hold you HOSTAGE to Nokia's awful services, and it seems Nokia plans to CHARGE for it in the future, look at that! 3.3. You can also purchase a good email client, with the features that should be present in the internal client to begin with, for US$ 30 or so. Not much maybe, but in my opinion outrageous considering, like I've said, IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FREAKIN PHONE.4. Maybe the browser isn't supposed to be perfect since it's a mobile one, but when I get to the point of using the browser in my cellphone you can be pretty sure it's an emergency situation. The N85 has FAILED MISERABLY almost every time I've tried to use it in such situations, both with the internal browser and Opera Mini.Final Considerations:I must admit the concept is sound: a smartphone with great hardware (camera/GPS/OLED display/storage capacity) and open software, problem is, software is not that open, and Nokia has lost its honesty towards customers as well as its technological edge.Now I feel like a complete idiot because I recommended this and other Nokia phones to a lot of friends and now I've found out that I was totally, completely, 100% wrong. Also my friends who own iPhones and of whom I used to make fun of will never, EVER leave me alone as I suspect I'll end up buying one.Don't let yourself be fooled like I was. Being tech-savvy I was looking for a phone with a somewhat open architecture and that could be tweaked to my heart's content and ended up going for a brand that deceives its customers with a very, very weak product instead of going for something simple, easy to use and powerful.
Had the phone for a month then had to return it to Amazon. Features are great. I won't get into the pros as so many ppl covered those already, I will just go over the cons. 1.)The OS seems to freeze itself up at times where it's totally irresponsive to commands. You can press select and nothing happens. Seems to correct itself after a few minutes of idling. 2.)Capturing the highest quality video is very spotty, it will capture for 3-4 seconds, freeze, then continue capturing. If it doesn't work, why offer it in the first place? 3.) battery cover started to rattle after a week, can not stay tug on the phone. It's a little fraustrating. 4.) worst of it all, the earpiece started to fail after 2 weeks. Clearly a connection problem as if you press the back of the phone hard and in different ways, it fixes the problem temp. It's not a signal strength issue because loudspeaker works fine. Seems to be a very common problem for N85 manufactured before Feb 09.
I bought two of these, one for me, the other one for my son. First of all, this phone has great feature, especially the online feature. I use its bluetooth to connect to my laptop to go online. However, it just has average call quality, lot of static. I am sure this is not the cellular network problem because I have tried on AT&T; and T-mobile with the same result.
Do not even consider purchasing this phone.As a Nokia fan and owner of a N95-3 (a great device), everything about this phone looked & sounded great.  It has all the same featues packed into a sleeker, more attractive body, with a higher end screen and equivalent battery life, for a lower price.  Sounds perfect, in theory.But... spend some time reading comments around Amazon and other review sites, and you'll notice a common theme: horrible build quality.  It seems Nokia has cut so many corners on component quality to drive the price of the N85 down that you stand little chance to get one that will work properly for a decent length of time.I've personally been through 2; the first worked well for 1 week and then the in-ear speaker quit working, so I couldn't hear anybody on the other end. An inexplicable component failure I've never seen in other handsets regardless of brand.  The second unit appeared to be okay for the first couple days, and then on any call that lasted more than 10 minutes, would start to randomly cut in and out, mysteriously dropping words & entire sentences, and sometimes dropping the call altogether.  Thought it was the network the first couple times, but as a regular occurrence 2-3 times a day (with full bars) realized it was definitely the phone.Read other reviews and you'll see a multitude of other quality issues, including dust under the screen, creaking buttons, hardware freeze-ups, etc.You may think to yourself, "good phone at a good price, I'll take my chances and hope I get one that works", but no, DON'T do it.  I am pleading with you, don't even try it, because the phone will fail - under warranty if you're lucky - or possibly 8 months down the road, and you'll be out $300 and feeling stupid.  Get an N95 instead, or an N97 if you have the cash.
I got it with 330 USD, that's a good price to have this phone. Nokia is the best.
El TELEFONO SE VE BONITO Y TIENE DE TODO, PERO SU CALIDAD DE FABRICACION ES MUY MALA. EL PRIMERO QUE COMPRE DEJO DE FUNCIONAR A LA SEMANA Y EL SEGUNDO, DESPUES DE TRES MESES NO ME FUNCIONA EL AURICULAR. LO COMPRE EN USA Y AHORA VIVO EN COLOMBIA; LA GARANTIA DE NOKIA SOLO FUNCIONA EN EL PAIS DE COMPRA COSA ABSURDA YA QUE EN EL MUNDO MODERNO UNO ESTA EN UN SITIO Y AL DIA SIGUIENTE ESTA AL OTRO LADO DEL MUNDO Y LOS CELULARES VIAJAN CON UNO.  ES HECHO EN CHINA Y LOS OTROS TELEFONOS QUE HABIA TENIDO, FUERON FABRICADOS EN FINLANDIA. NO RECOMIENDO LA COMPRA DE ESTE TELEFONO. FUI DEFENSOR DE LA CALIDAD DE NOKIA HASTA QUE ME PASO ESTO, AHORA HE CAMBIADO DE MARCA.
Nokia N85 Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Copper)If everything worked this phone would have been fantastic.  However, it constantly hangs, it is slow, it is lousy at picking up a Wi-Fi signal, deletes music out of the library, deletes phone log,  and the list goes on.I used to have Sony's and thought I'd try Nokia.  Guess I'll go back to Sony.
Good device; the interface could be a bit more intuitive; the download Nokia software for PC / mobile interface such as sync of Outlook elements is confusing and technical support confused.
The hardware is great, the PC Suite is horrible. I have some problems with the Suite and could not find answers, not even on Nokia forums. The Suite is vulnerable to smallest deviations from the routine imagined by the Nokia programmers. One example: connecting the phone cable through the front panel USB did not work, through the rear panel did. The Suite does not detect such deviations and the User Guide does not warn about their consequences. You discover the right way by trial and error. Windows Mobile is much better in this respect.
it is good product and meets all my expectations, I had during purchase of this item
All the great things about this phone including size are erased by a faulty headset speaker, which according to a couple of people at Nokia Discussion's forum even if I sent the phone to Nokia Service, after a couple of weeks the speaker will probably break down again. Apparently this happens with phones whose IMEI digits 7th and 8th are "02". Can I check with Amazon before buying about the IMEI digits?......
Nice but camera was so bad.  ALso, don't really like the screen very hard to see when outside.
La maravilla tecnológica me duró sólo 30 días antes de que el "speaker" fallara y luego la pantalla de video SIMPLEMENTE DEJÓ DE FUNCIONAR...  buscado razones terminé por entender el porque... NOKIA utilizó partes baratas hechas en china... después  de que mis anteriores teléfonos Nokia fuesen "eternos" ... ahora son me doy cuenta que los nuevos modelos son desechables a precios de "estafa"... los peores $450 gastados de todo mi vida... SI APRECIA SU DINERO Y SU PAZ NO COMPRE ESTE TELEFONO.
I just received N85 today, unpackaged it and it took me 10 minutes to realize that I'm dropping it off with UPS tomorrow :(First and the foremost, the build quality is awful! The whole thing is so flimsy, when you press the front buttons it makes a scratching noise!Secondly, the camera button doesn't work.Overall, the phone looks like a Chinese made fake for 10 bucks would look. Nokia, you are losing a committed 10 year customer!
Outstanding functions, takes fantastic pictures with great Macro and high-speed capture.But the keyboard- yikes!  No sensory feedback at all; it's actually tiring to use the keyboard.  I had this phone for two weeks- the first week I toyed with it until I got an inexpensive case to protect it.  The second week it was my full-time carry phone.I just couldn't live with the keyboard which is a crying shame considering the functionality of the device.  I'm not a huge guy, but I just couldn't keep from hitting the wrong keys and it was painful after a while even trying.Pros-~ Outstanding photos~ macro, high-speed modes work great~ Fast focus, multiple shot modes~ Typical great Nokia reception, holds 3G really well~ Big, crisp screen~ Snappy OSCons-~ Unusable keyboard~ Navi-wheel is nifty gadget, but is only implemented in a handful of places in the OS and not at all in 3rd party apps.  Too sensitive.
This is my first Nokia, and my first unlocked phone.I've had the phone for a little over a week and these are my impressions:It's built really well.  It feels solid and the screen seems pretty scratch resistant so far.  The buttons are also really nice and the number keys are god for texting.  From my research it seems to be a characteristic of N series phones.  The design is clean as well.  It seems well thought out and there's not much missing (an external play/pause button would be nice, but it comes with an inline remote to plug your earphones into), but nothing extra that I could do with out either.It looks great.  I got a white version (even thought the product description says grey) which I actually prefer.  There is also a black version of the N79 that has been released recently as well.  The changeable backs are cool (I received the white, red and brown covers), but I don't know how much I will change them personally.The features as you've read in the product description are incredible.  And honestly it does all of them well.  The music player is good.  The camera is decent (Not the best 5 mp pics I've ever seen, but for a phone the pics are awesome, and it has an automatic flash).  I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the video recorder, but the quality really surprised me, in a good way.  The gps is awesome.  You get a 90 trial of the turn by turn voice navigation, I'm not sure how much the subscription costs, but if it's not outrageous, I would absolutely spend money for it.  The FM transmitter is a really cool feature, I travel a lot and am in a lot of rental cars and it works like a charm.  At this point in time this phone seems to have about every feature out there.  It's pretty amazing considering it's size.I've never used a symbian phone before and there is a bit of a learning curve.  It took me a few days of moderate use to get comfortable with it.  The N79 was a bit buggy out of the box.  I was also disappointed with the software support for Macs.  You have to buy a plug in for iSync to work (not yet supported) and even then it recognizes it as an N95 8GB, but it does work.  I hope there will be more Mac support in the near future.  Nokia has recently released a firmware update and with the amount of things that were improved, it makes you think that Nokia kinda rushed this phone out the door a little.  After I updated my phone the OS is much more solid and a little faster and more responsive.  If you purchase this phone, updating the software should be your first order of business.I can't think of anything else I could possibly expect a phone to do that this phone doesn't.  I chose this phone over the N82 because of the looks and because it supports US 3G unlike the N82.  The N82 supposedly has a better camera, but for me I'd rather have the 3G.*Update*This phone is on v20 of it's firmware and MUCH more stable.  I've used this phone day in and day out for 6 months, and there still isn't a phone this size that can do everything this phone can.The only negative thing I'll say is that the battery life is not what I'd hoped.  It will only last for one day.  Granted I do a lot with it in one day.  Music, GPS, Internet, some pics all while it keeps 3 email boxes up to date.  I guess you can't have everything.One big bonus I've recently discovered is that this phone supports a 16 gb micro sdhc card!  I recently purchased the 16 gb class 6 card made by Trancend Transcend 16 GB microSDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GUSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] (The is one that comes with an SD adapter, not in the Amazon packaging, that's the one I bought) and it works perfectly.I'm happy with this phone.
I've just bought the phone. I was looking for a phone which I could use for Skype and WLAN. I've upgraded the phone OS as soon as I take it out of box. I've never owned a Nokia before so I hadn't use a Symbian phone. I was using Sony Ericsson phones for ages. But since Nokia is the top seller I was expecting a very good phone.First of all the screen design is not impressive and very classical. The SE has nice animated themes for like ages. But Nokia does not have any. The only interesting thing here is the Nokia N79 comes with 3 different clip on back covers with a sensor at the back so that the phone can understand what color back cover you are currently using and can adapt screen background color according to cover color.My first experience with Symbian was not so promising. First of all anything you launch be it Phonebook, SMS box etc are actually small applets and takes up some memory and if you don't quit it explicitly using Exit from the menu it just goes to background when you switch to menu. In time applications take up so much memory and the phone menu handling starts to slow down and even after some point some applications especially GPS tends to lock-up easily when lots of applications are running. In all menu system is complex and an application could be launched from different menus and there's not a single key which could terminate an application when hit (like Sony Ericsson's back key). There's not a built-in facility to display how much memory an application currently occupies or some way to kill an unresponsive applet). In all Symbian is similar to your average windowing OS but not having adequate functionality to support running applications like your OS does.GPS software have always locked up whe I tried voice navigation and I've tried it like 10 times. The only thing good about it is the cold-boot time for the GPS receiver is extremely short when compared to a pocket GPS device like Garmin etc.The design is impressive and with the silver bright frame it reminds the older generation iPOD. Screen is just plastic which could easily scratch. My older SE k790i had a mineral screen which is hard to scratch. Keypad is consisted of strips of single plastic stripes containing three numbers in a line which makes tapping extremely hard. It is not easy to switch between typing modes like caps, small, numeric and extremely hard to add a new word to T9 dictionary. With the SE there was a dedicated soft key for adding to the dictionary.I've really surprised to see that there's no numeric charge level indication that comes with the phone. With the SE phone status info includes the battery charge level as numeric percentage. But I've even could not find an external application which would display charge level in numeric. But the battery life is acceptable and it can survive up  to 2-3 days when WLAN is enabled.The picture quality of the 5.0MP cam is similar to my SE 3.2MP cam and it would be impossible for me to understand which pic was taken with which phone. In fact the problem with built-in cameras in phones is not the the capacity of the sensor but the optic lenses or better the lacking of them due to size limitations. Night shots are very noisy like most phone cameras. I don't think they could replace point and shoots at any time soon. Also I could not find an easy way to turn on cam light to use as a torch in the night. Thanks to incompatibility among different patch levels of the Symbian. The ones I could find did not work on S60 Patch 2.The screen is full of very small icons and it is not easy to understand the status it indicates easily. The screen is not very bright in the sunlight and it is very hard to read the screen under the sunlight. The back is covered with reflective paper it improves visibility to some degree but my SE was again better in visibility under daylight.The phone has some burrowed parts from iPod. There's this position sensor and it changes the screen orientation automatically when you hold it in horizontal or vertical. But the sensitivity is not so good. It sometimes switch the screen when tilted slightly or might not turn back to portrait mode again when turned slowly. The same goes with  dial wheel. When enabled the wheel does not operate on the initial screen and works only when you launch the menu. then it works erratically when you launch the phonebook in that it sometimes works when you first launch or sometimes it won't work before you tap a key. Then again it is not compatible with every application that comes with the phone or later you download.Speakers for music playback is loud enough but not very high. The music output is stereo with some useful wide stereo effect. I think the sound quality is acceptable for a phone. The radio applet is well organized and it comes with RDS which is new for Nokia. I'd never understood why Nokia refrained from using RDS for such a long time. The phone has also a phone transmitter with RDS output. It displays "Nokia" on RDS when tuned. But it would be nice if it had broadcast the song id instead. Transmitter eases stereo streaming from your phone wireless without using Bluetooth A2DP which N79 supports but most car stereo equipments are currently lacking.The built in browser is good and it supports Adobe Flash which iPhone lacks for copyright considerations. So it is very easy to browse any web site using the phone. Somehow it is not possible to understand at any time whether it is connected through WAP/GPS/3G or WLAN. There's no icon for it on the immediate display. You need to browse to connection settings from the menu to check the current connection. It is true for all the other applications that comes default apart from GPS. It indicates the connection type.In all, though Nokia tried some new features on it it seems that they are not tightly integrated with the OS. Smybian is not mature enough to be the OS of  choice for smart phones. So I want to replace my phone with a SE G705 as soon as possible though it lacks some of the functionality of N79 like dial button, and FM transmitter.
I bought the N79 11 days ago. Thus far, I'm very satisfied with this phone. The reception is great and crystal clear wherever I've been. Battery life is fine. One of the first things I did was upgrade the firmware over the air via Wifi. I have software version 20.175 now. I've used the music player and Internet radio a lot and I'm impressed. I get a lot of great music and sports radio stations over the Internet. I just use my old 4GB San Disk Micro SD card for my 60's music and it plays extremely well. Operamini is my default web browser and works great over Wifi. Moreover, YouTube videos play great straight from the Operamini browser or Nokia's native browser. I just had to change a few settings in Operamini and realplayer first, giving it privileges. I haven't tried my unlimited AT&T; Media net plan on the N79 because I use that feature on my N78 and I didn't feel like exchanging sim cards.The N79 is a little lighter than the N78 and the OS is just as snappy if not snappier. I haven't used the camera yet so I cannot really comment on that. I never had an issue with the keyboard on the N78 (which I've owned for 8 months now) and don't have any issues with the keyboard on the N79. I don't find the N79 keyboard stiff.This phone has everything I need (and more) and does it extremely well. I'm happy I bought the N79 (US Version).
Definitely, my best SmartPhone choice!Being a smartphone users from several years ago (i started with a Motorola MPx 200), I switched to Nokia years ago, with this roadmap (N75 3G US -> N95 8GB -> N78 3G US -> HTC Diamond 3G US -> HP iPaq 614c 3G US-> Nokia N79 3G US)(Yes, there are a couple of WinMo, but i liked the idea to show you my last choices)My new Nokia N79 3G US covers all my needs.I prefer a Candy Bar phone, because there are no moving parts, so less chance to send it to Nokia for repair.Keyboard is excellent, with more confort than N78.Screen ? 2.4", i feel confortable with this size, perhaps 2.6" OLED could be better -like N85 Slider- but as i said, i prefer Candy Bar so i got used to this size of screen.Good point for Nokia to include a 4GB memory card, so, there's no need to buy an other asap.GPS ? Is the fastest i tried up to now! Garmin Mobile XT runs smoothly.Camera ? Really good! I still see differences with pictures taken by a Nokia N95, but camera is really good!As i said, the best smartphone i used, with a great size that fits perfectly in your pocket with the power of a high end smartphone.And the best companion for your car... Search for ProClip mounting solutions here in Amazon, and your car will have a professional looking holder for your best smartphone!Regards,Gustavo
Well-rounded is best label I can think of for this phone. It has a very full feature set, and comes in a small and light form factor. It is not overly ornate or dull, and comes packaged with swappable backplates ("Style-Up" covers?). I got this for my wife and have been setting it up for her and find it truely pleasant to use.Number of key points:- Sybian S60 3.2 UI a breeze to use - I have been a long-time Sony Ericsson user and using S60 for the first time did not present a huge learning curve.- Loaded with features, and all works well and integrated together nicely.- Call quality/handling, phonebook, logs, etc. works as expected.- Call/SMS/MMS setup simple (seems automatic)- Data handling problem-free - 3G/EDGE/GPRS switches seemlessly. Did not notice hiccups. Streaming video works smoothly.- Wi-Fi works well, and setup is easy. Options to filter out ones you don't use (neighbors')- Very good Web browser. Handling of connections, bookmarks, loading, are also very non-intrusive.- Good 5MP camera - responsive, decent flash, sufficient options, good album/viewing.- Good video recording.- Excellent music and video playback - RealPlayer works well; the TV Out is particularly impressive quality-wise- Application handling is good - standard S60 v3 affair- GPS works fine, though I have not tested that extensively yet; audible turn-by-turn available (at cost)- PC software - great support and tons of choices. The new Ovi suite does everything possible. Lots of other Nokia services available (e.g. SportsTracker, share.Ovi)All in all, there are other handsets that may do one or two particular areas better, (e.g. higher MP cameras, 120fps video recording, etc.) but the N79's full set of functions all seems very well implemented and cohesive. As for ease-of-use, nothing has been a struggle on this phone. All of this comes in a very simple and pocketable package. While media fans may prefer the larger OLED on the N85, or a 8MP in the SE C905, I would highly recommend the N79 for the large mainstream audience.
I got this phone and unlike the product description, the color is NOT silver, but white. Supposedly the only color available for this phone as of today is only in white for the US version. The bundled firmware is very buggy so I had to update it to version 11.049. There are still some bugs, but many are fixed. Phone has a great camera which replaced my old point and shoot. It has great reception and call quality is good. I like the deign of the phone in general, however there are trade-offs for great design. The keypad is very crammed, which is often hard to use. The phone is made almost entirely of plastic, which is light in weight but creaks like there is no tomorrow. Anywhere you touch on the phone is where it will creak. The screen is nice but not very bright, but has a reflective screen on the back which helps usability under direct sunlight. The screen on my unit is not centered correctly so it's slanted to the left very slightly. It also came with one dead pixel. Battery life improves over a couple of charges, and I find the battery life about average. The speaker is not terribly loud, but usable. Overall the best part I like about this phone is the camera, and the area of most improvement is build quality. I would say this phone is not of a good value for the money, so I would not recommend this phone for any average person.
The Nokia N79 is an excellent phone, especially for people who like multimedia. Sorry iPhone, this phone has two cameras, video conference capability, lots of editing options, amazing battery life, wi-fi and more, all of these hidden behind a humble form factor.  Nice price if you want to avoid those expensive data plans. The keyboard is not it's forte, but other than that,  this phone is a must have.
I used to have BlackBerry phones in the last 5 years using them 99% for business. I decided to try a Nokia and here is what I found:PROS:1) Light weight, easy to carry and handle. This is actually a normal phone that has also all smart-phone features. Easy dialing and having a conversation with great quality is not compromised, because of a full keyboard or touch screen, like on many other "phones".2) Long battery life, it is designed to save energy in a smart and convenient way despite the 3G and all applications. If you use the device properly you will find that the battery life is at least 3 times longer comparing to a BlackBerry.3) Fast and reliable operation system. I am surprised how quickly it starts or shuts down, not to mention the responsiveness, fast operations, etc.4) Fantastic pictures and videos. It is not only about the megapixels, but the quality is really great. You really don't need to carry another camera around. It also saves the GPS coordinates of the location where the picture was taken. A lot of great camera settings just like in a standard digital camera.5) Great features that you really use and are very convenient. For example - the phone reads your emails, FM transmission to your car radio, so you can listen to your music in every car without a cable, great Internet and FM radio, unlock button on the top, easy set up of emails, including sync with company Exchange server, easy tethering at high speed, free IM (Nimbuzz), free Skype talk over the data connection (not using your minutes), etc.6) WiFi; that is a standard for many phones now. However at this phone the applications actually work faster using the WiFi. Also, it takes much less energy to use the WiFi comparing to the 3G. I found that great, especially using the phone in the office or home.7) Great design, the changing covers, the look and feel, durable at drop. You will be surprised.I am sure many will find other things and features of this phone great too.CONS:Really minor things I found being too picky and playing too much with the features: software bugs or lack of full control, but certainly those are really minor and they do not interfere with the normal phone operation or any of the applications. I recommend you back up of the phone once you take it out of the box. Some of the applications might be lost if you reset the phone later on. I am not sure why Nokia don't provide such a back up as a standard feature; let's say on the CD or on the Memory Card.I believe Nokia have made an unbelievably good product and I can't say there is a true completion. I would recommend Nokia N79 to everyone that likes well designed, but also sophisticated and convenient to use devices.
Camera is all you'd expect, with sufficient light the pictures look really good, and I'm really picky.  With low light, as bad as any other phone... :( Flash, pretty descent all though because of the configuration of the camera maybe using the flash even on pretty descent light conditions ruins your photograph by overexposure to light, haven't been able to fix that with settings, but maybe it can be done...Battery life is good, like any other nokiaScreen looks really good, put directly under sun light is at least visible.Buttons are not so good, sometimes hard to press and the end/send buttons are actually position OVER the menu/clear buttons, nothing big though just something you should know.I didn't read much about the phone except that the camera was great so in case you don't know it has an accelerometer which rotates practically every app, including the menu and interface.Overall a great phone! comes with a 4gb microSD and headphone jack without the issue of having to plug in a "special adapter"
I knew I wanted a Nokia phone and this seemed to suit me well! I have only had this phone for a week but I love everything about it, including physical appearance and battery life!! It has all the features I was looking for and more! Nokias are very user friendly so no one should have diffictuly in using this device. The reasons I did not give this phone 5 stars because (1) it has frozen twice already, so I had to remove the battery for it to restart (I seem to have difficulty removing the back casing). I think this was due to pressing the buttons too fast which might have confused it. (2) The keypad is a little firm, from a touchscreen iPhone to actually clicking down, the keys could be softer! And (3) last but not least, the flash of the camera is a bit too bright! Most of the pictures I've taken of my daughter are with her eyes closed! Other than that, this is an excellent phone and I would highly recommend it!!
this is what I would call a perfect phone! the design, specs & features are amazing... and take note: stereo speakers, display size-2.4 inches & tv-out functionality are among its best assets.......
I bought it 2 months back. Its coolest of its range phones in Nokia. Only draw back navigation is little complex you need to be used to it by reading manual.
With This phone at first didnt have so much expectations about it. After catching up with the device, is a whole different story, the phone is great, stylish, run smoothly eventhough it took me a while to take the best of the camera, pics came out beautifully. bottom line phone is simply great.!
Basically, I wanted to love this phone, however, the one that I received was full of bugs.  First off if u tried to use the navi wheel all of the keys (except for the power button for some reason) would lock up until you reset the phone.  This would also happen at random times.  Also, when I first booted the camera i got an image for about a second before the image went black and never came back.  I ended up returning the phone on the same day I got it.  I guess the build quality is pretty good though.
hello !!!i want to buy n79 or n85 wich is the best ?and one thing i dont like is the color.so please tell me is this phone silver. and does it has silver bottons and not white?if it is silver i would buy it.please inform me the front color is silver and not white yes ?
The first time I saw this phone, I knew I had to get it. It looked so stylish, and at such a reasonable price. It had many features I liked, like the 5mp camera, 2.4 inch screen (I cant handle anything smaller than that) and sliding lens cover, which doubled as a camera on/off switch.I kept this phone for about 2 months before I lost it. I bought a SE w902 to replace it, but I missed my ZN5 too much, and 2 weeks ago, bought a new ZN5 and sold the SE.Likes:- Stylish. eg flat keypad, "take the photo" button is stylishly disguised as a diagonal purple chrome button on the side.- Bright screen with scratch resistant glass- very shiny, smooth and nice.- The default purple Kodak theme for the UI is attractive imho.- Slim, yet solid build.- Easy to open a new sms message and send. To send, just press "send" once, unlike other brands, where you have to press "send", then press "yes" for "are you sure?"- Very customisable menu- can reorder items and lists.- Affordable.- Comes with 3.5mm headphone jack, so can use your own.- Camera:*Quality is so good that you can use as an actual camera, if you dont mind a fixed lens camera. Of course, be sure to charge the battery before you go out.*Panoramic photo feature is interesting, and often results in a good quality pic.*Like many mobile phones, you can take multiple photos quickly. However, most will only let you do it as VGA size, or maybe let you choose one ("best shot"). The ZN5 will let you save all the photos you take, and at full size- up to 5mp. Excellent.*Sliding lens cover doubling as quick on/off switch is practical.*Dedicated buttons for viewing photos.*5mp camera takes good photos, especially in good light.*Camera xenon flash is very bright, excellent for indoor photos in the same room.*Kodak software fix works well to lighten up dark or underexposed parts of a photo.Dislikes:- My second phone has a glitch. After I take a photo, it saves, then the screen goes black, as if you have closed the lens cover. All the other software lists are there, just no picture. My first ZN5 never had this problem.- My first ZN5 did, however, turn itself off after being turned on for a few minutes. I have read others online saying this is because the battery slips from its contact slightly, turning the phone off. My second ZN5 doesnt have this problem.- Video is pitiful. I mean it is so bad that it looks grainy, even on the 2.4 inch screen. Such a waste of high quality lens.- Battery got hot after prolonged camera use.- The word "Kodak" on the camera lens cover. I dont think Kodak is a very prestigious brand and detracts from the Motorola.- The sms dictionary is still screwy- strange words instead of the expected word, and you cant add words to a customised dictionary (well, I havent found out how to, at any rate)- Camera- Panoramic feature only lets you move horizontally, so cant get vertical collage effect like with the SE "manual" panoramic feature.-mp3 player is ok, but not as good as SE.- Reception was poor on my first ZN5, and average on my second one. Dont know what the hype about Crystal Talk is, because there was no crystal with my talking.- After downloading the contacts from my sim card, it added "/1" to the end of every contact. No idea why that is. eg "Adam" become "Adam/1"There's probably more things I do and dont like, but I cant think of them at the moment. Overall, it's not perfect, but I like it and I think I'll be keeping it for a while.Should you buy it? It depends on what you want. Do you need video? Give it a miss. Want a lot of fancy features and games? Give it a miss.Want a stylish slim phone with a great camera at a low price? The ZN5 should be in your top 3 list of phones to try out.
I have been a loyal Motorola user for some time, starting way back with my silver Timeport flip phone, V300, RAZR V3, RIZR Z3, W490 and now the Zine ZN5.  The OS is just intuitive to me and the icons and graphics have always looked better to me.  Whenever I look at other brands, namly Samsumg (even the newer ones), they always feel clunky (I also owned a Samsung S105 before the V300).  This phone keeps alot of the navigation that I'm famaliar with and adds some nice tweaks to it.  There are tabs on some menus making it easier to scroll through options.Some features I like, which also prompted my upgrade, are wifi, nice large screen and the FM radio.  I have tried the FM radio on a Nokia phone and reception was really weak.  This pulled them in nice and clear.  Only downside it you have to be using headphones, but that is needed on other phones as well with the FM radio feature.  Of course the major selling point is the camera!  It only took a few minutes to get the hang of taking pictures.  You have to press pretty firm to get the picture to take, but its just a matter of getting a feel for it.  The pictures are nice and clear.  Low light was a little grainy, but still good with the flash.  Not a complete camera replacement for me, but perfect for getting those split second shots that you always wish you had a camera handy for.... and now I do!  Surfing the web with T-zones was also much zippier than my RIZR.  That was unexpected, but very noticable.  I have finally been able to get Opera mini to work.  Go to [...] to see how to hack the phone and update the firmware.  Magx Reloaded is a very nice firmware.I was a little suprised at the size being almost the same dimensions as my iPod touch, but about 1/2" narrower.  Its about the same height and thickness.  Its not too big at all though and the phone feels nice and solid like my ipod.  Another physical feature that is obvious is that its a bar style phone (I usually stick with flip) and the screen can be subject to scratching.  I will certainly be getting screen protectors for this phone.  I have also dialed someone from mistake in my pocket due to hitting buttons.  There is a manual lock on the side, but I wish there was an option for an automatic lock like my RIZR.Something to note is I bought this off ebay with the seller claiming it was about two months old.  The "messages" button would audibly click but it would not pull up the messaging menu (probably why she was dumping the phone).  Before returning it, I did a reset with code 000000 and then the messaging worked fine.  Hopefully just a glitch that is fixed now.  Overall, I'm very pleased with all the features this phone offers and feel its a keeper!
With the product being a Motorolla phone AND a Kodak Camera combined, You're getting the best of both worlds (and even MP3 player is Easy to use)  I'm a T-Mobile AND a Verizon Wireless subscriber having phones with both companies. I was comparing this to the Samsung Omnia with Verizon as to whom I was going to choose for the better phone with the best options. For anyone who really does enjoy photography as more a hobby you're probably like me and taking pictures of things quickly. Example: "Oh, A beautiful bird.. I want to take a picture!"With the Zine, You open the "lens cover" and hit the picture button. You've taken your picture. tada!  The MP3 feature is very easy to use also, enabling you to access this with out having to pay for a seperate feature on your phone to give it this capability. the screen is well lit, and if you follow the directions on charging the battery when you first get it, the battery life is VERY good for what it handles. Using the camera on and off for over three hours only used one bar of power. This phone also has a GREAT Panoramic feature, creating the frames so that it guides you to a perfect panaoramic shot every time. It's a must have if you're a T-Mobile user , and are a camera enthusiast. Did I mention the Video feature? It's great too! Two resolutions to choose from and optiosn of "sendable" and "max" time frames.  Happy filming!
I love taking pictures, listening to music and having a phone. Not fun carrying all those around when you can have it all in one. I like phones with bells and whistles.PROS* Great camera, takes great pictures so much better than my regular digital camera. There isn't a delay like most digital cameras with this phone, so you can snap away especially if you taking pictures of animals or kids. They tend to move a lot.* Attractive interface and menus, also the themes are customizable.* You can use a standard headphone plug.* I like the radio feature, helps when your at the gym and you want to listen to the TV.* The battery lasts up to 3-4 days. Now this depends, if your taking lots of pictures, it may need a charge sooner.CONS* There is no phone number blocking feature. So all those calls you get that you can block on most phones, you can't on this. You cannot set the ring tone to be silent for a particular number or category either, I tried. Best thing is to download a stealth ring tone.* Texting isn't easy. There are no buttons just a dot like braille and sometimes when I text and I make a mistake, when I hit the back key, I often accidentally send it since it's right next to the send button. Nice! I don't like texting on this phone, it takes forever.* The memory card is underneath the battery, not really convenient.* Make sure to use the lock or you will be butt dialing.There's my opinion on the phone, hope this helps.
I bought this phone in June 2009, it is now November 2009.  The phone is sluggish... SLOW... annoyingly slow!  The pictures are nice, but don't buy it for the camera, you  cannot take action shots at all.  You can take landscape pictures, as long as nothing is moving.  You can take pictures of your kid if they aren't moving.  It is slow to function. It functions like a camera phone, just with nicer quality pictures.I can hear well when I call and they can hear me. I have a hard time hearing the phone ring, even on it's highest setting. I've tried different songs.  When you are texting it takes a lot of patience, sometimes you've texted a whole sentence and it's still on the 2nd word.I am passing this phone off to my hubby, it's frustrating me too much.Update: 6-24-10Hubby loves the phone, he loves the wifi on it and the ability to receive his emails from Gmail on it.  I'd change the rating to 3.5 stars.
This is my 2nd Zine phone and both of them do the exact same thing.  You barely put the phone down on a table, desk etc and the phone shuts off.  I get the Motorola symbol on it and it takes forever to come back on. I don't know if it's a malfunction or what.  I could see if it only happened on one, but two phones?  I probably have this issue at least 2 times a week and it's to the point I want to thrown my phone against the wall.  The only plus on the phone is the camera.  Great pictures but I would prefer the phone to work verses a camera.
Pro: Camera takes wonderful pictures.Con: The phone doesn't work. We are now on our 3rd phone. Ran into someone yesterday with this phone and the first thing they asked: How many times have you had it replaced? We are on phone number 3. Know people who are on number 4. We have run into the phone not charging; freezes up; just shuts off all together; the texting stops working; and hey, that wonderful camera even stopped working on the last phone.Bottom Line: Don't waiste your time or money.
Having used several smart phones, and used this phone for about 4 months, I believe I can give a fairly educated review. And hopefully save you some money in the process. I was going to do a pros and cons list, but I can't think of many pros other than the fact that it charges off a USB charger.The supplied software is useless (like most of these things). You can drag and drop from your computer to the phone, but you need to find the drop folders yourself. This takes time (and effort), as the folder set up is overly complex.Once you have some music on your phone, you'll discover it doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you'll need an HTC headset, which is an extra (was included on the previous model) and too bulky to carry around. You also can't plug it into speakers or your car stereo for the same reason, thus you can't play your music. Other HTC models have headphone jacks, why not this one?I haven't found a video format the phone will play. If it made the video, it'll play it. Otherwise it won't.It runs windows mobile. So it does all the things devices running windows do - it freezes, it crashes, and it requires re-booting - FAR too often.The HTC TouchFLO will cause you most of the frustration found with this phone. It is unable to distinguish between long or short touches, strokes and taps.... Or in fact anything that you'd expect from a touch device. If, for example you scroll through your contacts, the phone will continue to scroll until you stab the screen several times to stop it. By then it's gone past the contact you wanted, and you have to do it again, and again, and again. Eventually you'll give up and use the navigation key - which defeats the point of having a touch screen phone.The screen is too small for the size of the phone. Navigating the internet is very difficult, so you'll need to enlarge the screen to read anything. Then you're at the mercy of TouchFLO again, as you attempt to move the page to the section you want to read. TouchFLO will activate links you didn't want (as it can't distinguish between taps, and scrolls), and it will zoom and un-zoom constantly (as it can't distinguish taps, double taps, and scrolls). Simply looking at a page is hard enough, doing anything like booking flights or a rental car is impossible.The default web browser (Opera) doesn't open all web pages correctly, and links often remain inactive (see booking flights above). It also has Explorer, but with the small screen, it's too hard to use, and TouchFLO works differently in explorer. Opera is the lesser of the two evils.There are no settings to change the screen from landscape to portrait. Landscape would make everything easier (slightly). Once mine opened a web page in landscape (which was great), the next time it was back to portrait. There is no setting to change it manually. I think my experience was just a Microsoft glitch.It has limited internal memory, with an expansion slot for another micro SD card. However, the default setting is to save to the phone, which fills the memory so quickly it's no longer able to launch some programmes. Once data is saved to the phone there is no way to move it to the SD card, the only option is to delete (or connect to a computer and start the slow painful process of doing it your self). To avoid this you have to manually tell it to save to the card.If you store data on the card, you have to manually search the card to find it. Essentially you have two storage devices, a phone, and a card. This is a very annoying problem.Due to the phone's limited internal memory, it can only run one programme at a time and due to the slow processor speed, some programmes takes an eternity to load (Opera, for example can take up to 10 seconds and sometimes more)The camera is about typical quality for a phone like this. The best thing I can say, is it takes photos. Not good photos, just photos. The metering and white balance are very poor, but so are most phone cameras.To answer a call, the phone uses a `button' on the screen that you tap (rather than slide like an iphone), meaning you'll answer calls while fishing it out of your pocket. Even when it's your mother inlaw. Or accidently answer calls, even when you haven't heard the phone ring.When it detects wireless networks, it beeps, and brings up a box asking if you want to join it. If you're in an area with lots of networks, or in a moving vehicle, the shear number of these boxes makes doing anything on the phone impossible, as you have to constantly dismiss them.Texting is difficult due to the screen size. With the keyboard open you loose most of the screen, and still need to use the stylus to type as the `keys' are still tiny.There is no Alarm tone. The alarms will only make one solitary beep. Adding an alarm sound, or song to the folder containing the `beep' was fruitless. Mine is totally unreliable and the alarm seems to go off around 80% of the time - you simply can't rely on it.The recessed screen is an improvement over the previous model, as it makes it more difficult to scratch, however it doesn't come with a pouch (which the previous model did) so it'll get scratched anyway. It does however, come with a screen protector.As a business tool, this phone misses the mark:You can't read spread sheets on the screen, so you have to enlarge it. Then if you try to scroll, our friend TouchFLO is unable to distinguish between touching and scrolling, thus it will only highlight cells, it WONT scroll. The only way to do it is to use the stylus to move the tabs at the sides of the page (as any human finger is about 20 times too big to touch the little tabs). You can never see enough of the sheet at once to actually do anythingWord documents are usable, but due to the size of the screen, once you open the keyboard you can't read much. And again due to the limitations of TouchFLO you can move the curser, but you can't scroll through the document with out using the stylus on the tabs.Email works well, but attachments are downloaded to the phone memory, so it quickly fills up, which then affects other programmes. Deleting emails is the only solution, and as this phone does a full sync with your email server, they're deleted off the server too.Summary: it's a cheap, very poor imitation of an iphone. So poor that it fails at even the most simple tasks. If you've never used a smart phone before, you may be wowed by the internet and email on the phone and may not notice all of these failings. If you have used one before, this phone will drive you insane. The user interface is VERY poor. HTC has a long way to go to make this phone usable.Verdict: Save your money. The only reason it gets two stars is that it does usually make and receive phone calls.
This phone is great. It has out paced all my expectations. The only downsides are it only has edge technology(no 3g speed); The processor is slow. You have to wait for applications to open up; and the speaker phone sound is echoed to who ever your talking about so its not worth using. Now having said all that, this is an fantastic phone at a great price. It is very easy to set up for your carrier. It's all automatic apon start up. Mine is used on T-mobile with out any problems. It also comes with a screen protector. Thats not listed in the product description. If you are going to get a skin for it be aware that it bakes it a bit more difficult to use the touch screen at the edges. Box wave sells one on amazon. It is steep in price but fits very well.
I still love to use PPC, and this phone gives me what I want with the size and it's functions. I also added a 16gb card to it for my music and video, one thing I don't like it that it doesn't play many video formats. I put my T-Mobie sims card in it and it set it's self up from the moment I turned it on, it also uses Edge for network and data access.
besides for comunication purposes, i bought this phone for the following reasons:1. you can create, view, & edit excel and word in this phone when you are out of the office2. you can view ebooks (pdf format).3. great price for a phone with windows mobile 6.1 OS.other features are helpful too.the only problem i think(having the phone for 1 1/2 week), using the phone besides from calling, the life span of the battery is two days or less.
Replaced my HTC Touch (after 2 years use and broken earpiece) with this HTC Viva because it is cheaper and newer than the HTC Touch. Just a few minutes setup, and all is well. Plus it is a newer OS. I am pleased with this.
It is not only what I expected, it is over expectedThe phone is really good, with many important features, simply you are using a computer.Connectivity (wi-fi, btooth, data...etc.) are effective and working very well to facilitate internet connection all the time, you are always online.some windows programs could be installed on the phone, however still need to be improved by software creators. but one of the weak points is the windows itself!!!!! like any windows system, it crashes, hangs, frozen...etc. it is microsoft !!!!!!!! :}The other weak point is "YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE LANGUAGE OF MENUS AT ALL AND YOU CAN NOT FINE WINDOW MOBILE SOFTWARE FOR SALE" it is microsoft again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But HTC is giant coming on the road, I really like the phoneBaher
I am thinking to get another unlocked quadband phone for a while. After some research, I am considering between HTC touch and SONY-Ericsson W595a.I am glad that I chose HTC touch.It is a bit smaller than iPhone/iTouch.Similar touch screen interface.Power by MS mobil 6.1, IE browser, e-mail, wireless, audio/video. You can use the same charger as iPhone/iTouch (5V, 1A).I am enjoying this new gadget.
I have no problem with the phone. It works well except for the small keypad
The celular phone is beatiful, and it's a excelente product.The only problem is that the content of the package varies because they don't have the handsfree, and one cd with the applications.
Recommend not buying unless need a cheap backup phone, etc.Cons1. Screen is too small to truly be useful in web/email/text stuff.2. Can't find a decent holster for it.3. Activsync on win2k won't find it.4. Freezes every couple of days.5. sold as unlocked, but appears to be locked.Pros1. Cheap cost upfront, no att contract data requirements for the life of usage, etc.2. Easily fits in front pocket, only cause can't find a good holster.3. Dropped several times so far and no problems.
I bought this phone in [...].  I live in Costa Rica.  It did not work for me because the Costa Rica government monopoly I.C.E. only accepts two versions of the operating system software.

I am not sure what the other reviewers are comparing this phone to, but I can say this is the best smartphone I have ever owned.  I've been using the phone for four months.  Here is what you should know about the phone:1) Phone sports a beautiful 800 x 480 touch screen.  The touch screen is very responsive compared to other touchscreen phones I've used, with the exception of the iPhone -- which is the gold standard in touch responsiveness -- but doesn't have nearly as many features.2) The Xperia is infinitely customizable.  The panels allow you to quickly switch between home screens for Search, Facebook, Skype, Weather, Photo Slideshow and many more.3) I also love Windows Mobile.  The phone can do almost anything.  All of the features of the most advanced smartphone are available; MMS, Video recording, File Explorer, Micro SD Card, Cut & Paste, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth and the best Exchange E-Mail integration available.4) Although the OS is a bit dated, there are thousands of third party applications developed for it that anything it cannot do out of the box can easily be added to the device via third party software.  A couple of applications I could not do without are SPB Mobile Shell, eWallet, Google Maps, Astraware Solitaire, Opera Browser, Live Search, WMWifiRouter not to mention the native Microsoft Office applications -- Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint.  All of these applications run perfectly on the Xperia X1.5) The only things I'd like to see changed on the device are a bigger screen and improved keyboard.  The screen size is 3.0 inches and I'd prefer 3.2 or 3.5 inches.  The keyboard is made of flat steel keys in a small form factor that my fingers slide to easily over.There's much more to the phone than I can give credit to in this forum, but I have been using Windows Mobile phones for about 9 years and find the SE Xperia X1a the best yet.  The phone also comes with extended service and support that blows away anything offered from competing manufacturers.  Check out [...] for more info.
I purchased this pocket PC to replace my iPAQ 6945 because I wanted a higher resolution screen, the sliding keyboard & more convenient size and design.  The Xperia is a well built, high quality machine with a metal case.  The computer and internet capabilities are my primary concern but the telephone & messaging systems are very good.  The blue tooth tied in flawlessly with the on-board telephone controls in my BMW and uploaded my address book to the car.  It has superior signal reception and connected into my AT&T; hi-speed wireless network without a problem.  Same with the WiFi networks in my office and home.  Activesync works well and it is easy to set up your POP3 email accounts.  This is a very versatile machine with an extensive list of features.  The manual controls allow you to navigate without the stylus and include a touchpad you can use without opening the keyboard.You will not be disappointed.  Be sure and order a case, it doesn't come with one.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE! The phone is sleek and it stands out in a crowd. It is a conversation piece. At least until the X2 debuts:) I like being different and this phone fits w/my personality.BATTERY: I heard there were problems so let me tell you how I dealt w/it. I got the phone and charged it per the instructions. I then let the battery die completely...which it did within 1 day. I charged it and let the battery completely die again. After 2 full charges and draining the battery twice, the life of my battery improved exponentially. My phone can now go 3-4 days using internet, panels, and regular usage.PROS- I love the panels but found the spb mobile shell (which is free) is really the only panel I need. The facebook panel gets some usage as well. I'm going to try the spb mobile 3 and the phone suite and see what it has to offer. I really love all the customizable things you can do with this phone. The spb panels add alot to the X1. I love the Oxford Italian language download which allows me to learn Italian on my own. The battery life is not an issue since I did the steps mentioned above. Connectivity is not a problem and the programs run flawlessly. I love google maps and used it to find my way home after getting lost. It was a life saver since I was in another state. I have had no problems w/the camera or taking pictures. I found that by using mobile windows device on my laptop, I can go into my phone & storage card and put pics, music and anything else where I want it to be including making new folders if needed. Making videos has been fun and the quality is great! The picture quality is amazing w/ or w/o the flash.If you are going to get the phone get the spb mobile shell...it brings the phones best qualities to light and puts them at the touch of your finger w/o tons of searching. I LOVE THIS phone. I haven't registered this phone on the AT&T; network but haven't had any dropped calls. That says alot since some of my classes are underground where lots of people get dropped calls. The only deadspots I experienced were in the backwoods of Tx somewhere between Houston & Hooks. But I've been told the moment I register my phone, it'll be on the 3G network and will work in more places. The phone shows I am on an "H" network. The sound quality is good.CONS- For most people the price is a con but since I keep a good phone for 6-9 years, it is not overpriced. It does not have yahoo IM. I hate that there is no "vibrate during appointments" profile like the HTC Touch Pro because I have to remember to turn off my phone when I go to class.  You cannot turn off the SMS notification for sending messages which can be annoying. You can only see the weather for 1 city and the forecast only goes to 4 days. It only has 3 alarm clocks to be set. The font is small but it can be changed using the spb free mobile sheeHowever, I think most of these things can be fixed w/spb downloads (weather, travel, time, diary, etc which are mostly available for a 15 trial period). The keyboard is a little weird at first. It actually hurt my fingers during the first week on use. The keys are almost flushed w/the keyboard and the keys are kinda small for my big fingers but after a week these become minor, if noticeable, points.I'm not sure if I covered everything about the X1. If I can think of anything else, I will definitely write back. I'll write another review after the trial period has ended for spb mobile 3 & sbp phone suite.This phone is worth the money and is AWESOME!!!!! The cons aren't and shouldn't keep anyone from purchasing but beware...the X2 is on its way:)
This Phone is called in many forums of WinMo products and hacking as the king of the hill. Maybe because is simply the most integral of them all.It has EVERYTHING, i mean, theres nothing missing from it. Dont listen to that guy telling you not to buy it because of his singular problem which i says everybody has. The screen and its resolution is awesome (it stablished it as an Standard for newer WM Phones) Its keyboard, nice! Software, well asides from the standard WM OS, includes the great panel interface, and in the Windoes world there is always the most detailed customization with programs and panels like SPB Shell, or custom roms fusing both Panels and HTC TouchFlo3D.Camera issuper sharp on daylight and works just great.Im not really in the mood to write an extensive review for this for you could easily serach for reviews on many of the major WM sites ([...]) and realize the SEX1 is on of the best phones ever in both in its classical Windows office view and uses, and Media overall!And it also is the prettiest of them all! rare thing huh?
Perfect phone for me .. unlike iphone.customize your home menu. display all of em (calender, msg, bla bla bla) unlike iphone you have to press every app icon.Window media player. able to transfer my zune subscription songs!! love it.MSN messenger!love the camera !!!!.Stylish, unique and not so common to see ppl to use xperia which is cool.love it when everything that involve microsoft are connected into one device (MSN, hotmail, live or bing, window media player, calender, microsoft office)
My Sony X1a continued to lock up and become unresponsive after one week.I returned it for repair and was told it had moisture damage and the warranty was voided .No one pays that much money for a phone and allow it to get wet.After doing some searching on the internet  every X1a phone was having the same moisture  problem . That`s their way of voiding you warranty no matter what problem you`re having with your phone.Buy this phone at your own risk their customer service suck.
I've had this phone for about a month now and it hasn't failed me yet. If you have the money, you should definitely buy this phone. It not only looks great but it looks great and it also performs well. I would rather have this phone than an Iphone. My friends even ask me: "Where'd you get that phone?" "what is that phone?"All in all, i give this phone 3 thumbs up =)
Es un excelente producto, la compra fue sencilla y trabaja perfectamente en las bandas de varios paises.
i bought this phone because of the reviews it got, 1st i do like having a unlocked phone, but being a at&t; customer, let me tell you there is NO support from them, every single problem i had with the phone, i had to Google or find answers online. Don't believe the hype even Sony would not help me, all they kept saying is contact your service provider, and my "service provider" said call Sony. Across the globe there is a lot of support i.e "hacking, modding" but in America there is none, Sony turned there back on this phone to support the new Xperia x2. even most of the panels you can download are for Europe, or they say coming soon. (that was over 4 months ago). The support for this phone state side is hard to find. This phone has some cool features, but get old after about an hour, and a lot of the "panels" don't even work
Always losing connection with bluetooth, or static when using bluetooth headset.Constantly losing connecting tethering using bluetooth.Activesync suddenly doesn't work and has errors without explanation.Low volume probably due to tiny speaker.Slow when switching between sliding modes.  This I can live with, the above, not practical for use.Phone calls are great! (sound, signal)  It's a cool $700+ PHONE.  Definitely not a SMART phone.
The phone is nothing special. No battery life on the screen; the volume is low and the interface of the key pad for phone call is just not user freindly. The phone will go off for no reason. I am very unhappy with this phone. I won't get it even if it is $200, and I paid for 700!
Great phone. Camera is awesome and has many functions. Keyboard is a little hard on the fingers, but not a big enough reason to not get the phone. If you want to only use the wifi for internet, edit the "connect using" under the internet settings from connections. Edit the fields to nonsensical values, so it fails when trying to connect through the phone network. This will avoid you expensive data overages.Awesome phone, I got because I needed a camera as well. The internet browser can be finicky so just get opera mini.
This phone is great, I have been using it for a month, I upgraded from a Sony Ericsson k800i and it was well worth the upgrade! It might be more expensive than other similar phones, but the image quality is astounding. If you are used to Sony Ericsson, the menus and navigation will seem like a breeze.The only problem I see in this phone is that the navigation buttons are not very durable, so you might run into some problems with a lot of usage, also I have not gotten the included GPS to work (Google Maps does work though).Bottom line, if you take a lot of pictures, this is the best camera phone ou will find, amazing xenon flash, manual exposure control, smile shutter and all other features that come in SE digital cameras.
I have been using this phone for 2 weeks now and I find the picture quality of the camera is not so great for 8MP. I compared it with picture I took using my another Nokia E75 having 3.2MP camera and quality of both are same. Moreover, Zoom in C905 is pathetic. If I zoom more than 30%, image distorts. If I zoom full picture looks like dipped in water. Other features are ok.Update : I have been using this phone for 4 months now and the middle(click) button got stuck. It does not work. I bought the phone to India and Sony Ericcson India won't service it free as it was not bought here. Phone did not have US Warranty either. Now I have to spend more money on this phone to get this problem fixed.
This camera takes excellent photos, as promised.  The reception on the phone is also very good.  I like the interface better than any Windows Mobile phone I've used.  However, this phone does not have the synching capabilities of a Blackberry.  With 2000 contacts in my outlook on my PC, this phone won't synch them...  "too many contacts."  Also, accessing the calendar is a pain, ... 3 menu screens.  That just isn't right.The standard smartphone capabilities are an afterthought on this phone.  Camera + Phone, yes!  Calendars and contacts?  No!
I got the C905A AT&T; locked phone.  (I will get AT&T; to unlock this phone in two years when its contract is up.)The phone and camera is fun.The instructions are deplorable.  Someone fired any talent they might have had in the instruction manual department for sure!  Maybe this is a result of meddling by "the NEW AT&T;", I dont know but someone made an unholy mess of the owner's manual.  Undefined terms, sloppy wording that is inaccurate, features not mentioned and other features with major subfeatures missing.  For example there is no mention of MP3 anywhere in the manual and yet you can load songs with ease and the phone will play them.  Instructions for operation of the volume control is wrong.  Reference to "hands free" which term they dont bother to define:  "plug in the hands free" to make an antenna for the FM.For the big money they ask for this phone I am disappointed.
A friend of mine gave me this phone (Kyocera K126C), since she got herself another cell phone. It is a very easy to use phone. Single piece phone does not slide or flip. This is a nice phone to have for people who don't want a lot of fancy features. Very compact, and with TracFone, you can add as many minutes as you like to the phone. No contracts, cancellation fees, surprises, etc. You're in control. This phone would be highly recommended to anybody who is in need of a simple cell phone with excellent service, but without a lot of fancy features.
At first glance, the Prada phone looks like a great buy.  Slide out keyboard and responsive touch screen.  The interface is really pretty and for a user who doesn't customize their phone much, it probably works ok.  It's in the details though that has me tearing my hair out and trying to resell it on ebay.1) As far as I can tell, the contacts don't import automatically from Microsoft Outlook.  You have to go through some *.csv conversion which is a pain.  **Anyone know differently, please let me know via this forum!**2) User interface is not stable, it's rebooted on me at least 5x in the past month when I'm doing random simple things like making a phone call.3) They like their sounds too much and I can't figure out how to turn them off in normal mode!  (i.e. sliding the keyboard in/out has a ringtone, which when you're trying to discreetly text, and you don't want your phone in silent mode, at dinner/meeting is impossible!)4) The battery runs down relatively fast compared to my old Nokia n95, or maybe I'm just in bad reception areas a lot which impact my battery life?I would assume a lot of these *features* would be fixed via software upgrade but I don't plan to wait around.
After having the Prada 1 and liking it, I paid almost $500 for this phone. I went through 3 brand new Prada II phones and they all were defective. The longest use I got from one of them was a couple weeks. I had to pay to ship the phones back and long story short, I ve paid out $30 and have nothing to show for. LG did not want anything to do with US customers, even squaretrade cancelled the warranty when I tried to use it when it broke again. The physical elements of this phone are beautiful, but I would not waste your money, youll wind up spending more send it back. IT freezes all they time, restarts on its own, and eventually it will just not turn back on. Many many people have the same problem but LG will not take responsibility since they werent made here, but yet they market it as an international phone. I never write review but feel that I go so ripped off that I want to prevent anyone from making the same mistake.
This is a beautiful phone, nice interface for normal use. However, since the phone didn't come with warranty, and the fact that I got a minor defect in the screen that there's a red dot that doesn't dissappear, and also LG is not known for their quality, I had to return it. The battery after charging last me 3 days with non heavy use.
I bought the original LG Prada (KE850) as a birthday gift my wife last year.  It was a very fashionable and stylish looking phone, which my wife (in her early 30s) loves, but the reception and the missing 850Mhz band left something to be desired on the AT&T; wireless network, which is reasonable as this phone was never intended for the US market.  It would probably work better on T-Mobile US network (since they don't use 850 band).  We ended up returning it because of that.  Mind you, the software on this phone is very simple and basic, which is perfect for my wife since she hardly text and rarely used anything else.I was excited when the Prada II is announced and it comes with quad-band this time (however, 3G would only work outside of US)!  However, I was disappointed as soon as I found out they decided to add a slide-out QWERTY keyboard.  Seeing in person (at CES) how much thicker the new phone turned me off.  It has gained 40% in thickness (16.8mm versus the older but slimmer 12mm Prada I) and slightly taller than the old phone (quarter inch).  The "Ooze" factor of the original Prada phone is gone.  This new phone would be a good choice for these who texts often but doesn't want another me-too looking phones.  However, for my wife, the weight-gain is a deal-breaker.UPDATE:  I did ended up buying this phone for my wife to use on AT&T; wireless, as she doesn't have data plan and don't want to pay an extra $30/month, the iPhone doesn't make sense.  This works well for her since she only calls and texts, but due to reception and call dropping issues (which might just be AT&T;), we are shopping for a new replacement phone.
I bought the LG Prada 1 when it first came out in 2006 and she absolutely loved it. This lead me to buy her the new version of it for her birthday one month ago and she said LG has completely revamped the phone and corrected most of the negative points the first Prada had and she is very happy with it.
I buy this phone for my girlfriend and she have general good comments and a few badsThe Good: The 5 Mega Pixel LG Prada II camera can take vibrant color and high quality photos in sunny day but average in night, also you can edit,crop,rotate, and add text and logos to the photos. The second camera (VGA) can be turned on for self photos.The phone have good 3D Interface and responsive Touch screen very close to iphone.The bad: The phone have random restarts, this was solved by changing 2G only network, the 3G network is only for Euro, so you no need both networks function.The WiFi not always can be connected and the Internet browser lose connection on a few min of use, poor ringtones (solved by transfer a few mp3)
The phone KF900 looks great, but this phone have a SEVERAL ISSUES with the SO, it get freeze and NEVER coming back. i have to return, at least integron tech have a great customer care.**I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE NEVER EVER**HAPPY DAY!
When I set out to buy my first smartphone, I wanted one that supported a lot of applications -- That's why you buy a phone that does more than make calls, after all.  I picked the Dash because it runs the same operating system as Pocket PCs, which have been around for years.  This means the Dash can run all of the programs that were made for Pocket PCs, allowing you to choose from thousands of games, office apps, music players, video players, and tons more.The phone is quite easy to use, and the keyboard feels great.  Overall, I've been extremely happy with the Dash, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good smartphone for a low price.
I bought this phone because it is the only phone T-Mobile carries that is compatible with Mobilespeak, a screenreader for cell phones. I went blind a year ago, and did not have an accessible phone. After installing Mobilespeak, the Dash became fully accessible. I can now text again, though on the full keyboard, its taken some getting used to doing it blind. The 5 key is the D key, so there is a raised bump there which helps me find my place. I have the sounds all routed through my blue tooth, even the screenreader, so I have privacy for texting and so the computerized voice does not annoy people. I get baseball text alerts too. The sound quality is excellent, and all my calls are crystal clear.The design is slim which is comfortable for holding, but doesn't work so well if the need arises to prop the phone on my shoulder. There is a touch strip on the side  of the screen to adjust volume during calls, but I prefer the old buttons on the side of the phone to do this.The internet works well and is fairly fast. I don't know if it is the screenreader, or the fact that it is a Windows phone, but it tends to freeze if I go too fast. Popping the battery out resets it, and this is easy to do even though I can'tsee.The windows on the phone open and close like a Windows computer and they are easily navigated.All in all, I like it, but mostly because of the screenreader I have installed. I do like the audio quality though; it is better than my old Samsung flip phone.
I purchased my phone two years ago and love it.  I love the calendar feature and the full keyboard.  A couple of months ago I dropped it and the LCD screen cracked! (I have a snap on cover but it was not on at the time) I didn't want another phone, I wanted my phone!  So instead of paying for a new phone, I ordered a brand new LCD screen with the tools and I replaced it myself! I spent about $37.00 for the new screen vs.$200 to $300 plus for a new phone!  That is how much I love mine. Incidentally, I just ordered two new snap on covers....as I just dropped it again yesterday...with the cover ON and all was fine!! I highly recommend this phone.
This is a reliable phone.  Has bluetooth, wifi, instant messaging, windows media player, and a list of other features.  Qwerty keypad allows for quick, precise texting.
This is the worst phone ever made. You cannot hear anything unless you line up the slit in the handset to the exact center of your ear. The implementation of Windows Mobile is deplorable: you can't even locate contacts by typing the name; you have to dismiss reminders in order to log into the device...and if it gets stolen, the thief will see your calendar items. The volume control doesn't work at all. Because it isn't a touch screen you will be locked out of Outlook Notes. The screen is too small: you can only see one calendar item per day and it always displays the item that you don't want to see (if there are multiple items at the same time). HTC, in their state of denial, did not put a reset button on it, but it MUST be reset every few days or you will not get any emails.I could go on and on...AVOID THIS PHONE AT ALL COSTS!
I have been using HTC Touch HD for more two months now and I'm generally happy with it.My previous phone is O2 Atom Life with Intel XScale® PXA 270 Processor at 624 MHz, it's really fast. I don't know why newer phones generally only have 528 MHz speed, you would expect newer phones to have faster specs. But anyway, the main weakness of O2 is that it hangs and freezes A LOT. Averagely, I have to reset the phone twice a day. The phone signal is also not the strongest.I got Samsung Omnia i900 to replace O2 and immediately gave it to my husband after 3 days of use. He was using Nokia so didn't really feel the difference, but for me the speed and touch screen sensitivity of Omnia is way below O2. I love the big screen, color, and design, but just can't stand the less sensitive screen (although it has improved with the newly released official ROM).Finally, I tried the HTC Touch HD, which has better speed and touch screen sensitivity, not the best, but acceptable. Undeniably, I think that currently, iphone has the best touch screen speed and sensitivity (I don't own one, but have played around with my friend's). However, I still decided to stick with Windows Mobile system as I use the Office application quite often and I like to be able to easily sync data with my computer. I also like the freedom to customize/tweak my phone according to my likes.I use cooked ROM with the new contact list and dialer (Topaz/Rhodium based), which has better interface and features such as linking contacts to facebook friends. The Full QWERTY input is also better and easier to type.My main usage of the phone is to make calls (of course), messaging, calendar, reading e-book, word and excel for inputting data, surfing the net when traveling. I don't really use the music player, movie, stock, and email function.Here are my experiences so far:- System is quite stable. It has never hang/freeze so far. It also doesn't lag. When I have too many programs opened or didn't soft reset for days, then sometimes there might be 3 seconds or so delay when changing from one program to another. But the problem is usually solved when I soft reset or close all those opened programs.- Touchscreen sensitivity and speed is good. Although it does take a while for first time touch-phone user to get the hang of how much pressure to use, gestures, etc.- Text input is also great. As I mentioned I love the new full qwerty keyboard. It's very easy to type and I make very little typing mistake.- Quality of call and signal is good. It's very clear, no noise/disturbance.- The display is beautiful. Very nice and crisp color. It's much better than Samsung Omnia's display. I compared them side by side and Omnia's display and color appeared to be more blurry type.- Camera and video quality is just average, no flash. They are very plain. Not too many special features. You can take good quality picture/video under good lighting condition, but nothing too exciting.- The speaker for music playing is just average. It's probably not as good as Sony Ericson's music-phone.- Battery life is good. For average usage (making calls, texting) it can last around 3 days (this is with the cooked ROM) and I always turn off the data connection at night. I've read that with original ROM it could last up to 5 days (depending on usage of course).
This phone hasn't been released in the U.S. but is very popular in Europe and Asia.  It's very clean and the screen is the best I've seen in a device (much better than the iPhone).  It is unlocked which means it can work with most, though not all, carriers and no contract.  It also has windows mobile 6.1 as it's base so it can run thousands of applications which is much more diverse and deep than other phone platforms.  The cons to be are a lack of a d-pad (for gaming) and the inability to make many tweaks (you actually can do many tweaks but need third party apps which are free but require finding and installing them) and they could have bumped up the processor speed (though it's still faster than the iPhone).  The memory, especially RAM is awesome.  Personally, I would also liked to have seen a CF or SD (or both) card slot (has a MicroSD slot).  It's about the sam size and feel as an iPhone.
I bought the Touch HD in November 2008, after some frustration with the 1st gen Iphone. On the positive side, I've got to say this is one of the most complete handsets available on the market, it has almost everything a smartphone could have: GSM quad band, 3G, wifi, large 3.8" display  with WVGA resolution of 480x800 pixels. [...]However after 6 months of use I have to say the phone disappointed and I don't recommend it for these reasons: 1.- Windows Mobile. Microsoft has to do something about its mobile OS soon, or eventually it'll die, period. I'm not a fan of any particular mobile OS, I've used most of them, and believe me Microsoft is being left behind. It doesn't matter how great the hardware is on the phone, the OS is still slow and it's simply not designed for finger-touch operation. HTC does a good job with its Touch Flow interface, but it's only a mask, in the end it's all about windows mobile 2.- Crappy camera for pictures and video.  The camera is just too slow to focus and take photos, and video quality is mediocre. 3.- Video playback. HTC didn't include a propietary video player, so it just relies on Windows Mobile Media Player which, to be honest is even worse than the desktop version. Besides, the only clips that plays (MP4 with H.264) have the potential for good quality but are choppy if they are in high resolution (over 640 pixels wide), needed for this screen. So if you are planning to use this phone as a personal media player (PMP) for watching movies and/or videos because of its big screen, you'll be disappointed. 4.- Resistive Touchscreen, meaning it reacts to pressure rather than touch like the iPhone. If you have used an iphone you'll be wondering if there's something wrong with the screen. Let's face it: most people will consider this phone because they want something like the Iphone. Now I want to clarify that I'm not an Apple fanboy, but to be honest, the user experience is superior on the Iphone. In my opinion, Windows Mobile 6.1 is to blame.5.- Price is very high. Sure, it comes with almost everything, but you can get better phones for much less.[...]
If you are a Windows Mobile user, buy this phone, if you are not you may face some problems shifting to WM environment, I have this phone from Feb 2009, and I love it, you can have a hell of great support and free software on expert sites like [...] and [...]Technically speaking, this phone has some great features like Great LCD wow, and it's touch sensibility and large internal memory (not storage: it's a MicroSD) and there are some drawbacks which I consider minor like the lack of hardware buttons, the speaker is on the back side, and of course, don't expect much from it's camera even if it's 5MP, it's just gives you fine picture not the best.Anyway, I gave this phone 5 Starts because, really it rocks.if you are looking for more intensive review see this link[...]
The HTC Touch HD is HTC's finest Windows Mobile phone yet. A slim casing houses a large, responsive VGA screen. But it's not just about looks because inside this attractive phone lies the heart of a beast. GPS, HSDPA, Wi-Fi and a 3.5mm headphone jack make for a very smart phone.It's an amazing mobile.I got this as a gift and it is totally worth it. The only thing that is missing is the flash for the camera but the pictures are really great.thanks
I bought this PPC as I got very good reference from my brother. The product in my hands exceeded the expectations, although I was familiar with HTC products before too (I had qtec s200) 3 years ago.so, the product is great, the only compatative disadvantage with Iphone for me is the slower response rate of the touch-screen.the rest is just excellent
I bought it it instead of an I Phone. Big mistake! There is a lot of problems regarding the synchronization and the contact screen doesn't show up. I have to reset it 3 to 4 times before it works properly! HTC's support is a disaster. They keep asking me to do useless things and nothing works ! If you accept a suggestion: buy another brand !
With this device, I believe Sony Ericsson has reach the logical conclusion of the "race for the better camera phone."  Other devices already exceed 8 megapixels, but why bother?  the files sizes are already huge and no one really appreciates files this large being sent to them.  All of my complaints about this device are about it's cellphone capabilities...  Thus, i tell friends this is a great camera with an OK phone built in...Advantages:  beautiful photos and nice video.  Plenty of storage for both on the device.  the phone's processor is quick and the phone displays the pictures nicely.disadvantages:  awkward phone keys (hard to push;  horrible to text if you are used to buttons and/or QWERTY);  the SE interface for downloading to your PC is awkward at best.
Excellent cellphone. It's got all i want in a phone. Excellent camera, wi-fi, gps, everything works great. Definitively an excellent option. Totally satisfied.
Well my Blackberry Pearl 8110 that I have had for 5 months is going in the garbage.  The constant rebooting during phone calls has become intolerable over the last 3 weeks. When I inquired I was told that it is "outdated" but upgrading to a new Blackberry bold would solve the problem. (Sounds like a marketing ploy but I have no choice)  My local store that carries these took my name.  I had to go on a waitng list for the next shipments of phones due to the amount of Blackberry Pearl 8110 people have replaced over the last month, they sell the upgraded phone as fast as they get them in.If you choose to purchase, print out these steps and memorize them, you will be doing this during all the random reboots that occur several times a day.  If you think it won't happen to you, at work I immediately found several people who were getting rid of this phone, and several who were forced to get rid of it and replace it at their own cost due to this problem over the last week.This will be your life with this phone:Anywhere from 5-10 minutes into a phone call, it will reboot for 5 minutes, works for two minutes then turns off and reboots again.  Then about the 4th cycle, it doesn't come back on, the red light flashes except it is otherwise dead.  Take the battery out put it back in and it will come on and reboot for another 5 minutes.  Maybe you can talk for 5 minutes and the next reboot begins, your call is dropped, it has a red flashing light and dead phone, take the battery out and put it back in and watch the dead phone flash the red light (they only thing that works) for better than 5 minutes until it comes on and reboots again.  Today it did this for 35 minutes where I was unable to use it for the entire 35 minutes.  For someone who travels in by myself, I can't have a phone that talks to the mothership more than me.  It has definitely gotten worse over the last 3 weeks.  Sometimes it will work OK for a couple of hours but it is unpredictable.  It otherwise works great.  I even turned the data off before I make a call and turn it off and on thinking it will be happy and work for more than 10 minutes.WRONG!  I do not have the time to spend a day making phone calls and replacing this phone and neither did anyone else I found when we compared notes.
i have been using this phone for the past 4 months in south africa, and it works perfect on our networks. the gps, graphic and internet capabilities are brilliant to say the least. the only problem is when you are changing the SIM Card, the slot tends to be too tight hence taking out your SIM Card can be a mission otherwise i give it a thumbs up!
i did my first blind electronic purchase with this blackberry and i cannot complain at all. mobile came with usb cable, and charger. i really wasn't expecting to get the blackberry the way it came. it's really beautiful and i already used it with different numbers in usa and europe.
The product was categorised as 'new' but on receipt I discovered it is 'refurbished'. This was disappointing.I felt cheated.
Well at First i thought when the seller said it was "Refurbished" i thought it was working like brand new.When i got the Phone in my Hands, it was been giving trouble from day one.Till i had to get the phone flashed. its working ok since then but i had to pay an additional $150USD to Flash it.And it still freezes up from time to time.I know now in future don't buy a refurbished phone just by a new one.
I got this phone for Christmas and have had no problems with it. It works like a dream! I text message alot and this makes it real easy and fast! It's a definite upgrade from my crappy ( as in it no longer rings or vibrates and takes thirry minutes for me to get a message, if the mesdage comes through at all) Motorola Razor. I LOVE my new Blackberry 8110 Pearl! So far so good!
i will never ever purchase this item again as i purchased this item as a gift but unfortunately it ruined my happiness .I wanted the cellphone to send to india to my nephew as a gift but it ruined his happiness too i said him that i will be sending the phone blackberry pearl 8110 i didnot open the box and the phone was not factory sealed as described by the customer care when it reached india my nephew said that the phone is diffrent and the model is 8120 not 8110 and he also said that the phone is having scrathes on the back where we fit the battery he didnot use the phone yet and he didnot insert the battery and its not having the user manual too... i got angry when i listened about this thats the reason i will never purchase again as i wanted to purchase many models but unfortunately i cant i you want contact me regarding this contact me at 1404-494-6140.
It was't the right color it says titanium but it really was black, otherwise it arrive on time and the keyboard is a little bit unconfortable.
Excelent Product, but he send me a black one, but it was ok, i still like it a lot!
Bought this phone for my Mom, works great for her, plenty of features, nice keyboard, nice & loud, seems to get good reception too.The only thing I don't like is the 'Rogers' branding on the phone & embedded within the display. I'd give it 9 out of 10 rating.
Excellent product. Was a gift for our daughter and she's extremely happy with it. As all blackberry products, high quality and at a reasonable good price. Just the shipment should be slightly faster.
I enjoyng my bb cel phone that i bought for my wife brithday
This is a great piece of hardware. For comparison, I've got it's older brother the W800i and also an iPhone next to it. The X1 is nicely built, there's no doubts about the quality, no "cheap bits" here.The screen is fantastic, though to be honest, due to the UI/software, it's not easy to see the difference between this and the iPhone (lower resolution) screen until you hit the websites and see the difference in readability of small fonts.The keyboard, while solid, is not great. But that's probably because I'm expecting too much from a phone. It's still better than the iPhone virtual keyboard (for me). I think I will get used to the keyboard, it's okay. The only glitch is that it can be hard to hit the top row of keys sometimes because the screen doesn't quite slide out far enough.Now to the griping:- Startup time sucks, it's like over 1 minute while the iPhone and older W800i are ready to go in about 20 sec (that's before even the SE logo disappears from the X1). On the flip side, I guess one never expects to have to turn it off...- Inconsistent response times. Some have complained about the "lag" in UI. Most of the time it's okay, but occasionally, something takes so long to respond, you think you haven't clicked it. The old iPhone is solid, always consistent and fast.- Windows Mobile is NOT made for finger touch screens. That much becomes painfully obvious very quickly. The stylus is there for a reason. This is my first Windows Mobile device after years of other cell OS's and it's not leaving a good impression.- Navigation: The optical d-pad in the center works well, but is very sensitive, so takes time to get used to. The d-pad buttons work okay, except the lip in the screen makes it hard to use the "up" button, so I stuck to the optical.The Panels are a good idea. If they could spit out more of them, they could almost hide most of Windows Mobile and it would be a GOOD thing. As it is, they need to work out some kinks in performance and useability.As for calls ... well, what's to complain about? 1 hard button to take you to the calling screen where you just punch in the numbers. It works, no fuss.Right now, I don't regret buying this phone. Not yet anyways. However, I'm not sure I would give it a clear recommendation either, not for this price. Hopefully SE will work out some of the kinks in the near future.iPhone still provides a MUCH better experience, and the old W800 was good too, missing only WiFi and keyboard (else I would've stuck with it).
Pros: Excellent Product. Very customizable because of windows mobile 6.1. it runs very stable and looks great(I'm running the HTC Touch HD Rom on this phone). I've received many compliments on how good it looks.Cons: Price(Looks justifies price)
excelente producto, diseño muy elegante, cuando se los mostre a unos conocidos , que tienen blackberrys, me pidieron que se los vendiera..love my phone!
I ORDERED THIS PHONE EVEN I KNOW IS A GOOD PHONE THE SELLER DONT TELL IT DOES NOT WORK IN SOUTH A MERICA, IT SAYS IS UNLOCKET BUT DONT WORK, IS NOT GOOD THAT YOU HAVE THESE KIND OF PRODUCTOS IN AMAZON
The samsung glyde did have a gimmicky touchscreen at first, but with the BI29 software, this enhanced the touchscreen to make it as great as the iPhone. Also, if you buy this phone with the software update, then you will be able to take better pictures, videos, have better internet connection, and et higher quality music. I highly recommend this to someone who is a teenager, since I am one myself.
I purchased the Glyde as part of my Verizon plan, and at first was quite pleased with it.  It has lots of features in a nice compact body, especially for a phone with a full QWERTY keypad.  However, once starting to use the phone, I found it more and more frustrating.  The features that it does have are difficult to use and the software that it runs is very badly designed.My first Glyde died after about 6 months and Verizon replaced it with another.  The new one, I've now had about another six months and at least once a day the touchscreen either locks up or always registers a "lower right-hand corner" touch, regardless of where I touch (or sometimes, even if I have no contact with the screen at all).  Power-cycling the phone usually but not always temporarily halts this.As of Oct 2008, Verizon halted all Glyde sales and pulled this from their stores for an unspecified "issue"; it has not been seen since.
This phone is a piece of crap. I've had it since Christmas, and after Day 3 I figured something was wrong.The touch screen is heat sensitive so god forbid you have it in your pocket and go to use it. It gets so confused. If the phone is warm in any way, any touch on the screen will register as hitting the bottom menu or the back button depending which screen you're at. It's extraordinarily frustrating. And, really, I don't want my phone to beep at me when it's done charging. Of course, I have to charge it often because it won't hold a microsecond of time. My previous phone could hold a charge for six days while this goes for three if I'm lucky and don't bother it. That backlight eats up battery like you wouldn't believe, and it loves to light up.The sound on it is way to quiet even on full blast so I often miss calls even when it's right next to me or in my pocket or purse. Even the vibrate is too soft so I sometimes miss calls despite it being in my pocket.Really, there are two things I like about it: The keyboard and the little hole in the corner where I can hang my dangly cell phone straps.Not worth your time or anyone else's time. No wonder they pulled this junk off the shelf.
I bought the Touch HD in November 2008, after some frustration with the original Iphone. On the positive side, I gotta say this is one of the most complete handsets available on the market, it has almost everything a smartphone could have: GSM quad band, 3G, wifi, large 3.8" display,  WVGA resolution 480x800 pixels. However after 6 months of use I have to say the phone disappoints and I don't recommend it for these reasons: 1.- Windows Mobile. Microsoft has to do something about its mobile OS soon, or eventually it'll die, period. I'm not a fan of any particular mobile OS, I've used most of them (Symbian, Palm, Blackberry, Apple), and believe me Microsoft is being left behind. It doesn't matter how great the hardware is on the phone, the OS is still slow and it's simply not designed for finger-touch operation. HTC does a good job with its Touch Flow interface, but it's only a mask, in the end it's all about Windows Mobile 2.- Crappy camera for pictures and video. The camera is just too slow to focus and take photos, and video quality is mediocre. 3.- Video playback. HTC didn't include a propietary video player, so it just relies on Windows Mobile Media Player which, to be honest is even worse than the desktop version. Besides, the only videoclips that the phone plays (MP4 with H.264) have the potential for good quality but are choppy if they are in high resolution (over 640 pixels wide), needed for this screen. So if you are planning on use this phone as a personal media player (PMP) for watching movies and/or videos because of its big screen, you'll be disappointed. 4.- Resistive Touchscreen, meaning it reacts to pressure rather than touch, like the iPhone. If you have used an iphone before, you'll be wondering if there's something wrong with the screen. Let's face it: most people will consider this phone because they want something like the Iphone. Now I want to clarify that I'm not an Apple fanboy, but to be honest, the user experience is superior on the Iphone. In my opinion, Windows Mobile 6.1 is to blame. 5.- Price is very high. Sure, it comes with almost everything, but you can get better phones for much less.
I've owned this phone 9 months now with daily use. The battery is still strong and holds its charge just like it did new. I'm not crazy about the Opera browser being default; I always open IE if I need internet rather than clicking on links. The pic quality is great close range with good lighting otherwise its the same as any other phone cam. I get easily annoyed by the touch screen thus this will be my last touch screen purchase. I bought it for the os so I could run my medical programs, in that respect its great.
I don't like being negative but I was greatly disappointed with this one. First you could tell it had been painted and the LCD cover was re-glued on with grade school glue. The track ball did not even work and was defective as in the ball seem to be very small in the housing, and it also had nicks in the housing. The back battery cover was painted by air brush or some other method because you could see the color had a dripping look like the paint had ran during this process. Just the quality of the plastic from the molding stage you could tell it was not OEM. Very low quality over all. The seller did attempt to resolve the matter but was more worried about shipping and his product than customer service or satisfaction. The only resolution made was them replacing the front housing which the replacement was defective also. I purchased another one from another seller.
This will make your phone look like new, but the frame part looks like it lacks the battery contacts, and in at least the case for my 8320, it appeared that the circuits on the frame part were different (I think it was a lack of the Wi-fi antenna), but otherwise beyond the fact that you need a T5 and T6 star take your phone apart, for the money it's a decent deal.
This was the best thing that I bought yet for my blackberry curve 8310 and I bought alot of extras for it. I will tell you for this price you can't beat it if you are looking to make your phone look different or just new again. This product made my blackberry look like it did when I opened the box for the first time. This product is well worth the money and very easy to install long as you have the right tools (torx 5,6 and a small pry tool) it took me about 10 minutes all together to disasemble and put it all back together. I'm so happy that I bought this now it should make my phone last another year or two without having to buy a whole new phone.
I purchased this product so I could repair my brand new Blackberry curve 8320, which accidently I dropped scratching the case pretty badly.  All the pieces are 100% from Blackberry, and are really easy to replace.  Your Curve 8320 will look like new again.
Great product, works great easy to install, and has a good fit, the reason that i gave the review a 4 is the pictures of the product show 2 tools that are included, but the description of the product does not list the tools, well naturaly i assumed that the tool was included, so ither the photos are wrong or the tools werent shipped..... but the product its self is a great product my phone looks brand new and the sound quality of the new speakers is crystal clear as well
Weel protected to be shipped for that reason received in a vey well condition, more than I expected this is a really complete Kit, just with a litle compliant becouse a requested AT&T; logo and I received T-Mobile logo, but this does not matter compared with the great product I received, highly recommended.
i'd owned the d880 duos before and while it was a great phone it was difficult to use and required some learning to master it; got this one and unfortunately found myself with an instruction manual in french. but it's been quite easy to use has decent battery life and the spare battery provided with it's own charging and carry compartment make this a fine phone plus it looks and feels great  ... touchscreen's  very responsive you never need to use the stylus ... all in all .. great phone  ...  for a great price  ... don't regret buying it one bit and allows me to access both my lines simultaneous using the call hold / call waiting  feature  ... great stuff....
I had the phone for over 4 months and while in hot weather or humid the touch screen acts up and does not respond correctly.  Also with time it gets slower and need to be reset.  Over all is great but mine had this issues
Very poor instruction manual.  Very complicated to use and prepare to dedicate a lot of hours trying to get to know this phone.  It merges the phone books into one, languages are english, Thai and indonesian....forget about european languages.  This phone is not for text mssg lovers.  Overall, I would run away if I knew how complicated this would be.
If you want a good signal dual sim cell phone, you shall choose this Samsung phone. Perfect signal for both sim to talk and access to internet (WAP).Maybe this phone doesn't have wifi or 3G, but the Samsung efforts for a good dual sim has been obtained.I have used a chinese dual sim cell phone, and this phone has a bad quality and bad signal compared with this Samsung D980 cell phone.
I've had the Blackberry Curve 8300 for about a year and a half. It does a lot of things, most of which I haven't had the time to learn. In addition to phone calls, texts, web surfing, and listening to music, I use it for synchronizing MS Outlook's contacts, calendar, memo pad, and tasks between this phone and my desktop PC. Since this phone is for personal use vs. work, I can't synchronize my emails (you need MS Exchange software installed on a server for that). That's one of its downfalls. My old Palm Pilot synchronized emails too.RIM's software does not synch consistently with MS Outlook.  I have to re-configure the synchronization about every 10 times I synch the Curve with Outlook. Once you know how to do it (see instructions below), it only takes a couple of minutes. But it's really annoying. The phone in general is not very intuitive/user-friendly, so I strongly recommend against buying this phone unless you are pretty technically savvy.  And don't bother with the phone's help files - they rarely answer your questions.On the plus side, it is the perfect size and shape for my hands, small purses, and jean pockets.  It is also built very well. I have dropped it on hard surfaces from 4 feet high at least five times and it has survived perfectly -- even when I have to put all the pieces back together. RIM's technical support (which is where I got the synch fix instructions below) is pretty good if you have the patience to navigate their phone system to get to the right person. And you get a native English speaker - yay! The sound quality of phone calls on this phone is excellent.  Texting is a piece of cake - the keyboard rocks.  The web browser works well.INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING MS OUTLOOK AND RIM BLACKBERRY CURVE SYNCH ERRORS:Close Blackberry desktop mgr.Unplug phone.Open Blackberry desktop manager software.Open Synchronize.Configuration tab.Reset configuration.Plug in phone.Configure synch (yes, again).
For the money and as a first time Blackberry owner very happy with this phone.
everything was good the phone arrive excellent, new and in a good condition besides it didn't brought the cd and the hearphones
Bueno me parece que su servicio es fenomenal el equipo llego en buenas condiciones de funcionamiento todos sus accesorios completos el unico detalle que puedo nombrar es que el cd para instalar el desktop software(User Tools Blackberry)no tarjo tales herramientas si no que al colocar el cd en la computadora para tener acseso a estas herramientas en el mismo lo que estaba gravado eran dos peliculas y no el sofware de herramientas de usuario se esta la unica observacion que tengo que hacerles por lo todo muy bienGracias por su atencion
Recomiendo ampliamente este telefono a todas aquellas personas que quieren entrar en la onda BB y que siempre quieren estar conectados, es un equipo muy versatil, tiene de todo.Como punto debil y para los que les interesa podria decir que no posee WiFi.Hola amigos, quiero advertir a todos que esta tienda (vivecelular) vende solo telefonos refurbished (remanofacturados), raparados. Luego de tener el telefono por varios meses, comence a tener problemas (se apagaba constantemente) y lo lleve a un servicio tecnico para su revision, el equipo fue revisado en frente de mi y logre ver a traves del equipo de diagnostico las reparaciones que tenia el telefon en su tarjeta principal.Me siento estafado y muy molesto, pues cuando oferte y compre este articulo, claramente decia que era NUEVO, ademas el precio que pague era el de un BlackBerry NUEVO.Por favor NO COMPREN EN ESTA TIENDA, aunque a travez de amazon les aseguren que el telefono es nuevo, por que solo venden celulares REFURBISHED, REPARADOS.Espero lean mis consejos y nopasen por lo mismo que yo.Saludos.
me enviaron un celular bloqueado, luego les escribi y me dijeron que me devolverian dinero y aceptaron, pero no me devolvieron nada, de paso el dinero que tuve que gastar adicional y el mal rato, son unos estafadores.
got this phone from Radio Shack for $99.RS has a very poor price match policy.more on that later.got 4 of these phones.been using them for 2 weeks now.great phone, great features.i talked to Boost Mobile tech support regarding the walkie-talkie (WT) and bluetooth.i wanted to know if bluetooth will work with WT.got some tech in India with heavy accent.can't understand what she said.next day, i called Boost support again, this time i got a good English speaker with no accent at all!!probably a call center somewhere in the U.S.this time, i wanted to know about the WALKIE-TALKIE (WT) group talk.group talk is not available with Boost.only available with Sprint network, according to the tech.this is confirmed by me after i use the phone for 2 weeks.the phone itself has the feature.so, i assume may be sometime in the short future Boost will add that to their service.this service, of course, depends on the phone feature as well.think of it like bluetooth.some phone has it, some don't.the i776 has all the latest features but some features not supported by Boost Network.WT works fine via bluetooth headset.i use it with Plantronics 510.you need to use the PTT on the phone to transmit.i'm searching for a bluetooth headset that has PTT built-in.if anybody knows, please contact me.last but not least, after i bought this phone from Radio Shack, probably the last time i spend my money there.Radio Shack price is $99.Best Buy open its store next to my house 2 weeks later.i went to BB to check the price and it's $89.Radio Shack cannot do price match.what i have to do is bring the phone in with all the original content in the box, they will do a refund.then, i have to go thru the process of purchasing the phone again for the new price of $89.why not just give me the $10 difference?4 phones, that would be $40 plus tax.they rather loose $400 than to do a price match of $40?this stupid logic of Radio Shack policy is beyond comprehension.if i go thru the trouble of gathering all the pieces and put it back in the box and return them, why do i want to buy anything from them again?anyhow, the phone itself works great.i would not recommend anyone purchasing anything from Radio Shack.it's the same reason i quit buying stuff from CompUSA and Circuit City.guess what happened to those retailers now?and considering RS already filed for bankruptcy, their lunacy price match policy will only drive customers away.any updates available will be on my personal website:sokhaDotCom
I travel frequently back to the UK so this phone works great for me. It is quad-band and GSM phone which means it has a removable sim card that I can use a pay as you go sim card when I go back to the UK, and then switch it back while back in the US. Unfortunately your limited to AT&T; or T-Mobile in the US as the other carriers don't use GSM phones, not sure why?.  The phone itself which I bought in the UK has an adapter for 110/220v for charging in other countries which is a nice touch from LG (I once fried a US adapter by plugging it into a UK socket, duh!). It comes with a screen protector and the casing feels nice and not too cheap. The touch screen itself is bright and easy to navigate and the inclusion of a stylus that fits in the base of the phone makes it very handy when texting. The phone houses a slot for a micro SD card up to 8gb, which is ample for mp3's and photo's or video's. I don't like that you have to use the supplied headphones in order to listen to music as they aren't that good and would have preferred the ability to use third party phones.Camera quality isn't that great, but like most phone cameras the quality is grainy, I only use it rarely as I have a good quality digital camera for that.  Overall it's a great little phone that is considerably cheaper and less bulkier than the i phone. And if you need accessories then eBay is the place to go, I picked up a great leather case that fits perfectly, and a car charger. I have had the phone now for 7 months and am pleased with it so far.Update: I recently flashed the phones firmware to the latest version which is V10n and the phone is so much better.The touch screen works a lot better than before and the slide bar can now be used without having to press hard.The firmware install is a little tricky and can only be done on a windows operating system, but is well worth the time as the phone's performance is so much better. Do a search for KP 500 firmware v10n update.
I live outside the US and the phone worked perfectly with Guatemalan Carriers, it is a great value phone has almos every feature built in other smartphones. the only downside is that it doesnt has wifi, but the browser is very good, you can surf every web page, not only mobile sites.great design not big and bulky like the iphone, its easier to handle when you are speaking.The only downside is that you need to push a litte hard sometimes in order to move things or activate things, i dont know if it is only my case or thats the way the is. I own it now for three weeks and im loving it, and the touchscreen is getting more responsive over time.The phone has a lot of features but at least im gonna mention the ones I like the most.favorite contacts screenit remembers the number you dial or the ones that call you, so it suggests every time you start dialing.nice camerawidgetsgrat music playerup to 8gb micro sdNice phone I highly recommend it.
This is a very nice phone with great features. It has a rubbery feel to it (doesn't scratch easy) and a beautiful screen. However, if you buy it unlocked for U.S. use, the MMS (picture, mp3 messages) will not work! I was surprised. Everything else works though, even text messages. I talked to AT&T; to try to make it work, but after an hour on the phone they said it cannot be done because this unlocked phone is not available in the U.S. Therefore not all features will work. But if you can live without MMS, this phone is awesome.Pros: Clear and bright screen even in direct sunlight, Build quality, Features, Customizable, Built in stylus, Micro SD slot up to 8GbCons: Camera (no auto focus, no flash), small qwerty keyboard, FM radio cant be played without headset attached.
I've had this phone for about a month and a half and I'd say I'm rather disappointed.Pros:The phone is aesthetically pleasingMicro SD card slot is a nice featureRelatively scratch resistantFits in a pocket comfortablyUser Interface is pretty straight forwardExternal speakers sound goodThe drawing feature is funCons:Proprietary LG headphonesTexting is unusable, words disappear when using qwerty keyboard modeWriting with stylus is very difficult, you have to write one letter at a time or it will mash everything you write into one letterIt takes a very long time to turn the camera on, so you can forget about pulling your phone out to snap a quick shot of something before it's goneThe touch screen is unresponsive at timesNo multimedia texting in the USThere are no additional apps you could getDocument reader is not user friendlyThe organizer is very "bare bones"Document reader isn't Office 07 compatibleBattery life is mediocre at bestIt's very expensive considering the lack of featuresI understand that this is an unlocked phone that wasn't made for the US market, but this phone is an absolute shame.  It has some nice features, but the negatives far outweigh the positives.  I knew going into it that there was no multimedia texting capability and that the web browser was shoddy, but I was at least expecting to be able to send a text message quickly.  The proprietary LG headphones are also a pain:  they're uncomfortable, the sound quality is mediocre at best, and their durability is questionable.  Make sure to order an adapter or spare headphones, since mine already broke and I have to wait for new ones to come in.If it wasn't for the fact that the touch screen makes this phone almost unusable, I would have happily given it at least 3 stars.  If you text a lot (or at all), don't buy this phone.
I've had the Cookie for about a month now and I am so happy with my purchase!It was fully charged when I received it and all the mentioned items were in the box, including the charger with adaptor.  I slipped my SIM card in (I have T-Mobile Even More service) and it immediately recognized T-Mobile as the carrier; even shows it onscreen!Spent approximately 20 minutes playing around with the settings as they are organized a bit differently from U.S. phones...for instance, the settings for ring tones are under the "Settings-Profile-Normal" names, not the usual ones we see here.  However, it's pretty easy and the touchpad appears to become more responsive with time as you get used to it.The QWERTY keyboard is great and the accelerometer function works quite well for typing with either [small] fingers or the stylus.  People have received my texts promptly, as I have theirs.  Anyone considering this phone would do well to check the services their provider offers - if you don't have an Internet plan, well, the phone won't surf the 'Net - I say this because I've seen a couple of complaints about that issue.  I don't use my phone for that purpose, just calls and texting, and it's perfectly suited for such.  Also, this is NOT a wi-fi or 3G equipped phone, which again suits my needs but perhaps not others...they'll have to spend a bit more for that and sacrifice battery life.  Speaking of battery life, I am a fairly heavy talker and only charge my phone every 3-4 days - and it charges in less than a couple hours.All in all, if you're patient and like to fiddle with new gadgets as I do, you will LOVE this phone.  The wallpapers, ringtones and games are really great and again, I'm extremely happy with my little Christmas present to myself!
I ordered this phone in Sept, thinking I would be able to browse the internet and access the T-Mobile browser, media player etc. After several failed attempts to open the browser, T-Mobile finally had to send a 'fix' to the phone that would allow internet access, as much access as was possible for this Euro designed phone. I was only able to view some pages but could read my e-mail, that's it. No watching you tube or any videos, no listening to AOL Music or other streaming media. I mentioned this to Vibe Cellular, the internet access problem, they suggested calling t-mobile and LG for assistance, which did help fopr what it was worth. I bought this thinking it was FULLY compatible with T-Mobile...I figured, what the heck, who needs internet anyway...The phone came with a round prong charger (European 50 cycle type), with no adapter. I ordered a separate charger (through Amazon) which didn't fully charge the phone.I also didn't receive the 8gb card which I ordered and paid for. I instead received a 2gb card. Both of these issues were later resolved by Vibe Cellular after I contacted them.When the phone was able to receive a full charge more issues began showing up.The phone locked after appx.15 seconds of being idle. I repeatedly changed the settings to allow 1 minute(this was the longest time available in options), but the phone didn't change, it still locked up after a few seconds. I also had trouble sending and receiving messages. I contacted T-Mobile and thought that the issue was solved after taking appx.  30 minutes and 2 different T-Mobile agents to figure out how to fix it.I couldn't always send messages, sometimes I could but... can't explain other than to say that there was no rhyme or reason for this? I would send a message to someone, be in conversation, then all the sudden an error appeared???I began getting an ERROR 15 notification, maybe a dozen times a day ?I am not sure if all of the notifications were the same because my screen wouldn't unlock in time for me to read them?I only Know that I was constantly hearing the ERROR notification (the ones that I did get to read indicated delivery errors had occured, "message couldn't be sent")I would continually get more notifications asking if I wanted to continue to attempt to 're-send' the message.I hit the 'cancell' option but it didn't do any good. A few minutes later I would see that option again, and more than likely I would 'cancel' again...If you like going in circles, this is the phone for you !!! Also the screen became increasingly harder to 'wake' up or navigate.I would use the stylus because my fingers would sometimes hit the wrong button, even though I calibrated the screen more than once or twice. very frustrating to try to scroll down your contact list when the page won't move with your finger and you end up hitting the wrong contact...this is why I thought the stylus would help, but I was wrong. I would use the stylus to push the 'down' arrow but the screen wouldn't acknowledge the touch...It got to the point that I didn't even attempt to call anyone from the contact list, unless they happened to be on the first page!I guess the phone forced me into memorizing a lot of phone numbers...The screen also required more force to operate. A simple touch wouldn't always work.The new 8gb card was nice. I downloaded a bunch of music. BUT, Here is another issue.I like to set my phone up so that each of my contacts has a different song. The phone allowed this only a small percentage  of the time.I didn't understand that either, since All of the music was in the same format and all appeared to be fine when I editted the ringtones... but when the contact called, a different (default) ring tone would play...but not on every one, some of the sounds I actually applied...yeah...this COOKIE had some big crumbs...Finally.I was working last week when I heard the phone (which was safely stowed in it's protective holster at my side) giving the usual beep alerts, probably ERROR 15, but who knows ???When I was able to I pulled the phone out to check the alerts.To my surprise the LCD front looked very weird with lines all through it.As I put my finger on it to 'wake it' 'unlock it', the screen image looked as if my finger was breaking a glass. There were lines all through it and impossible to read anything !!!The good news is, it still receives calls !!!I contacted Vibe Cellular, but this was their response. (keep in mind that I didn't get the right charger or the larger 8gb card until many weeks after originally receiving this junk phone...It's funny that the ERROR 15, and other ERRORS, didn't really show up until I began using the 'correct' charger which charged the phone 5 x's better that the old one, and added the 8gb card...could this be why they weren't shipped originally?I was at minimum hoping that Vibe Cellular would offer to work out some deal...I mean I spent $[...] on this practically useless peice of garbage...Here is their reply...[...]Sincerely,Izzy
I personally like this phone a lot, but it has some flaws which could be fixed or avoided which I find very annoying.Pro'sOverall this phone is user friendly if you are used to tech like this, it didn't take me long to get used to the way this phone works but then again I am pretty tech-friendly.The phone itself has a lot of customization options, the interface is easy to understand and the touch screen is sensitive enough for you to use your fingers and not the little touch screen pen that follows with the phone.Its a very nice looking phone with a lot of potential.Con'sThe annoying parts of this phone, and why my phone bill keeps getting bigger while I use this phone is that the key lock on the phone keeps unlocking itself while it is in my pocket, the key lock can be opened by touching and holding your finger on the screen for 3 seconds, which it can easily do while in your pocket if you brush up against something. The phone also has a way of phoning people while in my pocket...Another thing about this phone, in case they are thinking about buying this phone, it does not have a keyboard of any sorts, except the touchscreen one. So if you are used to typing things with a touchscreen, go for it.. But for those of you with no experience with this (like me), will take a long time getting used to it.I hope this review helped people, and I apologize for my bad grammar as English is not my first language.
This is my kind of cell phone. Stylish, affordable and very fun to use. The touch screen technology is the greatest and finally I can have a piece of it thanks to the LG Cookie. It is very very easy to use. The photos that I get with it are very clear its enough for me. Makes it easy to storage all the contacts and music etc.... with your computer. I really recommend it!
I purchased the LG cookie about 2 months ago and I have to say that it exceeded my expectations in terms of the features. However, I was not prepared for the short battery life. Do remember that the protective film reduces the touch sensitivity and that takes a bit of getting used to. I also have not figured out how to get the phone not to "lock" so quickly. It locks in the midddle of conversations and it takes a while to unlock it and look for information. The expandable memory feature is very useful as the phone itself does not have much storage capacity. Definitely worth the money so far.
I bought this phone about a month ago for my wife. it has not worked for one day without charging the battery. that is a big NO NO for me.then i am still trying to get it to recognise a picture as a caller id display that is like pulling teeth, then trying to get a ringtone for a particular caller is like reinventing the wheel.you know what they say? you get what you pay for at this price don't expect an omnia.
I bought this unlocked phone for my husband for his birthday and he loves it.  It has great features and is very user friendly.  Sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond on the first tap, but it is not a huge problem and is probably no worse than any other touch screen phone.  Also, since it is a European phone, we couldn't find accessories, such as a silicone case, that are made specifically for it.  Other than these minor things, I would highly recommend this product!
The battery life its too short, I bought this item for my wife, and she must charge the battery daily, and the she only speak a few minutes on a daily basis. A new battery should have more power life.Please notice that you can't view you tube videos if you have an internet plan, since this cell phone does not allow you.If you are looking for a smart phone, spend a little more and buy HTC, Iphone or BB.Also, you must buy a power adapter, since the connector has been made for Europe.
This LG KP500 phone works well as far as phone and text messaging is concerned.  However, picture taking is not good quality and I never tested the video.  Mostly the browsing capability of this phone is the poorest of all.  The touch does not work well.  Even when you use the stylus, you can make the screen move.  Furthermore, although you can make the browser larger, it does not always work.  The writing is too small when you browse it is not readable.  I find this phone not user friendly and does not have everything I am looking for in a phone.  For the price that I paid for it, I am not satisfied.Also the most important thing is that, because it is an unlocked phone, you are taking a risk.  Some of the features do not work and also you will not get AT &T; or any other service provider to service your phone.  Good luck in finding a place that will service it for you.  The LG manufacturer will tell you also that they can't help you.Bottom line, if you are in the US, this is a high risk buy.  I do not recommend this phone.  There are more troubles and problems with it than it's worth.
AT first I was a little worried that I might not like the phone.  But after having it in my hands and being able to play around with it.  I started liking it more.  It is not that hard to use.  You just have to be a little patient with it if you are not cell phone savy.  I can work a computer but I always have problems with a phone.  I really like the phone.  My husband also likes it and would like to get one for himself.
This phone was not manufactured for us in the US.  I've contacted LG with questions about the phone and was told that because the phone wasn't made for use in the US, they could not help me in any way.  I can't access the internet and can't send or receive picture messages.  The picture and video color and quality on the phone is very poor.  I've also had problems with the touch screen, especially when texting.  I've had to retype words that dissapear while texting.  The best qualities on the phone are the radio and mp3 player. Although this is an inexpensive phone for someone looking for a touchscreen type phone; it would be better in the long run to pay more for a phone that is supported by the manufacturer and has the features that you are looking for in a phone.
Thi phone is awesome, I have no complaints.  It took a few days for me to get used to the touuch screen but now I love it.  I can do anything with this phone, the pictures a pretty good, video comes out great and there is even a drawing pad to keep my daughter busy during trips.  I couldn't ask for more. This is the best LG phone I have had, way better than the shine.
This phone is a good product, had to make a few adjustments due to it being an unlocked phone but that's to be expected. If your looking for a great phone for an affordable price, this is the phone for you.
The LG Kp500 is a very nice phone. I like the design and look of the phone. I love the fact that the phone lets you do multiple things at one time and has an mP3 player. The only problem i have had with the phone is that sometimes it runs slow. i have learned that the less you have on the external memory, the better it runs. i dont know why that is though. i definately like the touch screen. But the headphones that come with the phone are not comfortable. I do reccomend this phone.
I got this phone cause I wanted a touch phone and I'm on a budget, so I chose this instead of the Samsung S5230. I've got to say it was a smart move, this phone is much cheaper and it has pretty much the same functions. The construction quality is very good and the unit comes with a screen protector so you don't leave your fingerprints all over the screen, which obviously will happen a lot.Luckily it also has a stylus pen, as text messaging with the virtual querty would be mission imposible without it, I have small fingers and had a hard time trying to hit those small buttons so the pen came in handy.Pros:- Small- Lightweight- Nice bright screen- Good menues, customizable- Touch screen is pretty responsive- Comes with stylus pen (you'll need it for text messages)- Features acelerometer- Good volume and quality MP3 player- Bluetooth- Navigation runs pretty fast- Battery life is goodCons:- Manual could be better, misses some useful information- Photo Camera is not very good (don't be fooled by the 3MP)- Some basic things are complicated to configure (like ringtones)- LG propietary connection for headphonesThe camera quality is far from stellar, but you can't ask a cellphone to take great photos, specially at this price point.I've owned another LG phone (MG 280) and it turned out to be the worse I had, I even promised myself i would never buy another LG, but clearly after seeing this one you can tell these guys evolved a lot and listened to their customers on many common issues with their previous phones.All in all, the best $190 you can spend on a phone today, sure there are better, but none of them below this price. If you want something good and don't want so spend too much, this is by far the best option you've got. I took one star off just for the camera and the headphone connection, but no doubt this product is solid.
This is a really nice phone, that's almost a steal at this price. Everything feels feels pretty snappy and responsive. It has a really sleek and sophisticated feel to it.Pros: Easy customization, bright clear screen. Stylus can be used to write notes directly on screen which is converted to text for storing quick notes or sending SMS messages.Cons: On screen keyboard seems better suited to those with smaller fingers. For those with larger hands, I recommend using the stylus. No flash on camera is a definite disappointment. Touch screen sometimes requires a firm press to activate certain options. The PC Sync software that came with the phone could be better.
I like this phone. Its a bit heavy compared to the iPhone. But its a mini version of an iPhone (like a college version)The only complaint i have would be its kinda hard to scroll down... it gets annoying after a while when u scroll down and accidentally hit something and that screen pops up.
Unable to use internet. AT&T; won't support phone for internet or MMS functions. Tried to program with codes available on the net without success. Cute phone but we also wanted internet capability. Returned and ordered an unlocked Nokia instead.
I originally bought this phone because my w810 that I have with ATT was on its deathbed. I wasn't eligible for an upgrade for about 8-9 months (plus I don't really know if I want to be with them for another 2 years). So I figured my only two options were to purchase a phone from an ATT store for the full, unsubsidized price or buy an unlocked phone. Buying an unlocked phone definitely makes much more sense. For about the same price, you can get a phone without carrier restrictions, and should you decide to use another carrier, you can just put a different SIM card in the phone (for GSM phones). Anyway this particular phone is OK. I wanted to get another Sony Ericsson, but they are too overpriced for what the phones can do. LG is another good brand so I looked into this one. It's a good price, a nice budget phone that still has decent features. As far as looks, I loved it; sleek, thin, and black. That's about where it ended for me though. I didn't much care for the menu layouts, and the touchscreen is extremely slow and lagging. Texting was a nightmare for me with the touchscreen keyboard as I would always hit the wrong button or hit a button twice because the screen would lag. The camera is also terrible. The 2MP on both my Sony Ericsson and now my Nokia are exponentially better than this camera. The video player also sucks. I only kept this phone for about a week, so I don't really remember everything. I just feel like you can get better for your money. I sent it back and got a Nokia E63, now I'm much happier.
not a huge fan of this phone, it was made out to be really good and fast and have tons of things to do... it's not all that great.  it's really slow, sometimes txts won't go through right away, have to shut off the phone, and the speaker quality isn't that great for speaker phone.  overall i'm not that satisfied with this phone none the least. my suggestions is to not get this phone, get something else especially a phone not made by LG!
I brought the phone in October no problems yet great touch screen phone w/ nice features.  The radio sounds good the  stero headsets are a plus and games graphics are clear.  The camera picture color quality not that vivid.  Like all touch screen phones you have to make sure the phone is locked.
LG KP500 Cookie is a very nice phone its easy to use and not bulcky. The only problem is that the PC Suite would not work and you can't get updates online. But the phone works well.
I was very pleased with my purchase of the LG KP500 phone. In fact, I purchased the phone for my wife and she simply loves it. The phone met all the specifications of the seller and arrived in tact, on time and with all of the advertized accessories. I am totally satisfied!
This is the best phone you can buy for less $200. I have bought three of them: Two for friends and one for my wife.Here in Costa Rica the phone works perfect.
I received the phone in good time, charged it up.  Charger is multi-capable, 220VAC/120VAC with adapter for US/International mains receptacles.It is hard to figure out how to use the music player and access the added memory disk.  Headphones work well, however.Menu is a challenge to learn, probably because the phone has so many functions.  I really wanted a Wi-Fi capable phone, with internet and messaging capabilities; as well as one I can change SIM cards for whatever country I am in.  It does part of this, but I think I will miss the Wi-Fi capability.Slim, buzz/hum feature as you activate the soft keys is nice.Sound quality and speaker for hands-free work very well.
Bought this phone for my girlfriend as a bithday gift,and she loves it.First of all the price is awfully nice for a phone of this calliber and stature.This phone has all the bells and wistles you need in a phone unless your looking a phone to do impossible things.You got touch screen,music player,great camera,video playback and all the other goodies, and does not cost as much as the i-phone which is more bulky and overrated. When you compare both phones the cookie out shines the iphone, but if you dont believe me go to [...] and do the comparisson.
I'm very pleased with ky kp500. The phone is very stylish and works really well. i love the mp3 it holds all of my music with i use as ringtones. The video camera is awesome.
Wife loves her new phone. Easy to use and very stylish. I will never buy phones from cell stores again.
This  product  is  excelente . I  bouth  10 of  this  phones for  my  customers  and  ell  of  tnem  are  so  satisfied  as  wel  I  do. Of  course  I  will  buy  some  more  in  the  near  future.  Regards  .  Jorge  Cespedes
Lo mejor de este telefono es su precio... en realidad muy bajo con respecto a otros que son mas sencillos..Al inicio es un poco dificil el uso de la pantalla tactil pero en unos pocos días termina uno por acostumbrarse.Lo bueno:1. La duracion de la bateria.2. El tamaño.3. El material, no se raya con facilidad.4. La memoria expansible.5. El puntero.6. Mutitarea, puedes tener abiertas varias aplicaciones.7. Si te registras en la pagina de LGMOBILE, puedes bajar bastantes juegos. Como recomendacion, si vas a registrarte hazlo como si estuvieras en españa de lo contrario no vas a encontar informacion ni aplicaciones. Luego baja los juegos y aplicaciones desde el telefono, no desde la pagina ya que por la pagina tiene que ser por medio de SMS.8. El cable USB, te funciona como cargador.9. Pantalla Tactil.Lo malo:1. El envio de mensajes, es un tanto dificil, si estas acostumbrado a enviar mensajes SMS constantemente y de manera rapida, este modelo no es para ti, es un poco complejo. inclusive con el teclado QWERTY.2. No guarda registro de ultimos numeros a los que le has enviado mensajes, por lo cual a la hora de buscar el destinatario te lleva mucho tiempo.3. Si tienes muchos contactos se dificulta a busqueda.3. No tiene funcionalidad de copy paste.4. La camara no tiene auto focus, es casi imposible tomar una foto clara.5. No tiene Flash6. Tanto el cargador, el USB y los audifonos poseen una sola entrada y no es comun. Si se te pierde alguno de ellos veo dificil encontrar el sustituto.7. Los audifonos no son de muy buena calidad, es plastico duro, por lo que es incomodo en los oidos y muy propenso a quebrarse.8. Las tapitas de las entradas de el micro SD y del cargador, son muy debiles, si constantemente estas cargandolo o conectando los audifonos pronto se te van a quebrar y van a quedar al descubierto.9. El boton de bloqueo no esta en la mejor posicion y esta muy cerca del disparador de la camara.10. Cuando te indica que queda poco carga en la bateria, no te ha pasado ni una hora cuando ya se apaga, y el aviso es muy constante y molesto..11. Si bien la pantalla es grande no puedes hacer que las cosas se vean mas pequeñas por ejemplo el texto de los SMS, con el tipo de letra mas pequeño es facilmente leible por alguien que este a un metro de distancia.En resumen el telefono tiene sus detalles malos, y sus atractivos, yo en lo personal le he tomado el gusto, y sobre todo porque por su precio no encontraras otro con esas caracteristicas.
I'VE HAD IT FOR 3 WEEKS NOW. IT HASN'T PRESENTED ANY PROBLEMS SO FAR. IT'S A FANCY PHONE, NICE 3 INCHES TOUCH SCREEN. NICE FEATURES TOO. AFORDABLE NICE DEVICE!
Very pleased with the phone and the service provided .Prompt and efficient just as you would expect from Amazon.
On opening the box up I found that the instructions are in Russian!  It has therefore made it somewhat difficult to work out how it all works and weeks later I am still finding out!
I can not set my own new pin code because nowhere tell me the initial pin code.
There are a big problem with this phone I bought here. It has not sound at all without headset, and when I receive a phone call without headset, I cannot listen what are talking in the other side.And it does not have any kind of support here!!!I cannot obtan any kind of support here for it!!!
agradezco de verdad su ayuda para la compra de este producto,segun el banco emisor, hay problemas de comunicacion con la pagina de amazon, por eso a sido dificil concluir la transáción, por favor indiquen otrs alternativas de como puedo adquirir el producto a la brevedad posible, ya que es un regalo para navidad.graciasagustin avendañoCaracas-Venezuela
In general the handset is pretty impressive certainly the best I have seen on any SE device I have owned recently. The slider is pretty solid & even after a number of weeks of use their has been no degradation in it's action. The only obvious weak point I would say is the camera 3.2M pixels. The build materials are a nice mix of metal & plastic, I especially like the hardened glass used on the display which certainly seems to live up to it's non-scratch nature so far. Overall though maybe not quite reaching the very best of Samsung phones, it is much better built than any N series device I have owned of late. Be interesting to see how it holds up over time.
The letters associated with each key are small: ABC, DEF, GHI, etc.Only two languages for to change settings English and Chinese. Is not suitable for international sale.
I have had my Samsung SGH-t629 for 2 years now (on the T-Mobile network, with myFaves) and I love it. I am ready to trade up, though, to the Samasung Behold and, as my third Samsung, I am sure it will be as well-made as my previous two. I love the sturdy slider design, the best part is it's durable but sleek. The big screen looks pretty and has great colors (plus it works as a mirror when turned off ;]). The camera could be better, of course, but it's sufficient for what I use it for. Only had a few glitches occasionally, that work themselves out. I've even dropped it in parking lots before and the screen hasn't cracked or anything. Just a few scratches on the back, that's it. I constantly slide it open and closed and it stands up to my nervous habit. I love the keypad too; it's not bulky at all so I like that. Good volume for the alarm and ringer (though I usually keep it on vibrate). The ringtones are a little cheesy, but that's to be expected. I don't even mind the default wallpapers so much (more variety than my previous Samsung, a Stripe). I like the music player too, for my t-zones ringtones, and I love the microSD memory card. I have like a 2GB memory card and I have so much memory available. Battery life is good, as long as you don't surf the web all day or play too many games. Menu is easy to understand, which is great. I like almost everything about this great little phone, I just want an upgrade!
I have had this phone for over three years now.  I have never had any mechnical problems, ringing problems, camera problems.  I have even dropped it on several ocassions and it still workds.  The battery life could be a little longer.  It's not one of your touch tone phones but for someone who just wants a phone with not a lot of fancy frills it works just fine.  especially for senior citizens who cannot work all the new mechanical items.  Good phone
My T629 broke after only a month of use.  The phone failed to ring on all incoming calls (electronic problem). I had to return the phone to samsung for repair.  It took 5 working days for the phone to arrive plus 15 working days to look/fix/replace the phone (basically stared at the phone so it can magically fix itself).  Then it took another 5 working days to have it shipped back. Essentially, I didn't have the phone for 1 month.  Word of advice, don't buy the phone or avoid samsung product unless you have extended warranty from the vendor for returns.
Excelent guys, i am from Venezuela and my phone works excelent with Telefonica or Tim.
The 8820 offers a truckload of features without overwhelming the user and it can be easily customized to fit its owner's needs. It is a very good email device and it performs well as a phone and mobile Web browser.Before the Bold I used to carry a fully-loaded Blackberry 8820 (just kidding). It was one of the smartest smartphones at the time it was launched and it's not too shabby these days either. One of my kids, actually, is using it and I would be very happy with it myself if I didn't have to carry the company-issued Bold.Briefly about the Blackberry 8820:- It was originally launched as an AT&T; device.- Unlike most of its predecessors it's actually 'black' in color and I like that.- Rides on the EDGE network when available - pretty good bandwidth for emails and voice but.- Good QWERTY keyboard.- Can be set to use Wi-Fi, when available.- Supports Bluetooth.- Comes with a working Web browser and it accepts third-party such as Opera.- Allows for downloading third-party apps and I had Yahoo!Go, Gmail, GoogleTalk and Opera downloaded and performing well on it.- Many applets are preloaded: scheduler/calendar, contacts list, BlackBerry Messenger, Bricks, Calculator, Notepad and so on.- NO CAMERA- The phone can use the address book info for dialing.- Of course, it integrates well with a corporate messaging infrastructure and it works well with Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.- Practical battery life - about 2 days, 3-4 if not used a lot.- Charges through the USB port.- Elegant design.- Bright, color screen.- Speaker.- Easy navigation with the ergonomically-placed track ball.- Excellent customization: ring tones, alarms, custom folders, themes and so on.- Solid build - ours is almost 3 years old and it looks and feels as good as new.All I can say is that, if my boss told me that I had to surrender the Bold and get back to my old 8820, I would not mind too much.
The Tiger Direct website clearly lists this phone as 900/1800/1900, but not on Amazon.com.  Not sure who is at fault here, but this is annoying.  I use AT&T; and I'm not getting 3G coverage in my house (which I normally do).TigerDirect's website has a clear listing of features.  So I'm not sure who fudged the description here.  To top it off TigerDirect is reselling from another company called [...].  Let's see how the RMA process goes.The phone is good, everything came shipped nicely and timely.  It would work well on T-Mobile's network.
I didn't purchase my razr v3xx from here but rather from a pawn shop. Its awsome, I have had no problems with it at all.  I had a regular v3 a couple years back and did not realize when i purchased this one, it was an upgraded razr.  I was very happy.  I switched from my LG shine to the razr v3xx and I am very impressed.  It has the same exact features and then some than my shine and the screen is longer and wider.  The colors are brighter as well and my lg shine is brand new well 8 months old.  I like the rzr a lot better as far as the buttons and resolution colors.  Much sharper.  The shine is really nice but too bulky for me and i dont like the sliding issue with it.  I drop it a lot so the razr is much better for me.
I too bought this "new" many years after it's heyday. What can I say. I'm cheap. But after trying and failing and trying some more to get my iPAQ to sync, I decided I needed to bump up to something easier and more reliable. So, I found this Blackberry selling very inexpensively and bought it. I was astonished. The syncing process was almost effortless. The unit is easy to use and the menues and programs are intuitive. I have nothing but good things to say about this unit.Now, having said all that, I admit it does not have all the bells & whistles of the new Blackberry's. But, when this one finally goes to that great electronic graveyard in the sky, I'll buy a "new" one to replace it. I could never go back to anything less intergrated than a Blackberry. That would be like going back to a dial-up connection for my Internet or cooking over a fire for dinner every night.
am bought this item, and i brought to Costa Rica, am so happy to use this.the great experience, is when you begin to write a sms, is so quickly and comfortable.is very very good, if u have to decide, i recommend for u
This Blackberry 7290 was purchased "Used."  The loudness or Volume of the phone was adjusted to maximum by me, according to the Instructions that were readily available for download on the Internet.  I deliberately shopped for an "Unlocked" phone so that I could use it on a vacation trip in Europe after loading it with a SIM chip that was compatible for the country in which I was traveling.  I discovered that the cell phone was barely audible.  I spent a lot of time, running to quiet spots and holding one hand over the opposite ear from the ear that was pressed to the phone.  Even then, I missed a lot of words.  I had to resort to sending text messages as often as I could, which this Blackberry was excellent at doing.  Upon return to the USA, the vendor could not figure out how to correct this problem with hearing the phone.
It is better than the 7230 but It is only a very good phone and a useful PDA It is OK for me, If I need a camera and a MP# I buy them
this review is not about Blackberry, but about a seller...I ordered the phone from Tigerdirect 3 days ago along with a hard drive, and both pieces were marked as 'in stock, usually shipped in 1 or 2 days" in my basket. Today I received an e-mail from Tigerdirect stating that they are out of stock for BOTH items.Right now I am trying to call them via skype colling service and can't get through. Getting through with my cell phone, but the international call from Trinidad is gonna cost me extra 40 cents a minute.You better do not waste your time and money with this company
This phone is simply amazing. It has everything you want in a smart phone; Web browser, GPS, still/video camrea, wifi, bluetooth and a decent number of apps (not to mention its good looks). It also comes with a 8GB micro SD card which you can upgrade if you need to. Touch flow 3d makes up for the outdated UI of WM 6.1. Whenever I forget it at home, I really miss it.I use it with a "go" plan cause I'm not willing to pay a carrier tax every month. It's no big deal because I don't make that many calls and I use data apps only where I have access to Wifi. It may not be a good fit for someone who has a monthly plan. You might as well just take advantage of the carrier discounts you get on a new handset especially since the phone doesn't support 3G in the states. I think HTC missed a big oppurtunity by not releasing a US 3G model.
I'm a techno geek, I like all the electronic gadgets and have to say this one is the best phone I have ever had by far.This smart phone offers you the best you can have using Windows Mobile. It has the same size as the iPhone. Only being phone's width which is bigger than iPhone, however, it doesn't has anything to envy to the Mac's big seller.It comes with everything you might need for your day to day routine and also, HTC has improved battery capacity (I had an HTC Diamond before this one and battery couldn't last more than 5 hours!).Only thing which is a con for me in this phone is its price, but nothing can be that perfect.UPDATE (10/28/2009): I thought this equipment has died on me after it started to fail to connect to the Internet using my mobile's line. I made a lot of tests, went to support and even tried using different SIM cards (from the same provider -Movistar-) and thought it was dead. It resulted to be that my provider has made a change in its system (which they don't even know about it, at least not their first level of support) so my phone can NOT get connected to data plan again (voice and SMS are just fine). Apologies for the ones who read my previous feedback saying the phone dead before second month, it wasn't true, which is going to die is my service plan with Movistar because they're such incompetents providers.
I have had the HTC Touch HD for about three months. I have had over 7 different phones this year alone, buying and trying and then selling them within  a months time with the exception of the HD. This phone is so much fun. The quality and the looks are unmatched to date from any one. The Touch Flo 3D on this is beautiful. I use this with AT&T; On a Prepaid program with absolutely no issues at all. There are countless APPS that can be downloaded for free on many web sites.I have added the SPB Shell software on this and it is unbelievable. The price of this is a little high but for once you are paying for the quality and not the name (Blackberry)of the manufacture. I f you are a Windows OS person you will not be disappointed. This one will stay in my home for a long while.
This phone is truly amazing. The looks, the feel, the responsiveness... Everything has been beautifully crafted. Definitely, the touch could have been better (don't expect iPhone like breezy touch), but its easily offset by the wide range of both free and paid apps available on the internet. If you like toys and you like to mod them to satiate your inner cravings, then this phone is definitely for you.
This phone is incredible have had it for just over a month now and its great. I got it as a gift, but this phone exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it.
i bought this and my brother is using it in Saudi Arabia network (STC).the device is good at all.
after reading all those good things about this phone i decided to buy this piece of jewelry, guys , this thing goes beyond your immagination in term of what it can do ' if you'd had a hard time immagining a phone that could replace your laptop then try this thing
i like HTC HD very muchi feel ease to usei recommend you to bay one
HTC Touch HD IS ONE OF THE BEST OT CANERA SHOTIENING WITH 5MP AND I LLOVE USING THE GPS AND ADD ALOTS OF PROGREAMS ON IT... I CAN UPDAT ALL THE aplication and add new ones. the micr slot save all my document where i can send them to my laptop form work to home wi-fi ... the toch screen work perfctly and the desing and the weight are geart... it pc+cam+net+mobile+fax+HD+ TOUCH+FUN TIME....
I received this phone on 7/28/09, and today 9/2/09 the phone broke on me.  The ribbon cable that connects the screen to the keyboard tore and is sticking out.  It feels like a cassette tape ribbon, is orange on the front side and black on the backside.  The phone has never been abused or dropped.  This should have been built more sturdy especially with the movable part of sliding the cover back and forth.  The only good news about the phone is that Amazon will give me a full refund.
This is the first LG phone that I have purchased.  I was skeptical about LG phones, because I have always thought they are low quality cell phones.  I was right and should have followed my instinct.  I bought the LG KS360 unlocked phone for my daughter on her birthday.  At that time, they only had the European unlocked version, and I paid close to $200 for it.  The reason why I bought it is because my daughter had really wanted the look of the phone and for the texting feature.  About 3 months later, this phone started having problems. The screen started freezing when you slide the keyboard open.  It happened only once in a while, so my daughter kept on using it.  4 months later, the screen started going blank, freezing, had some colored lines, and all other things you can imagine.  In other words, the phone has stopped working!!!  I have contacted the LG company but told me that since it is an unlocked international phone, they can't do anything about it, and the warranty has already expired.  I contacted the LG company in UK and was told that it sounded like this phone needs repair.  Never would I purchase another LG phone!! I have never had a phone that lasted only 7 months.
This Cell phone was my perfect gift for my girlfriend Patricia, she liked too much and she feelt very happy when she recived this product..In my personal opinion, i think that this cellphone is very complete, 'cause has music, photos, video, bluetooth, contacts, internet.. (the only one that i dont like of this cell is that no has Wifi.. but the rest it`s a very good inversion..Thanks a lot.
A nice phone. Good with texting. Sometimes when you push up it looks like its blanking out. Great features though for the money.
I purchased 2 phones.It went out of order in a month.The user were girls around 20 years old.This phone had structural problem.I called LG and they say that theycan not give me warranty as these areinternational model not for USA.

Perfect for a no frills phone.  Could have better graphics but overall its easy to use and strong.  I have had no problem with the battery life charge every few days, using it moderatly.  Perfect for 1st phone, and does whats its meant to...make and recieve calls and texts.
This phone is great if you don't want any special features.One thing that drives me crazy is the battery life, or lack of one!I have to charge this phone almost every night... even if I don't use it! No long-life battery available for this model.Also, I keep getting annoying solicitation calls and there is no way to block them. I contacted Virgin Mobil and they didn't offer any viable solutions except for changing my phone number, (ahhhh, no thanks!).Great for younger kids. Easy use.
I purchased this cell when I lost my Verizon cell phone and I needed some way to communicate.  Within 5 minutes of opening the box I had the phone activated and I was making calls.  Verizon InPulse (pay as you go) service offers great plans for which you only pay on the days you use it.  The service comes with unlimited Verizon mobile to mobile minutes so I was able to talk to all my Verizon clients unlimited!  The phone itself made the same great quality calls as my expensive Blackberry.  The camera works great too.  Overall you can't beat this price for such a convenient phone! 5 stars!
HI All.I have used a blackberry for over 10 years now...give or take. I have always been impressed by the devices they have created in the past and the current line of devices. Since I like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I just had to get a 8900.Most of you know by now what the new feature sets are of blackberries that are out today. The bold, the storm, and now this one The JAVELIN.I wont go into too much detail but I will give you my quick run down.The Javelin is perhaps the thinnest, lightest, small footprint blackberry that I have ever used. It sports a great look and the feel to the hands is awesome. It is after all the curve II. Screen comparison to the bold is that this unit has a higher resolution then the bold but a smaller physical screen. The higher resolution definitely adds some clarity to the screen...but it should be duly noted that the BOLD's screen is also beautiful. Yes I own both.The Javelin is a EDGE/Wi-FI device...it does not have 3G capabilities. Technically you only need 3G if you want to be on the phone and receive/send emails at the same time when using your mobile connections...I personally have never needed that functionality. However, please note that if you are connected to WI-FI you are able to be on a telephone call and receive/send email etc over wi-fi....works perfectly.The Javelin has a new processor which makes the device FLY. Yes the processor is slower then the one in the Bold, but one can hardly tell the difference....I have used both for weeks...and I can honestly say you will not notice the speed difference.I have a 8gb MicroSD card installed in the device and use the software available from blackberry to synchronize all of my DRM free music from iTunes to the Blackberry. A must buy if you want to carry one device that does it all. Amazon has great prices on micro-sd cards.....Here are what I consider to be the best features on the Javelin:1. AUTOFOCUS 3.2mp Camera - It is AWESOME. Picture taking, due to focus, is a bit slower....however, the clarity and quality of the picture make it all worthwhile.2. FOOTPRINT - Great looking device with a great size.3. High Resolution screen - Awesome clarity....4. The functionality of a blackberry has always been a pro..and this one makes it better with a faster processor and more zippy feel.The three BAD things:1. The speaker on this thing is so TINNY....that it hurts my ears with certain tones.....there is NO bass what so ever. That is to be expected in a device this small....so maybe some new tones need to be tested out.2. Micro-USB - Why take something like mini-usb and replace it with something new. Now I have to get all new chargers, travel chargers, etc.... Upsetting but bareable.3. The holster in the BOX is simply a pleather pouch of sorts...no belt clip etc... You will need to buy an aftermarket leather/plastic holster if you wish to attach to your belt. Not a deal breaker...but should be mentioned.I am posting some images for your review also.Overall this is a great 5 Star Device.
I bought my 8900 in February when it first came out and I am so delighted with it.  Never before have I been so happy with a phone because it can do so much.  I used to carry a palm and a cell.... no longer!  The 8900 has everything I need: Internet, instant email, text messages, phone, games, camera, documents, etc, etc, it is wonderful!  Very happy and still excited about it.
Pros: Reception and call quality!, interface, beautiful screen, syncs with Mac, keyboard, terrific sound on media player, decent camera, and intuitive user interface.Cons: Battery life could be better, can be slow at times with multiple applications open, the Mac syncing software from Blackberry is finicky though it eventually works, no 3G network support :(Summary: This phone is wonderful. My last two smartphones were Windows Mobile and this Blackberry completely blows them out of the water. The interface is wonderful and the OS is really reliable. I put battery life under cons, though it gets about forty hours with one charge on heavy text, email, internet, and phone usage, so this is really a minor complaint.All in all I love this device. Compared to my girlfriend's previous gen Blackberry, this little gadget is a beauty and a top performer. Keyboard is about the same, but the 8900 wins in just about every other category: build, reception, screen, interface, camera.Versus the BoldI ultimately chose this over the Bold for a few reasons: keyboard, form factor, price tag, and screen. The Bold's edge over the Curve 8900 is its support for 3G, though I find browsing the internet on a phone painful so it had no impact on my decision. I prefer the smaller size of the Curve 8900 too, and it feels like it's built better than the Bold.Versus the iPhoneI'm a Mac user, though I chose a Blackberry. Why? First of all, I already own an iPod Touch so I'm familiar with the interface of the iPhone and I can tell you how frustrating it is to type on the screen! I wanted the full physical keyboard interface, and with the growing Blackberry app store it is quickly gaining ground on the iPhones flexibility. I find the trackball quick and I make less errors with it than on the touch interface. Of course, the touchscreen has its perks, but I find that I don't miss it here. I also wanted to avoid the iPhone's lackluster battery, and I'm happy I did because the Blackberry easily lasts a full day and the next without a charge. I also know that iPhone's don't get the greatest reception, and this 8900 gets the best reception of any cell phone I've owned (which is probably at about ten total phones over the years).Conclusion:This is a great phone. I highly recommend it. I did a lot of research before making this decision and am very happy I settled on the Curve 8900.
I have now had a few days to check out the new T-Mobile Blackberry 8900.  I will be comparing my most recent Blackberry, a T-Mobile 8800.Good Points:1.  Nice screen; very good resolution; and good readability. Good for viewing attached documents.2.  Nice industrial design and small form factor.3.  Wifi (but it seems much slower than the Iphone or an old T-Mobile Dash I have around the house).4.  Pretty good camera.  There is considerable shutter lag; but the photos are fair.  Note that I cannot seem to be figure out how to turn off the annoying shutter sound.  I tend to use a camera phone for reminders of a product or article that interested me.  The shutter may be required by law in some locations; but I don't think it's required where I live.5.  Audible works a bit better.  I am an Audible fan. (I also download audio books from Net Library, but they require a protected WMA format, which the 8900 does not support).  I finally can downloads audio books directly to the device.  There are still glitches, such as updating the My Library list, but it improved from essentially "non-functional" to "somewhat usable".6.  UMA--T-Mobile's voip option, worked quite well.  Voice quality was so so (probably device limited) but setup was simple and it seems to work at various wifi sites without use of minutes or special hardware.  I am excited to try this in Japan and on other international trips.7.  3.5 mm headphone jack, started with the original Curve.  Quite good sound though my headphones.Not So Good Points:1.  Mediocre voice quality.  My 8800 had exceptional voice quality.  It was better than my Cisco Voip phone at work.  The voice quality of the internal speaker for the 8900 is not nearly so good.  I found myself continuously re-positioning the phone vis-a-vis my ear to try and hear better.  This is a big problem; and makes me think about returning it rather than suffering through a year of poor voice calls.  I have been with T-Mobile for seven years or so in the Chicago area (from right after Voicestream came to town).  I find their service much better than AT&T; and Verizon and rivaled only by Sprint (this may sound funny, but it is my experience).  Anyway, this  is probably the worst voice quality I have had on any of several Blackberry phones.2.  No 3G.  May not mean so much for routine Blackberry functions, which are highly compressed, but for web browsing or downloads, lack of 3G is a big minus.3.  Annoying change from mini-usb to micro usb for device connections.  I have several devices, such as M3P players and another phone that use mini-usb; now I need to have another cord just for the 8900 and buy some extra chargers and cords for when I travel.  I note that the media-sync was much faster on the 8900 than my 8800.  I don't know if this is because of better software, drivers or the micro usb (versus mini usb).4.  Annoying, audible phone dialing sound.  In normal and other non-silent profiles, there is an annoying and very audible rapid dial sound that everyone around you can hear.  My convoluted work around, found on line, is to use vibrate mode, and then have it ring. This is silly and annoying.  It is representative of the settings limits for this phone that seriously detract from individual usability and customization.5.  The included case is a definite letdown.  It is too small, leaving the top 1/2 inch of the device uncovered.  It is too tight, making the phone tough to extract when answering a call, and there is not a belt clip.6.  Web browser--still bad.  Bookmarks are a pain, locked in to useless T-Mobile sites, and browsing is not so good.  I loaded Opera Mini but it doesn't seem to be well integrated. This may be the side effect of using an Iphone; by comparison the 8900 browser, even tough introduced more than a year after the Iphone, is so poor.7.  Reception seems to be worse than the 8800.  It is difficult to compare exactly, but it seems that reception at home and work is a notch worse than my 8800.  Not as bad as an Iphone, though, on AT&T.;
Good Morning. I live in Venezuela, and I buy this phone with many expectations, and I was not disappointed. It is a mini laptop phone, he has all the tools to keep you well informed and connected to the Internet. The emails arrive in real time, has speakerphone, bluetooth, GoogleMaps, and one modest gps. Great expandable memory, keyboard perfect, neither too large nor too small. The resolution of your screen is phenomenal. The 3.2 megapixel camera has autofocus.The only detail, if you use the internet much much like the facebook mobile upload photos, and the messenger, because the battery only lasts 1 day. In no other complaints.Purchase a longer battery life and be happy.It has many applications, I can open PDF files, I think I need only get applications to open compressed files.The size and weight are ideal. If more light would give the feeling of being poor, if not heavier than many believe is outdated and is made with materials global warming.The agenda is amazing, very intuitive.The trackball is strange at first, but 3 days and ends becoming familiar atmosphere.It's the best phone I could buy, and  amazon offers the best price and with free shipping.Here in Venezuela, is the best for the blackberry messenger, we Venezuelans are more accustomed to SMS messages.100% recommended.Greetings
HI All.I have used a blackberry for over 10 years now...give or take.  I have always been impressed by the devices they have created in the past and the current line of devices.  Since I like to be on the bleeding edge of tech, I just had to get a 8900.  Unfortunately, my lack of knowledge led me to purchase one with a QWERTZ keyboard (GERMAN).  I had to return it and find a QWERTY keyboard unit.  I did get one.....Most of you know by now what the new feature sets are of blackberries that are out today.  The bold, the storm, and now this one The JAVELIN.I wont go into too much detail but I will give you my quick run down.The Javelin is perhaps the thinnest, lightest, small footprint blackberry that I have ever used.

Please be certain you know what you are buying...a QWERTZ or a QWERTY.I thought I selected a 5/5 review...but only 4 stars are lit up.  THIS IS A 5 STAR DEVICE.
got this originally for a friend overseas but it called to me ever so seductively from the box! i had many times said that the bb curve original was my all time favorite phone,pda,blackberry, everything. it just made me happy to pick it up in comparison to some of the other phones i have tried. and it was love at first curve byte.i liked the bold when it was released but everything i didnt like was resolved. the curve is just the right size, wifi was quick and clean, its hot, cutting edge, fast, sharp, sophisticated and it will take your PDA woes away.actually i still want blackberry to put the "period" at the very least on the lower case so that you do not have to break stride for a stupid punctuation mark. that is the one thing I have noticed with samsung pdas and maybe other's i am not remembering but they take some of the commonly used punctuations or special keys and make them easier in placement on the qwerty or by creating a new key or at least a lower case location. my only real criticism that is really silly. it doesnt take away an  ounce of my love of this curve.
I really love this BB model...It has all of the benefits of a Bold (except for the 3G but that doesn't bother me), but in a "female size".It has a tiny size, an excellent performance, a decent battery life, a great look & feel and SO MUCH more...I just love it! :)
Thought about getting the Bold, but I've been with T-Mobile forever and I love their rates and their coverage so I got the 8900 instead and I'm loving it!  I do love the Bold's keyboard better and I do find myself wishing I had some 3G love at times, but that's about it.  I experimented with a G1 for a week but I returned it for many reasons, with one being that T-Mobile's 3G was just not quick enough in my area.  I've got Wi-Fi at work, home, and school so 90% of the time I'm happy with browser speed.You've surely heard about the 8900's beautiful screen, and they're not lying.  It's packing a 480x360 resolution and is definitely the best screen I've ever seen on a phone.  It's like a plasma screen with pictures showing up in HD.  The camera is also sharp, and better than the Bold's, and BlackBerry in general has done a great job of making it possible for their devices to be complete multimedia devices.  I've got a 4GB MicroSD card in here that holds my most necessary songs for when I don't feel like bringing along the iPod.Cons: loose keyboard, sometimes loose trackball, no Pandora support.  In the end, T-Mobile's great coverage and excellent customer support put this device over the top for me.  I renewed my contract for just 1 year because I know in a year 3G support will be a lot better and EDGE is going to be completely obsolete..so that's when I'll pick up a 3G device.  But until then, the 8900 is all I need.UPDATE: Pandora is now available for the 8900...yes!
Simply an excellent smartphone with great capabilities and features.As an Unlocked device, it works pretty good with my local mobile service provider.
I bought this item to take to costa rica and DLN Send me a Refurbished and Used cellphone, amazon and DLN didnt refound me my money or send me the cellphone that i pay for. Right now i fell like somebody stole my money so if you want to buy this to take it international i recomend to buy this in your country and pay more but you can get guatantie wich is something Amazon dont give to people how live in other country.
OK.the only bad thing about this phone is the WiFi, for WLAN. The signal fail very often.This is one of the best selling phone from Blackberry, nice design simple the best. Nice display very shine color, almost like plasma. The display like regular phone 2.5 inches.The join of the trackball navigation, fit very nice. Even that looks to delicade but are very strong.The best signature of blackberry, is the keyboard they keep this in this model with some littles improvements.For ejecutive or people who like to send many email or edit documents and archives, this is the phone for you.Nice camera with 3.15 megapixel for ocational photos. Maps google, this phoen brings anything.I imaged this FAQWhy you should choose this phone?If you are the people wrote a lot in the for for mms or sms, or editing document during louch or traveling, dont waste your time and buy it now.Thsi is better than iphone?This phone is for diferent needs from iphone. Curve8900 phone is evething anyone wants, nice resolution but the display is smaller from the iphoneStorm or curve?This is the big issue, in aplication curve 8900 is better from storm, but for video or pictures, the best choose is the storm. but remenber the blackberry storm was lauch to deal with the iphone, choose acourding your needs.Curve or treo?To be very clear, i like more the blackberry design, there are some style that i like from Palm like treo 750 and similar. but the new palm's model, is not my taste.Curve or bold?Besides the price, the curve8900 has more aplication.
First I have owned and used a lot of BlackBerrys.  I started with the 7100, and have moved up from there to use the 8700, 8800, 8100, 8300, 8310, 8320, and now my 8900.  I have also used a Storm 1 some as well.The 8900 is an amazing phone.  Its fast and snappy.  I don't have the constant problem of running low on memory I had with my 8320.  The WiFi is great when I am somewhere with weak signal, or best of all on an airplane equipped with WiFi.  I was able to surf, IM, and Tweet the entire flight.  I have never had a flight feel so short.The phone is a nice size to fit in my hand for typing or calling.  The keypad is great and I have no issues typing on it.The only complaint I have in the design is the placement of the charging port.  It is a little inconvenient to hold and charge, but you learn to work around it.I have no complaint about the memory card slot being under the battery.  I don't have a need to change it.By far this is my favorite BlackBerry I have used and would recommend it.  It works perfect for heavy email, texting, and messaging that I do.
* (This review is for the Unlocked Javelin) *I will try to give a review that will help you decide if the phone will work for you, maybe you can relate from my experience or needs. First of all ask yourself what other options you currently have on the Blackberry market. Bold has a pricey tag and its not that great, the Storm has received so many negative reviews that is hard to think of a reason why to get it, and now, the Javelin.I've been using a Blackberry Pearl for over a year now, and even though I found the user interface a bit confusing, I enjoyed the fact of having so much connectivity in such a small package. I'm not an enterprise user, just a guy who wanted to have Blackberry messenger available to chat with my friends worldwide, facebook, msn, etc. Some of my frustrations with the Pearl were software speed, lack of internal memory (by now you know that adding external memory doesn't help at all, for all major apps are installed in the BB's main memory) and the built in web browser.I've had the Javelin for two weeks now, and I'm absolutely pleased. I'm not going to go into details of how it looks, chances are that if you are reading this is because you think is a nice looking phone, and you'd be right. This processor makes the phone perform really fast, most apps run smoothly. User interface is improved, although I still believe that in could be much more user friendly. The 3.2 MP camera is actually pretty decent, not the best, but just right. All this plus the fact that it has a bright and crisp screen compared to other smartphones out there.I'm not going to say anything about the lack of 3G, if you buy this phone you should know that, and there is no reason to give it a negative review because of it. I've been reading issues about the speaker, but personally I've had no problems with that nor reception.Heres a major flaw though... Let's face it; if you use your Blackberry as much as I do, you probably know that the battery doesn't last an entire day. Especially when you're hooked on on IM. One of the nice features I loved on my Pearl was the fact that the Usb charger was very popular, so even if I lost my wall charger I could always find a Motorola charger to plug it in to, buy one for 3 bucks, or just grab any of the supplied USB cables from an external hard disk, PS3 controller, mp3 player, etc, and just recharge it using my computer. So battery life was never really an issue for me. RIM has introduced a new plug that killed that convenience. It might not look like a big deal, but now I realize how important it is for me. It doesn't change the fact that is a great phone though.Bottom line, if you're making the switch ask yourself if you are in desperate need of 3G network. If so, don't even bother getting this one. If not, you will find yourself pleased with a blackberry that look so over the edge, and with great performance. I would strongly suggest buying a car charger and an extra wall or PC charger. Does it deserve 5 stars? No. Its not just about the phone, it's the software itself, and I know RIM can do so much better and add more features, better looking menus, address book, calendar, etc. Why is the iPhone so successful? Its cool and its easy to use. The blackberry market is changing, and there is a growing market of conventional users wanting a cool phone with great features, all supported by the Blackberry Platform.
This BB is awesome i reallly recommend you tu get this phone because it has everything you need to keep in touch with people in a very easy way.The seller sent the same phone with the same thinhgs it says.Para las personas de Venezuela pueden comprar este telefono que si viene desbloqueado internacionalmente y funciona a la perfeccion aca.
Es un equipo excelente, super completo, la camara a pesar de ser de 3.2 Mpx funciona bastante bien, el GPS funciona a la perfeccion asociado con Google Maps, en vista de que Blackberry no ha lanzado mapas para la zona de Latinoamerica.El Telefono viene con una tarjeta de 256 megas, las cuales sirven para almacenar unas 100 fotos, mientras compras una MicrSd de 8 GB :-)La unica contra del equipo lo mencionaria en el consumo de bateria, es una animal para consumir baterias. Activado el GPS, recibiendo correos, y haciendo uso normal del equipo, la bateria dura un dia, no mas, llega a 12 horas de uso, algo corto, deberia durar por lo menos 18 o 20 horas de uso normal.
Excellent product and excellent service from Amazon.I only had i little bit more expeectation with the GPS functionality, i thought i would have a true GPS software.
I have had pretty much every blackberry ever released.Reasons I LOVE the 8900:-perfect size (I think the bold is too bulky)-excellent screen resolution-WAY faster than other berry's as far as OS performance-WIFI for using UMA (especially internationally! Call back to the US for free!)-GPS. Finally a berry with both in this form factor-media player. I got a 16gb card and ended up selling my ipod nano because it was just collecting dust after I got this phone.-Media Sync. Syncs perfectly with itunes.-Form factor. Looks super sleek and nice.Only thing I don't like is the micro usb. Hard to plug in at times and had to purchase converters for all of my amassed mini usb chargers.
The phone is really good. The weight and size is perfect. The data connection is fast and stable. The interface and software is very easy to follow and understand
I made the leap into the smartphone world, coming off an old flip-LG phone that I *loved*.  I wasn't sure I'd even really like the BlackBerry, as it's a bar phone and I always chose flip models, but I love it.  Sure, the Javelin doesn't have 3G, but for most things, the EDGE network is perfectly fast and 3G isn't so much faster that I miss it for web browsing.Call Quality - in all honesty, I don't call much on the phone, but it gets plenty loud and I can usually hear calls just fine.  It doesn't drop calls unless my service sputters (ATT), but overall I have no complaints.Keypad - On this, I'm much pickier.  I love the QWERTY keyboard on this model.  My work phone is a BlackBerry World Edition 8830, whose keys are much more similar to the Bold and Tour.  I don't like those keypads as much.  There was, of course, a slight learning curve on the Javelin in typing time, but now typing is a breeze.  I type an awful lot on Gchat, via SMS, and via BlackBerry messenger, and I have no problem with the keys.  They're great, they're separated, and I don't often make a mistake on them.Trackball - I cannot praise this trackball enough.  RIM finally did away with the old recessed trackballs and created one that feels smooth and effortless.  I love it.Media player - I didn't actually expect to use this, but I lost my mp3 player.  I popped in an 8 gb microSDHC card (didn't have to remove the battery - nice feature), loaded up some music, and popped in earbuds.  Music doesn't sound so phenomenal that audiophiles would be happy with it, but to me it sounded perfectly acceptable.  Videos and pictures look spectacular on the display, and there's a playlist option for music.  All in all, pretty impressive for a phone meant for email.Display - Gorgeous.  Absolutely flawless.  Pictures look amazing, it's a pleasure to look at the screen.Connectivity - Again, no 3G on this device.  Unless you need to use data while talking on the phone, you won't miss it.Speaker - LOUD.  Not awesome sounding, but better than most mp3 players' built in speakers.Reasons why it gets 4 starts instead of 5 - MicroUSB, why?  Why remove the miniUSB that SO much of my other electronics have?  I hope I don't lose the charger . . . It can be a little laggy occasionally.  It's tough to find good accessories for this particular model.  It was $150 with a contract, why no accessories?  It should be much easier to find a good skin and screen protectors.All in all, the device is fantastic.  It's smaller than the Bold and the Tour, the screen is outrageously good, and it's a pleasure to type on.  I'd highly recommend it.
This a great blackberry phone, i would recommend it to everyone. The camera is awesome. My volume key has been stuck for a month after i got the phone. But in overall a great phone
i just love this phone and i love all of it's features. It has almost everything you can imagine and demand from a single phone, i hate touch screens because they are not as advanced as they should be, that is why I chose Curve over the storm. Believe me you will definitely enjoy this phone.  It takes amazing pictures and videos, I had so many phones and non of them had even closer quality camera, even though it's 3.2 MP it goes beyond expectation.Buy it, you won't regret it.
it  was  just  on  time!!!!! very goood!!!!!  the product is  great, I love  the  javelin. I LOVE MY BLACKBERRY....IM A CRACKBERRY!
i prefer this phone compared to the bold.the size is perfect and 3G not so necessary. also, better priced.
I upgraded from my Sony W580i and I'm very happy I did.  I wanted a qwerty keys because I text more than I talk and this phone was perfect.  The size is just a little larger than my old phone but the screen upgrade was worth it.Wifi access is great, 3.2mp camera, and gps are all nice addons.  G3 and more apps in the app store are needed.Micro usb sucks mini would have been nice so I could have used my old cords but not a deal breaker.  Highly recommend the OEM Blackberry Curve 8900 Desktop Charger (ASY-14396-007) and a microsd card for more room to store music.Great phone!
Great phone, perfect size, not as big as the BOLD but with same features.Good price too!
There is either a design flaw or a very weak antenna on this phone:If it's lying on the desk and shows 2 to 4 bars respectively (never seen it at five bars, anywhere), within 5 to 10 seconds of picking it up, the bars go down to 1/non/SOS-only.  I'd been puzzled for a couple of weeks on how the call quality deteriorated over a call, till I actually noticed the bars go down while I was texting.  It hit me like a light bulb.  I tried different holding positions and angles, and figured out it happens when the lower half of the phone is covered by my hands.  Which doesn't make sense.I know its not my network, because I've been with the same network for 7 years and used several phones by different companies.  My previous, a Nokia 5300, got signals EASILY at places that this BB struggles with.  Just my experience, I'm not a brand person and would dump any phone of any brand if I didn't like it.So... it doesn't matter how many bells and whistles its got, and if it looks like a cellular version of brangelina.  If it doesn't work as a phone, can't give it more than 3 stars.However, 3 stars BECAUSE of its form factor, looks, and just how good it feels, plus no other major hardware or software concerns.  The battery life is awesome compared to other phones and brands I've used.  I'm finding it extremely hard to give this phone up.  But I might have to, since it doesn't work too well as a phone!
Todo llego tal cual como fue descrito. Excelente tiempo de entrega. Buen producto y vendedor.All arrived in good conditions. Fast ship and delivery. Good seller. Thanks.
I bought it, and brought it to Venezuela.Brand new.... and works perfectly with MOVISTAR.I sincerely recommend it.
I purchased this phone a couple of days ago and am going to keep it.  I was using a Blackberry Curve 8320 prior to my purchase of the 8900.  First impressions:  1) gorgeous screen; it is the reason I made the switch from the 8320; web pages load up without a glitch; 2) the keys are closer together and not as comfortable or easy to use as the keys on the 8320; they are not bad, though, and I've easily gotten used to them; 3) the 'pocket' case that came with the phone is too small; I know that the Blackberry cases tend to fit snug upon first use, but this case is incredibly tight; I have to use so much pressure to push it in and pull it out that I fear I will break the Blackberry.
The item is non original or new. I need to exchange for another. No case original (case of curve model 8320). No sims card. No CD. I need to return.
I purchased this item to compare it with my Motorola Q.The GPS system is well worth the cost along with theclarity of the pictures and screen. This cellphone ismore than a smart phone making it among the top sellingphones on the market.
Any person that buys this BlackBerry cellular phone its going to be very satisfy with it and every time it uses its going to rate it with a 5/5 star rate.
Excelent phone, work fine with Movistar, Venezuela. No software upgrade needed. It's lightweight, small and have a good resolution.
I was very pleased with my purchase of the Blackberry Curve 8900 phone. The phone met all the specifications of the seller and arrived in tact, on time and with all of the advertized accessories. I am a totally satisfied customer!
The Javelin it's one of the best phones tha I ever bought. so I recomend strongly.
Best Blackberry ever. Being a Blackberry user for some time now i can say this is the best Blackberry device. Sleek, light and better looking than the rest BB devices. Looking forward for 3g version now."
THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED ON TIME AND BEST OF ALL IT WORKS...CONGRATULATIONS FOR THE GOOD SERVICE AND PRICES...
The Blackberry Curve 8900 is true to its reviews. It has the weight of a feather but the functionality of your own little army. The menu key opens a plethora of applications which you can always customize via download, and the manual in pdf form helps you out if you get lost along the way. The Blackberry Desktop Manager allows for easy transference of files, music and pictures between your BBerry and laptop. Overall a great for functionality and of course..it's a great phone LOL !!
i thought i would never find a better phone than the bold but this is by far much better, its smaller, faster, the camera is great, its a must have for bb lovers...
Hi, I'm from Venezuela and would like to know exactly if the phone is AT & T or Tmobile phones only work here because these companies
This product isn't for me so I'm not sure exactly how to review the product but I did get the product as described and am happy with the shipping time and the condition of the product. Thank you.
i gave 4 stars because the battery life is not good. the rest of the cel phone is perfect.
The curve is a downgrade from previous models. WiFi and gps barely work. You need a very strong signal for wifi. No 3G. The most annoying part is that you will have to change all your chargers and adapters because they changed the connector. The old mini-USB cable was very handy because it is shared by many manufactures so it was very easy to find someone to help you out in case you run out of battery on the road. Not anymore. Do not waste your money.
Blackberry does not honor their warranty.  If you must get one, buy insurance.  The USB connection breaks because of poor design.  I have had two fail.  One had insurance, the other did not.  Blackberry claims that this does not happen and WILL charge you $180.  There is no escalation.  I got the device back with a broke screen and no battery (new one too).  Poor design, poor software, and the worst customer support.  You have been warned.
I need the tracking number of this buyed, because i didnt received this item yet
T-Mobile is sticking to its guns with this one: consumer phones. While the functionality is certainly there, the look and feel of the 8900 doesn't even come close to that of the Bold. The slightest finger print or stain makes the Curve look like a flimsy, underpowered tool. The keyboard feels cheap, and so do the trackball and other buttons. I switched to an unlocked Motorola A1200 because of T-Mobile's underwhelming phone selection a few years ago, but this time I may very well switch carriers. If you want something more impressive, go with the Blackberry BoldBlackBerry Bold 9000 Phone, Black (AT&T;).
I've had this phone for about a month now and I have to say it's a very pretty and excellent phone to own.Sound: Excellent. Nice and loud.Battery: It'll last you a good 8 hours (full charge).Internet connectivity: Can be faster. Maybe it's because Xperia isn't too popular in the U.S. quite yet. When AT&T; supports it, it will most likely improve.Response time on touch screen: Pretty good. It can be faster but I'm satisfied. Those of you with big figures or no finger nails will need the touch pen included with the phone.Features: Solid. The customizable panels are a neat touch to the phone.Camera: One of the best things about this phone. It's quality of picture is very excellent. And a huge help since it has a flash built in the camera. You can't compare with the iphone camera with this one.Keyboard: I love it. It's the one of the main reasons why I purchased this phone and I like typing on the small keyboard than touching the screen to enter letters; faster respons.Overall, If you're willing to fork over $600 dollars for this phone and if you're a sony ericsson fan of phones, you won't be disappointed.Cons: Internet streaming playback for live tv can use some improvement (in the U.S.) but it will come in time.It's not the most user friendly phone. It will take some time to get use to it. That's all I have for cons.
I just got a hold of this 5800 Xpress Music. This is an amazing new device which shows why Nokia dominates the mobile phone market with a big choice of innovative designs and experiences suitable for each individual user.The price is unbeatable. You'll keep hearing this line about the price, and when you get a hold of it, you'll agree.This is the phone with the most complete set of features I have ever wanted.The device is light, feels ready for some hard knocks, it is a little bulky (compared to my trusted E51:).Update to the latest firmware 11.0.008, and you'll feel much better about the usability of this deviceIt's not quite "touch" sensitive, but "press" sensitive. This proves to be an advantage, since I'm more in control when I use the device on a bus, train, boat or tuk-tuk (a 3 wheel vehicle, with 2 stroke engine, sort of a "Thai Model-T" seen all over Bangkok).The switch between portrait and landscape mode, is actually much simpler and quite natural once I got the hold of it.I set up access to my GMAIL account within 2 mins.Messaging App, Options->Settings->Email, say "Yes" to Define Mailbox, Enter Email Address, Password, choose POP3 or IMAP4, and I'm connected to my GMail Account!You can choose the best way you see fit to enter text1. Handwriting recognition  Took 5 minutes to get used to it. I don't quite like writing in block letters, but the 5800 handled fast writing quite ok. I'm overly critical of all current handwriting recognition products, since they don't even come close to the Newton, way back when I could expect my own handwriting to be recognized.2. Small QWERTY keyboard  Most typically used in portrait mode but much more readable than WinMobile keyboards3. Full QWERTY keyboard  It felt more stable than the iPhone QWERTY keyboard. I prefer to "press" the keyboard as is needed with the 5800 XpressMusic.  I don't like the iPhone QWERTY key since it's too sensitive to touch and I can't type when I'm on the move. I've never been able to get used to the Blackberry or E71 style full QWERTY keyboard.  The 5800 XpressMusic full QWERTY keyboard switches to landscape mode and feels almost right that I have to use 2 thumbs to reach all the keys...almost like 2 hand typing.4. Alphanumeric Keypad for traditional one-thumb typing with T9.There's a really cool driving game that shows the 5800 XpressMusic sensitivity to turns. You literally hold the phone with both hands and "steer" the car!The media player (from RealPlayer) is much improved, allowing me to play more types of VDO format files. Quite useful to get the nice video podcasts downloaded and find that they are actually viewable on the device.The Music Player is the same. Sound quality is really good through the speakers.The Media Gallery is a little static, with all files arranged as a grid. The N95 Media Gallery would be a nice touch.You will soon see many useful applications on Nokia's range of "touch" handsets.This device requires developers to publish a Symbian sdk5 version of their application.We tested a few apps released for Symbian sdk3 devices (N-Series and E-Series mainly), and they almost always worked without any changes.
It is definitely a cool gagdet. I took one star away because call quality is not great. Maybe it was my phone in particular, but sometimes voice faded in and out, especially when the signal is not at its highest. After I updated the software, the voice fading stopped.Web browsing is pretty simple, as is switching windows. The full size Qwerty keyboard is great for IM.Although not many applications have been made for the phone, it has everything you need, and it comes with a sturdy case that fits snuggly and protects. Great picture quality (the flash is a plus), the contact shortcuts on the homepage make it easy to get in touch with people, and speakers are very loud.I do have problems with the clock though, it loses at least 30-45 seconds per day, and when I notice it is 10 minutes behind. I've read in several blogs that other owners have the same problem.Other than that, really happy with the purchase!
Nokia 5800 is defineitively an awesome mobile. the Toucgh Qwerty keyboard works justs perfect and is very easy to use, handwritting recognition works fine after calibrating your handwriting. Software is very responsive and stable.Music sounds just great, radio station tunes very good. Easy software to use. Lock button is most than convenient.Is the best mobile i tried from Nokia. Buy with confidence.
I recently bought this phone and I have to say that It is the First XpressMusic I buy 'cause I've always been a N Serious fan. But, I'm totally amazed with this phone. It has the best features and is not that big as the iPhone. I totally recommend this phone. Nokia's the best!
nokia xpress music is great for music and movies. Touch screen is ok . If you are a internet user than dont buy nokia xpress. When u are using internet Touch screen is very troublesome. I find iphone and google g1 very user friendly. Battery life is awesome. Overall its good. If you are not heavy internet user then i would recomend it.
I can do almost everything with one hand, it websurfs, gets my gmail, does text messaging, takes pictures, movies, mp3's, supports all kinds of file formats. I wanted to get an iPhone, but now I think I'd probably get an upgrade of this one for my next phone.  Apple better not take any breaks as long as Nokia puts out phones like this.
For the price, this is an amazing phone. Connecting it to the home wifi took less than a minute. The browser is fast and the best I have experienced on a mobile phone so far. You can switch from  landscape to portrait mode or vice versa by moving the phone sideways, which is useful for getting a better overview on different websites. It's possible to watch YouTube videos - including YouTube videos embedded on other sites like EduTube. The screen is quite big and surprisingly high quality (640 by 360), so watching YouTube videos on the phone isn't much different from watching them on a monitor. The interface is nice and intuitive with big clear buttons. I like the fact that you have different options for typing (handwriting, mini qwerty, full qwerty, alphanumeric), although those with big fingers may need to use the stylus even in full qwerty mode. Few people mention the phone supports not only Java but also Flash lite, which means not just video but also a lot more applications and games which are supported.As has been mentioned the touchscreen is not as good as the iPhone, but that is not a critical factor for me. With respect to the price (much cheaper) and features (e.g. better camera, handwriting recognition, YouTube videos, many additional features supported by the Symbian O.S.) I think this one is a much better deal.
First of all i will really like to commend amazon on a job well done when it comes to the ordering aspects of any item. As you may know amazon is only 1 of a few online site which accepts international credit cards and also the shipping and billing address does not have to be the same. HATS OFF TO AMAZON. Apart from that great factor, the nokia 5800 is really a wonderful phone and  the price is with a doubt very reasonable. so thank you again amazon,i can safely say in the future i will be doin business with you once again.
The Nokia 5800 is a further evolution of Nokia products worldwide. I had waited long for the touch screen from Nokia and finally arrived.congratulations
This phone is awesome, and everything works out of the box. I used its GPS Navigation to travel from store to my home :). It is all plastic, so light in weight and provides a good grip in hand. Nokia improved symbian60 platform a lot. it is much faster than older s60 phones.
I love this phone - I am getting it as soon as a North American version is released.I just wanted to point out the 3G frequencies.Europe/world: 3G HSDPA WCDMA 900/2100North America: 3G HSDPA WCDMA 850/1900Both have regular "Edge", data would still work in north america at a slower rate .. but you need HSDPA (on the right frequency) for the fast stuff. (as of Jan 18th, the phone still isn't officially available on NokiaUSA.com)Don't forget, it does have Wi-Fi. Also, both versions are quad-bad the voice frequencies would work anywhere.I can't wait.  a Music Phone, touch screen with stylus, GPS, Symbian OS and Java compatability : A LOT OF APS !
Anyone looking for a good smart, light and small phone should seriously consider the 5800 XM. The display is huge and the screen resolution is perfect.Also, new software for the Symbian S60 V5 is popping everywhere now.Great phone!
im very happy with the product and from now on amazon is my choice over ebay
This is simply one of the best phone in the market. User friendly and easy to get use to it. If you are looking for light, slim, solid phone, with great features then this is your answer..
This phone has the best overall specs I've seen on the market so far. Even most of the unreleased models fall short. This means Nokia 5800 is ahead of its time.Pros: superb resolution, speedy performance, intuitive design, excellent music player, solid call reception, battery life, application plentiful, price tag and much more!Cons: none!
if you find anything wrong. RETURN for REFUND immed if possible.Purhcased at NYC flagship store. I had the phone working for 1st 5 days. When the battery started to discharge, i tried charging. It didnt charge at all. Store gave me new battery saying battery was at fault. Again same issue. It wudnt even turn on with the charger connected - so clearly its not just battery problem. By the time this battery discharged , the 14 day return period was over - pretty sure they knew it.Then started the saga of sending to nokia service center - PALCO. Already sent 4 times. each time had to ship back same evening or next day. Same problem for "repaired" "replaced" and "repaired again" phone.First they claim its "repaired", then 2nd time they claim "cannot be repaired...so replaced"...why did they send it then?but the so called replaced also had same issue - how can this be co-incidence?again sent...they claim repaired....but same issue.When i call....they dont agree to send me a courtesy phone since its clearly their mistake and 4 attempts are enough to figure out im being cheated.They wont give me refund or replacement.They wont even agree to send me a email saying they take responsibility to resolve the issue.5 is not my lucky number....i have no hope it will get resolved.looks like they will continue playing ping-pong till end of 12 months.WORST set of people.Bottom line: NEVER BUY UNLOCKED PHONES- even if its nokia flagship storeNEVER BUY NOKIARETURN WHEN YOU CANAND FOR HEAVENS SAKE DONT GET WITHOUT WARRANTY
Don't get this review wrong, the phone's feature/functionality are simply GREAT.. but thats if you get the properly working one..so far this is my 2nd Nokia Tube(returned previous one since it was defected), and im still getting some issues with it..1) screens goes to different colors(similar to when you used to have the old phones, u know how you press the screen the whole screen goes green/purple?)2)phone restarts/frozen when clicking too fast from applications to the next.3)when typing text msg-screens goes total white(happened to the previous one that i return also)4)during calls.. voice of the other person goes loud and soft back and forth(real annoying)Despite those big CONS...this phone did came with tons of nice accessories along with the box. Features of the phone are REAL NICE... thats if the phone is working properly.. but until they really fix all those bugs and etc... i would hold off until they release the 2nd generation of it.but don't get me wrong.. "Get it!!" .. just good luck on receiving the properly working one...
Pros: O telefone celular eh um bom aparelho, bons recursos e facil de utilizar.Contras: Produto produzido para o mercado asiatico (possui como opcoes de lingua somente o ingles e outras linguas asiaticas), nao veio com uma caneta extra, nem com a capa de borracha (como vi algumas vezes na internet), tive problemas em utilizar o GPS (o que veio com o celular nao funcionava direito e precisei baixar o Google Maps).
What is the international version mean? Is there Chinese input method for international version? Does N96 also have International Version? Thanks!
This phone hasn't gotten as much hype because the operating system that came as default was pretty bad.  Once I installed SPB Mobile Shell 3.0, it turned my phone into an awesome phone.  You can customize everything and I would say it's very similar to Google's new android phone.  The camera is great at 5.0 megapixs.  The wifi, FM Radio, internet browser, built in mail, Excel, Work, Power Point.  This phone is the real deal and much better and more customizable than the iPhone.  Not to mention it comes with 8 GB of storage.  I would strongly recommend this phone!!!
Thought it would be perfect with all the hype about it, not at all. The feel is okay but not performance.
This phone is perfect for my husband who breaks everything. He had the samsung rugby but hated it because he is a little technologically challenged. This phone is tough and easy to use. He loves it!!
Bought this phone for my husband. He LOVES this phone. Bigger and heavier than most phones but he doesn't mind. He likes the ruggedness of this phone plus it is loaded with great features too.
I Do not recommend, Screen to small for GPS use, On phone ring tones are few and annoying. 3G is slow. The Motorola V365 BLK is a smaller version of this phone, no 3G but for the price is a better deal.
I am a graphic designer/photographer looking for a phone that would allow me to read my mail, download and read attachments and browse the internet while I am on the road.The LG 500kp fulfilled my expectations and more.The different functions of the phone is easy to learn. It is small sleek looking and handy.In my down time I can entertain myself with games or music, or watch a movie.My only concern is it seems it is not sturdy enough to withstand the shock if it falls to the ground. I intend to buy a protective case.I certainly would recommend this low priced phone with high end functions.
Thanks to all the good reviews this phones has, I decided to buy it to be used in Costa Rica. After a couple of weeks, I can only say that the phone has worked perfectly.  The software is quite easy to use and the touchscreen sensitivity is the right one, you don't have to push to hard to get it to respond.  Power saver helps and lot and battery life is improved when the feature is enabled.  The only thing that's somewhat disappointing is the PC Suite software since I haven't been able to figure out if there is way to update it or the phone's software automatically.
My office mates were drooling when I showed them the phone and the price I paid. Especially considering the costs of unlocked phones. But lets get to the nitty gritty.The Pros. Works great with TMobile in the USA. I inserted the SIM card an viola, I was up and running  I have not had any problems with reception and the call quality is good. Screen is very visible. No more squinting to see the numbers or letters,and it can be adjusted. Battery life is terrific, and it didnt take long to charge up initially. The interface is intuitive, figured it out without the manual.Cons: Touch screen is exactly that. Make sure your speed dials arent on the first screen, unless you dont mind calling them accidentally.  There may be too many options for some people. Scroll bar can be difficult. Best to use the stylus with that one.Great value.
great phone pros *big print *clear call quality* great Game* Quad band etc, buy the case and the screen protector with the phone.cons * last one day without charging *
Muy buen telefono,  llego en el tiempo esperado, exelente servicio. lo unico regular es la camara le falta el auto foco.
I bought this unlocked phone to replace my Motorola Razor about a month ago. My contract doesn't expire with AT+T until a few more months, but I needed a replacement phone to tie me over. The nearest AT+T tower is about 180 miles away. I live in an area of the US that is sparsely populated and so having a good signal is very important when travelling. So considering my location I understand that I will not get a full signal. The razor, before it died from water damage, performed very well on picking up a good signal.The sidekick3 doesn't perform well in this comparison. Very seldom do I have more than one bar of reception inside a building, even standing near a window. When I go outside on a cloudless day, I may get two bars. I get texts randomly showing up 2-3 days after someone sends them. There are times when I have a decent signal my phone will not let me send out a text. Once when the battery ran out, all my data and contacts were erased. During a phone call, the person on the other end complains of the scratchy sounds over the receiver.Having the full QWERTY keyboard is a feature that I do like and makes the phone agreeable, otherwise, I would not recommend this phone to anyone who lives away from a large town/city.
This phone is very slim and has most of the basic features for the users who want a phone just below par with a smart phone.It's ability to send multimedia and listen to music (MP3), radio stations is great!. The colour is attractive to both male and female. The flash comes in handy when you're looking for small items in your car or at home especially at nights.
.I like the phone a lot. It has some features I have to have.  One is a USB charger.  Others are a good speakerphone and bluetooth capability.  It is also a slim design.  While it fits in my pocket ok, the glass faceplate has broken four times on three of these phones (I have an unlocked GSM phone I use in Europe).  You can buy new faceplates for a couple of bucks on eBay.  If you buy this phone, go ahead and order a couple so that you have them.Now, if you keep it in a leather pouch, the faceplate will survive longer.  My current phone has not lost one yet, but I can see one corner is coming up. I tried gluing these on with epoxy.  It doesn't work.Aside from this one hassle.  I love the phone. I'm about to buy one for my brother, but I will be ordering at least four glass replacement fronts, just so I won't have to wait if one breaks.  They cost about $5 for two and are shipped from China, so it take a couple of weeks to get them in.  Hence the advance purchase.NOTE THE GSM phone is slightly different from the Verizon version.  the GSM phone is narrower.  Both are beautiful phones.  They look elegant and people who see mine are impressed with it.Pros:  Sleek sexy looks.  USB power, camera, speakerphone, and Bluetooth.  It also has MP3 capability.  I don't use it for that.Negatives:  Glass front breaks frequently.
This is phone is almost everything I wanted it to be.Just to begin, I use AT&T; and I actually get better signal now then I did with my old phone, which I bought from AT&T.; I have five bars almost everywhere, including places where friends with AT&T; have no signal.It has a great fairly high resolution screen that rotates based on if the keyboard is out or not. The video quality is pretty good for a phone and the point-and-shoot camera actually produces very nice pictures. The "touchscreen" actually only functions if you're using it to dial a number when the keyboard is closed. It is by no means a significant control mechanism.The software has a very clean look and is very easy to manage -- every feature is where you expect it to be. Also, it has many ways to instantly check messages or create a new text message. It also has a cool feature where is lines up your messages with the same person as though it were a chat, which makes it very easy to remember what they said last. However, using that line-up method, I've had a lot of trouble with it chopping off the ends of messages, but if you just use the regular view, it's not a problem. Also, referring to the software in general, I've had a number of instances when it froze temporarily -- annoying, but not common enough to really be a problem.The phone itself looks great. I have mine in a somewhat chunky case, which really detracts from the way it looks, but without the case it's very sleek and gorgeous. Also, even though it's a slider with a full keyboard, it's very thin and light. The buttons on the front and the keyboard are a good size -- not so small you can't tell what you're doing, but not too big, either.And the battery life seems to be really good. Off of one full charge, it stays alive for three or four days of regular talking and texting before it dies.And just a heads up, the charger that I got was actually a European charger with an American adapter, which works just fine, but it makes the charger really bulky, so it's hard to plug in behind furniture. Also, my manual came in what I think is Romanian, but there are plenty of manuals available online, and the phone is so intuitive it wasn't really a problem.Overall, I really like this phone, and I'm glad that I got it, even though there are definitely less expensive unlocked phones out there. Sure, it sometimes glitches on me, but it's never been anything severe. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a durable, QWERTY keyboard phone.
I think it needed to be very clear that this IS an international phone and not for use with ATT. It would have saved us a lot of hassle. It did not mention this in the internet ad.
Vibe Cellular's FAQ clearly states will work with AT&T.;This LG KG360 phone will not keep a connection with the tower.We worked with AT&T; tech support for an hour. It goes from zero bars (no service) to five bars standing in the same place. Two other AT&T; phone get five bars in the same physical location. Moving SIM cards from a "good" working phone to this LG KS360 does not improve the reception. NOTE: The LG's SIM card worked fine when placed in another AT&T; phone. We were able to get one call in between signal fluxuations, however, if it doesn't work as a phone, it it worthless.Clearly a defective phone. I have asked VibeCellular for a refund. With a 30 day return policy, can't trust and exchange. That would drag this out beyond the 30 day credit card charge back limit. Now I can only hope I can get this resolved quickly, as this was a birthday present for my 15 year old daughter.
This is a low end phone intended to entice customers to buy long term contracts with Canadian cell companies like Rogers. The phone is cheap and the one we purchased suffered an internal screen break after a month. It was not dropped, did not get wet, did not freeze or anything like that--in normal use the screen just broke. We had to buy a new phone since it would have cost nearly as much to fix the LG piece of junk as to purchase a new one. We bought a Samsung.this is a scam product which Cell phone service providers get for next to nothing, then use to convince you to buy extended service contracts.
Your product was just as you said wich is very important for a buyer.Also when I had a problem your customer service was just amazing.Thank you very much.HeidaSouth Dakota
Web site was misleading and did not supply enough information to make a valid decision.  Customer service seemed very uncaring.  They did not care that I was unhappy with their service only that they got their "restocking fee."  They didn't even bother answering some emails.  I'll never deal with them again and I have become wary of dealing with Amazon because of the bad experience.
This phone has been good. Great texting. Couldn't ask for nothing better but I think it should have a part for touch when texting. I thought it was big but its a nice small neat phone.
This phone is slick, well-packaged, cute ,and easy to use. Everything works great. It is a flip phone and can be opened easily with one hand. Setting up this phone was a piece of cake. It has a very crisp, high-contrast display. Call volume and quality is very good and the music player sounds great. The soft keys can be programmed for a quick access to the frequently used apps (alarm, calendar, etc.). It came with an adapter plug which can fit any A/C plug.
The international version of this phone of this K1 does suck as you have to download a monster pack here in the USA for this phone and if you're not careful and don't know what you're doing you can even make things worse for the phone when doing so. If you want a KRZR K1 phone i wouldn't suggest buying the international phones such as the UK blue. So many people have had problems with them here in the US. Now the US phone is excellent and I have never had any problems with mine. Infact I love the phone and can't imagine ever getting a different phone.
GPS does not work. USB Mass storage does not work. No memory card. Battery dies in 2 days.Other than that its a great phone.
The curve is a downgrade from previous models. WiFi and gps barely work. You need a very strong signal for wifi. No 3G. The most annoying part is that you will have to change all your chargers and adapters because they changed the connector. The old mini-USB cable was very handy because it is shared by many manufactures so it was very easy to find someone to help you out in case you run out of battery on the road. Not anymore. Do not waste your money.
We purchased this phone as "new" and it arrived missing components that should have been in the package, not to mention the fact that the camera and flash were crusted in dirt/scum, and it just looked "used".  The cover doesn't close well...it leaves a gap when closing.  I attempted to contact customer service today immediately and was unable to get through.  I left a message and am awaiting a call return from Vibe cellular.  Hopefully they will take care of this quickly since this phone was purchased for a visiting relative who lives in another country and is leaving next week.  We are highly disappointed with this purchase.
I buy a new product and they gave to me used, the blackberry curve 8310 i purchased is sulphated because the sticker on the back that indicates contact with watter is red what makes me think it has, beside that i cant instal the blackberry featrures because the phone is not entirerly unlocked. I would like to hear an answer from you because i want to chance the merchandise."

The company offering this product, OEM, states "These LCD are tested and they work 100%." This is a blatant lie. The screens have the connector cable torn off or damaged, so they do not function at all. When I complained I was told that a lot of people had the same complaint. They said they would return my money, but they have failed to do so. DO NOT BUY FROM OEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would like to thank whom is concern for the perfect purchae i've ever done.every thing was recieved with no harms.but it took allot of time, & the main problem i faced was that there wasn't any method to track the product via our post service after it was shiped to Saudi Arabia, which was a bit scary that any one may loose his item.Many thanks.Farid
Very Much Impressed thus far...nice size in comparison to other smart phones, good battery life and nice reponse time. Everyone loves it. I LOVE the Footprints....
GREAT PHONE, I LOVE IT. EXCELLENT FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE CONNECTED WITH WORK, GPS, WIFI, BLUETHOOH.ALL YOU CAN FIND  IN ONE PHONE.
I've been looking for a new phone for a long time now (my previous phone was the Razor) and this is the phone I decided to buy to make the switch to a smartphone. This phone has possibly the best non-touchscreen design in the world. The phone fits great in the hand, and everything about it screams high-quality.Some pros and cons:Slide out keyboard: + Great sized keyboard, possibly the best thing about this phone is how easy it is to type on this keyboard. - Minor complaint: A fifth row for numbers would have been nice, but the phone does have a number pad right on the front that you can use to avoid pressing the function button - Minor complaint: They could have easily made the spacebar bigger.Face: + The buttons above the number pad are very easy to press (they put the HTC Fuze to shame) - Possibly the only legitimate drawback of this phone is the screen, it isn't as large or as high resolution as some touch phones out there. If you're buying the phone for games or videos, this isn't the phone for you.Body: + Overall construction of this phone is high caliber. It makes most Nokia phones feel like a kids toy. + The back of the phone is made of a soft material that feels good in the hand, and doesn't attract smudges or scratches. - Minor complaints: the battery cover is a little hard to take off, and the microSD card slot is underneath the SIM card. These are both things that you'll be doing rarely though.Software: It runs WM 6.1 Standard, and it behaves pretty much exactly like you would expect it to. Not much to say here.It may seem like I'm complaining more than I should be for a phone that deserves a 5 star rating, but the truth is that the positive aspects of this phone far outweigh the few complaints I have.The reason I bought this phone is for the same reason that I originally bought the Razor, although it doesn't take 10 megapixel pictures and allow you to take calls underwater, it does succeed with both style and design.Finally, if you're interested in this phone also read the reviews for the HTC S740, because it's almost the exact same phone.
Bought the HTC S743 after my ATT "Fuze"/HTC Touch Pro was stolen. I looked at some of the new WM phones (HTC TiltII) and didn't like the idea of carrying a heavy phone shaped like a bar of soap.I'm a tough consumer to please when it comes to phones. I had the first HTC Tytn before they were available in the US - my heavy, soap-shaped, phone days are long over. I liked the sleek unique style of the original razr; the touch response of a iPhone; the power of windows mobile; the keyboard and email management of Blackberry and the outdoor screen visibility of Nokia....so I've had some trouble finding a phone I like until now.I know this HTC S743 ships with Windows Mobile 6.1 and that means no touch screen...no "cloud backup" no "remote wipe" and no "widgets"... but to tell you the truth, I'm getting burned out on silly widgets and I think I'll wait for someone else to beta test the remote wipe features! On the other hand, getting a WM 6.1 phone as a newer OS is launched, means that there will be deep discounts on this phone. Lower prices are a great thing.I want current news and this phone comes with a great RSS reader. After using touch screens for the last several years, I've found that I miss fast, one-handed control and an easy to use PHONE feature - HTC 743 is great for this. I want MS Office - WM 6.1 satisfies that need.  I want browsing speed, tv, photo contacts - that took about $40 in add-on software.  Added  free "SkyFire" for that Opera Mini look-and-feel.One handed use is a breeze....that means you can actually use the phone while walking the dog, jumping in and out of cabs, carrying packages and otherwise living your life.  When I have time to chat and browse - the keyboard is easy to use. This phone is sleek, powerful, "tetherable" and contract-free.  I hope this helps you make a decision.
The phone is a great product. Battery life is excellent. I've gone three days full without recharge with heavy useage of the FM Radio, Music and talk time and only now seeing the battery colour change from blue to green. (colour changes according to battery strength: blue = good to excellent/fully charged; green = medium level; red = time for recharge). Does not support MicroSDHC cards but if you can find an 8GB MicroSD card, you're well on your way.The overal feel of the phone is good, nice large 3" screen to view your photos and videos. Picture quality is good as well for a 3.0 megapixel camera.Supports dual text input (querty onscreen keyboard + manual key input like that of basic phones). There are a lot of features that I like including auto off and auto on. Supports phone lock. While it doesn't support voice or picture dial, it makes a great companion especially as it supports two sim cards meaning one can simultaneously run two different phone networks from two different providers on one phone.Drawbacks:1. The unavailability of software to use the com port as a dialup modem especially in areas where one may not get internet while travelling. I haven't done a comprehensive search as yet but it looks like it may be emulating one of the samsungs. Somehow it is identified on some computers as a samsung (the removeable drive part that is). If I find something, I'll be sure to update this review. That's why I stopped short of giving it a 5 star rating.2. mp4 support is spotty. Depending on the encoder used, you might have problems playing back. So be sure to check carefully what encoder is used. It's best to stick with avi.It does come, however, with a spare battery, microphone/headset combination headphones (could be a bit more dynamic) usb charger both for wall and pc.Finally, bluetooth speeds are exceptional. This completely blows away my Motorola W510 in terms of bluetooth speed transfers. That alone is an added bonus. All in all, a good phone and I'm satisfied with my purchase.
OK..to start, I gotta say that the FREE shipping from Amazon SUCKS. So, if you want good shipping, dont use the FREE shipping that Amazon offers. Why? Tracking is horrible, tracking history is completely inaccurate.(I used the nokia N82 before)IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BUY THE CELLPHONE, READ THIS REVIEW. I THINK IT WILL HELP A LOT. IT IS LONG, I KNOW.Moving on, the cellphone is good for the price. Come on, where will you get a 300$ cellphone that has all the functions that this one has? It is insane: 3.2 camera, touchscreen, more customizable than iphone, external memory, etc etc.Regarding the touchscreen...I think it is personal taste.. I never used the iphone, and I think that this touchscreen it is VERY responsive. AFTER buying this phone and getting used to it, I used a friend's Itouch and I gotta say that my nokia 5800 is the winner. But as I said, it is personal taste. Still, it is a very responsible touchscreen (no matter you say that it is a resistive touchscreen)..like, you got no excuse..it is responsive, and it is responsive. PERIOD.Good things about it:-Starting to have more apps...you just gotta know where to find, for FREE.-MACRO of the camera is awesome.-I got the GPS with turn by turn voice direction (trial), and it is a dream. I wont know when they take away my trial...however, with voice direction, this thing it is a real GPS.-The media button is pretty useful.-It is legit that it unlocks when you take it close to your face when you are talking.-Speakers are also awesome. Super loud. Sound quality when you plug in earpieces are also really nice.-I love the cable to plug it in to the tv. I convert videos, put it on my cellphone and lay on my bed, plug the cellphone into the tv and voila. It is REALLY nice.-About apps. Right now I have 42 but I only use maybe 8 of them lol.-The screen it is mega-clear. It is one of the best screens ive seen.The "so-so" of this phone:-Build quality. It is pretty well built, however the screen it is TOO plasticky. When I put it under the sun, the reflection shows a big difference in the surface, I mean..it is not completely flat. Using the reflection of light you will realize it is not completely flat. In other words, the screen presents big flex (like in laptops, for instance). However, the rest of the cellphone is well built. If you take out the screen part of the cellphone, it is a pretty solid cellphone.-The camera. I dont know. Sometime it takes great pictures, sometimes it stinks. When there is too much suns, it doesnt work well. When there isnt light, it also sucks. It has to have the right amount of light.-For some people it may be ok, but this is a freaken fingerprint magnet. only the back cover it is mate. The rest of the cellphone devours fingerprint as a dinasour.-Battery life it is not the best, but not the worst.The bad:-The interface it is not the friendliest. It could be better. I hope that with the update, it will be user friendlier.-The screen. As I said, it is too flexible. It kills me to see differences with the reflection of the light (you know what im saying if you have the cellphone). It makes me hella nervous.-Sometimes the phone in landscape mode, when you want to scroll down or up for example in some setting, it is freaking hard. I always keep tapping the wrong thing. in vertical mode this doesnt happen, because the scroll bar it is sticked to the right of the screen, so you dont have margin of error. however, in landscape mode the scroll bar is in the middle of the screen, so it gets tricky.-Honestly, the phone it isnt the best looking phone in the market. It is just a chunk of plastic. (This is for people that care about appearances. I personally dont care, but im trying to be objective)Ok, I think this is pretty much it. If you read this, you may decide whether to buy ir or not. I think it is a pretty good phone for the price. If you are RICH and money it is not your main problem, I would say go buy yourself a N97. Oppositely, I would say definitely go for this cellphone; I like it pretty much. You wont regret it (however, remember all the things I wrote in this review). If you are ok with the cons of this cellphone, you wont regret. And in my opinion, the Pro's overcome the Con's so... I dont know, it is your call!I hope this helped.
I had owned various phones in the past and Nokia is the best on any comparison, for the Features available on this phone, had Apple had all these features it will cost 10 times more, most people don't even know it has extra camera on the front for video Calls along  with the 3.2 MP on the back, Video is far better and there were no sluggish performance as far as I had used for more than a month, unlike iPhone this phone can run multiple applications at same time which is like multitasking in PC, so I can play music and browse websites at same time and switch to GPS , attend a call and type an SMS.. And it goes on...all at same time, iPhone cannot do more than one at a time, we get millions of free software, games, themes etc., unlike Apple App store, no need to pay more and more. Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price.If you like Garmin for GPS, Garmin GPS software available for this phone and installing that will make it the best GPS (it comes with Nokia's map software too) and no data plan or internet required for GPS as maps are copied to memory. It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that.It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone.And FM is there to use while driving and at the Gym, Google has lot of software available for this phone like latitude, docs etc. If you want free chat software Fring ([...]) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users. It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically. We can import and export all contacts from outlook, Lotus notes etc.And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too.For brand conscious users like me, I want to buy a phone from a telecom company like Nokia than a computer (apple) or TV (Samsung) company, who were just trying phones as one of their business.iPhone doesn't have many of these features and only selling because of marketing, if nokia did their part, this should beat any phone for sure, I don't want to lock with AT&T; for lifetime with iPhone and pay $ monthly and pay for any applications and did I say its unlocked? What else you can expect from a phone?
i buy this phone bcos i want to use it as phone and i-pod like i-phone, i use t-mobile service which is far cheap than at&t;'s i-phone service..now i already use this phone for more than a month..first what i like about the phone1 it has 3.5mm audio jack where i can connect any speakers to use it as mp3 music player its at top like i pod.2 8gb memory card enough to hold your likable 100 songs,10-15 videos and 1 movie in it.like i have in it.3 sreen display quality is good.video quality is also real good4 wifi is good. and browser also good loads all kind of web pages.it dont play flash videos..big no no for me..5 gps also work great..its capable of giving your exact location when you are on road... i load whole Texas(us) maps on it and it takes 200 mb of my space..but if you have web connection on phone go with google maps application. nokia's ovi maps are far behind google. for usa ovi maps dont works great i dont know about eurore or asia..6 desktop shortcuts are good but we need more than 4.7 calender,clock aplications are good.8 camera flash is bright i load torch software on phone and i can use it as torch  also.dont like abou the phone..1 cheap plastic body of phone.dont robost as nokia phones..shaking body.2 camera picture quality is too bad.. it is 3.2mp only to take space consuming pics.. clarity of pics is too bad and there little color difference in pics too..picture quality is little better when outside under sun.camera really disappoint you.3 not easy to access the  lists like phonebook. you have to scroll by using side scroll bar. you dont scroll the list from contacts like in i phone. and there is no up-down buttons on phone.if you have long list of cantacts like 150 and you want to scroll from scrollbar.you are unable to stop on contact you want from scrollbar it run too fast.(long list same scrollbar).4 when you have to dial the number in between of call like-->slect 1 for english 2for spanish -->some time it dont take your input value..i remember lot of times teller machine told to "hung up and try again".bcos it dont get the input from me..5 no security for data.. anybody in your family or friend can access you photos,videos,masseges etc there is not even a simple pasword securiy on phone.. pin number only works when you restart the phone.6 screen unlock key is provided at the side of phone.which is sliding one i dont think this key lasts long time.because every time i have to use the ihave to use that key..even to look for time.. in i-phone u can unlock phone from screen itself and in samsung touch phones this key is push button key not the sliding key.7 no outside music controls like pause/play,next.you have to unlock the phone for pausing or selecting new song.8 data cable provided with phone is too small.i have to buy aconnector for it to increase the length.otherwise your phone is hanging on desktop.9 audio quality when you use the headphones is not impressive even my 20$ 2gb mp3 player has better sound quality.even with higest volume and full bass you dont feel your head shaking.its just your hearing songs on it.without quality sound.8 3.2 inch screen size..its big but its not like i-phone i-phone's 3.5 inch has square kind of size.but 5800 if too long lengthwise and too short with wise.many time i think of returning the phone.. but i dont find any other phone in market which fulfill my reqirements.. i dont want to carry ipod and phone(two gadgets).i dont want to pay 100$ a month for i-phone AT&T.;  and nokia 5800 for only $299.think its good deal.. this phone needs a lot small changes..
I had been looking for a new phone for a long time.  Every phone in the AT&T; store and at their online site just did not seem to be attractive.  Sure, the iPhone is great, but I didn't want to commit to a 2 year contract with a required $30/month data plan attached.  And I can't replace the battery myself?  Can't use the phone as a wireless modem? Hmmmm, there must be a better option.  Hey, what's this?  An unlocked Nokia phone that doesn't require a monthly data plan and I'm not locked into a 2 year contract?  I can use the phone as a modem and the battery is easily replaced?  Too good to be true?  Actually it just gets better from there.  Don't want to incur data charges? Just go find a local wi-fi spot and you're online in a few seconds!  Oh, its an incredible music/media player as well.  The built in speakers are the best I have ever heard coming from mobile phone or any other small device.  If I turn the volume all the way up I can rock my office when I am alone, otherwise I need to turn it down or plug in the headphones.  Did I mention the GPS?  Very nice feature for a phone, but it was a little slow giving directions during a trip to Seattle recently, still worked ok and helped me find my way around town.  I signed up for the free trial and it was useful, but my Garmin does a better job, but the Garmin was more expensive than this phone and that is its primary function. Still a cool feature, but that's not what I bought it for.  First and foremost I use this as a mobile phone!  You know, talking to people the old fashioned way, by voice.  And this phone does that function flawlessly as well as letting me access the internet either via hot spots or through AT&T;'s 3.5G network (must mean that they're half way to 4G), which blankets Southern California and worked well in Seattle too.  The other features you'd expect are present as well, a decent 3.2 mg camera and video that are fun to use, 8gb of micro SD storage and easy USB connection to your computer for uploading your favorite tunes, which you can use for your ringtones. So if you want a great phone that does just about everything an iPhone does and a few things more, for less and without a 2 year contract and a required data plan, check out this Nokia, you won't be disappointed.  In the interest of full disclosure, I have to admit that I signed up for an unlimited data plan for $15/month that does not carry any commitment, I can drop it at any time, but I enjoy being able to look things up or access my email while away from my office that I have continued to use it.  Also, don't be concerned that this is an unlocked phone, its too easy to set up if you have an existing phone you are replacing.  Just slide out the sim chip in the old phone and slide it into the Nokia.  Pop the battery in and you are good to go!  Now go have fun!
Worked okay the first few days, but then the following problems slowly began:1) When I get a call, sometimes it beeps and vibrates like it's suppose to. Other times when I get a call it does nothing until a few seconds later when it beeps to tell me I missed a call.2) When online, the browser will sometimes just freeze up or close without warning. When it freezes up, sometimes the only solution is to pull the battery which sometimes causes all settings and information to be lost. I have to back up the phone nightly for this reason.3) When my calendar alarm goes off, sometimes it will beep and vibrate like it's suppose to, other times it will just beep without vibrating.4) When my alarm goes off for a calendar event and I try to press either the 'snooze' or 'stop' button, sometimes the alarm won't stop.5) When I click on an event under the calendar, sometimes it opens the details of the event, but other times it opens a small window with the options of 'delete' or 'send'.6) When standing outside, the GPS may pick up satellites within a minute or so, but if I turn it off and try it again, it sometimes takes up to 20 minutes to locate the satellites again while standing in the same location. I can stand in that same spot with my Garmin GPS and it will pick up the satellites every time within a minute.7) When opening a video on YouTube's desktop version, half the time, instead of playing the video, it just shows the flash player icon where the video usually plays. (I tried deleting their latest application update and this seems to have fixed the problem.)8) Calendar events no longer show up on main screen.I went through 3 Nokia 5800's which all had the same problems. Nokia's support was horrible. They had me perform a hard reset and update the software on all 3 phones multiple times only to have the problems return after a few days. After many calls, resets and updates, they told me to do it again. I eventually refused and explained to them that performing a hard reset and updating the software was not a solution. They said I had to then send it in to them for repair. I reluctantly agreed. When they returned the phone, I found out that their "repair" was to perform a hard reset and update the software once again. Surprisingly, it didn't work.Amazon's support and return policy on the other hand was EXCEPTIONAL!
works great in the bay area with att signal. had the iphone before and it was mediocre with such slow internet over a 3G connection. This phone has an excellent antenna. I live in probably the worst areas for a cell phone to operate and this thing constantly gets 3 bars better than any phone before including the iphone. this phone also connects at mostly 3.5G (HSPDA) where not too many devices do which is like driving in the carpool lane - very fast download speeds. The mp3 player works great, sounds good. It is very easy to load music files into the phone either via usb transfer mode (fast) or by bluetooth. The internet is very functional and stable. Can open youtube videos, yelp, etc. Google maps can be downloaded and is better than the iphone version having more integration with the web browser and some other feature.Email is great, easy to setup with predefined profiles of gmail and other known sources.  This phone also has a dedicated GPS chip and a assisted GPS chip so if you want you can use the maps software included with the phone and get turn by turn direction, re-routing as well as POI's via telenav maps. It also has acompass via GPS but i havent used it yet. The battery is quite good, lasting over 2.5 days with average use before needing a charge. Theathering can be done via bluetooth and you can use this phone as a high speed modem for your laptop. just make sure you use wap instead of isp and you don't get all crazy, using the std data plan on att of $15 a month you get a pretty good deal. The camera takes decent shots during the day but is quite shotty at night or in low light. The LCD screen is not as vibrant as the iphone and the touch screen is good enough but i feel could of been better. Also the phone's screen is more easily scratched than the iphone since it's made of plastic and not harden glass. but all in all,i'd say for under $300 its a solid deal considering your data plan is halved each month.
hi, first lets setup my parameters. I am a Tmobile subscriber from Tampa Bay area.  My reception is the highest available. I have owned in order a Ericson from the PCS days, a Panasonic from ATT/Cingular days, Nokia 6120, 6131, Tmobile Dash, Tmobile Shadow, Nokia N95 8GB (for 3 weeks but then the display went out and i got scared to want to replace it so i returned it. Please also note this is my second time owning a Nokia 5800. The first time was a European model with US warranty since i got it from the Nokia Flagship store in Chicago. That had the first firmware with no updates...and it sucked. Sucked so bad I sold it used because I couldnt wait for the firmware upgrade. So now we advance to today. And with great relief, I tell you people that this Nokia 5800 Nam is an outstanding smartphone.  The most current firmware 20.0.012 has made this Nok great. I know this because I have owned both.  I take off .50 because no the UI is not as pretty as the Iphone, nothing is when it comes to touch. the other .25 is because when you activate the pretty animations for the touch interface, it does slow it down. So I do turn it off to keep it running smoothly.  This is a best seller for Nokia, therefore they will continue to give us better software updates to make it run even smoother.  Their is no crazy ear piece problem.  The phone feels so easy fitting in one hand.  This cant be said of the Iphone.  The Iphone is awsome yes, but its kinda big to use as a cellphone. ok let me real this in. The phone works great clear LOUD speaker phone, great fun snap shoot digital camera, great flash abilities to stream web content, great call quality, very pretty screen.  As for the touch method, the iphone once again is kewler and smooth however the resistive touch screen is CLEARLY improved and does not hold you back. Clearly the firmware upgrade tweaked the sensitivity and made it much more responsive.  im all over the place with this review, im sorry. if only Nokia could do better marketin partnerships and get this to a local Best Buy so people can touch it and feel how great it is...that for me is one of it biggest selling points...
I bought the Nokia 5800 from the Dell website for $220 plus taxes, in July 2009. I ordered the silicon case & screen protectors from Amazon.I'm very happy with the phone! I use it for phone calls, texting & quick photos where I'm too lazy to get my camera out of the box. The camera has a "flash" feature! I love the handwriting facility with the stylus & the haptic feedback. Conversation quality is great & the phone is very user friendly. I have no problems with the battery life (though I charge my phones daily out of habit).I would have liked to have more than 4 images on the "desktop" for quick dialling. The option for video call is a nuisance, though you can avoid it by touching the phone icon from the contacts UI.At this price, its one of the best phones! It has sold more than 6.8 million units globally. Before I bought the phone, I read the user reviews on various sites. This is definitely a great phone for people who want a touch screen phone for regular use. I haven't spend much time surfing the net or testing apps because thats not how I want to use my cell phone currently.Unlike the iPhone, this phone has haptic feedback, good battery & it lets you add memory cards. It is also greater value for money.
I've Nokia 5800 XM for over a month and I love the phone. Well worth every single penny. Interface is not as good and as intuitive as iphone, but trust me you'll get used to it very soon. Music sounds very good and the external speakers are very good, could be louder, but hey this is a phone not a boombox.Like:1. Freedom - Being unlocked there are no restrictions on this phone (No more jailbreaking)2. Excellent feature set in the price range (sub $250) - Bang for the buck3. Very customizable4. True multi tasking - Run multiple applications at the same time just like your PC5. Sync/Transfer files via Bluetooth (Finally you can use bluetooth as it is designed, not just for headset)6. Handwriting - I hate little dinky buttons and I can write faster than I can type7. Turn your phone into wifi hotspot (joikuspot)Dislike:1. Interface is not very good2. Installing too many apps can make your phone sluggish3. Horrible camera4. No VPN (Well there is Cisco VPN Client for IPSEC, but just doesn't work)5. Could be thinneriPhone comparision:Well, I had an iphone and didn't like all the restrictions that Apple and AT&T; had on that. You've to jailbreak to use many advanced features and worry each time you upgrade your firmware, if it is going to kill the jailbreak. Besides that you've to be with AT&T; forever, atleast as long as you want to use iphone. AT&T; doesn't let you unlock the phone even after the contract perid, pure insane. Well, you can get iphone unlocked after jailbreaking. But there is no guarantee that future upgrades won't kill that. All in all iphone is far superior hardware (and so it thrice as expensive unlocked) but your Nokia 5800 XM won't let you down.
I have purchased this product in april '09 and so far I am impressed with it. Being a nokia phone user for years, I am well accustomed to the features and interface even with some technological changes (like touch screen). The features you will read here are just some of the highlights I think is usually overlooked but as important when using cell phones.Pros:Data management. An example is for contacts. You can easily select and transfer phone numbers to and from the sim card. This is a must when upgrading to a different phone without bothering to use a computer. Try that with a blackberry pearl you will see what I mean.Unlocked. You can use most gsm sim cards from around the globe. (hint get prepaid sims available in most major cities) And this option is a lot cheaper than having to pay international roaming charges. Another plus is that you are not tied to a network so you can switch whenever you like.Price. I think this is one of the cheaper phones which has touch screen capabilities without having a contract (of 2 years usually) and no data plan required. This was 350 USD when I bought it and has gone down to 300 (as nokia is trying to put out a newer model)Cons:As with other reviews, the plastic battery cover needs to be a lot sturdier. It bends easily as it is made of softer plastic (maybe to prevent it from cracking or becoming brittle?)Thicker dimensions. Not as sleek as an iphone as it is NOT an iphone.Apps for it is still limited, but expect it to grow over the years.
Ever since I have used smart phones, nokia and symbian s60 has been my favorites, my last two phones being the n95-3 and the e71.  I was hoping to hold out until the n97 but decided to give the 5800 a try.The phone itself is built very solidly for a midrange phone, there's no worry about dropping it and having it break on you, the screen is also very nice, this may not be the slimmest phone out there but it feels very comfortable in your hand, and the resolution looks amazing.  I have a minor concern with the battery cover, it seems like it was more of an afterthought in the design of the device, there is no buttons or latches to secure it, just a few tabs that u click it into...I hope this doesn't break on me quickly.....but I don't see a need to be removing the cover very often, as the memory card and SIM card are inserted through the side, meaning this phone can have its memory cards switched very easily.The user interface seems like a quick and dirty job, it is basically the s60 v3 operating system with some bigger icons to make selection by touch a little easier. Not a major overhaul on the operating system basically everything looks the same as previous nokia smart phones, the camera, video, and music interfaces could have made better use of finger controls in my opinion.Another major concern that hopefully will be alleviated soon is the lack of third party apps, I'm assuming this operating system is still an infant and over time developers will start adapting their existing apps to use on touch devices.Handwriting recognition is my favorite input methods, although the full screen QWERTY comes in a close second.  The t9 keypad works great for one handed operations, and the mini QWERTY keyboard is a joke.I was disappointed to see that the US version does not ship with an extra stylus, NOR DOES IT HAVE A CARRYING CASE.
I've had this phone for about a month.  I've used touch screen phones that my friends have (iPhone & Omnia), but this is the first I've owned.The touch screen works very well although it did take a little to get used to.  I am impressed with how accurate it is.  The full querty keyboard is easy to type on.  Surprisingly I'm even able to use the mini querty keyboard with my fingers although it's really designed to be used with the stylus.  I noticed some people voicing displeasure with the resitive touch screen.  I think most of these came from users with early firmware versions.  After using it for a while now I'd say it has both advantages and disadvantages over a capacitive touch screen.  I think scrolling is easier on a capacitive screen.  It's not hard to scroll with just your fingers on a resistive screen, but in some applications when you need to use the scroll bar the bar is a little to narrow and it's difficult to grab the slider.  In this case using the stylus works better and makes scrolling very easy.  The option to use a stylus gives you very precise control.  A resistive screen is less fragile and can be made more economically which helps to keep the price down.The screen is bright and clear.  The resolution is great and I like the 16:9 screen format for watching movies.  It can be a little hard to see clearly in bright sun, but I haven't found a screen that isn't.It's loaded with extra features and functionality like the built-in GPS receiver which means it works even when you are out of cell phone coverage although it does take a little longer to initially find your position if you disable the assisted GPS (A-GPS mode).  The other advantage is you are not forced to pay for GPS service from your cell provider.  The FM radio works well, but I wish the antenna could be built-in rather than relying on headphones as the antenna.As a phone i think the reception and sound quality are excellent.I am a little disappointed with the camera quality in low light, but from talking with others I think this is a common problem for most camera phones.  This issue can be minimized with the camera settings if you know what you are doing.  In medium to bright light the pictures are very good.  I really didn't expect this to function as my main camera.  I just wanted a camera that was always with me and could take decent photos if I didn't have my main camera with me.  It serves that purpose well.My only complaint with this phone is that it uses micro USB and doesn't charge over this connector.  A mini USB connector is much more common (I have 6 or 7 of these cables already) and I'm sure they could have fit this into the phone.  It uses a separate port for charging.  You can buy a charging cable which will let you charge from your PC (or any powered USB port), but it still has to use the charging port on the phone.  This seems like an oversight, but maybe there is a reason for it.Battery life is good although it will certainly be affected by how many of the radio features you turn on (wi-fi, bluetooth, GPS, FM radio) and how much you use the video screen in addition to the cell phone use.Overall I am very happy with this phone.  There are certainly more expensive phones out there if you are willing to pay for them, but this one has a lot to offer for a more reasonable price.
I've only had my phone for a couple of days, but it is FANTASTIC.  For someone new to smartphone technology, it was a very easy transition.  I toyed around between the iPhone and the Nokia 5800 and Nokia won out.  While the iPhone is a really great product, Nokia had features that it didn't have.  For one, the Nokia 5800 is capable of recording video and sending MMS - something the iPhone does not do.  It's great because you can switch out the memory cards (and EASILY) where as the iPhone is either 8GB or 16GB, no changing memory cards if you want to.  The music quality is fantastic on the phone and I think the touch is really great.  Picture quality is also better than the iPhone and the resolution is beautiful. I also love how there are so many shortcuts on the phone!  I also love the side-locking feature. It's quick and easy to lock the phone so you don't have to worry about accidentally pressing buttons. Basically...this phone is fantastic especially price-wise!!!
POST-SCRIPT (8 December 2009):Applications have failed to function twice within 6 months of owning it. It was reformatted two months ago. Looks like I'll have to visit service centre again for the same problem, i.e. music player and shortcut bar have both failed; some photos are partially obscured. Thankfully their service centre attended to it promptly; unlike an Apple ipod I bought years ago when the battery needed to be replaced. But really, who wants to repeatedly visit a service centre and reload files. Bottom line, this is my first Nokia and probably my last! Absolutely disgusted with the product!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW (19 August 2009)If you're looking for a 3G cell phone with wi-fi connectivity and large memory (maximum 16MB capacity), the Nokia 5800 Express Music is perfect. It surfs the internet with relative ease, links to RSS feeds, plays on-line radio stations (listen regularly to KVOD in Denver and SWR1 in Baden-Baden, Germany) and downloads podcasts.  The browser can be magnified similar to the Opera browser application. The 3G networks in Malaysia work well on it.Applications for Symbian 5 touchscreen phones like the 5800XM seem to be minimal, and this might be a drawback for some. Nevertheless, I've found many 3rd party developers with applications and widgets that fit my needs, among these: WorldMate, Psiloc World Traveler, Office Suite, AccuWeather, Phone Torch, Level, Scientific Calculator, YouTube, Google Translator, France 24 News, AP News, GPS with Garmin, Scratchpad, Mobbler for Lost.FM, Facebook,, MySpace, Twitter and NimBuzz,  to name just a few. Some are free while others may be purchased on-line.  Some Java applications work well too, as do some Symbian 3 applications. Gaming applications are also available.Using a touch phone takes some getting use to, and the Nokia 5800XM is no different. This is especially so when scrolling through the address directory. It can be very fast and a contact can be overlooked with much frustration. Nokia solves this problem with an alphabetical keypad; simply key the first initial of a name and it compiles a short-list of names.The media player is terrific. It is indexed with an FM radio, Podcasts, music player, video player. The sound is sufficient for my needs and I've stored hundreds of music files, that play instantly at a touch on the desktop.The 3.2 megapixel camera uses Carl Zeiss lenses. It focuses with a touch, hold down and it snaps photos easily. You can resize the photos or add special effects to it. With some 3rd party applications you can do some photo/art touch ups as well. With Nimbuzz application you can even video conference or carry on video calls with the front lens.Data can be downloaded via Bluetooth or Mass Storage using a cable. With Bluetooth only small data can be downloaded since it is received in the Message folder that is placed in the small megabyte and fixed memory chip.The Nokia 5800XM is indeed a great little pocket computer. It does many things very well. Unfortunately, it's application glitches devalue its worthiness.
This phone holds and manages everything for me, although some software wasn't included (mainly office apps i.e. exel, word, ppt, pdf programs) for a small fee or sometimes for free you can download alot of business applications from the Nokia store (OVI)and other websites like Adobe; new applications come out to catch up with the phone's software version (S60 v.5); it's a great altervative if you don't want to be a an Iphone zombie j/k...it is responsive to small area touches like a finger nail or the stylus. It doesn't do well with your whole finger unless the icons are bigger. I surf the web and listen to radio (yes an FM radio is on the phone)at the same time. It has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. It has several keybords you can switch between which is handy for switching between entering passwords and typing a text message. Some pics don't display in the browser but the browser that comes with it is pretty well thought out I think updates will come as time goes on and it's rare something doesn't display but it was something i noticed. I have the Black phone and it is very sleek and attractive. I am happy with my purchase don't believe I over spent and may actually save in the long run by it being unlocked (I didn't have to purchase a more expensive plan, like with I phone).
****Please note I'm reviewing the United States version of this phone. I'm happy for every 5800 owner in another country who no longer has to deal with the issues I'm about to address below. As far as I'm aware at the time of this writing the US has not had the firmware support you have had and so these issues still remain in this country with this phone.****The positives: Good music player, very lightweight, expandable memory, no contract necessary, can run multiple apps at once.The negatives: Resistive touch not desirable and imprecise. Navigating menus/functions is more difficult/time consuming than it needs to be on a mobile device. Camera is terrible. Battery life was sketchy (good some days, terrible on other days). Looks like a kids toy or candy dispenser.The unacceptable: I have to say that I'm very surprised by the number of people who review this phone very positively on Amazon and elsewhere and yet seem to report the same problems I had when I owned this phone. Dropped calls, dropped internet connection, dropped GPS, frequent locking/freezing which requires the battery to be removed then reinserted. I had all these issues, constantly. I cannot imagine how anyone finds this acceptable and is glad to own a phone that you can't rely on.Contacting Nokia for support was a mixed bag. Nice CSR on the phone, but the only suggestion was to send in for a replacement. I've seen enough of these reported problems to believe it's not just a few bad phones out there. This seems to be a systemic problem. Suffice it to say I returned this phone on day 29 for a full refund.Those interested in touch screen mobile devices would be better served by looking elsewhere. The Droid and of course Iphone come to mind. Nokia needs to prove they've got a handle on this technology before they should be trusted with your time and money.
As somewhat of a tech-head with an eye for detail and quality, I had searched widely to find a smartphone that offered the best blend of features and quality without breaking the bank. The Nokia 5800 honestly impressed me, though not so initially, but after a couple weeks of usage it has the tendency to grow on its user offering a solid and sleek feel, gorgeous display, and outstanding audio (the audio is really that good, through speakers and earphones alike, especially with stereo widening enabled, it is truly an experience). In addition, the touch-enabled Symbian OS (even though it is still maturing) is quite responsive and provides a user friendly experience. What I can say is that the UI was designed with the correct balance of animation and snappiness (animation effects are turned off by default, activate them through Themes > General > Options > Theme Effects). If the UI is not that eye-catching for your taste, there are thousands of themes you may download and apply, in addition you can even design your own theme through Nokia's Carbide.ui software (downloaded separately). What's more is the variety of apps available for the phone, I can recommend a few that I have found quite useful: Photo Browser, Handy Shell, Paint Pad, Phone Torch, Opera Mini, AccuWeather, QuickOffice, GoogleMaps and Fring.  (google them to find out more)Another aspect that truly impressed me is the phone's ability to act as a mini entertainment system. Bundled with the package is a certificate which allows you to download $50 worth of movies from Amazon. I got six movies (both hi-def and mobile versions) for this price and they all fit on the 8 Gigs of hot-swappable storage that comes with the phone.  In viewing the movies on the phone I was impressed at the display quality (16M colors, 640x) and more so with the audio quality - the stereo speakers were loud and rich, able to simulate the acoustic depth of the movie and I must say that it rivals some laptop speakers I have come across.Another highly important aspect is the battery life. For the first few days of owning the phone, it was constantly used, testing out the Camera, GPS, Wifi, playing movies, installing apps, etc. and with such constant use (which is unusual for a typical user), the phone was able to operate for a full day and a half before the battery warning kicked in.  Now I charge the phone every three days or so with a few daily calls, light web browsing and YouTube playback. (A tip for you is to make sure you fully charge the battery with the phone off when you get it initially, it operates and keeps it charge as it should this way).The phone's camera is quite decent in my opinion. It shines in daylight conditions able to capture great photos and widescreen videos of surprising quality. In low light conditions, you may have to play around with settings a bit and get as close to the subject as possible to get the best possible result. Overall, the phone's camera could be better given the quality of cameras on previous Nokia products, namely the N95, but this judgment is relative. I believe, however the choice was made to make it affordable, given the fact that it also comes with a front-facing camera for video calls.Final thoughts and tips about this interesting piece of hardware center on its value, quality and reputation as a Nokia branded product. Some say it rivals the iPhone, and honestly, it does have more collective strengths as a smartphone than does the iphone in spite of its resistive and non-glass touch interface. It even has a downloadable simulation of the iPhone's interface called MyPhone if you prefer that flavor. In this light, the phone shines as a more flexible device with swappable memory, battery and service, features not present in the lauded iPhone, but I say what's to compare? In short I chose this phone and adore it now due to its form-factor (not too big, not too small), its screen, its expandability and flexibility, its hardware features (GPS, Wifi, audio) and most of all, its competitive price/quality ratio.
I've had this phone now for a little over a month.  I can tell you that after using it for this length of time that it is an excellent phone.  It can do more than any other touchscreen phone out there today.  The only two phones that can even come close are the iPhone 3G and the BB Storm.  This phone can do more than either of them two.  The camera gets dogged a lot, but in all actuality, it does a pretty good job when taking pictures in bright outdoor/indoor light.  The front facing camera is an outstanding feature and works very well.  The Video (which iPhone does not have at this time) is very exceptional as well; even more functional and better quality than the camera still shots (odd eh?).  The virtual qwerty is very nice and has all the keys in the right place. I also have an Eternity, but the layout of the 5800's keyboard is way better (don't make me dig for my apostrophe Samsung!) >:[.  Also, the haptic feedback is awesome too.  The vibration actually 'feels' localized and not just vibrating the whole phone.  The call quality is top notch, not sure why some reviews say other wise, but compared to previous phones I have owned, this was on par with my old Nokia E51, and better than my Eternity, Quickfire (what a joke), SE w580i or LG Vu.  I've had other phones too, but they were very basic phones and were also Nokias.The OS is still a tad bit immature, making its crossover to the touchscreen.  However, it is still very stable and functional for its 'immaturity'.  I love how they managed to keep all the previous capabilities of the S60 3rd and include it into a very well packaged bundle what is now called S60 5th Edition.  I love the 'tap and hold and slide' to copy and paste things.  It is so awesome!Syncing is great as usual.  I downloaded the iSync plug from Nokia website and was able to sync my calendar and contacts via bluetooth flawlessly!  Also, PC Suite worked like a charm as with any Nokia phone.The sound is best in class.  I don't think anything out there can compete with the sound quality that this phone puts out.It's still a new phone, been out only about 7 months now.  But they provide excellent firmware support (3 to date) and are constantly looking for ways to improve performance and enhance any existing features if not, they even add more useful features.As for all the other features (gps, radio, messaging, browsing); it does them all very well.  I have no complaints.  Probably the only drawback if there were one, is the fact that this phone can do so much with its Symbian OS that you really need to read up and research all the things it can really do and how to do them.  This phone's OS has a very rich Symbian ancestry.It's an excellent phone and I honestly believe that this phone is best in class and overall compared to the other phones currently out there.  I would even go so far as to say I am glad I did not wait for the N97.  I know blasphemy!  But it's true.If you get this phone, you will not regret it.  Just keep in mind that it does come with plenty of features and the OS is very 'sophisticated'.  Oh, by the way, I do have to admit, that it is very nice to have a 'Smart Phone' that can use the internet and check email without having to pay any PDA fees.Kudos Nokia!  Keep it up!
Well, all I have to say is that this phone is amazing. It's light, beautiful and It is a really smartphone. You can download and install a lot of apps from Ovi Store (like you dowmload apps for an iPhone from the iTune store). You can keep your 4 favorite contacts on the main screen. I had an iPhone and I sold it to buy this awesome Nokia 5800. I also upgraded my Nokia 5800 to 16GB (something you can't do with an iPhone). When I bought it I thought 3G was not going to work in my town 'cause it says that this is the U.S. version and I live in D.R. But, 3G works perfectly with Claro which is the only communication company that provides 3G in town. I totally recommend this phone. 5 stars!
I have used lots of different phones, from the basic Razr flip phone through several different Windows Mobile & Blackberry smart phones, and even the greatly over-hyped iPhone, and this is by far my favorite phone!Symbian has a lot better performance and stability than Windows Mobile. The Nokia 5800 is more fun than a Blackberry. And the iPhone? Well, it's really just a "feature" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone. The iPhone is great for what it can do, but terrible for what it can't do.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a truly useful and functional communication and entertainment device. It is the best convergence device I have used to date. It excels as a phone with great call quality and RF reception (I get 3G signals where other phones barely get 2G, or even no signal at all)! As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback. And as a web/communication device it has one of the best mobile browsers available (full HTML with support for Java and Flash) with applications available for popular IM and social networking sites (ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, Googletalk, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and more) and email with support for attachments (POP, IMAP, SMTP, MFE). And since it's all controlled by the Symbian multi-tasking OS, you can use just about any combination of applications and features you want (within the limits of the phone's memory)!Nokia has been supporting this phone well with several major (free) firmware updates since it was released late last year. Be sure to update to the latest firmware, because there have been significant improvements in performance and stability, as well as new features added.It's small and light weight with reasonably solid construction. While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket.It's about as loaded as you can get feature wise. Besides what I mentioned above, it's got tactile (Haptic) feedback. Accelerometer. GPS with A-GPS and navigation software (Nokia/Ovi Maps). Dual-band high speed HSDPA 3.5G (WCDMA 850/1900 MHz) and multi-band international calling support (GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHz). WiFi 802.11g network support. 3.2MP camera with auto-focus, dual-LED flash and video recording (plus a 2nd front camera for video calling). FM Radio! Media player (audio & video) with "Flight" mode for use during airline travel. Photo browser. Multiple input options (full screen QWERTY, mini QWERTY, T9 with predictive text, and handwriting recognition). Expandable memory (microSDHC 8GB included, can accept larger cards as well). User changeable battery. Really loud and surprisingly good sounding speakers. 3.5mm Nokia AV connector (for standard stereo headphones and audio/video TV output). Bluetooth 2.0 with support for Stereo audio (A2DP & AVRCP). Speed dial. Voice dialing (SIND speaker independent dialing and voice commands). PC sync software.The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS. But because Nokia markets this as an XpressMusic phone, you can use it with AT&T;'s cheap medianet data plans, or just use WiFi without any data plan at all if you prefer (I've got unlimited data for $10/month on the family plan).You simply cannot beat this phone's combination of features, performance and price!
Absolutely, without a doubt - great phone!Most importantly, it has WiFi!!! You can always switch between cellular and WiFi and that's a huge money saver!!! I'm on the 'pay as you go' (AT&T;) type of plan, which is the most convenient way for me to stay connected, when I want to be... Having a regular cell phone plan for me personally, is not an option - I hate to be 'on the leash at all times'! Can't wait when Nokia releases Skype edition for 5800! I know it's coming! Battery life is awesome ... three days, always ON and still going. In spite what other people say about cheap looking, made in China and all that - I totally disagree. There's nothing wrong with its looks! Navigation's pretty simple and easy, unless you have banana shaped fingers?! Other benefits: 8Gigs micro SD card (up to 16!), headphones, strap and stand, USB cable, charger, etc.Reception's quite well, but it's all about the area where you live in, I assume. Haven't tried it as a GPS device yet, though. Check out Ovi Nokia Store too. Great apps for whatever you need.
First let me start by saying that I've owned this phone for a month already and im VERY HAPPY with it.  It feels solid in your hands it does not freeze at all, like the n96 when you fill up the memory. Before i bought this phone i owned the nokia n95 (great device) and the nokia N96(more memory but not so good)  The only reason i did not give this nokia 5800 five starts its because of the camara quality which by the way is good but the n95 and n96 were better quality camaras and also video recording capabilities.But It Works a lot faster and with a lot less or none problems so far than previews owned nokias. I Think Nokia  could have done better in the camara area, Other than that nokia took a big leap from the symbian 3rd edition to the fifth touch screen base.  making the phone very user friendly and simple to use, yet adding a lot more features and ways to get to the applications quicker.  it supports a 16GB memory card to store a decent amount of music video and pictures(it comes already with an 8GB memory card). the battery life (VERY IMPORTANT at least for me),  is great.  Much better than the n95 and n96.I can go a hole day surfing the web and playing with the phone and the battery does not seem to die.  There Is A Shortcut for almost everything from the main screen that can also be customized to your four favorite contacts being able to see all the recent activity like calls e-mails or text messages and place calls from their picture icons.  this phone can be used as a router which is great if you are carrying  a laptop and do not  have a network available the phone can provide it for you. it also comes with an amazon coupon of $50 to download movies from amazon unbox (another plus). Music Sounds  clear and loud with hidden speakers. If You Are Planning on buying a nokia i really recommend this one over the n95 and n96 ( if you like touch screen) . E-mail settings is very easy the phone automatically recognizes the servers and ports  from the e-mail you are typing in like (yahoo,hotmail, gmail ect). it was more complicated with previous devices to set up e-mail accounts also GPS works faster and better on this device. In General its the most refined version of symbian working better in every aspect.  If You Are Going to buy this phone i strongly recommend you to buy it on amazon the price is a lot cheaper and the cust service policy and people are a lot more linient and reliable that the nokia ones (nokia cust serv SUCKS) Good Luck.
This is a simple intuitive phone to use. The touchscreen is very responsive. The display is absolutely gorgeous. Web browsing is a tremendous experience if you use Operamini 5. Call quality is very clear. I could not ask for better reception. The Music player is good. The phone feels very solid and firm in my hand. The battery is not as strong as my N79 or N78, but it lasts a day, with very heavy web browsing (3-4 hours). That's probably due to the touchscreen. Videos play very well. Again, picture quality is magnificent.This is a very powerful phone that takes time to learn and get the most out of. So, be patient and read the manual. I say this because there are more things you can do with this phone than you can imagine. At the current price this phone is a bargain. It feels a little heavy, especially when one is lying in bed, surfing the web, but not excessively so. I'm an entrepreneur, so I use this phone for business and for my own personal entertainment. Bluetooth works fine. From reading some of the negative reviews here, I think some people have not taken the time to learn how to operate this phone. I can't compare the touchscreen to Apple because I have never owned an Apple product. But I can say unequivocally that the touchscreen on the 5800 works extremely well. Some apps require a single touch, others require a double touch. After a while, it comes natural what to do. After owning a N78 and N79, I can say the touchscreen is a big improvement over a physical keypad with buttons.After using this touchscreen, I'm not sure if I can ever go back and embrace a more traditional phone again.
From the moment I opened the box I was pretty impressed. I wanted something different from what everyone else has and At&t; only has the same tired stuff. From the 8 GB memory card (for lots of music & games), all the cool attachments (earbuds w/ a tiny remote, tv a/v cable, etc...), GPS, and a bunch of cool apps already set up in the phone. I was sold. Granted, I was just a little bit disappointed with the 3.2 MP camera (but who cares! Thats what digital cameras are for). I've never had the i-phone but I work w/ someone who has one and she can't make video calls with hers(hee-hee)!! In conclusion, I really think its a great phone from a reputable company.
This is absolutely amazing phone for the money. It has all the features one can possibly want in a phone. Here are some Pros and Cons. The only reason it did not receive a 5 star review is the lack of commitment from Nokia for the US release of this phone, in terms of firmware updates which are long overdue. (UPDATE: They have released several firmware fixes for the US version and it is amazing. PLUS FREE NAVIGATION SOFTWARE, beat that i-can't do anything-Phone)Pros:-Amazing interface and ease of navigation-Has great GPS Function. Nokia maps is awesome and for good measure you can get Google maps to work even better with this device.-Sound is spectacular on the headphones and not too shabby coming from two built in speakers.-Great array of apps online for use as a work phone or a entertainment phone.-Great colors and touch screen response.-Most importantly great sound and connectivity during calls.-Decent camera not great in the dark.Cons:-Nokia doesn't really care too much about the US market when it comes to this phone. No 3G on T-Mobile and No firmware updates that have been out in other countries for some time now.-Little buggy and sometimes can freeze and needs a restart. This is why they need to release a US firmware update really badly.-The dial pad lacks letters that correspond, so if you are calling tech support that has e.g 1-800-WHAT good luck figuring out what WHAT is numerically.-Battery is kind of lacking but what touch screen isn't.-A little thick but not too bad. Other dimensions are perfect in terms of hand grasp for texting and emailing.-Definitely not a camera phone despite its great Carl Zeiss lens.Overall:If you want to put away your ipod and still be able to listen to music, have a good navigation system, be able to SMS/EMail quickly, read Office documents WORD, EXCEL, PPT, PDF on the run, maybe squeeze in a few games, and have a stable OS interface (for most part) this is really a great phone. I forgot to mention it actually is a great cell phone in terms of call quality. I did not want to get the G3 from T-Mobile because I am tired of the commitments and have Google force everything down my throat kind of like Apple has been doing to their customers. This phone has gazillion free apps that are actually useful. You will be able to squeeze a lot of use out of this phone on the cheap and enjoy doing it.
Firmware updates for the 5800XM seem to come every few months and the system automatically reboots after but there is also a soft reboot and a hard reboot if needed. I have not used either. For my purposes, mostly music, appointments and alarms, and the phone, it is stable with just 1 exception when the battery overheated while I was talking on the phone and connected to my Wi-Fi. This has not happened again.Kinetic scrolling is what most XM users are waiting for in the next upgrade because current dragging scrolling is not as accurate and is inconsistent depending on what app or utility you are using. The bad news is that the kinetic scrolling will only be for the home screen, contacts, and the browser. I don't think the dragging currently used in the 5800 is all that bad but there is a learning curve if you are not use to it.The browser is slow and sometimes hangs but anyone using the internet knows that sometimes any browser, including FireFox will hang. This is really not specific to the 5800XM. When it stops responding I do the same thing I would do on my laptop or PC, change to something else I was doing and wait for the browser to either respond or I kill it. With the 5800XM simply click on the menu button and get out of there. I have never had to reboot because of the browser. It is, however, slow. I have full AT&T; 3.5G coverage (7 bars) but the browser still works faster over Wi-Fi. Response time is supposed to increase with the new firmware.On icon screens the 5800XM requires only a single tap to open but on some of the menus 2 taps are required. That is real confusing until you get use to it. The upgrade may fix this as well.Supplied documentation is basically non-existent other than for just general operating instructions but there are tips and hints tutorials on the net.Outside, the camera takes crystal clear pix. Inside takes a little tweaking but there are plenty of options. The new firmware is also supposed to contain a camera enhancement.The auto-orientation screen rotation sometimes gets discombobulated but corrects itself in a second or so. Some screens don't rotate but this is addressed in the next release as well according to the Nokia USA discussions forum.The speaker distorts sound if it is set at max but although I would expect better from a phone advertised exclusively as for music, it is typical of almost anything I have had plus I usually have on the earphones so the sound in not on max that makes this mostly a non-issue for me.There is built in Flash player but it does not work with version 9 so some of the videos you want to watch online simply won't play until this is upgraded in the firmware.Mine and some others have a small open area on the top right side where the top screen section of the phone meets the main phone section. You can see it real good if you hold the top of the phone against a white background, look along the side and front and between the 2 black sections. It almost looks like someone took the phone apart and did not put it back together correctly. Dust and even hair can get below the screen. I keep the phone in my pocket at all times so I don't see where this will be an issue and after 2 months, it is not. If it becomes an issue, I will have to ship it to a Nokia Care center so I kept my other Sim-card phone just in case.The issue with earlier European phones that involved a defective ear speaker is not an issue with mine.I had trouble connecting to my home Wi-Fi but once I upgraded my router's firmware, the XM found it without further incident.The GPS turn-by-turn directions through Navteq and Nokia Maps are flawless and the phone comes, if I remember correctly, with a 3 week free trial.The battery life is about the same for any other phone I have had and even better seeing as how I am always listening to music.So, why did I stay with this and not go with the iPhone 3GS? Every phone and every OS has some issues. This is really the first attempt by Symbian at a touch interface and they seem responsive to enhancement requests. I did not want to get locked into a contract in case I move and can't get the AT&T; signal. I don't make or take calls every day so I did not want to pay the minimum monthly for the iPhone. I use Pay as Your Go.It has tactile as well as visual feedback (the key you press enlarges and there is a slight vibration that you can turn off), making typing on the large QWERTY easy and the XM remembers where I use the large keyboard and automatically brings it up with the apps where I use it. It is just the right size and the rubber-like back makes it easy to hold on to. The XM has both primary and secondary cameras. It backs up to both its own folder on your PC as well as synchronizes with my Outlook Express. Also, for all music lovers, the surround sound in the 5800 is the best I've heard on a phone.Some of these things would have totally turned off most people but I searched for over 2 years for a better alternative to my Sprint Palm and the 5800XM is the only phone that fulfills all my needs. The enV Touch came close but it has no Wi-Fi and I could have been locked into monthly fees and a contract. I am willing to put up with a few minor inconveniences while they iron out the bugs. I would not have been happy at all with the alternatives and it is the best phone I have owned.Update 10-16-09 the browser freeze does not happen since I reoriented my Wi-Fi. Version 3 update still not available through PC Suite. Most times Bluetooth works flawlessly but sometimes, under exactly same circumstances, it constantly cuts out and this is reported from people using different BT devices.
this was the review i wrote initially when i gave it four stars...i spent a week online trying to figure out which smartphone i should buy. i required an unlocked gsm phone that would receive the most common 3g bands as well as wifi.  i also wanted a decent camera. i've never used a smartphone before and would have normally tried a few models. only nokia had phones that filled my requirements. i selected 5800 because it has the biggest screen and is the cheapest. the phone performs my requirements fairly well. it feels very clunky but since i've never so much as touched another smartphone, i have nothing to compare it to. amazon service was excellent.the phone worked fairly well for first 100 days. (curiously, the warranty was 90 days.) first, it stopped keeping time. then every time i received a call, it would switch into another function so that the call ended up on voicemail. thinking that it might have needed a software update, i tried to hook the phone up to nokia's pc suite. in the past hooking up took anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour: it never worked the first try. so i spent an hour and a half without any success. i tried the support system in the past never with success. i was able to find a way to send the phone back--i have extended warranty from amex. but even if my phone would be fixed, i would still need to buy a new phone for the interim; moreover, i had no reason to believe the problems would be remedied. instead, i decided to take out my frustration by badmouthing nokia every chance i get for the rest of my life. no wonder that every other cell phone company is taking share from incompetent nokia.
I've had this phone only for a few days now but what a great smartphone! It's actually smaller than an Iphone and has tons of features that actually work. I owned a couple different phones over the last year and I am definitely going to stick with this one for quite awhile. My previous phones were the RAZR V3t which I ended up giving to my wife and my Cect I9+ which is an Iclone but performance-wise is an okay smartphone at best.I wanted a new smartphone not only to replace my cell but to also replace my aging Dell X50v Pocket PC. I feel like this smartphone helps me accomplish those goals. It's pretty fast when it comes to input and using applications. It could be a little faster when switching from portrait to landscape mode. Inputting text with the full QWERTY touch keyboard is pretty fast and easy. Of course you can use the stylus too for writing text as well but I prefer the touch keyboard. I don't have a data plan but I do have a home WiFi network and Wifi at work also. The 5800 found the Wifi signals from home and work easily and once logged into them it's like surfing the web on your home PC except on a much smaller screen! Facebook, Youtube and other websites work and look great on this phone's screen which does pick up a lot of fingerprints but doesn't bother me too much...I'm getting a screen protector and case anyway. Call quality is also very good and the speakers sound really good on calls and when playing music. An 8gb microSD card is already preinstalled and you can expand the memory upto a 16gb microSD. There are a few preloaded apps, games, vids and music. The games are pretty cool--not surprising, remember the N-Gage made by Nokia? A one press media button (located above the screen) pops a menu on the screen for you to quickly select any media you want to access (pics, MP3s, vids, etc.). There are actually 2 cameras--one on the front above the screen can be used for tele-video calls kind of like a web cam. The main camera is a 3.2 megapixel camera with built-in flash which is located on the back used to take digital pics and video. It does a good job good for taking quick snaps when a digital cam is not around but would not replace a higher resolution compact. Pics can be grainy especially indoors and in low-light situations but the flash does help. Recording video is also okay but will not replace a good camcorder.I am contracted with T-mobile as my carrier which this phone is compatible with. I went to several reputable websites (CNET/Gizmodo/Amazon) to compare the ratings on several smartphones. The ones that are getting the most buzz are of course the Iphone, Blackberry Storm, Palm Pre and HTC Magic (soon to be the T-mobile G2). Unfortunately, the Nokia 5800 is kind of under the radar...most likely due to lack of marketing and not being attached to a large carrier like those smartphones are. If you are looking into the smartphone market you should seriously give this one a look at. After looking at reviews and pricing my final selections came down to the 5800 and the HTC touch Diamond/Pro. The HTC Diamond has Windows Mobile 6.1 which I'm used to since I have Windows Mobile (older version) on my Pocket PC while the 5800 does not...But the 5800 has a bigger screen than the Touch Diamond. Most of the other features are the same for both phones. Both are also priced reasonably well for a smartphones of their calibre but the 5800 is a bit less expensive. I've also played around with a family member's Iphone 3G which is also a great smartphone but to get an unlocked version for T-mobile would have costed over $350+ via Ebay. That goes for the other top smartphones. Although I am with T-mobile I wanted to wait for reviews on the G2 which has not been officially released yet in the U.S. The G1 is also a nice phone but I would've had to wait until the end of the year to get my upgrade discount ($400 if bought without the discount). I got the unlocked Nokia for under $250 through Dell with EPP discount, free shipping and a $50 rebate that is available right now. Great value for such a fab smartphone.Some other things worthy of notice are the 5800's neat little phone stand that comes with the package. It lets you prop your phone up on a flat surface so you can watch your videos comfortably. There's also a AV cable (RCA output) so you can watch your videos on TV, headphones and built in GPS (sorry not tested yet but other reviewers say it works well). Definitely overall a wonderful smartphone in nice compact design...highly recommended by this reviewer!
This phone connected to the internet via WiFi yet gave me so many freezing problems both on and off the internet. I ended up with the Nokia 5530 and have had no freezing problems and am very happy with that phone. I cannot recommend the Nokia 5800 because of the freezing problems. And I did think the 5800 was a very pretty phone with big screen had it not been for those freezing problems...Oh well, life goes on! Glad now I own the Nokia 5530!
This is not a phone! This is a PDA with a phone as an app.  It is just what I needed.  The only con is that third party apps have not yet caught up with this device, mainly a good ebook reader.  But eReader says they will have one that works on the S60 5th ed with touch screen ability by the end of summer.  Then this device will meet my main reason for buying it in the first place, only one device to carry instead of two, a phone and a PDA.
I like the expression, "a Nokia is a real phone."  You know you'll get excellent RF and audio performance, and good battery life. In the 5800 you get this and iPhone-like features. I know the Symbian OS is a little older, but reliable and being improved with 3rd party apps soon to follow in great quantity.
I have a long history of Nokia devices.  Historically, they have been the most durable, have the best battery life, and have the greatest ease of use.  The 5800XM has been my favorite device so far, and I've only had it for 2 days!The touchscreen: Beautiful!  Bright, clear, and very responsive!  It seems to respond better to fingernail taps rather than fingertip taps, but that works better for me anyway.  Double-clicking takes a bit of getting used to but does reduce the amount of fat-fingering and hitting the wrong options.  A lot of the reviews I read online were spent groaning about responsiveness, but I haven't experienced much of that.The music player:  As wonderful as all the other Nokia music players.  Easy to navigate, easy to set up, easy to customize.  Not to mention that transferring the music is a breeze and the Nokia Music Manager seems to compress the files or something because I have loaded 6 hours of music and a full-length movie on and I still have 5GB left.The camera:  Another one the reviews were bashing on.  Gorgeous crystal-clear images come out of this camera every time.  If you set it on all the wrong exposure settings and fiddle with the sharpness/contrast you MIGHT get a bad picture out of this.  Extremely impressive for 3.2MP.I can upload pictures directly to Flickr/Ovi from the gallery- which takes less time than standard MMS.I have been thoroughly enjoying the WLAN on the phone as well.  I find it has been most effective to set the phone to ask me every time it connects whether I want the WLAN or the AT&T; internet.  Seems to work the best that way.I LOVELOVELOVE that the phone extracted all my network settings from my sim!  It's a small detail, but entering all those in can be time-consuming.The personalization!  Oh, the personalization.  One simply has to hit "options" in any menu and all the icons can be rearranged.  Different themes are easy to download.  Applications are easy to download from Ovi Store.  Upcode helps with downloading content extremely quickly.I could go on forever about the phone!VERY IMPORTANT!!  If you can avoid it, don't order from Nokia directly!  I strongly suggest ordering from amazon.com.  The order from Nokia caused 3 weeks of waiting before they told us they had no idea when it would ship.  The order from Amazon took 24 hours to get to our doorstep.And the ZAGG Invisible Shield is DEFINITELY worth the 25-ish bucks and the hour or so of cursing and fear of destroying the shield to apply it to the phone.  I got the full-body model because I tend to be a klutz.
This smartphone may surprise you!!  The touchscreen is sensitive and is responsive to data input which I didn't expect for a resistive design.  Handwriting recognition works well and you can train it to your style.  Very fine resolution on the display with saturated colors.  Great WLAN (wifi) connections -- works better than my PC. 3.5G on AT&T;'s cellular network is rather fast.  Impressive loudspeakers on voice calls which is something I find valuable. Good sound quality on voice calls.  Loundspeakers also work in stereo for music playback. Have not fully tested GPS yet -- not sure how well it works.  'Net browser fully renders web pages including Flash animation. One feature that would have been nice is a trackball but you can swipe your finger to browse pages.  Very convenient size and weight - easy to handle and fit in pocket.One note:  As mentioned by another reviewer, you must setup messaging with AT&T;'s message center number in order to send SMS(unbranded phone).To say I'm satisfied would be a little understated.  Good job Nokia..!!
Phone worked well out of the box.  (AT&T; user, just insert your old phones SIM and go.  However, for texting you have to go to the set up menu and input the AT&T; message center phone number, otherwise your text/s will stay in the Outbox).  Music is great with clear sound.  Camera has a flash and works for night scenes, but the resolution is not that great.  Wi-Fi is automatically scanned just like a laptop does.  Haven't downloaded all the Nokia apps to check out all the functions this smartphone can do. Expanding memory is easy with a phone slot on the side to max out to 16 GB.  Great Amazon price, quick shipment, way more positive add ons than the overpriced Iphone.  Video webcam available via 2 cameras, not locked on to a monthly $30 data plan like the Iphone, battery on par with my previous cell phones, touch screen is as good as it gets.  You can also just add AT&T;'s media data plan down the road if you need 24/7 websurfing, think its about $15.  All in all, Nokia 5800 is a winner; not as well known, then again you're not going to stand out as one of the Apple peeps out there.
I have officially had this phone for 1 week, and so far so good.. for a smart phone virgin! I have synced fairly easily, download some apps and listen to podcasts without issue. Great internet connect and connected within my wireless network with no issues. The only problem I had was obtaining my contacts from from my old Nokia 5300(way behind in technology I know), phone swap did not work for me. Anway, after I saved my contacts to my SIM, and placed it back in this phone, all was well that ended well. I also thought it was wierd that the guitar game was in Spanish?? Good thing I speak the language! I really like the guitar pick stylus and the music stand.I Overall, I'm more than satisfied with this purchase, and still playing with my new toy, and I just appreciate the freebies including amazon video credit and free map trial.  It's pretty easy to use for someone who has never had a touch screen before, and even has a help screen in every section plus tip video clips. There are tons of shortcuts which is cool. I really like that you don't have to take the cover off the back to swap the memory card as well. Just wish it came with a case...
I just got this phone a few days ago and have been very impressed. As other reviewers have said, its size is great to hold and use with one hand. I use on campus wi-fi mainly to check email. There may not be many apps for it right now, but that should change in the future as Nokia is shifting to this platform (S60 5th). Battery life is great and the music quality is top notch --it already replaced my old mp3 player. The screen is very responsive thanks to the new firmware, and I like the ability to use a stylus to draw/handwrite.At $300, the phone is a bargain for anyone wanting a wi-fi capable touchscreen phone. I hate to make this comparison but I think this trumps the iphone, especially in terms of cost and features. Note that the battery is user-replaceable (hence no paying $60 to have your battery replaced). It's also unlocked!The only slight letdown of the phone is its camera. Mediocre.
I've been using this phone for a few days now and am impressed overall with the symbian software...it's very user friendly. Also the audio chip is excellent and music sounds great! However I was disappointed with the camera...which takes very grainy photos indoors unless your VERY close to subject...however outdoor photos look fine...if your looking for better photo quality the nokia 5610 xpressmusic is your phone.
I think this is a great phone. The problem is that when I received it, it had already been opened. Amazon sent me a package that someone had returned. They are taking it back. The other problem is the ear piece speaker. You can;t determine when the phones were manufactured. Any phone manufactured before around mid February was probably manufactured with the faulty ear piece speaker. You can order then get it fixed if it fails under warranty, but that is a pain for me as i don't live near a Nokia care Center.
This is a really good phone for all of those people looking for a cheaper option for a good touchscreen smartphone. I personally use this phone with AT&T; network, a Go phone account in fact, so you can imagine that having the Wifi is a great feature for me since I don't have an unlimited data plan. I use the phone a lot to make long distance calls through skype with the program Nimbuzz and I have to say that it's excellent. Streaming videos live through Qik is also very cool. It has a good variety of apps.As for cons, well I find it a bit unstable sometimes and I've had to reset it to factory settings twice cause certain features like the camera and music become unaccessible, and I don't even tinker with it much like some do by installing apps from other sites other than the store or installing custom firmware. This is my first touchscreen phone so I can't really judge too much the keypad but it has full qwerty and I've found it a bit of a challenge to get used to. Depending on how precise I am, sometimes I write pretty fast (Only a tad faster than T9 with predictive text) and sometimes I struggle a bit. I love the music player, and the camera and video recording capabilities are awesome. Also, the browser is more than decent, pretty speedy and you can also use Opera mobile 10 (not opera mini) which feels like a more full fledged browser than Opera mini and is also quite fast. Youtube works great, and so does google maps and GPS. Though I suggest you use Nokia maps, that way you can download the maps of your area and install them and avoid data usage, which is great for me. Brings and 8gb micro SD and I've considered getting a bigger one since the music and multimedia applications are so good :) Still haven't mastered video conversion so I can't opinion on that, but the videos it brought look awesome.Great phone all in all, despite it's small shortcomings.
I bought this phone because i did not want to be caught in a 2 year plan with AT&T; along with an additional $50 data plan for the iphone. Despite the fact you can buy the dual sim card iphone fake in chinatown across the river was not an option. Also when I do my international travel I can switch in my sim card and use the same phone.I must say I have discovered so many nice tricks and features with this phone the more I explore it. I love  the fact that you can put 5 of your closest contacts images on the main frame and simply press the pic to call, text etc. I also assigned a ring tone to every person. Phone call quality is awesome no one has ever complained they could not hear me and vice versa. The volume I wished was a tad louder but that is being picky. I love the headphones with the music controls there so you can ff or rew or even while listening to music you can get a call and the phone automatically turns off the music until you end the call.I love the GPS as well as the dictionary. I am a traveler and I do a lot of crosswords on my travel time so having the dictionary was a nice discovery. The versatility of the keyboard for tap, plectrum, mini, full qwerty as well as the handwriting makes writing notes or texting convenient.There is even copy, cut and paste. I was able to record a phonecall for a return of a product so that if they said I did not call i can play the conversation as my proof. I have used both cameras and the picture quality is great, the video feature is awesome as well. I was able to assign a picture to most of my contacts from my pc as well using the very versatile Nokia PC Suite. The ability to simply drag and drop any file including my music has really made a difference. I also love the fact that on the phone you can edit your pics just like you would do on coreldraw or any graphic program. I have added talk bubbles and  designs to some of the pics. You should see the one I did with my ex hehehehe!!! Thankfully Amazon not only gave us the rebate( which I am yet to receive) but the videoondemand 50 credit. I have so far bought mall cop and night at the museum pt 1 and downloaded to my phone. I watched them recently waiting for my delayed flight last week using the nice stand that they gave me to hold the phone landscape style.The graphics on this phone is awesome the speakers are adequate and loud. When I hooked the tv out cables from the phone to the tv it actually worked!!!! I was able to see slideshows of my pics on the phone as well as anything I did with the phone. This phone is awesome. I did play the tactile games, guitarrock, bounce and car racing cute but I am not a gaming person but they did keep me entertained. Goshhhhhh there are so many other things on this phone but I will end on the music. I SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO love this phone for the music. I downloaded album art and 578 songs so far including my personal cds and I am loving it. I have not been using my IPOD recently because I have the same songs, pics etc on this phone which is really neat. I am really happy with my purchase but I wished the dialer had alphanumeric keys I wanted to call 1800 flowers and I had to call someone to ask them to look at their phone and tell me the numbers for flowers which SUCKED!!! Otherwise I have not found anything bad with it. Oh yeah.......... one more thing I actually got a cover for the phone and I bought a reasonably priced 16 g microsd card because my 8 gb that the phone came with has 1.6 gigs left with all the stuff I saved on it.
The 5800XM being the first mainstream handset from Nokia is certainly a product that lives upto its Brand Name.The phone has quite a few cons, but the pro's of the handset weigh them out...pros:- Price...very affordable (for an Unlocked Quad Band 3G Touchscreen)- Slim form factor (fits right in the palm for single handed use)- Audio quality- 3.5mm jack (but I guess thats standard on Xpressmusic series)- Fast response (I think it has an ARM11 359MHz processor)- Symbian has lots of apps, and newer apps coming quite fast for v5 (optimized for touchscreen)- Inbuilt GPS that works with Google Maps app.- 8 Gb card and TV out video cable in the box.- Symbian has lots of themes.cons:- The touchscreen is resistive, so won't exactly give you the iPh**ne feel but you get Handwriting Recognition... not much use but still a feature- Single click- Double click  operation a little confusing- Interface is typical Symbian... If you've used Nokia before, then its a short learning curve.- The ridged edge around the screen tends to accumulate some dust/lint after being in-out of the jeans pocket a couple of times.Overall, I'd say its a great handset FOR THE PRICE...and NO CARRIER CONTRACT!!!
It's my first 3g phone and I really like it, ease to use, good screen quality but the camera is not good.
I have been eyeing this phone for months watching for a price break, which finally happened last week. On top of that great deal, I am going to send my phone to Nokia Trade Up For Cash program, which means overall I have spent $200 on this really cool phone.I had Nokias my whole cell phone history and last year got a Motorola. I really did like my Z9 but it was almost obsolete from day 1 (but I really don't have anything bad to say about it, it was a good phone.) I missed Nokia with their simple menus and excellent quality.To be honest, the menus are no longer simple and sometimes seem counterintuitive LOL. And the touchscreen is a bit hard to use with the fingers like touching an iPhone (I have an iPod Touch so I was waffling between this phone and the iPhone). The touchscreen works very well with the included styli though. And my learning curve is getting better with touch, so I don't see it being a problem after a while. I think the accelerometer is faster than my Touch, almost too quick sometimes. The Music Player is the bomb! Way louder than my Touch and perfect clarity. It sounds amazing. I don't even need an additional speaker like I need for my Touch.The screen is gorgeous and so far setting up everything has gone well. I have my music transferred, my contacts transferred and am very happy. I like the compact size and heft of the phone. I don't like lightweight feeling phones. The camera seems fine to me. The battery life does seem to be on the shorter side but make sure you close web applications after use. The phone does so much that you can dejuice it quickly. My Touch does the same thing.Nokia definitely needs to step up with apps and also get the Music Store available for the US! Also if you message the downloads to yourself it is a pain, so it is better to download on the phone direct from the store. The App selection bites though, but that's what my ipod is for. The thrill of app-ness dies down anyway, so it's not really a big deal, but not having music store access is just silly.Otherwise this phone is very competitive to iPhone. Being upgradeable with its memory is a definite plus and you can even have many memory cards since it's hot swappeable, technically that is unlimited memory. I love my Touch of course but I got an 8g and I'm maxed out with music and apps and now I can't do anything to it unless I get rid of stuff. That kinda bites. So the 5800 has a true edge there.I already had AT&T; and it was no problem to pop my SIM card in the phone and move right along. I had everything except the TV out cord and the stand which it appears on the website that they do not sell that in the package anymore so that is more Amazon's fault for not upgrading the info, but I don't really need the stand or cord. The USB cord is entirely too short. The headset comes in 2 pieces with a piece that can control the music and phone, which is very nice. Of course the charger is included and is acceptable. It easily connected with my internet, easily paired with my bluetooth, and once I finally figured out how to transfer music from my ipod to it, there were no problems there.I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it for people who want a quality touchscreen phone and not necessarily an iPhone.PS I LOL at 8g holding 6000 songs. Maybe 6000 ringtone sound bytes. 8g will net you between 600-800 average songs....
Well, I won't give you tech details about, just because you can get any of them directly from the Nokia site or others reviews right here. What I would want to share is that I'm very happy with this phone. I've been using it for about over a month and I'm so happy with it.The QWERTY (normal one) works excellent, the hand written function is also VERY useful. Calling people or sending text messages is so simple (the usage of the phone book is so simple). You can get cool free apps at the OVI store. Radio work great. Music player works great. Video also awesome. The GPS at firs did take about 20 min. to hookup with sat link, but after that, it work perfect (using the nokia maps app) with no kind of internet connection or aditional service fee. I have 0 complains (up till now) about this phone. The only problem that I did encounter was (not directly with the phone) that in the description of the product (when I got it) it said that in the box was the data cable, hands-free earphones, charger, tv-out cable, stand, and stylus pen. Well the stand and the tv-out cable were not in the box. The stand I don't really need, but the cable is something that can be useful. But anyways, got this sorted out and now all is well and good.And just to close, (because a lot of friends asked me about this) I've used iPhones before, and I won't say it's better or worst than an iPhone, but that it is a great alternative to it. I, personally, wouldn't change it for an iPhone or Ovnia (another product I tried).
Hi all.A couple of month ago I bought this amazing phone.First all buying in Amazon is always a great experience. I live in Chile (far far away from you guys) and my orders always arrive at time and I can track'it in any moments. Congrats to Amazon.About the phone. I was thinking in buy N97. I like the design, specs, it has keyboards!!! but is too expensive. Really is too much pay almost USD600 for that phone. But the 5800XM have similars features but you pay half price..and It worht it in every dollarsReciently I added a 16Gb microSD class4 (also I bough it here in Amazon) and it works great.Some words..-Good build. I'm afraid of plastic phone, but I'm impressed with this phone-Very fast 3G-Mail for Exchange. I can sync with my company email.-Amazing screen resolution. The movies and videos looks awesome.-A lot off apps in Ovi Store-The phone is fast, even with the 16gb microSD. Well with the new firmware nokia raise the cpu clock to 434mhz (d'oh the same as n97)-If you know how take pictures, you'll find 5800xm camera excellent even in low light condition-The GPS is kinda slow but once is connected is delightfull.-The touchscreen is not the best at all is just resistive but it works better than my old LG Cookie.-The battery is a pain in.....I think this is the main disadvantages. With 3G and push email (with MS Active Sync <- very cool) and talking about 1 hour per day I must charge it every night. Well is not a business phone, but come on..I don't even use it like a music player.Beside the poor battery life I recommend this phone. You'll not regret it.But I'm waitting N900 ;)Best RegardsAlan Correa
The phone is quite good, but it could be better.Pros: Good screen resolution, good sound quality, nice headset. Large storage space that is easy to interface with the PC.Cons: Graphical user interface not as friendly as IPhone and not as responsive since not using GPU acceleration.GPS is unusable, I never succeeded to get it to work. Proprietary OS allows only signed applications to be installed.
When I saw the ad for the video quality being better than a DVD I thought it was just plain marketing bluff, but upon getting this phone and watching videos on it it takes my breath away. I always liked Nokia as a phone brand and they are the best in my eyes when it come to perfomance and durability. The phone is light-weight for the size and slim and sleek (much better than an iPhone). The touchscreen is very responsive and the vibration when touched is pretty neat also. The qwerty keyboard can be a problem for big fingers like myself so I just use the Alphanumeric Keypad (Options like this is awesome). Sound quality is great speakers a lil low for me but it must be me going deaf from the system in my car, but this phone is awesome. I love it and I guarantee you will love it.Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, 3.2 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)
I loved the way Nokia designed its first mobile touchscreen phone. The purchase was a gift for my wife secretly. She was impressed when she discovered the multimedia experience and web browsing it has. Of course, the OVI share experience to upload all her photos and receive comments from her friends and family, was what made her happy. This smartphone has everything required for a practical use of email, e-mail account wizards settings are very easily to use, and with the OVI suite you can have it all in one place. Multitask System Symbian 5th Edition is really the strength of this model, which allows to do many things at once. The only detail known is the battery consumption.
Great Smartphone for the masses.(Cheap Unlocked- no attachments with those rip offs)It's gonna take time to get used to the Unit Interface (UI)is not 100% user friendly but is a lot of FUN! Is not that big nor small.The screen is Super crispy to watch videos. Great sound quality on the speakers but not loud enough (big turn off for me,hopefully Nokia will take care of this SOOOOON!). Battery runs down quickly when using speakers.Games that come with the phone are too hard to play(3) but the guitar hero alike is very entertaining.It takes a couple of seconds to change view to landscape and viceversa .Slow accelerator( It doesn't make sense huh?)While texting too many steps and screens being used.Camera is good outside but indoors is kinda crappy.The Gps is an excellent feature.Ovi nokia application store is getting better with the time ,you can find good free app's there or buy a good game.I STILL WAITING FOR THE COMES WITH MUSIC FEATURE IN USA!(Is available everywhere[Spain, England,France,Mexico]  but here!) Comes with music let's you download all the music you want for free for one year!!! YES! FREE for ONE WHOLE YEAR.Here in USA we just get the laughable Nokia Maps for 1 miserable month!4th best Smartphone, better than I-phone 3 g but not better than new Pre Palm, Nokia N97,HTC T-mobile My touch and I think the new 3Gs is the  King again.Bottom line: Very Good smartphone,cheap,lots of memory space,nice screen,Gps,everything you need is in the box but a case,good camera,video calling,nice looking phone,few applications but lots of them are in the making.The sound is amazing but needs more power!Update-01/05/2010After several months of use guys let me tell you something.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE IF YOU HATE HEADACHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Slow as hellSuper Anti-intuitiveI had to do lots of hard resets losing my dataSpeaker went bad several times.FreezesPower downs[...]Go buy an Htc or something different than Nokia.
Well what can I say.... The interfaz is SO FAST.... The touch screen I feel better than an iphone... I downloaded several aplicattions and games and with the accelerometter is awesome.... Great phone.... Great price.... it a MUST BUYYYYYY
A really great phone. There is a new firmware out that makes it faster and touch sensitivity better but it is not yet available for US phone. Keep looking for it. If you want to buy a larger 16GB card, make sure it is class 4 or 6. Class 2 cards do not seem to work. The OVI app store has new apps almost every week. Check it often.
Had to say good bye to my old Palm Treo of many years. The new Palm phones have not really kept up pace with the competition and it was time for something new. After reading many reviews of many many phones, asking friends etc I finally settled for an unlocked Nokia 5800 (US version). I haven't regretted my choice for a minute. Now in its 4th week, I am beginning to use it as a pro. The only thing I can think of being a bit negative, is the screen response. Sometimes it is a bit slow and I have to press again for it to react. But that's all. This was a great choice and I recommend it to anyone who wants a smart phone.
This phone was a great value. Overall, I feel it has the potential to be better than the iPhone or any other touch screen phone on the market today. The phone does, however, have a few drawbacks. For one, the phone does not have multi-touch. It has been demonstrated that the Nokia 5800 can utilize multi-touch and maybe we will see it in future Symbian OS releases, but that is one thing that is currently lacking. Additionally, there is limited application support for the new S60 5th edition. I have looked long and hard and found very few applications that are compatible. This will, of course, change in the future as more developers start work on this new OS but right now that is another major drawback. Aside from that, however, the phone is light, has very high screen resolution and has a built in accelerometer. It comes with an 8gb microSD card so you never run out of space for music and videos, and it has 3G and wi-fi so you're always connected at the speed of technology. The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a great value that will hopefully get even better with time.
Don't know about an iPhone-killer, but it has to come close.It's true, iPhone users probablly have an app for anything they need to do, something this phone still doesn't offer, but at hardware level, features and compatibility, the Nokia XM5800 wipes the floor with the iPhone.It does have its tiny glitches/annoyances, but every product in the world has them as well.Pros:- can't believe some people are calling the GUI non-user friendly. It's far better than buttons. Just touch what you want to do.- This phone is very responsive. Nokia has always proved that the S60 based OS used on higher-end phones does not need high horsepower. If you feel your phone sluggish, check for open apps... they do NOT close by clicking the red "End" button anymore... go to Options-Exit.- the full sized QWERTY on screen keyboard is great, but some people will still preffer the standard predictive text input.- Finally, a phone I can hear across my house when someone is calling... music is pretty loud at max volume, and not distorted. Great stereo speakers.- Included 8GB microSD card. Nice.Cons:- as stated, the screen tends to flip "accidentally" from time to time. It's annoying, but can be tweaked under configuration, to have it be less sensible.- Contacts screen. You have to "Enter" a contact to see their phone number. My prior S40 based Nokia phone had them right there on the list. When adding contacts to a SMS it does NOT show the phone # you're using.- Gallery. Can't sort content very well, mixing videos and pictures together. Separting those two woul've been a good idea.- Included web browser is horrible, but you can get Opera for it, and that works very well.- the attack of the inmortal fingerprints!Most Cons can be fixed with alternate apps, or later on they should be easy to fix with firmware updates, so you never know. They're just slight glitches on a still very new phone.Don't be another iPhone users who swear by it just because it's a fashion icon. Get something that REALLY works as a complete phone.
Really good touch phone, I definetly think its the best touch phone out there right next to the Iphone. The Speakers are Loud and Crisp for music. The Screen is responsive, and the vibration feedback, is not annoying at all!- The Camera could be better though, and the flash doesn't seem to help, alot of the time sadly-VERY IMPORTANT, the real reason why i didn't give this phone (that I was reaaally excited for) is because the second day I had it, I used the tv- out cable to see some vids, it FROZE and shut off, now SINCE then there is a horizontal line around the bottom of my screen, and it NEVER goes away :'[
I bought this from another US online retailer, before amazon got phones to distribute, and updated it to new firmware within three days.Great phone, intuitive, sync with Outlook at work was reasonably easy.Bluetooth and WiFi are easy to set up.Screen brightness is too weak for outdoor use on sunny days.Camera is good in bright light, but abysmal in low light (but I've yet to see a phone camera worth more anything).GPS is dodgy, but better with an external Bluetooth GPS puck.Reception was bad out in Utah and Arizona on AT&T.; My wife's Motorola got better reception on the same network.3rd party apps are EASY to install; there are tons of apps and themes available (visit DailyMobile.se for an idea).Handwriting recognition is good, at least as good as my Palm T5. I miss recognition for non-latin characters. I want to be able to use Greek, Russian, Serbian, Hebrew, Korean and Japanese... maybe there's some software component (lang pack?) I need to find and install...Video playback is good, as is music. BUT making MP4 files for it is VERY hit and miss! Big problems making audio and video keep in sync. Will not yet play OGG Vorbis audio files. Bad, bad, bad.
The Nokia5800 XPress is really an outdated smartphone for a high price. Turn on WiFi  is cumberson and always 3 step process through the menu. Aside the telephone functionality it has no intuitive user interface. Save the money and get a smartphone of a newer generation or keep the old cell phone and get an iPod touch.
I love this phone.  I can see why Europe is trying to make it the number 1 cellphone ever.  The simple one-button set-up wizard and one-button update applications are amazing, as well as all of the extras, free software, etc., etc.
This phone so far so good I had been used lot of cellphones from brand to brand until a got this 5800.I get this phone over a long research and since i start this unit is so amazing the camera is good and the viodeo as well so easy to use kind of trick at first but when you get use to it is so easy to handle.Even I can ear my music tru my regular blutooth y when you get a call the music stops like 2 sec before and then ringI strong recomend this phone.
This has to be the best phone that i have ever had. For a long time it seemed like Nokia was getting left behind, but they have steped up their game. I wanted a new phone and i was going to get an iphone but then i saw this and how much the iphone fanboys hate it (LOL). Im glad i got the nokia 5800, i got all the good things the iphone has and more.Pros:1. great battery life.2. wonderful screen.3. lots of options.4. lots of apps u can get for it.5. flash works with it.6. text, pic, and video messaging.7. 3.2mp camera.8. perfect call quality. (at least on at&t;)Cons:1. the only one i could really find, was that the touch was a little to sensitive at first. that was soon fixed just by tweaking the settings.Overall this is a must buy for those people that want a smart phone with out changing your plan. This phone has plenty of room to grow with updates and new apps that u can get from the OVI store and 3rd party.
I have bought this phone few days ago and I must say that this phone has everything you need.Main advantage over the iPhone.- You pay the price once and no need to worry about contracts. It's unlock phone!!!!!.- No data plan required like iPhone.- Replacable battery.This phone is very user friendly and simple to use. So far I haven't had any trouble using this phone.
I bought this phone on nokia website just after its release in USA. I have been reading its reviews since couple of months. I am happy with this phone. Everything is great about this phone. Have no regrets. Installed some apps (games, utilities) and all work great. Waiting for nokia ovi store to be up.
I bought this phone in Germany. I have no problems at all with it. I get reception everywhere. I love the fact that it came with a stylus, that way there are no finger smudges on the screen. It come with an extra one too. It comes with 8GB of memory which blew me away. The sound is clear and the video calling is spectacular. It is definitely worth the price.
I decided to pick up an unlocked phone to go with my AT&T; service rather than go into another 2 year contract.  After months of deciding on IPhone or something different, I came to the conclusion that the missing features of the Iphone were too much for me.  I needed multi-media messaging, video recording capabilities and a better camera.  I also wanted the ability to change batteries at some point as I've had bad luck with devices that had built in batteries.  So I ruled out Iphone and went on a search for the perfect phone.  While I can easily say that there is no such thing as a perfect phone, the Nokia 5800 comes close.  I was going to wait until the N97 was released but the $600 or $700 price tag was too much to take.  I ended up buying the 5800 from Amazon at a reasonable $302 which was the same cost as the 16gb Iphone minus the 2 year contract.What I like about the phone:1. It has everything I need that the Iphone was missing including very good video recording capabilities.2. The Bluetooth works well with my car and head set.  No difference in sound and everything is very clear.3. Music Player is clean and clear but it could be a bit louder.4. Web browsing works well although not as smooth as the Iphone5. Flash support!!!!  Yes, you can watch youtube videos on it6. Amazon On Demand $50 gift certificate - While I don't see myself using the phone to watch movies, this was a nice treat and it looks very sharp on the screen7. Battery life is great compared to other phones that have these features and can be replaced8. Access to any type of e-mail including Exchange support9. The full digital keyboard is easy to use with the stylus (a bit tough for those of us with fat fingers!)10. Ability to use apps such as QIK which allows you to stream video for live sharing (very cool feature)11. Customer support from Nokia has been top notch for me12. Expandable memory - comes with 8GB card and I expanded it to 16GB.  I've heard through the grapevine that it can also handle the new 32gb SD cards that just came outLast but definitely not least13.  Multi tasking!  Listen to music while tracking your fitness and browsing the web.  No problem....well except for the actual working out part!What I think needs improvement1.  Camera takes incredible pictures in bright light but is brutal in low light situations.  Supposedly firmware V.21 helps this problem but it is not available in the U.S. yet2.  Limited Apps available compared to Iphone.  Not a big deal but it would be nice if Nokia can get their App store up and running beyond the limited themes and music tones out there right now3.  Firmware Updates - U.S. versions seem to be last on the list since no major carriers over here carry this phone.  Waiting for V.21......4.  Touch screen is fairly responsive but could use some additional customization for sensitivity5.  There is a learning curve for the Symbian software that runs the phone - Not as intuitive as the Iphone but once you get the hang of it is not too bad6.  Web browser - yes, it is one of the things I like but it also has some flaws with navigation.  Iphone got this one right and no one else has gotten closeOverall, in my opinion, this is one of the best phones on the market under $400.  I think the N97 coming out will be the king of phones but I doubt it will break into any major U.S providers since it would compete directly with Iphone, Storm, Pre, etc...  It's too bad for Nokia that they are left out and that means too bad for U.S owners of their phones since we get all the newest firmware releases last (if at all).  I don't see myself changing phones anytime soon as the 5800 seems to have everything I need for now.  Maybe if 4G or 5G or whatever is next on the horizon becomes available, I will consider changing.  For now, this is my choice.*****Update May 27, 2009*******Great news!!  The Nokia App store is now live (store.ovi.com).  I now feel like I have a complete phone as I can easily download apps and have them installed.  Prior to yesterday, the only way to get apps was to search for them on various sites, forums and other places.  The installs were always hit or miss and I could never tell if the app was compatible with the 5800.Now, with the new app store, I feel like the one thing missing has been fixed.  The number of apps seems to be very large upon the initial opening.  I heard that something like 20,000 apps were supposed to be released on launch day but there is no easy way to know how many are really out there.Prices seem a little bit higher than the IPhone store.  There are a good amount of free apps but the ones that cost money seem to range anywhere from $2.99 to $20.You can either shop the store on your computer and send a text link to you device or you can download the OVI app which will automatically connect you to the app store.Hopefully the amount of GOOD apps that are released will increase fast now that the store is open.  In my mind, the only benefit of the IPhone was the apps...but that it now in the past.Oh, and it seems like us U.S owners are getting abit more support.  The App updater works now and I was able to update to the newest version of Flash Lite which could only be done in the past through firmware updates. And speaking of firmware, I haven't checked to see if V.21 is available in the U.S. yet but tech support seemed to goof up a bit last week when they told me to download it to fix a minor issue I was having.  When I told them I couldn't see the update, they quickly corrected themselves and told me to keep checking.  So hopefully any day now!!Finally, I love this phone so much that I just picked up a second one for my wife.  With the $50 rebate, that puts the price to below $300 which is just amazing compared to what the IPhone would cost coupled with PDA monthly data charges. The 5800 is the winner.
well...i just got this sweet phone from amazon a couple of weeks ago, and is a very good phone, it has nice features, the image is good, camera is good, touch screen is not as sensitive as the iphone, but is very good also...anyway is a good phone, i rather nokia than iphone anyway, nokia is tougher.the only problem that i had with is that the speakers is not that good....when you put a music with some boom boom like hip-hop and the volume is at his maximum it get a lil distortion, its noticible when you put the speakers at max volume.but thats the only problem...witch is not even a problem, if you want to listen to loud music buy a boom-box.by the way....the volume with the headphones on is loud and good.so if you where like me, allways with a mobile and an ipod, just buy the nokia 5800 express music.you gonna like it.  thanks for reading, i hope it helps.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCc
I had upgraded the micro SD card from a 8 gig to a 16 gig.  Afterwhich, I uploaded 8+ gig apps, music and video.  Upon restarting the phone, the OS would not boot past the Nokia blue welcome screen.  The phone would then just freeze at the screen.  I had to perform a hard reset and remove the memory card in order to have the phone boot up properly.  Then, I removed some apps, music and video below 8 gigs for the phone to boot properly.  I returned the phone because it didn't live up to what it was advertised....being able to handle 16 gigs.  I, then, borrowed my friend's Euro-spec version of the phone and it seemed to work without any problems.
Too much to be truth?1. I put Garmin software and works just like a Garmin GPS!I can also use Google maps in which you can walk or drive your car and see your position on the satellite image.2. 3G signal is always 100% even in rural Costa Rica where I live.3. I put Joikuspot and it works as a 1.5 Mbps router, anywhere I go!Right now I am using it to write this on my Ubuntu laptop.4. Sync with Google Calendar and contacts fast and excellent!-why should anyone need Exchange Server anymore????5. Excellent camera, video recorder, I even scan documents with it even if I have a scanner around.6. Offline multilanguage dictionary7. Excellent video, music and audio book player8. Bright flashlightI miss is a portable bluetooth keyboard, PDF and office reader, but all are available.Well I would love the IPhone's beautiful and smooth interfase (which is far better than any other) plus snooze options for remindersToo much and too good to be truth? No
Excellent device for a good price. You can have all the right solutions in your hand, such as internet navigation, email and multimedia. Easy to use, easy to install new and cool applications like GPS maps and games. Better than Iphone, and trust me, I'm a true Mac user.Cool design, small and light weight. The 8Gb microSD card it's perfect to store data, music and videos, but if you need more space you can upgrade it with a 16GB card.
I both this cellphone hear in Amazon, and when i looking for a PIN CODE in a box of product to active the promotion NOKIA COMES WHITH MUSIC for download 8000 musics on computer free, i can't. This code never come in a box, only cellphone, manual, charger and jack's phone (include ipod jack - surprise for me).  I liked so much this cellphone, include beautiful disign, longer battery, widescreen quality and the functionally. Only negative point is the side's of video and photo, because i can't turn to right side to see a video, for exemple, it has only left side default.  Somebody know how can I get this PIN code, or if is possible call to NOKIA USA to see that whith a serial number can active NOKIA COMES WHITH MUSIC? What is phone number?Waiting your opnion Friends,Maia, Vinicius
My daughter wanted an iPhone but even she agreed it was overpriced.  She picked this one to replace her broken Motorola "Ming."  She loves it!  That's saying a lot for someone as picky about her phones as she is.  I gave it 5 stars because of the cost to quality and feature ratio.  Instead of listing what it has, it would be a much shorter list of what it doesn't have.  Check out the specs if you're interested in a good multi feature phone.
I purchased this phone and am quite content because in my country Costa Rica works best. I like its touch screen, resolution is great, the sound is terrific and I can also watch videos from youtube. Another thing is that it has good coverage and I can clearly hear all the calls, and is very easy to find any contact likewise have no problem to download music in the library and update. Truth is an excellent phone and meets all my expectations.
Well where should I should I begin, its great touchscreen phone comes with a memory card (8gb)so you can download music and movies if converted to the right format settings. The screen looks beautiful. I don't usually buy phones unless something innovative has been created. For Example This will be my 3rd cell phone ever my first Nokia 3560 phone without a camera, second LG Cu500 has a camera and music player and 3rd Nokia 5800 Wifi, touchscreen watch and listen to media on the go. All mechanics works great no problems. The only bad thing about it is the battery little short if u keep using it for wi-fi. I recommend waiting for a good price on amazon this phone price keeps going up and down during different days. So wait for it.
It works great and is quite useful, I use it as a business cell phone. Bur remember you get what you pay for, 5 stars is for the fact I paid such a low price and it is what it is. The only issue I have with it is start up and shutting down problems, EVEN ON THE FIRST DAY. But just take out the battery for a second and put it back in and its all fine again. If it was a little more expensive, I would have given it 4 or 3 stars.
I have been using this phone for 5 months now, is great, the greatest feature is the GPS, sometimes is slow to connect but is pretty accurate. The web browsing is also great and fast, depends on the connection, I have not downloaded many applications, word and excel work fine and are good for working or having information on the go. The sound is excellent in voice calls, and in music mode. All in all I like the phone, highly recommended.
This is a great phone that has a multitude of functions and features. This is a good alternative to the iPhone. It is one of the best phones from Nokia.
I do not usually write reviews, but I like this phone so much that I felt I should write one.  First, I normally would not buy a Nokia - I am a Sony Ericsson fan. However, I needed a quad-band  phone for a trip to Europe and I wanted a touch phone. The SE Satio has been released, but not in the USA and it is pricey.  So I went with the Nokia. I love the look and feel of the phone.  I have had absolutely no problems - no screen freezing and battery life has been very very good.  The battery charges quickly. It is easy to lock and unlock the phone manually.  There is an automatic lock feature which you can disable or set a longer time before it automatically locks.  Calls are easy and call quality is great.  A prior reviewer said it is to hard to make a call, but I do not find that to be the case. You can put pics or an icon for people you call frequently (I think up to 5) on the start screen or set up a speed dial number. I find it easy to use the touch screen but you do need to apply some pressure - more than the iPhone, but it works great.  I am not a big web user but it connects quickly.  I have not tried the GPS yet. I do have to say the camera is not so great, so if you are looking for a good camera phone I would not buy this phone.  Also, I do not know why the phone icon is found in applications and not on the main menu (maybe I can change that). I am still learning to use all of the many features this phone has to offer.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced phone with lots of features, you should definitely consider the Nokia 5800.
Switched to this from an iPhone 3GS... its great. extremely customizable and costs less per month with an att data plan.
the telephone arrives me under very good conditions (NEW SEALING IN ITS BOX) the excellent software works well in venezuela with the company movistar all its functions up-to-date mail, msn, facebook, wi-fi, everything very well, but what I don't find well is that not all the accessories were in the box I lack the tv cable and the base to place the telephone: (that hurtsNOTICES: the battery doesn't last but d 7 hours that is very bad!!
The only one thing I would say about this product is Nokia products are all awesome...especially the 5800 XpressMusic that I have been using. I enjoy it every much..it helps me organize the works, arrange the time for school, relax and be entertained by all the funtions that this product have provided for me. Nokia XpressMusic is the one subject that I always bring along with me every day from now.
The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a chick and elegant phone. Have a great sound and the configuration is easy in almost countries around the world. In other way, you have to pay for most of the programs that you want to use, like acrobat reader, office mobile, real player for MPEG videos, antivirus. The operative systems Symbian Os is fast and operate correctly all the time. Nokia maps doesn't run in all countries, but in developed nations works pretty fast.
I really really love this smartphone. It is intuitive and does everythig that is said about it. The apps, are wonderfull and easy to navigate. Nothing less should be expected from #1 cellphone maker (NOKIA).
The phone to me is pretty good personally to me because I like the touch screen but I would like to see a better interface in upcoming versions of this phone. As everyone else complained about the camera it is not very good. My old phone which was a Nokia 5610 slider was 3.4 MP. The internet with wi-fi works very well also and the music is good quality and i like the 3.5mm slot for regular headphones no need for an adapter. Also like how u could make 3-D effects with ringtone and echo. The phone box was sealed but still did not come with the stand, video cable, and case but the wrist wrap,memory card,headphones, and adapter were included. I did not choose free shipping cause i heard it sucked but paid like $5 for shipping and it came like in 4 days.
The touch screen on the phone is great, the stylus makes scrolling and such even better. Although the stylus is a little bit awkward to hold and putting it in and taking it out is a little rough you can use it to write your text and it becomes printed text, this can be used online, or texting. You can search the files of your phone. Using PC Suite you can get updates. Great battery life. Great lock/unlock position... 3.5 mm jack (or whatever standard is, it has). I would definitely recomend this product to a friend, at a good price. Nice 3.2 MP flash Carl Zeiss lens/camera works good. Accelerometer is good... Basically buy it.
This is an excellent phone and MP3 player.  The camera operates better than the average cell phone.  I have had problems at call termination with the phone locking up which has required me to remove the battery as a solution.  As a touch phone, the 5800 is as good as any of the others that I have seen.
I have had my nokia 5800 for a week now and it's definitely love so far. The call quality is excellent and the speakers are top notch for a phone. Everybody who has seen my phone has fallen in love with it's appearance (with the only detraction being it's thickness). It takes a little while to get acquainted with all the features and to learn your way around but once you do it's all smooth sailing from there!
I am person who's a mobile crazed, and specially the touch screens, I can say i tried them all, Nokia 5800 is the most satisfying amongst them all, i cant wait for the developed version of it, the N97.
Can't say it is an iphone killer, cause don't have one to conduct head-to-head test, but that is the whole reason for not having an iphone for me anyway.Pros1. fast2. predicts your next action for the most part, ex. when on a call w/ the phone to your face the screen will sleep and when take away to end a call, it wakes up w/ the proper screen of options to either end, make a note, speaker option, etc.3. froze on me once in a week now, but "fixed" its self when I had to go answer the door, I thought I would have to yank the battery like on the htc viva I had just before this phone, ABSOLUTELY HATED IT, DON'T BUY-- ms mobile has a lot of refinement to catch up with symbian and apple.4. Takes really good pics for a 3.2 pix camera, just be sure to learn how to use the proper scenes, just like on quality 5 pix cameras.5. not forced into data plan contract by att, currently I don't have a use for losing  $40/month to att in perpetuity --yeah att no thanks I'll keep my $$ and give it to you when I want; just my approach anyway.6. love the sd card ability, iphone can't do it, so you're stuck with apple.7. phone is not to big, not too small.8. definitely, order the rubberized phone case www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026NMA0C/ref=ox_ya_os_product, fits perfectly, best $5 of phone insurance against drops/falls I've ever spent.9. Basically an unlocked iphoneish phone for under $300, with no contract, just can't go wrong.Cons1. would like a 1/4" wider screen, would make such a big difference.
It is a great cellphone, very interactive, and easy to learn how to use it. I have to get used to this new techonolgy and all the things that it has because I had an old cellphone. The camera seems not to take some good pics at night but I guess I have to explore more of it. I had to restart it because I couldn't install some of the coolest applications such as Hotmail Msn and others but the rest is ok. I like it!
I bought Nokia 5800 from Dell. The phone itself is wonderful. If you only need languages already installed on the phone (which are different for phones sold in different market), it indeed is a great alternative to iphone. However, if you need to use additional languages, don't buy Nokia. It wouldn't let you install any additional language packages. Quote from Nokia USA-FAQ: "Language packs made available on a Nokia phone is market dependant. As such a software / firmware upgrade will not allow the phone to support any additional features and language packs. If the phone does not have the language already installed then unfortunately you will not be able to use the language in the phone. Hence, phone that supports the Chinese language is only sold in China or countries where the language is mainly spoken." Had I knew this, I wouldn't buy a Nokia phone. This may well be my last Nokia phone.Nov.23, 2009 Update:If I can change my star rating, I would drop it to ONE star. The quality of the phone is poor. The custom service is even worse. My phone is broken in thirty some days. The phone won't power on. Before sending it to Nokia repair center, I tried to find a local Nokia care point. Couldn't find one online. Emailed Nokia about it, received totally irrelevant response with unwanted advice. The repair center mailed back my phone the same day it received it. The phone was in exactly the same condition after charging. In the letter came with the phone, they give me an no existing web site to flash my phone. I called the repair center explained my situation, the first agent said another agent will call me back in one hour. After four hours and 2 emails, still no response. I called again, the second agent asked their supervisor and told me that they will try to diagnosis the problem and call back in "24 business hours" (meaning three business days). They don't want me to ship back the useless phone right away. I asked for an extension number so I can call back if I don't hear from them after three more days. She offers none. To contact them, you just have to go through all the options to get a different agent every time.Dec.5, 2009 Update:My phone took second trip to Nokia repair center and came back still not working! I called three times since last Thursday,when I received my phone. Each time, their call center agent just telling me a specialist will call back within "24 to 40 business hours". How absurd! Why not just saying within a week? I was able to use this $300 phone for only four weeks and spend three weeks to repair this phone. Second time around, the letter came with the phone from the repair center is exactly the same, stating all they did was "software upgrade and phone reset". They totally ignore the problem I described with the phone. Does Nokia care center care about customers? I don't think so.
I have had this phone for several months.  I bought the unlocked version because I travel a lot and wanted to be able to buy sim cards in various countries.I have found the phone to be extremely powerful with a vast array of features.  The touch screen took some getting used to and I found the interface difficult at first.  But now I can navigate without any problem.  The user manual and "help" is essentially useless, but I have figured most things out just fine.  I had trouble sending texts initially, but after going through some fixes on the Nokia user forum I got that solved (it had to do with message center settings).One of my favorite features is the music player.  It has freed me from my iPod.  Uploading and playing music is easy and intuitive.  The camera is nice but I don't ask much of it.  The GPS feature is really cool but it takes a long time to find satellites.  It's only really useful if you're in network range although you can get a GPS fix when out of range.  If you leave the GPS function running by accident though it seems to drain the battery quickly.  Speaking of the battery though, I've found the battery to last quite a long time otherwise though. Several days with normal phone use and music playing.  The computer interface is easy.One other minor negative is that it seems the screen can be scratched easily.  Be careful.I'd definitely buy this phone again and recommend it to others who are not afraid of solving minor tech issues.
Everything was as described in the add and look exactly as the picture thank you
Don't look anywhere else. It's got everything you want from a smartphone. Great purchase! I'm very, very satisfied.
el telefono tiene todo lo necesario para ser un todo en uno. La camara no es la mejor (comparada con el N82) pero tiene una calidad aceptable, en cuanto al manejo del telefono nokia a hecho un gran trabajo y su nueva plataforma symbian v5 es mas estable y facil de usar que su version anterior. Quisiera que existan mas aplicaciones para estos telefonos asi como existen para los iphones
This is a great phone. It isn't as high tech as an iphone, but its close to it with a cheaper price(without having to get a contract). It's a great smartphone and easy to use once you've played around with it. I've added apps and themes to personalize it. It's great and it comes with everything you need for your phone. Plus you can hook it up to your tv!
I love this little Nokia 5800 phone. It's great. It has a better signal than my old phones. I love being able to get on the internet where ever I am without a computer (with added data plan to your phone plan). It's just a great little phone with everything built in. I've always liked Nokia phones but this is the best one I have used yet. Thanks Nokia.
Pros:- The set up was fairly easy and straight forward.  Insert an AT&T; sim card and it was able to figure out various network setup(internet/MMS/Message) automatically.- Touchscreen was responsive and pleasantly easy to use- Price/feature is good compared with other models- Battery life seems to be quite decentCons:- Even though I didn't install much additional applications(nightstand + Opera browser), it kept generating this error "memory card full...close some application" message even when I was simply composing an email message(Messaging).  The phone comes with 81MB memory and 8GB card and it should have tons of space left.  I googled around and looks like this might be a known problem with 5800.  You may have to turn it off and back on to get around the problem but this error happens once every few hours.  Not good.- In addition, unlike its competitors, it is unable to render CKJ language(lack of unicode support?).  Looks like the only way to get around this is to fake the product code, and use some freeware to flash it with some older version of firmware(which supports whatever language you desire).  This most likely will void the warranty so that's not good.I'll work with Nokia support to see if we can resolve the memory full message problem.Update: I called Nokia support and they basically told me to get a replacement since the "memory full" message indicated mine was a defective unit.  Got a replacement, but the new unit somehow freezes frequently for 15 or 20 seconds at a time.  One time it hangs completely and I have to remove the battery to restart it.  A few times the gravity sensor stopped working (doesn't alternate properly between portrait & landscape mode) also.  It is a very good phone but unfortunately too buggy.  :(
First off I want to say this and that in the 2 days that I used this phone I thought it was fantastic.  The screen looked great, the touchscreen was responsive (for a resistive touch anyway), Gps worked good, Joikuspot, video playback looked great, i thought S60 worked well on the device and it had a reasonable price.  The only thing that kept me from loving this phone was the horrendous camera quality.  I ended up returning this phone and getting an N85 because of how bad the camera on this phone was.  The pictures were grainy even in bright natural light, and no matter what I did with the white balance or color settings i couldn't get rid of the purple hue over all of the pictures.  Howver, if you are someone who doesn't really care about a camera, then I guess I would recommend this phone, but If you value camera quality like I do, look somewhere else or you will be dissapointed.
I am researching to buy a ipod and using my regular phone.  I realized from my research that this was the best phone available in the market.  If I go for ipod, I should be taking data plan connection, but in this case it is not compulsory.  GPS works with satellite and no need to have a data plan.On one to one comparison with iphone, this is the best one and going for it.
The radio & music app's are what's good about this phone.Cons: web browser crashes often & hangs when opening pages. Copy & paste does not work in the browser. So if you are filling out a web form, you'd better fill it out quick. If the browser crashes before you're done, you lose all your work.In order to open or view Word or Adobe PDF files, u have to pay aroun $50 to a third party software company. And not many app's run on the 5800 because it's OS is so new.Nokia firmware may fix some of these bugs. But Nokia Support has not released the latest firmware update for this phone in the US. And they do not reply to emails on time.
If that is Nokia's response to the iPhone, then Apple can rest for the next 2 years.I bought the phone because it is unlocked and I don't want to pay ATT data plan for two years. It also has Wi-Fi, Blue Tooth and GPS.What I like about the phone:1/ It is very sleek and fits snugly in the hand2/ The voice quality and the speakers are excellent and have enough power3/ It has WiFi and Bluetooth4/ I am a stylus type of guy and I like the handwriting capability - probably the best feature5/ Changing the SIM or the SD is a snap.What I don't like1/ Making a phone call is pathetic - how many clicks do I have to make in order to make a simple phone call. And why does it have to ask me if I want to make a video call ?!? Like I do video calls from my land line.2/ So far I haven't found a way to do phone card call, without having to type in about 20 digits.3/ Could not manage to get the blue tooth conduit to run with my Vista Laptop. Vista asks for a driver, Nokia says that they have provided the driver.4/ Even the full size QWERTY is very difficult to use. You need to press much harder on the LCD so fat fingering is very common.5/ Help and support are pathetic6/ The battery died after about 8 hours, during which time I had made 3-4 calls. It virtually died it went from full charge to almost empty in a matter of 10 minutes.All in all, I am considering to return it and get a phone that actually works, without having to have manicure or three hands.============================================  10 DAYS LATER UPDATE:-------------------------------Here we go:PROS:1/ The battery issue disappeared after about 1 week nightly recharging. Now the battery indicator has a tendency to be 100% all day long, and I do talk more than when I was testing the phone. I am not sure if the indicator is correct, but at least it has not let me down while I am talking.2/ The phone has relatively decent "Voice Command" feature. That resolved my issue with the number of clicks to make a simple phone call.3/ I received an SMS from NOKIA - telling me how to turn my GPS feature on. That was awfully nice of them - ~2 hours after the activation the GPS found me. Obviously there is a "soak" period. So don't expect immediate results. The "soak" period also falls in the CONS category.4/ I must admit that the "Camera" is fairly decent. Having said that - I did not buy the phone because of the camera. If you need a camera - "you buy a camera". I am looking more into the "organizer" functionality. ("I-DON'T-have-to-attach-my laptop-to-my-butt-but-it-helps-if-handy) kinda' application.CONS:1/ The voice command works fairly well. The problem is that NOKIA has prerecorded commands from, I am sure, some terrific Finnish guy, who has a terrible Finnish accent (as far as English is concerned). That is easy to overcome, as far as Applications are concerned (you can override him with your voice), but I am yet to figure out how to change the preconceived notions, as far as "Contacts" are concerned - I cannot figure how to create a voice command to call my wife, unless I mimic the Finish guy's ideas as to how to pronounce a name.2/ The DTMF issue is a real problem. I do a lot of call card calls and conference calls. The phone has "Copy --> Paste" function, but this does not cut it. There MUST be a way to pre-program your call-in numbers, and log-in with 1-2 'clicks'.I do understand that "One" is not supposed to talk on the phone while driving, but this is "One's" decisions. By no means it is NOKIA's decision.3/ In order to access features there is a substantial time lapse between the moment the feature is activated ( you click) and the moment you can use the feature. I wonder why is that!?!WHO IS WATCHING?!? AND WHAT that "WHO" IS?The long "soak" frustrated me and invoked questions about the safe keeping of my privacyCONCLUSIONThis phone is an acquired taste ... or maybe Symbian is an acquired taste ... I don't know.It has potential, if NOKIA fixes the annoyances in the firmware - e.g. the voice command works fine, minus the Finnish accent. GPS works,AND people know how to make it work and what to expect. (SMS simply does not cut it).There is no way to convince me that this phone is user friendly. It simply is not. You can easily access the most basic features, but if you want to do something beyond basics - it is a nightmare.I am sorry, but I do not buy a "cheap" $340 phone, just to figure out how to make a phone call, or take a note, or make an appointment, or take a picture. I buy it to be able to do all of the above - EASY.And learning how to do that has to take place in "reasonable" time - say 1-2 hours. This is not the case. So far I have invested about 8 hours to figure out the some of the questions, that are most annoying. Probably it will take twice as much to figure the answers.How about an brand new idea! How about, a user guide that actually guides you?!? Or how about some useful webcasts, that would teach you how to use the phone features, without having to spend 7 days trying to figure them out !?! What a challenge !!!THE VERDICTI WILL KEEP the phone.I will keep it, simply because, based on my experience and judging by reviews about the competition, it is MORE acceptable.It is nowhere near to the iPhone, but that is another can of worms.I expect huge improvements from NOKIA on:1/ User interface2/ User manuals or instructions3/ Ease of use - functionality.All of the above can be fixed by software, so I am expecting the upgrades.Happy upgrading !!Enough said - 2-1/2 stars - FINAL !============++++++++++++++++++============LAST UPDATEThe headphones coming with the phone are AMAZING !!!Easily comparable to BOSE.I heard depth and breadth of music, that I hadn't experienced in a long time. (That is after I figured how to copy the music to the phone, and how to start it). Seriously - the sound from the headphones is exceptional !Maybe it is what it says "XpressMusic" - I will give to NOKIA that - Music is PERFECT !!! Much better than my wife's iPod !Still - 3 stars for the overall phone - MAX.Music on the headphones is excellent though!!The phone is an acquired taste ...
This phone died within one week.  I had to return it to Amazon for refund.  Amazon was very professional and speedy about the return and the refund, so 100% satisfaction with Amazon.However, the phone was a waste of time and aggravation.  Very cheaply made.Absolutely no confidence in this Nokia product.Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, 3.2 MP Camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, and 8 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)
I got this Phone 2 weeks ago, I like it because it is very firm in hand, touch screen, and have wifi.Amazon send me this phone in mail for free, it took 5 days, the phone came safely wrapped.The phone has some good sides :1. The touch screen is very good , as I never used an Iphone, but the sensor is good enough for you to use your finger on it.2. You can handwrite messages which is very convinient to compose a text message or send an email.3. Compare to Iphone, you can use Wifi to connect to the internet, without paying monthly data plan, but wifi can only be used in an area where have open wireless internet service.4. The talk quality is very good, clear, you can hear very well. and very easy to use hand-free speaker.5. You can save your favorite 4 phone number on the home screen and creat button with an image icon.I like this feature, because I can put my family members phone number on the home screen.6.Easy to use the USB wire to transfer music or pictures from PC to Phone.I like this very much.the phone I do not feel very happy with is :1. the battery do not last long, I charge it every 3 days, though I do not use text message or connect to internet, nor do I listen to music via it since I got a good Mp3. so I cannot imagine how can people listen music with it as a MP3.2. The camera quality isn't good with a 320Mp camera. take very poor quality pictures with it.3. some time it frozen the screen, you have to restart the phone to make it work. but this happens to a lot phone.over all, I think this phone worth of the price, it still a nice phone since no phone is perfect. I will still buy it.
Well the nokia 5800 is a really nice phone, great price at amazon as always, a bit on the chubby side, but is very easy to use. Great feautures for the price
Very easy to use, all the right functions. The first phone I received did't charge, but Amazon replaced extremely fast at no charge with a new phone that works great.Camera is excellent, battery life is awesome.Very satisfied with the phone.
I bought my Nokia 5800 XM from Amazon & used the free shipping option. It arrived at my APO address here in Kuwait in 5 DAYS!What a deal!The phone is great, & easy to figure out & use. The only bad thing was the memory card came with some music samples /folders on it which I could not delete. I could delete the songs, but not the file folder. An error message would appear saying that the file was corrupted. Finally I formatted the memory card & that erased all the preloaded junk on it. Now I have only my stuff on the card so... format the card BEFORE adding anything to it!Aside from having to do that, it's a great phone, lots of features, basically everything I'll ever need & much more. It's truly a mobile device, not just a phone.Oh, the camera pics are OK... just OK. Not really that great, but not really that bad either.
I was very unsure about this phone when my husband ordered it for me because he is very well know ledged with technology.  I am not to say the least.  But everything on the phone is very user friendly and organized.  It just makes sense.  I love the touch screen. You know exactly what you want to enter, unlike the iphone that I found uncontrollable compared to this phone.  I really like it, everyone may not but I have had it over a month and it has been great.
I have had this phone almost a month now and I am still discovering its versatility.  It is well worth the cost and does everything I wanted it to do.  I have AT&T; as my provider and receive a strong 3.5g signal.  The phone is light, fits well in the hand and the touch screen is beautifully clear and responds well with the stylus.  The reception/sound quality is crystal clear, also. The volume range is very good and the stereo speakers work surprisingly well.  The FM radio is a nice addition and I find I use it more than I thought I would.  The MP3 player is good; however, their is one thing to note about the Nokia software you use for transferring the files from your computer.  It offers an option to reduce the file size prior to downloading the music to the phone but it seems to greatly reduce the sound quality of the tracks, so I no longer use it.  The wifi/browser works fine and the zoom option helps to make all print readable.  The camera produces excellent photos but do not rely on the auto mode to give you the best shots.  The manual options have proven to allow for much better quality results so it is best to become familiar with them.  This is true with the video recorder, too.  For example, indoors on auto mode the video recording is very grainy but when using low light option the results are great...In fact, better then I had expected.  The video player was a little disappointing because seems with most of the movie files I have played so far there is some drag periodically which is irritating, especially right after the video has started.  I wonder if a more powerful processor is needed or just a firmware update would solve the problem.  Despite this I still give the phone a 5 star because it excels in every other regard.  And finally, I downloaded the free flashlight software I found on the internet and now this phone can be used as a bright flashlight for times when I need to find something in the dark.  I am waiting for a DivX player software for this version of Symbian (which Samsung offers for their phones using the same Symbian operating system) so I can play this popular movie format.When I received the phone I noticed there were 2 tiny scratches on the screen (one was deep), which I couldn't notice until I was outside with the direct sunlight reflecting off the screen.  So inspect the phone carefully right away for that or for any other defects.  Amazon customer service offered to replace the phone but I didn't want to wait for a new one to arrive.  I just wanted to mention it so you know that if you do find there is a problem Amazon is very good about offering support.
This is an excellent smartphone that my son is completely happy with after 3 weeks of use.  He was able to insert the SIM card from his old phone and everything was recognized, and he also transferred all his music files easily to this device.The touchscreen is fantastic, and there are many useful apps available for download.  Good sound, a GPS, web access - it's all there.  Even the phone call sound quality is clear. (imagine that!)Still, it's overpriced, - but worth buying if you want a great product and good quality.
Great phone packed with a lot of features. The 3.2MP Camera is decent compared to other phones out there in the market with 8MP cameras such as the Sony Ericsson C905. Overall one of the best nokia phones ive ever owned.[...]
I think the phone overall is very nice....I bought it back in May of this year ('09). Now...only a little over 7 months of having the phone, my screen is constantly going out...the phone will be on and flly functional, but the screen will not light up....i've changed the battery, the charger, resetting..still no luck. I called Amazon to see how I would go about getting it replaced,..and they couldn't help me because it was after 30 days of the purchase...so where does my full year warranty come in? well i contacted Nokia as well...the customer service was not good...and they basically told me they wouldnt replace my phone...i'd have to send it in and wait until they fix it (supposedly) and send it back. I really loved my phone, but this dissapoints me. I prob wont buy another Nokia touchscreen.
excellent product .. I arrive in good condition and works perfectly ... and came with all accessories .. I recommend
Functionality is very excellent and useful (multiple alarms, wife, touch-screen) but I have twice experienced that after charging overnight, the next day the unit will get very, very warm and will just die. Returned it for safety reason.
I like the phone, but it is hard to use if you are constantly on the run.  This phone offers me to many options for every operation.  Even for dailing a contact, you first have to select the contact, then press call, and then your prompt with another menu were you have to choose voice call so that dials.....  I do like the touch screen, but i think the ram of this phone is not good enough as it freezes constantly.  Battery is not the best but it does hold one entire day and a half.  It would be good if this phone came with the fm transmitter as the N version.  I think is good considering the price, but it could be improved with minor work on it.  Ohh before i forget dont use OVI, pc suite is much better i think.  An remember to search for office and pdf programs in the web.
This phone is a good investment, I changed annually but this team used it for 3 years and it worked perfectly.
I recommend this to any who want a Phone which is NOT the i-phone but has all the functionalities. It is also very configureable, I can install many apps and the screen is great.
Even though this is first Nokia touch-screen experience, it's not bad at all... has almost everything you'd like to have in a smartphone, but they have changed slightly the interface so it's a little different from what you would expect from Nokia...The PRO's: Great resolution, camera and sound; integrated wi-fi; good memory capacityThe CON's: Poor capacity to arrange the menus as you wish; no easy use of the touch screen as Palm-like graffity. Not intuitive interface. Lacks integration with contacts and e-mail (have to work them separately).So... buy it or wait till next upgrade or model!  ;)
This is my first touchscreen phone, but i'd tried some before, and I really like the way it responds. The screen resolution is awesome and the aplications works very well.
This cellphone is great the sounds is great. The micropohone is amazing. I never thought that even this small can give a sound like that. The touch screen is also nice or should I say tap screen and there are times that it takes a little while before it responds. Overall its great and would definitely recommend it.
If you are looking for a smart phone that is unlocked and does not need data plan (but can use free wifi) then there is every reason in the world to get this phone. It is exactly what you are looking for.
I had did my research when I was purchasing. When I purchased the nokia 5800 I was surprised that the shipping was so fast. I didn't like the tracking system it wasn't very accurate but it did come on schedule. That's all that really matters. THe phone itself is great. I bought it mostly for the music player, but I love every aspect of the phone. I'm a big texter and this phone is great for texting. The camera is great. I had the e71 before this one and by far I love this one.
The camera has some disadvantages with the types of light... it is possible to be lived with it... As far as fingerprints, it is not a serious problem... I recommend to use a screen protector... this reduce the problem a lot...
This was the first electronic product I purchased from Amazon and I couldn't be more thrilled with it.  Functional, easy to follow manual, and does everything the write-up said it would do.I would recommend this phone to anyone who does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a phone.
I have had a cell phone ever since 2002. I have had many different types of phones. Nokia has always been my favorite due to the OS, the style, the service, and overall everything. I have had many different brands of phones and many other Nokia phones as well and I have to say, after having this phone for a month, I can say without hesitation that this is thee absolute best phone I have ever had! You don't have to trust me on this. See for yourself the review at [...]
Overall I am pleased with this phone.  I have not used the applications feature that much.  Here's what I've noticed:GPS takes a while to lock in.  Forget about it inside.Had a few hangups at random times.  I'd say about 4-5 in 3 months.Camera - OK during the day, not so good at night.  I ordered another camera.  Video is OK too, once again during the day.For the price I got this on sale for versus how much cell phones cost locally, I have no buyers remorse.I know I need to update the phone software, and I am trying to figure that out.  I haven't really tried though!
buen celular la mejor compra que hize lo recomiendolo unico malo es el gps se demora en conectarse pero el resto todo bien
super long battery life, clean live sound from speakers, easy to use display and on-screen keyboard. Letter recognition works. Cons: no real keyboard.
for the price you get a lot of features that are competitive with some of the more popular phones.  clear signal good pictures during the day. pictures at night are a little fuzzy. gps eats up battery. 3.5 g downloads the from the internet really fast and wi-if is pretty good. with 16gb card can store a lot of photos, video and games. just wish ovi had more apps.
Phone is excellent, the only thing that made me kind of sad was that I cannot use the $50 amazon video card, because I'm in Costa Rica, and is only for USA usage.But ohter than that everything in the phone works perfect, a lot o fun with games and other aplications. I definitelly recommend the Nokia 5800.
is an excellent choice if you are looking for a touch screen smart phone, I've had a phew touch screen phones in the past but this is the best one yet, the only thing that I wasn't 100% happy with is the camera is not a very good one when there is not much light, but the rest is fantastic, the different writing modes are the best, you won't even notice it's a touch screen, berceuse you can blast emails and SMS messages like with a keyboard cell phone.
phone died in 5 days. 4 and counting attempts by nokia to repair  SAME ISSUEif you find anything wrong. RETURN for REFUND immed if possible.Purhcased at NYC flagship store. I had the phone working for 1st 5 days. When the battery started to discharge, i tried charging. It didnt charge at all. Store gave me new battery saying battery was at fault. Again same issue. It wudnt even turn on with the charger connected - so clearly its not just battery problem. By the time this battery discharged , the 14 day return period was over - pretty sure they knew it.Then started the saga of sending to nokia service center - PALCO. Already sent 4 times. each time had to ship back same evening or next day. Same problem for "repaired" "replaced" and "repaired again" phone.First they claim its "repaired", then 2nd time they claim "cannot be repaired...so replaced"...why did they send it then?but the so called replaced also had same issue - how can this be co-incidence?again sent...they claim repaired....but same issue.When i call....they dont agree to send me a courtesy phone since its clearly their mistake and 4 attempts are enough to figure out im being cheated.They wont give me refund or replacement.They wont even agree to send me a email saying they take responsibility to resolve the issue.5 is not my lucky number....i have no hope it will get resolved.looks like they will continue playing ping-pong till end of 12 months.WORST set of people.Bottom line: NEVER BUY UNLOCKED PHONES- even if its nokia flagship storeNEVER BUY NOKIARETURN WHEN YOU CAN
Fast shipping from amazon, item was received faster than expected. The Nokia 5800 is lightweight and very easy to use.  Most responsive touch screen that I have used.  I went from a N97 to the 5800.  I think it is a better phone for the money, cheaper phone but better quality and responsivness.  It gets better reception, clearer calls, music function is by far the best of any phone I've used or seen.  The apps are all user friendly, disc included with phone shows shortcuts and use of apps.  Nokia definitely got it right with this phone.
I really like this cell, I at the beginning I had a couple of issues with it but I did an upgrade to the latest software version and everything started to work great, it is really fast browsing and downloading stuff, I will rate this product with an "EXCELLENT".
Just got this phone and honestly, I prefer this touchscreen over others.Browsing the web though has left a lot to be desired as web pages don't display correctly.  Also my XP computer refuses to recognize this phone and the Nokia Updater won't run.  Amazon - where is the cute little stand that is supposed to be included?  I didn't get it!
I read the reviews on this phone before i made my purchase. The good reviews out weighed the bad so I went ahead. This phone is power packed. It has so many faetures that I have not even begun to venture into. So far it's working well. The only thing is, I cannot see the name or number of callers. This is a real peeve. I have been advised by my network that I need to take it to their office and they have to do something on it. Hope that sorts it out. It's really annoying right now not knowing. My other problem too is the sensitivity of the touch seems to be on and off. Sometimes delicately touching will set the phone in motion and at other times, you have to probe real hard. Still getting to know my new best friend though...
De entrada es magestuosa su presentación. Totalemtne tactil, amigable y poderoso. Existe la posibilidad de agregarle mas capacidad de memoria a través de la ranura de expansion, yo ya encargue una de 16gb, ya que de paquete trae una de 8gb. 95% recomendable, el resto 5% no lo recomendaría por ser algo complicado con el sistema de posicionamiento de GPS, a una semana de haber activado la cuenta de un mes gratis, no me he podido conectar con ningun satelite, no de modo general ni de modo asistido. Y justamente esta herramienta del GPS fue lo que me llamo la atencion al momento de hacer la compra por lo cual me siento un poco frustado. Espero conseguir la solucion al problema lo más pronto posible. En lo multimedia perfecto, en sonido externo fenomenal, es altamente recomendado, los videos corren de maravilla. Graba video, y toma fotos como un profesional. En resumen, si se solventa lo del GPS y el satelite, sería el mejor telefono del momento.
This phone works great I get reception in places my Sony Ericsson didn't. Great sound and video/pictures.1 word of caution if you buy it from Amazon and try there Unbox offer for $50 worth free video downloads, I entered the promo activation code and was still charged for the video. I emailed them 3 times on there help web page that said they answer usually in 12 hours. Never got a response!!!
This is a great phone for the price you pay, you may need some time to get used to the touch screen but after some hours you'll be ready to go.100% recommended!
I was looking out for a phone with a integrated GPS and found this one for a reasonable price. But got completely disappointed when I started using the GPS. Here are some of my findings.1. The GPS takes long time to lock up, can be upto 5 minutes. This is definately too long.2. The user interface on the GPS is not user friendly. E.g. it won't even show the complete route for the destination. I have upgraded to the latest maps but that wasn't helpful either.3. Address serach is not reliable. Some time it works, some time it doesn't. This is for the same address, not even different one.4. Lot of time, it doesn't even show the route... GPS keeps stuck in the "calculating route" mode.So overall, this phone is not good as a GPS.... I won't recommend it.
This phone is not up to Nokia's standards.The touch screen is resistive technology, much worse than capacitive as iPhone's or most of the new HTC's.The Symbian OS is really behind what you may have seen on iPhone or Android. Really behind. And it's so slow.The ear speaker lasted around 8 months until it broke. And the battery moved so the phone switched off from time to time.I really hope Nokia get their plot back because they are really falling behind....
This is a great cell phone love it, for me this smart Touch screen Phone better than I phone
This is a great mobile, it's a good cost-benefit relation.Its battery is poorI'm happy with this.
JANUARY 2010 UPDATE:  After having used the Nokia for a week, decided on returning it because of the short battery life and then even with an updated firmware, the screen became unresponsive needing turning off and on again the device in order to use the phone features.  As much as I like Nokia, they still have a long way to go with touch screens.INITIAL REVIEW: After one year using a Nokia E-71 which I dropped and stopped working, I searched for a replacement and found this XpressMusic5800 for $219.00 OnLine.  Ordered it from the blue computer store and have been "playing with it" for only 24 hours.  Nevertheless, being a recently introduced device in the US, thought on sharing my first impression for those who are considering it.Users familiar with Nokia products will love how user friendly this phone is.  Those unfamiliar with Nokia, might have a hard time setting up the many phone's features but it's worth your time.  Once you open the box, will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be.  The most attractive thing is how narrow it is.  Slightly shorter than an I-Phone and E-71, much narrower than both but somewhat thicker; a tad more than half inch.  Included is a wired remote control for the player, mic/headphones, the wall charger, strap, MicroSD card and a mini disk for installing the Nokia features.On the upper part of the device there is a micro USB dock, the port for the regular headset, the charging port and the on/off switch. On the right side there is a volume switch, the unlocking switch and a separate camera switch.  The left side houses an 8GB MicroSD card (included) and the SIM Card from your phone carrier.  The expected Nokia strap hooks on the lower left side of the phone.  The battery is on the back, facing downwards and to access it you need to remove the whole back cover.  The phone comes in shiny black which is a fingerprints magnet.When you turn it on it vibrates, shows the usual Nokia welcome and then allows you to program it.  I was able to configure my two main e-mails but guess you can do several more.  On my E-71 I had four different mail accounts constantly receiving messages.  The native wallpaper is black with some waves but you can easily change it to your favorite photo.  I downloaded several screens from the Apple website since the screen is somewhat similar to the I-Phone and I-Pod in shape and dimensions.On a very T-Mobile way, you can have your "four favorite people" on the main screen and once you touch their corresponding picture/icon, the phone shows a history of calls made, received, text messages and e-mails; quite innovative.  On the lower area you have an icon for phone dialing and another for your contacts.  The phone dialing keyboard works only in the vertical position but the font keyboard is accessed also while the device is horizontal.  Making a call trough the contact list is very easy the device is loaded with features.Call quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion.  The touch sensing screen is not as fast and accurate as the Apple devices but good enough for not needing the stylus that is housed on the rear of the phone.  As a music player it is outstanding.  Playback is trough the two micro speakers on the lower sides and sound quality as well as stereo separation are very good.  Nokia offers on this device all the goodies that make them unique such as saying the caller's name/ID, unique caller ringtones & photos and several customizable user modes. There are many features that I have not yet tried but will do during the next week or so.  My service is with ATT and works in both frequencies; EDGE & 3-G,Now, the limitations of the Nokia 5800:First; the battery life.  Nokia products have been famous for their extended batteries.  My E-71 could be used without recharging up to three days.  On the 5800, the battery drains in six hours. The stated four hours of talk time and two weeks of standby time are far from reasonable.What I did to prolong battery life was disable the vibrations when the screen gets a command, disable the 3-G (use EDGE only) and made the Bluetooth available for search for only one minute.  As of today, with regular calls, internet use, e-mails and music, after 15 hours of nonstop use, the battery still has like 40% charge.Second and quite disappointing, the installation mini disk as well as the software upgrades on the Nokia Website is not compatible with Windows 7.  After downloading all the suites, OVI, and ancillary software, many of these do not work with Win-7. Then tried these with a NetBook running Win-XP and no problem with the updates.Having stated all this, I consider that for the price paid ($219.00), the Nokia 5800 is a bargain when compared with their 51XX and 53XX series, mostly because of its music playing capabilities, awesome call features and quality.  But in my case, the battery issue might make me consider other alternate phones.  Let's see what I decide and meanwhile, I hope that this initial review helps you to decide if the Nokia 5800 is the phone for you.  In case that you are considering an I-Phone, you should wait. The new, smaller and slim I-Phone 4-G goes on sale in June 2010.
I love this phone. The touch screen is just right, too much but tolerable garbage programs on it by Nokia that you cannot remove. Decent but not great call quality. I thought I would not like stylus but really like its accuracy. Surfing the web (on ATT) is great with this phone. Its biggest problem is dropping calls, shutting down, acting like "memory overflow" when browsing the web and shutting down the browser. These problems cured temporarily by removing battery. The more you use it the more often you must pull battery to reboot. Mine is going back to Nokia for warranty repair tomorrow. Hope that helps. It came with V20  software, upgraded to V21, but Nokia won't release the V30 software in US yet. Who knows, that may cure problem, but first they will have to spend their factory dollars to investigate since they won't give U.S. new software. Last Nokia I will ever buy. There must be a company that can make a phone with good hardware and/or software??? I wish it worked......  UPDATE 9-3-09: ZPhone was having so many problems, sent it in to their REPAIR depot. It came back in ONLY 6 DAYS and has worked PERFECTLY since. They noted they "replaced crystal filter". I really like this phone and feel it is perfect now. It does make me want a larger screen and the new 4 inch devices being released are very tempting (when we can buy them unlocked). I hope they are are good as this phone for usability. Will consider other Nokias based on their repair service.
Obviously this phone has a lot of features for one in its price range.  And overall I'm happy with the purchase.  [Update 2011: I wish this piece of crap would die already]  The reception is good, the battery life is good, and it seems to be very solidly built.  [Update 2011: still true]  Synchronization with Outlook is easy once it is debugged.But it is a very difficult phone to operate in many ways.  The single-click to open an application and double-click to select at item is counter-intuitive to any user of any computer, and will never feel right.  It is very difficult to figure out how to change settings, and the manual is no help.  Actually, the manual is no help for anything-- it has almost nothing on troubleshooting (nor does the Nokia website) and seems to have a lot of factual inaccuracies, such as which commands are on which menu.  You would think that you could find commands intuitively, like with a real operating system--  but no.  Even the few applications that work well on this phone (music player, calendar, voice recorder) become enormous pains to use at times.  Just adding a "back" button would be enormously helpful. Never going to happen with Symbian.Also, there are a fair number of bugs.  I like to use the QWERTY keyboard, but it randomly reverts to T9.  Wifi connections disconnect for no apparent reason (no error message, and the phone never passed out of range).  Unlocking it may take eight or ten yanks on the little slider.  When you do unlock it, it often asks you to set an alarm rather than going to the home screen.  Bizarre.It has great trouble syncing with computers.  The Ovi software is a known scandal (search any Nokia forum), and simply doesn't work.  The Nokia PC Suite works most of the time, but every time they update it you face an hour or two of debugging. [Update 2011:  Fortunately, Nokia has stopped supporting this phone, so no more software or firmware disasters.  It says a lot about a company that life gets better when they stop supporting the product.]The GPS is a sad joke--  it gives my current location as a place I stayed a week ago, which is 200 miles away. In other words, it hasn't picked up a GPS signal between Boston and New York. maybe it only takes a GPS signals when you turn on the GPS. Who knows? The manual doesn't care to inform you of this. But, oddly, I did not turn on the GPS when I was in Boston, so *if* it only receives a signal when the GPS is turned on (and, again, there is no way to know whether this is the case), the GPS turned itself on when I was in Boston. Really, who can deal with an erratic piece of software like this? It's like having a phone that is a substance abuser.And there really aren't many apps for Symbian 5th Edition, and at the Ovi store (the Nokia house store)the cupboard is all but bare.  The one at that I thought was simple enough that even Symbian could run it was one that turned the camera flash into a flashlight. That worked for about a week before it started crashing the phone every time I used it.  Don't expect anything when it comes to add-on applications.
Good phone with some nice options. Nice touch screen, FM radio, GPS, Music player, cable to connect to PC to add Apps and games easily. Camera is OK, but not expecting much in a cell phone. Hopefully in the future manufacturers will address the camera quality since generally you carry this device everywhere.
Phone died in two weeks.  Return to Amazon.  They are always prompt and customer service oriented.
I Got this Phone yesterday and i`m returning it.The phone is just OK. and the sound Quality is the worst ever.It does not  worth the high price.I Cant Recommend this Phone.And I`ve had bad times with Nokia Phones.UPDATE:Before you buy this phone, Google, Create New Server Profile Nokia 5800. This is a Common Problem, And Nokia Has no Answer For this.
Amazon made me a Happy customer, everything went as planned. Thx and looking forward to make business with you in the future.
This phone is good, very good even, with a good set of features (Wifi, GPS, good music mgmt, video, etc) and nice touchscreen. However, don't think that this touchscreen is even close to the iphone's.The main problem, though, is the software used to sync the phone with the computer.  It's absolutely useless.  Just look it up on the internet, you'll see lots of complaints.  It's just silly that Nokia can't get this right.  I realize it's probably Vista's fault, but still I think it's Nokia that should adapt.  The funny thing is that the previous versions of the software used on the E71, for example, works perfectly.I think if you are a big music fan and you have the patience the get to know this phone and set it up, it's very good.  If you are looking for something easy to use and your main thing is the touchscreen maybe you should look for another phone.
I recently bought this device to upgrade from the Nokia N81 8gb, and so far I don't regret my decision.What I like about this 5800 Xpressmusic:1.- It has great reception2.- It is light (lighter than N81)3.- The big screen is nice, sensitive and requires zero calibration (not like the Palm TX I used to have some years ago)4.- The sound is even better than the one in the N815.- The Internet experience flows very well, you can even watch videos from youtube right from their website6.- GPS... mixed feelings tough, nice to have one, hard to master it, weak reception7.- The menus are very easy to get used to, very well organized, and you can still change their order or create folders to your own preference.8.- You have 4 different options for writing, from handwriting, to large full qwerty keyboard in the touch screen9.-The accelerometer works very well on directing the screen for vertical or horizontal display.10.- It comes with a micro SD 8gb (reads up to 16gb cards)11.- The PC Suite works great for sync with PC12.- Good to have a 3.2 megapixel camera (although I would only use it for emergencies, since the quality of small sensors is on the very low side)13.- Nice calendar, helps keep up with duties (although I would like some color code for different activities or meetings, something I liked from the Palm TX -although this is not the strength of this device, it is music, so well forget what I just said...)On the weaker side,1.- You cannot see the phone number of any of your contacts when you have dialed it. You have to enter in the full contact menu to see the phone number.(Still a defect also found in N81, you have to enter in the contacts to do that)2.- GPS has very low reception, so even a tinted window of the car can block the signal3.- Battery life does not seem to last as much as Nokia claims.4.- I miss the 4 way button from N81 (HTC has one for their touch screen models too) This is especially useful to scroll over long pages such as contact lists, moving among missing calls, or just navigating the internet, where if you touch the screen you can easily activate a link.5.- Plastic feels like the shell of an egg (but I guess that's the only way to get small but technologically complex devices)6.- Does not come with protective plastic for the screen (the N81 came with an excellent one from factory)7.- Terrible image organizer and editing. In N81, you could make albums, navigate over the photos and edit them in few steps, but now, the 5800 does not offer you the album option, you can make a folder and put the photos in, but if you want to rotate them you can quickly do it but won't save the image like that, you need to go the edit to change it, which involves 4 or 5 steps, and once you save it, it takes the image out of the folder you put it in!!8.- I am not into gaming, but the touchscreen games are like for kinder kids, forget about the great engage!So then, why is that I am giving this hot toy 3 1/2 stars?Because it is still dragging some few defects coming from the N81, and considering that I am reviewing a cell phone, beyond the nice extras, after all...The calling experience might not be so fluent...When you call someone, you cannot see their phone number if you need it quickly. I have to go back over the more than 600 contacts to find the phone number I just called... those of you who have a Nokia know how this can bother big time... (based on the same Symbian platform as N81)You can press the green call for starting a conversation or you can touch a button in the screen to do the same, so why to duplicate? Same for ending a phone call.The missing 4 way button (from N81) would have been great to navigate the nice extras of the phone without "aiming" well with the tip of your finger. But hey, N97 is coming, for a difference of price too.Overall, I recommend (barely) this cell phone, great reception (although this might depend on your service provider), fantastic sound, fluent Internet experience, excellent extras, outstanding screen and resolution, perfectly calibrated!UPDATE June 17, 2009.Cons... Regarding webmail....1.- If you are answering a message on the webmail (Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) say you wrote a paragraph of 10 lines and you need to add something to the 4th line of the paragraph, you CANNOT place the cursor in between, you have to delete all previous 6 lines to get to the position where you can edit your response. Now, if you don't mind that it is fine, I tend to review what I write and often add or rewrite an idea.2.- Since you cannot place the cursor wherever you want to to write webmail, if you are answering an email and you want to include the original senders message (what is normal) your message will start at the end and not the beginning (as normal) In order to start at the beginning you would have to delete the sender's original message!Regarding crashing...3.- In several occasions it has crashed, meaning that you hung-up a call and freezes, the solution is take the battery off and put it back.4.- In several occasions when you are browsing the web and touch the middle of the screen it closes the browser and disconnects... anyone with that problem? I has happened to me 1 in every 10 times or so.I am starting to think that Nokia could read my review to consider these annoying issues on future updates! :))
bought two Nokia 5800 xm phones, one for my wife the other for my daught. they love it no more. best built quality plus basement price, buy if you haven't yet.
I did quite a bit of research before I purchased this phone, as I always do. Of the unlocked phones that were reasonably priced, this one seemed very promising. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. If you want a phone for its camera/video and audio playback, this would be a decent choice. If you plan on using the phone for sending text messages and you expect quality, stay away! The problems I experienced were as follows:· The phone would just lock up and become unresponsive. The only cure for this was removal of the battery. Which, if your phone was in a case like mine, was a huge pain.· The screen when in keyboard mode would get tiny pixels (green in color) that would not go away unit you closed the application. The more I used the phone the more frequently this happened.· The message light would start blinking at random times, most of the time after I had checked/read a text. Sometimes it would blink once, sometimes twice but very inconsistent in its operation. This is minor but goes toward my thinking that this phone will not last.· This phone doesn't support HTML browsing, not a flaw in the phone, but when you go to the Internet you realize what you are missing.· When in text mode, you can only see one side of the conversation. Again, not a problem with the phone, but bothersome nonetheless. I had a Blackberry Curve and you don't realize what you have till it's gone.· Some of the other reviewers mentioned multiple steps to navigate through the phone, they're right. I think with a little refinement this could be a nice phone.· When sending texts there is not support for spell checking, it's just not user friendly. No predictive text, no auto capitalization, all things you miss once your phone doesn't have them.All in all, I would not recommend this phone. I sent it back and purchased the MyTouch Google phone made by HTC and spent $100 less. Amazon is a great company, no complaints there, just not a good product.
I bought this phone 3 months back when it was on sale discarding all the negative reviews and warnings by Amazon users. Now i feel that I made a huge mistake. I shouldn't have paid [...] for this piece of crap.1. The phone died the first day. Yes.. after couple of hours of use the phone just went black and couldn't reboot after. So had to sent it back to dell and they sent me a new one.2. The touch screen is not responsive at times. You sometimes have to use your nails and press so hard.3. Scrolling on this phone sucks. It is so frustrating when the scroll is so slow and doesn't respond at all sometimes.4. THIS PHONE FREEZES. Yes.. When you are in the middle of a conversation, the phone can go all black. You will be able to talk but won't be able to disconnect the call or do anything else. None of the buttons work, neither do the touch screen. Not even the on/off switch works at this point. You have to manually remove the battery to reboot it. Someday this happens 2 or 3 times. I did read about this problem but didn't believe it will be true for every unit, but it is.5. The dial pad doesn't have alphabets, it has only numbers. So if you want to dial 1-800-amazon or something like that, you have to search for another phone with alphabets and numbers or remember it all.6. Bluetooth is not compactable with my BMW car kit. It connects and disconnects all the time. Nokia asked me to call BMW to get a fix on this. I would rather keep my car than this piece of junk.7. Making a call or getting contact details is sometimes a lengthy process. Contacts and logs are not easily accessible while you are on a call.The phone is not worth the money. Nokia needs to improve the functionality in order to compete in this market. I would recommend not buying this phone until all these issues are fixed in the next release.
This phone is too complicated to use! I had this phone for almost a month now and I still couldn't figure out how to use some of the features without using the manual book. The battery only last a couple days after fully charged. The headphone wire is way too short. The lengh is from your ear to your upper chest. Therefore, unless your coat has a pocket on your upper chest, you have to hold your phone in front of your chest everytime you try to enjoy the music quietly.I will not recommend this phone to a friend!
I purchased this phone from amazon leaving dell though the price is less in Dell, bcos i believe and had good past experiences with Amazon.Unfortunately for the first time i got this  phone delivered very late and right from the first day i have seen lines comming up on display screen and with in couple of days they r showing up a lot. I have checked with Amazon for exchange and due to unavailability of stock, Amazon has returned back my money.The return policy was quick enough.
The phone only worked for two months and then the screen went black. My warranty was up and I now have to try the Nokia to have it repaired or have it changed. My problem is that I live in the Caribbean and I have to ship it back to the USA. The phone was not very responsive to the touch and would sometimes freeze .
This product is nicely equipped with more than enough features, but for my sole opinion the price should be a little more lower to beat all other competitive.
I really enjoy this cell phone!I was expecting a lot, but it surprised me.
I used this phone for around 2 weeks and then decided to send it back.Good:It's a Nokia, so the calls were all clean and crisp.The form of the phone in my hand was exactly what I've been looking for.The screen is very bright and nice to look at.Bad:The OS looks like something you would have been using 3 years ago.  For the first try at a touch phone, it's pretty good but there are just too many other touch phones that have already got the OS right.The Ovi store is still not worth going to.  Only a few of the apps are even made for the 5800.  And most of those were just ported over from the original app to be used with the 5800.The camera should be better.  There is no excuse why a 3.2mp Nokia can't take a decent looking picture indoors.Overall I would say its a nice phone for the price but there are just too many phones out this summer to settle on this one.  However if you are buying a phone for your kids, this wouldn't be a bad choice.
Power off your NokiaBefore removing your tiny memory card, take note of the orientation as you are removing it, if you forget RTFM (Read The Find Manual)Power on your NokiaA screen will show up asking if you want to get out of the offline modeSelect "YES", thank God!If you select "NO", you Idiot!, repeat this instruction from the beginning.Good Luck mate!.....................................Source (Thanks to Nigel):I have a nokia N80 smartphone with the latest firmware (v5). I also have lots of customized applications installed.Yesterday I switched it to offline mode, and then powered down.MISTAKE!On powering up I then got prompted for "Do you wish to stay in offline mode" but regardless of what I entered it would not go online, and was running slow. A very smart phone now... :-(I tried all combinations of power up/down, menus etc to no avail, although did notice on shutdown I could see the "Enter PIN" dialogue, but it was hidden/in the background and inaccessible.Finally I removed the memory card and it switched to online mode perfectly. I was then able to replace the memory card & things carried on working fine.So I guess some sw interaction - but a useful tip - if you get stuck in offline mode, try booting up without memory card. I also recommend installing all except critical software to the memory card - makes it easy to disable in case of any problems-- Nigel......................................no gateway replyUse the instruction as a guide.  If you follow the instruction verbatim, you might end up confusing your self like I did.  Best of luck![...]
The cell phone has good looking, works fine and is nice. Battery performance is very poor.
Hi I bought this phone . But even I couldnt use it for 1 month. I was not in Us to return with in 30 days. And warranty covers only 10 days. You sholuld know this. Plus i cant find the number to contact with celler. The phone even couldnt open it , it was not fall down anything, by it self it start to not working. I am so dissappointed with this situation and I do not know what to do, Who can I speak with.Seda Alpat
The reason I bought it was because it is unlocked! As a phone, it does a god job... but sometimes it cracks...
Tried this touchscreen out and for those who say its better than Iphone...crazy! I had this first for 3 weeks and then bought the 3GS and there is no comparison.  Web browser, UI of the touchscreen, typing, apps all go to the iphone hands down.  The Nokia doesn't even have any sort of check spelling or word correcting on it....seriously.  And the screen would get caught in landscape mode and I would have to shake it vigoursly and then after 10 seconds or so it would rotate.  I added quickoffice to both and with it for the iphone I can store any pdf's, word, and excel files directly on my iphone and view and email anytime so there isn't a need for an sd card.  Being able to sync with itunes, which is what i use, is nice especially coming from the blackberry bold where it also synced effortlessly...on the nokia...yah..not even close.  If you want a simple small touchscreen then I guess its ok but for anything else the iphone or maybe one of the new android or htc's coming out would be the way to go.
Nokia product is getting worst.  the ring tones play in music player.  nothing change.  need more improvement.  the product is made from china.  5 stars is for low iq people.
I was sorry to see that what could have really given the iPhone a run for its money is actually trailing...Here is what I liked:1) Great sound! For a phone, the full body sound from its stereo speakers was amazing! Great for music, and as a speaker-phone.2) The size - fits very nicely in the hand. Body is plastic - but feels solid.3) Fastest GPS initialization I have ever seen in a portable 'period' let alone a phone-gps!4) Great video playback.5) Loved the handwriting recognition.Here are my dislikes:1) The Phone user interface is lacking. Especially if you use systems that require DTMF tones to operate. There were several occasions when even after getting the soft dialer on the screen, the digits did not send out the tones - on other occasions it did - I was not able to figure out what I was doing differently to get consistent behavior. The phone had to go back because of this.2) Applications just suck up power - if you use the phone for more than th e phone, you'll run short.3) Application hangups - podcasts downloaded caused the media player to get stuck. Had to cycle power to restore.4) Email application does not support HTML.5) No flash player6) WiFi selection is stupid... it does not automatically pick known wifi when in its proximity...7) Feels the phone could use more horsepower.I'm waiting for the N97...Cheers!
Nice phone, if I ever get to use it.  I just got mine today from Amazon.  The box was not sealed.  When I open it, I was missing the quick start guide, the Nokia brochures, and the $50 Amazon coupon for video downloads.  After waiting 40 minutes to speak with a representative, I was told that since the coupon was not listed on the website, they are not responsible for it.  So if you want an open box (sounds like a refurbishment to me) and chance not getting the $50 coupon, order from Amazon.  Who knows, you might just get the one I just returned.The one star is for the Amazon experience and not so much the phone.
I thought this phone would a nice touchscreen phone based on other reviews but I am highly disappointed!The only things I'm pleased with:1. battery life- it seems that it can go on for 2-3 days without charging if you're not using the phone too much.2. call quality is decent3. typing is easy- can use fingernails unlike iphoneHowever, beware of:1. terrible interface- very un-user friendly. Haven't quite seen something like this. The features are there but it'll take you forever to figure out how to use it2. difficult to call ppl- very basic feature a phone should have! Again, because of terrible interface. Have to click so many buttons just to call one person or to look up someone's number3. slow and unstable- the phone is slow to respond sometimes (3 sec lag after EACH time you unlock your phone). Also the screen flip flops randomly- so you have to adjust the way you hold your phone to use it based on its (not yours) preferencesI'm not a super tech savvy person so I just really need a phone that's easy to use and have good features. Unfortunately this phone does not satisfy those requirements. I hardly ever return anything but this phone is going back.
will purchase this phone and I brought out cable TV carriers, nor shown in the labels
This phone is not reliable.yes you will say its not.But this phone hangs up if somebody will call you while you are surfing the net exampl watching youtube,sending message on facebook or chatting on fring.The bad thing about that the phone cannot recover by itself from hanging up and in order to revive this phone you have to manually remove the battery.SO HORRIBLE.i BOUGHT THIS CP BECAUSE IT HAVE IT ALL INTERNET,CAMERA,MUSIC AND PHONE BUT IT CANNOT HANDLE THE TASK.IMAGINE THAT CELLPHONE FUNCTION IS OFF IF YOU ARE USING THE INTERNET,..HUHUHU......I PAID 340 US FOR AND WORST I BOUGHT 4.i GUESS I HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS MUSIC PLAYER AND MID.
I bought this item and item was bad and i exchanged it but that was too bad.So i think that stock was bad.
I bought mine in april and my earpiece has the worst sound of any phone, i know its going to fail and die. It doesn't sound strong, i can't  even hear if its in my purse, and the sound is like a bass too loud for speakers. Get it? like is getting broken. I live in south america, and i dont know if the nokia warranty still works if you get the phone out of USA. Is it still available or not?
Not so great phone after all,.. I owned almost every Nokia phones.Touch screen so wimpy,.. very hard to navigation around. Impossibly to scroll down the phone book and stopping by the correct name.Also phone dead now,..when power up. Screen said Return to provider for service, boot up fail.
This is a Cheap made in China phone with a very ugly camera and video quality, it takes terrible pictures
Cell phones are so 1999! Nowadays everyone uses a pager or writes letters to see what their friends are up to.
I been using this phone in replacement of my issued phone, being an unlocked phone, I was able to use the sim from my regular phone and get to load a whole lot of music, with the memory card capacity that i can usefor this phone, its just awesome. great for loading short movies to my 8gig card. thanks...
i am not completely satisfied, because the item came withouth headphones, free hand, cover, instructions etc.
I have to say, after owning the Wildcard for 1 1/2 years(and oh boy, did I suffer), I am thoroughly impressed by the XTC.The XTC has a crisp, large screen. The resolution is marvelous, it takes very nice pictures in medium to bright light, and the fonts, program design is very attractive. You can set it to three different themes- the black/red Virgin Mobile color combo, white, or black. I use the black and it looks so amazing.The keyboard takes some getting used to, but after inputting all of my contacts from previous Wildcard phone, I am loving the keyboard layout. I love how the "back" key is at the right bottom corner. The keys are decent sized, easy to press, and the keys are really responsive. Plus the design looks very elegant and functional.The sound quality is also MUCH better than the Wildcard. In fact, I'd like to say that I am absolutely pleased with the earpiece sound quality and volume, and the speakerphone volume and sound clarity. I loaded a couple hundred songs onto the micro SD card, which I popped into the XTC, and playing back the music was actually very clear and pleasant, even when I playback heavy rock songs.Overall I find the XTC to be very functional, slim, well-designed, and my only fears now are my fingerprints smearing the glossy screen or accidentally dropping the phone because I've been using the phone so often.[...]
For prepaid phone, design is very sleek. Bigger bright LCD screen, slide-out keyboard, slim, many basic features plus more. My previous phone was Wildcard and overall it's so-so upgrade. It could've been so much better.Pros-Design. It's just sexy to look at for a prepaid phoneA slide-keyboard.Bluetooth, memopad, alarm, blah blah which are kinda standard nowadays.Way better speaker than Wildcard, for obvious reason(if you own a Wildcard you know why). Can listen to MP3 too without headphone.MP3 player supported with microSD flashcard, with "Play, Back, Foward" buttons on face of the phone for easy access.PS-All songs must be in 1 single folder. No sub-folders, meaning you have to manage the playlist from scratch.ETC that many already mentioned.Cons-Battery life. It lasts shorter than Wildcard, which was also a phone for heavy texter. If you call/text everyday, expect to recharge it everyday.Keyboard keypad positions. There are no gaps between the keys like other phones. This means you'll more likely to make typos. I have to use my fingernails to make precise typing.Space+Enter+Back keys=MESS. Space key clicks softer than the rest of the keys, so I'm not sure if I pressed it or not without looking at the screen. Sometimes I end up doublespacing. Enter key is on TOP of the Back key, which is opposite of the standard QWERT keyboards out there. I mean come on! I got used to it, but it's still akward.LCD screen ALWAYS auto-adjust horizontally once the keyboard is out, except when you're at the top menu. What this means is that phone has the motion censor that detects whether you're holding the phone vertically or horizontally, but goes to horizontal display whenever you move from the top menu to elsewhere with the keyboard out despite holding it vertically.Backlight turns on randomly during battery-save mode. Once the LCD screen is off after couple seconds, it will light up again for no reason and then goes to black again. I've seen it doing it couple times in the first 10-15 minutes, but not sure if it does it over and over overnight. This means it's draining more battery for no reason.Front facebuttons are small and positioned way too low. This could be due to bigger LCD screen, but it feels very uncomfortable to reach those buttons without changing the way I hold the phone. Simply look at the picture of this phone and compare to other ones out there.So there you have it. Looks good and can make calls and texts with ease, but with many flaws that could've been easily fixed.PS-I'm a very picky person so the cons I mentioned might not be the big deal to many of you.
Let me start off by saying I am VM fan. No contracts and decent pricing schemes. This is my 3rd Virgin mobile phone. My last one being the Super Slice. This phone has everything I was looking for. It's cool and mature looking [VM phones tend to look children toys], decent battery life, and a slide out keyboard for easy texting.  So where did it fail? Sound quality! It's awful. The sound coming from the ear piece is low and has tons of static. Oddly enough the person on the other side can hear you just fine.If it wasn't for that. This phone would easily be a 4 or 5. Don't recommend buying this phone unless you just want to do texting. Don't really care about the media player functions or the camera. They should of left that stuff off the phone worked on the sound quality a lot more.
After several years with Tracfone, I finally decided to jump ships when I saw this phone being offered by Virgin Mobile with pay-as-you-go service.Tracfone's limited phone choices really are pathetic, by comparison, and the relative cost of ownership, once I started to look more closely, was much higher.That said, I got the X-tc and fell in love with it immediately. The feature set is excellent, the phone sound quality is fine, the keys may be cramped but heck, it's a tiny little package and feels pretty solid. In fact, the only reason why I give it a 4 rather than a 5 is that it doesn't feel *really* solid when you open out the keyboard - there's a bit of "rocking" that gives it a slightly fragile feel.Otherwise, given the price, it does all those neat things you'd want from a phone like this, including music ringtones by caller, music ringback by caller, automatic switching between portrait and landscape when you turn the phone around, etc. etc. - take a look at the spec sheet, it's a mile long.In fact, it has so many features, I still get lost a bit in the menus - which I would say is another shortcoming that keeps this product from getting a 5 from me - the menu hierarchy is deep and sometimes difficult for this AARP member to remember.Now, as far as Virgin Mobile customer service is concerned: don't listen to those who are too impatient to deal. The fact is, if you're calm and deal with them with the respect you'd expect them to give you, they're as good as their JD Power rating implies. I had a bit of trouble getting my phone to activate following the instructions on the web site; I called, waited a few minutes, got a fellow who knew the script and got me through the process, and, as I said: mutual respect goes a long way to making these conversations a lot more pleasant than if you go and yell at them that they have no clue. (Being able to describe the problem well also helps - these CRM folk are just reading from menus and scripts, and being able to give them the right words to search for an answer helps a lot.)VM's customer service gets a 5 from me :)*******Edit/follow-up: I don't know why others are having a hard time with the battery, but mine has been performing to spec: about 3 hours talk time, 200 hours standby. Not stellar, but the batteries are $20 apiece and easily replaceable - try that with an iPhone. ;)
I want to start by saying that I love this phone so much that it put my Blackberry Pearl to shame. People are saying that the sound quality and volume is low. I totally disagree. The volume is loud as well as the speaker volume and it's loud when you use the bluetooth. If the earpiece is low then use the speakerphone or a bluetooth headset. I use a Kyocera Bluetooth headset for this phone. My only drawbacks for this phone is the battery life is short when you are surfing the internet and the keys are slightly cramped. The keys are not no more cramped than the Blackberry Pearl and the sound qulaity is 3 times louder than the Blackberry Pearl. I feel that for the price this phone does exactly what it should do.I enjoy checking my emails, my Facebook account and there's also Twitter. The Washington Post, ABC, CNN, CNBC, New York Times and LA Times is on this phone. You can easily access Craigslist and Amazon.Com. The Opera Mini web browser makes the speed fast. Some people are saying that it's not but I guess it depends on where you live. You should go to Virgin Mobiles website and check the coverage are to make sure you'll get the coverage you need. I think everyone looking for an affordable phone should at least try it before making a decision. Don't compare this phone to an Iphone because that it is not, but right now I'm glad I invested this money for this little item. Good luck and happy phone hunting.
Finally, a VM phone that doesn't look like it was designed for young or budget-conscious prepaid users. This phone doesn't have EVDO speeds or the ability to record 30 second video clips like the VM Shuttle, but it does have a slide out key keyboard and a larger display. Both of these come in handy when texting or surfing the web. Sound from the speakerphone and wired headset is loud and clear, but earpiece quality is the biggest disappointment of this phone. The incoming volume is too low and scratchy. Surprisingly, outgoing voice quality is just fine. Another minor gripe is that the GUI is a bit sluggish resulting in half second lags whenever a key action is performed. This may be Virgin Mobile's best phone in their lineup, but it is far from perfect.
I bought this phone about 2 weeks ago. I absolutely LOVE this phone. Finally, a VM phone, that doesn't LOOK like a vm phone. You can even buy snap on cases for it which I did and they work great, and then the phone can be any color you want. I was debating on this or the shuttle...my last phone was a slider sonic, which I LOVED, but it finally died on me (after 2 yrs). I wanted the shuttle bc of how much I loved the slider sonic...but chose the xtc bc of the keyboard...I do not text much but am tired of having to be annoyed by texts people send me...they would write a long text and I would answer in 2-3 words. Now I dont mind texting back at all. To me, the keyboard is easy to use. The one thing I miss is the video recording option...the shuttle does have this...I liked being able to take a short video of my kids, and put it on my computer w/o having to either email it to myseldf or "upload" to VM. I do carry around my camera all the time, and so just use that more, so it wasn't REALLY a big issue for me, and it having the keyboard makes up for it. I don't think I could go back to a phone w/o a keyboard, and I am 40 yrs old not a teenager, and its only been 2 weeks. But, I do, kinda miss not being able to record video, but not enough to get the shuttle over this. I am NOT a heavy texter by any means, but its hreat to have when I want it. I love being able to put MY music on it...thats why I kept my slider sonic for so long, it used to be the ONLY vm music phone. Buy a cord and listen to it over your car stereo, and if it rings the music will stop and the phone rings. I have never used bluetooth, but my regular headphones (had to buy an adaptor at radio shack 3.5mm to 2.5 mm I think, but I had it 2 yrs you need it to use regular headphones on ANY phone) work just fine too, to listen to music. A great phone, overall, if you are used to pay-as-you-go phones, it is THE BEST!!! If you are switching from a major contract carrier, there are better phones out there for the same price...but for vm it is the best and you wont feel like your talking on your kids phone, it really is nice.
This is a really good phone. At first I had trouble with the phone. So I contacted Virgin Mobile, and they sent me a new one. Now I am so happy. This phone is really nice. In my opinion the best VM phone. I've had the Wildcard and the Shuttle. And this phone is way better than both of those phones. The keyboard is small but you get used to it. And the screen is so big, bright, and clear. I would definitely recommend this phone.
hmm i think this will be a nice phone cant wait 2 get it!! as soon as i make 100 dollars im getting it!!
I've been using Tracfone for years and I initially wrote a harsh review because adding minutes to the phone via the website was a nightmare. All that has changed now and adding minutes couldn't be any easier. No more adding lines of numbers over and over again. You basically just enter your serial number and keep clicking on continue. I recently upgraded my phone to this model and transferring my telephone number from my older phone was very easily (again I did it on the website). I find this model to be much better than my older phone. The volume and sound quality is great and I the flip case. The double minutes feature is also great. Tracfone also does nice things like give you free minutes on your birthday. I've been very pleased with the phone and the service.
I switched to Tracfone a couple of years ago to save money, and at that time, I bought the Motorola V170, which was a downgrade from the Samsung phone I used with Verizon. I assumed that's what I'd be stuck with as long as I was with Tracfone, so I was surprised to see this phone appear on the market with a pretty nice set of features. I have purchased this phone for both my wife and I and ported our old numbers and minutes over (no problems there, but make sure the tech you talk to knows how many minutes you currently have). This phone is pretty slick. The sound is great, the screen is nice and big, bluetooth integration is great (I've paired it with my car's integrated system, my laptop, and another LG600g), and the features are surprisingly robust. Two nits: (1) The camera kind of sucks. If there's any kind of motion, the picture will be blurry. (2) Ringtones can only be in midi or amr format. The sound quality on amr is lousy--mp3 would have been nice.All in all, it's a better phone than I ever hoped to get when I switched to Tracfone.
the good things:small, lightweight, compactkeypad feels good and has a satisfying click to itt9 predictive texting - makes texting very very easy. and fast.voice/audio recorder - kinda random, but it might be useful sometime, i guess.there's a small two part button on the side that you can use to adjust your ringtone volume, or set your phone to vibrate or silent. (instead of having to navigate through a really long menu). if you're in a call, it will adjust the call volume. its very convenient.external display - if you just want to check the time without opening the phone, you can just press a button on the side, and you can see the date, time, signal strength and battery level on the outside screen.the things that annoy me:when you go to your inbox, the sender isn't in the title of text messages - it only shows the date and first few words of the message. really stupid, imo. also, when you get a new text, you can't tell who it's from until you open it.camera is really low qualityother things:the internet access is crippled, so don't expect to check your email from this phone or anything.bluetooth, however, isn't crippled, and was very easy to setup and use (at least with a mac). its especially useful if you plan to take pictures or use the voice recorder, because it doesn't cost any minutes to transfer them to your computer using bluetooth. you can also transfer ringtones this way.battery life seems pretty good, i haven't tested it but it goes down to 2/3 charge after about 2 days, so it could probably last a week on one charge.stuff about tracfone in general:activate your phone over the internet, its much easier than calling them. none of their representatives speak english very well, and the internet activation process is much easier anyway.USE BONUS CODES!! search on the internet for them. i added a 400 min, 365 service days card and got 350 bonus minutes. so with double minutes for life, that comes out to 2 * 400 + 350 = 1150 minutes for 99 dollars = 8.6 cents per minute. which = a good deal.if you're choosing between this and the motorola w376g -(this is all stuff i've read from other reviews on the internet. It is from reputable sources, but i don't actually own the motorola w376g. try googling "pbushx2's weblog" for lots of in-depth phone reviews)in terms of texting:t9 (this phone) > iTAP (motorola). i've heard on the motorola you have to press ok to auto-complete a word, whereas with the lg you just press 0 (space), which is much less awkward. also, i've read that the input is kind of slow/lags on the motorola.call quality:other reviews have said that the sound quality is poor on this phone (especially compared to the motorola), and you people sound like they are far away, or talking through a tunnel. I don't notice this at all, it sounds fine to me. its never dropped a call, and i've always gotten reception. (though i live in LA, so i'm not sure how the reception is out in rural areas)bluetooth and internet:bluetooth is crippled on the motorola, so if you want to transfer pictures, you have to send them to your email, which costs minutes.a lot of people complain about hitting the web browser button by accident with the motorola, and then getting minutes deducted.the button isn't as inconveniently placed on this phone. i've never once hit it by accident.other stuff:i'm pretty sure the motorola has a scroll wheel, which would make navigating the menus much easier, but i'm not certain.the external display on the motorola doesn't show the date and timeso yeah, overall i would say this a better choice than the motorola w376g, and the worth the extra ten dollars.
The LG600G is an excellent phone!Transferring my minutes and phone number from my old TracFone was painless using Tracfone's website, and I didn't have to wait days for the transfer to be complete.  It was done just as soon as I was finished on their web page!!Bluetooth works excellent!  I easily paired it with my GPS, earpiece,  and laptop.I've been using it for a few days now, and have not experienced any dropped calls, always good connections.  The camera is very basic, but I already have a camera, and I didn't buy this for the camera.It comes from Tracfone with free double minutes for life, and if you can afford to buy large blocks of minutes, Tracfone usually has good bonus minute deals.  So far, with the package I got through HSN, my costs have been less than $0.08 per minute!Everyone I have spoken with over this phone say that my voice is nice and clear.  And they sound good to me!  All in all, the LG600G from Tracfone has been a very good deal for me!
Great phone with great reception. Also, with this phone you can get the weather on radar.
Bought this for the double minutes but has been a good phone as well. Easy voice mail etc, however, cannot figure out how to backspace through misspelled names. Not a single dropped call and I live in the sticks.
We signed up with Net10 (they're affiliated with Tracfone) with the LG600G phone & the first one was a dud (very, very muted voice audio from the phone).  Net10 was good about sending out a free replacement & a return mailer-- I give them credit for that-- but the 2nd phone was barely any better.  On the 2nd phone, the voice sound was weak and garbled.  We called Net10 on the phone so they could hear what we were experiencing-- they wanted none of that & immediately insisted that we dial back from a hard-line (& wait in the phone queue again).  Then we got a big run-around ("try it for a few more weeks to see if it gets better"-- we had already done that for 2 weeks and it was more than enough).We already have a different net10 phone, it works great, the sound is perfect, we know what a good phone sounds like.  I'm leery of this phone based on the two failures. YMMV.  In the long run, I'm inclined to give Net10 the benefit of the doubt based on prior experience, but we needed a phone without any more fooling around.  So...After 2 dud LG600G phones and way too much run-around the 2nd time from Net10-- bye, bye Net10, hello T-other-company.
I purchased this tracfone about six months ago to replace my phone with one of the big carriers.  My experiences with their customer service were horrible.  I initially bought minutes via one of the cards at the grocery store.  It didn't work, but I needed a phone that day.  I had to buy them online.  When I called customer service to get the credit for the time I purchased it took over one hour on the phone with several people to get someone that had the ability to help with the problem.  They were friendly, but not competent.After a few weeks I started experiencing dropped calls. Whenever I initiated a call, my phone would drop the call in the first ten seconds of my conversation.  For some reason my second attempt would remain connected.  My phone has been a frustration for my friends and my family.I've also experienced issues with the phone shutting down (power) while I am on a call (with a full charge)I've experienced issues with minutes vanishing.  (This may be user error, since there are times when my calls are still connected when I pick up other calls)  One time, I lost 75 minutes.Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this phone and service to anyone.
I purchased this phone on sale for a very low price (twenty dollars).  I did it because it had bluetooth that could connect to my computer.  I have since switched back to my old phone.It doesn't serve the simple function of making a call.It's reception compared to other phones on the same service is horrible.I had it connected to my car.  The phone displayed 4 bars on it's screen while the car showed zero bars (emergency calls only).My money is wasted on the phone.My time is wasted on tracfone.Save your time and money, buy something else.
I bought this phone from tracfone website, was supposed to be compatiable to my area, I was an existing customer and just wanted to upgrade to a better phone, it was a nightmare I went for 3 weeks with little or no service spent countless hours on the phone with tracfone tech support, all of which are barely understandable.  Until I wised up and went to amazon and purchased a go phone ( the motorola razr)by ATT, which is also a prepaid phone, and had free 2 day delivery when I got the phone I was up and running in 15 minutes ATT is far more superior than tracfone.
NICE AND GOOD SOUND,BUT,SLIPPERY,HARD TO OPEN CLAMSHELL and ANNOYING EXTRA STEP TO SPEAKER PHONE. ALSO TINY 0 WITH SLASH THRU IT OFT MISTAKEN FOR AN 8
I haven't used this item yet, but since I had to rate it, I put one star. I just want to make people aware of something before they buy this phone.  My boyfriend and I just bought 2 of these phones.  We went to the Tracfone website to transfer our numbers from the old phones to the new and a message came up stating the phones' technology was not compatible with our area and to call Tracfone.  I just spent a long time on the phone going over all sorts of information because they need to send us phones that will work here and we need to send the phones we got through Amazon to Tracfone.  Plus, in order to keep my same number, I had to give up all my minutes for 72 hours!  I checked back on Amazon and saw no warning that the phone may not be compatible with the buyer's area.  Who knows?  Maybe Target is supposed to be aware of which phones go to which areas.  From now on I will purchase my phones locally.
The entire reason I got this phone was so that I could use mp3 ring tones.Will NOT work.Otherwise, the phone seems to be working well.
Good luck porting your number from an existing tracfone to a new one.  I was told 72 hours and it's been 7 days.  All they do is apologize but have they fixed it? NO.This has been a nightmare.  I have no phone.
I had this phone for about three months, until it fell from about 3 feet and the screen broke.That said, I'll write this review being objective, based on the whole experience as a user.Pros:- Capacitive Screen: Yes, just like the iPhone, no need to press, just touch. You can perform gestures such as sliding pictures or scaling them with two fingers.- Nice interface: the rotating cube is great. The contact manager is as good as it gets, I loved it.- Wonderful screen resolution: 480x800- Good looking and not bulky at all, especially for that resolution.- Great multimedia features: decent camera, video with sound, 8GB, nice music player.- Good battery life when used as a music player: I had this phone playing music for hours in a party with no need for a charger.Cons:- Average battery life with day to day use.- Slow: Browsing is embarrassingly slow. I thought that was normal for a cell phone until I saw some other phones browsing way faster, even phones worth half the price. Navigation is fast 90% of the time but occasionally it'll freeze for a few seconds. Same thing with the accelerometer, sometimes it just doesn't realize it has to rotate the screen.- Interface mistakes: regardless of the great looks, it has some obvious mistakes. For example, when you make a call it locks the screen, so far so good. But sometimes you need to unlock the phone (to dial an extension number for example) and guess what, as soon as you click the unlock button on the highly sensitive screen there's a red "hang up" button just below it waiting for you to click it by mistake.Also, IMHO the "call" button on the phone should open the dial-pad and the one on the screen the "recent calls list", not the other way around.- Kind of fragile: I've had Nokias fall harder with no problems whatsoever.Well, that pretty much summarizes it, I hope you find my review useful.
I bought this Arena via Amazon.com (MobileCityOnline) and connected it to my desktop to synchronize it. LG PC Suite III asked me if I would like to update my Arena, which I did.After this been done I could not use this phone anymore and having VERSION MISMATCHING in the phone display.Amazon as well as MobileCityOnline refusing to have it flash resetted, as this phone is an international one and can only be resetted outside the States. I paid 520,00 US for this phone and still can not use it. I feel robbed. DO NOT BUY THIS ARENA FROM AMAZON! Be warned, apparently these phones are only for the Singapore market without warranty although Amazon said it has full warranty. Also I ordered a 16GB and got the 8 GB delivered. Do not buy with Amazon.com !!!
Phone would freeze up at least three times a day.  Nice when it worked, but the software problems made this thing a P.O.S.. Could not send photos via email when using the 5MP camera.  Not enough memory to send it.  I had to downsize to 3MP. Would not fetch mail at the intervals I had put in.  It tried and locked up.  LG did not think this software through.  Allot of money for bad software.  Sent it back to mobilecity and got hit with a 15% restocking fee even though the phone was defective.  Buyer beware.
I'm easy to please when I see something i like. So I like this phone and I wouldn't trade it in for any other (at the moment) but that's just me. It comes with it's fair share of problems though. One key problem is that when i'm on the net, say checking my mail, if i choose to save the password (prompt from phone) and then try to sign into the same mail service with a different username and password the phone restarts. To avoid this (I've learnt all by my lonesome) You have to either clear the cache (or turn it off completely) each time you want to use a different sign-in for the same email service...OR opt not to save the password each time you put one in and are prompted to chose whether or not to do so. There are other little probs but I really don't care as I said I like it despite. The good stuff can be found all over the net and some more of the other trivial pitfalls of this model
I would say this Phone is very well design,stylish fun, cool etc , its got some cool features,size is good ,processing a bit slow,i realy want the gps the GPS have two selection AGPS and STAND ALONE, STAND ALONE GPS i dont know if it works or not, never can be turned on, WIFI connects every time (verygood), price is good, its not loud as i thought it would be,cannot connect to the pc suite i paid $350 worth its new price $300. every other features work good FM Transmitter works well MUSIC TRANSMIT VER CLEAR but got to be close the radio.Some of the features are better that the Iphone,very fun to play with.love this phone despite the gps is not a stand alone.BETTER than nokia Express Music 5800,it comes with 5mp camera, comes with a skin and screen protector.built in 8gb can expand to 16gb.Agps works draw backs GPS not stand alone. got it 1 month and NEVER FREEZED UP. EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE
- The phone has a spectacular design, pretty stylish, small, fulfilled all my expectations in design.- The interface is very nice, friendly and fluid video playback is spectacular and very fast, excellent sound and clarity of the screen.- Acceptable Photographs and video recording is excellent.- My disappointment:The 3D software S-Class is the owner of LG. No Windows Mobile 6.1., Accepts only Java applications. It is impossible to install Windows Mobile-compatible applications, such as Garmin Mobile XT (Which makes the GPS is useless and unusable) only works with Google Maps (which requires a permanent connection to an operator and the flow is very slow).The battery life is low. =(
i had this phone for over a 3 months and is very slick and nice; to be honest this is a pure cheap imitation of the iphone, is very slow, you have to reset it at least 3 times a day, poor battery life, the browser is the worst web browser i ever seen!!!!i recently have now the nokia 5800 and is far way better in every aspect and is cheaper.dont waste your money.
i bough this phone and canceled verizon to go with boost because of  the amazing $50.00 everything plan + my sister other family members have walkie talkie so i wanted to walkie talkie with them overal  the phones are expensive and so cute but i really like this phone i meam its a phone it does not have camera but gets the internet ass any  other phone as well ass the text walkie talkie is great a lil hard to get used to it but once u get  the hang of it ull love it the best thing would probably be the speakerphone it is very loud and clear and u could set the phone and do laundry and the person on the other end of the line will have no problems hearing you! it is great phone overall  very basic so if u are expecting nice features like other phones well this is not for you it does not have a camera but u could receive pic's does not have many other features either but it does what it sais it does unlimited talk unlimited text unlimited data  and unlimited walkie talkie that's what it adverstises and thats what it does. i like the simple phone could be better but im happy
The Blackberry 8830 World Edition smart phone is a great work phone allowing one to keep track of business e-mail on the go.
I bought this as a replacement for my LG KU990R "Viewty." It had a 5 megapixel camera, but the Samsung M8800 "Pixon" has an 8-megapixel camera. The Pixon is the Innov8's sister phone. The Innov8 is a Symbian-type sliding phone, but the Pixon is a full touch screen model. The Pixon has the same 3.2-inch touch screen as the Samsung Behold, Eternity, and Omnia. The screen is responsive, big, and bright. There are just three hard keys, a call send/call log, end/on-off, and a back button in the middle. What makes Samsung's phones unique is their use of the TouchWhiz interface and on-screen application icons called widgets. Samsung's TouchWhiz interface is also found on the Behold, Eternity, Omnia, and F480 "Tocco." There are tons of cool features in here. The phone is built around the camera which is also a very good video camera that shoots 720i HD video. The multimedia player is easy to use and plays MP3's MPEG's, AVI's, WMA's, WMV, WAV, MPEG-4, and DivX files. There are also video and photo-editing programs. The camera takes awesome pictures for a cell phone. Colors are vibrant and realistic, and the LED flash works well up close, but forget about it working in a dark room if your subject is over 3 feet away.The phone itself is a GSM quad-band phone, so it will work all over the world. It has Edge and 3G 7.2 mb/s HSDPA, but 3G will not work in the USA. I use it on T-Mobile and it works just fine. You'll have to set it up for T-Zones though, and until you do, it will accept text messages, but won't accept multimedia messages and you cannot use T-Zones. Calls come in loud and clear. The speaker phone is great.People probably want to compare the Pixon to LG's 8-megapixel Renoir. In my opinion, the Pixon is a much better phone. LG tries hard to copy Samsung's TouchWhiz interface and widgets, and does pretty good, but it's not the same. The LG's screen is smaller (3.0 inches), and not as sensitive to touch inputs. The Pixon's camera is also better, but not by much. It's hard to notice the difference, but Samsung's camera does a better job with color reproduction, and the camera interface is much eaiser to use. Texting on the Pixon is also better thanks to a larger computer-like virtual QWERTY keyboard. Overall, both are good phones and cameras, but the Pixon wins the phone war with user-friendliness, functions, and a better camera.The bad: Despite a 1000mAh battery, this phone uses a lot of juice. It is kind of discomforting seeing the battery indicator going from 5 bars to 3 in just 1 day. Fully charged and occasionally used, the battery will be drained in 2-3 days. My LG Viewty and Motorola E6's batteries lasted much longer, but then again because this phone has a serious camera, in all fairness the battery life is not too bad. Just keep it charged.Samsung has made a great phone that's also a good camera. As hard as it is to get everything right, Samsung does a pretty good job.
I decided to try this out because I heard about it, not really impressed and my C905 is more worth my time. it doesn't work well and the quality is just not good, I'm going to return it for the N86.get the Nokia or the C905
I just upgraded to an iPhone. I had the tilt device for two years, it was a good phone. I enjoyed being on the 3G network. I also used it to tether as a modem for my laptop, no issues there, great for visiting clients at Starbucks and not having to pay for internet. Really nice not having to fumble around with setup on that tethering. I used to watch youtube via player application, before youtube finally made their own plugin. I would check out Fifth Gear, top gear, etc episodes during my lunch hour, it was good fun, espcially with the tilt screen while I was eating. After two years the battery needed replacing, I never did, but it sure needed a new one. The charge was only lasting a couple hours. I dropped it twice, and had the screen replaced once for $100. The time the screen needed replacing it was thrown from the second story of my apartment, the phone is pretty durable. Most phones would have smashed to pieces.What can it do that an iPhone can't you ask?* Tether as a modem* Internet Access with AT&T; via 3G for $20/month NOT $30 like on the iphone* Full keyboard* SMS messaging, (add pictures to text msgs)* Run office applications (word, powerpoint, etc)* Screen tilt* Create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking (sweet)* No I-Tunes or Qucktime malwareWhat does an iPhone do better?* Larger screen* Better battery life* Backlight auto adjusts brightness, saves battery* Shuts off faster, no buttons on front that accidentally turn it on* Looks better (impress your friends, the tilt looked like a brick)* Better support if/wehn it breaks, at least implied* More applications* Larger storage up to 32gb with 3GS* Ipod / music work much better, easier to use etc* Voicemail stores on the device* GPS device with compass can tell you which way to turn not just your location* Thinner, lighterAll in all I am planning on keeping the iPhone after having the tilt for 2 years. I still love the tilt though... nothing wrong with that phone at all.
As the title suggests, I consider this Smartphone to be a good work horse.A previous poster listed a few features on this device, I've expanded some of the detail on that and added some other info.* Tether as a modem - very helpful and less expensive than buying a standalone aircard.* Full keyboard - there is a soft keyboard you can type on without having to slide out the keyboard everytime you need to type something.* Can open, edit, save Microsoft office files (word, powerpoint, etc) (on an iPhone you can only view not edit).* Screen tilts - helpful to reduce glare* Create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking - without additional costHelpful tips for Windows MobilePeriodically Windows Mobile devices experience registry corruption.  The best resolution is to perform a hard reset on the device clearing out the memory and essentially freshly building the device.  By doing these periodic resets (in my experience 2 times a year is necessary), the device remains responsive and less buggy.There is a lot of functionality built into the Tilt that is handy.  It is one of the better Windows devices for navigation.  Using a bluetooth GPS bug the device can do quite well guiding without the necessity of having to buy a singletasking handheld navigation system.
This is a really good device. I have had many cellphones and PDA's and this is one of the best ones I have ever had. It is durable, has good battery life and an easy to use qwerty keyboard. The tilting action makes it easy to see what you are typing with no glare. The video resolution is good and SD card makes it as expandable as you want. You can switch out cards if you start running out of room or want to keep some files private. I highly recommend this device. I have used it in a busy medical practice loaded with references and resources; and with the Google mobile apps bar, I am on the internet in a flash and can access the web or my Google apps. Luckily, it is pretty much drop proof.
Why buy these $250+ phones and get stuck with a 2-yr contract when the phone doesn't last even a year?It's almost like BAIT & SWITCH by AT&T.; They stop "carrying" the particular expensive phone in less than a year so when the phone dies in a few months AT&T; won't have to exchange it with a new one for you... but they got your contract for 2 years... with a cheaper phone in exchange. Before wasting your money on a new expensive AT&T; smartphone, ask yourself if you're ok with having to warranty exchange your new phone with a USED refurbished one in less than a year.
This phone stinks - I doubt I will buy another HTC product!!!  It has been nothing but problems since I purchased it at a much higher price.  I can't wait to replace it!
I have had the phone for over 24 hours so far. Great phone. Good sound, good voice, fast O.S. Good signal reception all around, though in N. NJ that is not really a problem.I charged it initially at home with the included AC charger, and at the office hooked it up with the included USB cable and saw the phone charging while I was playing with it and synching up my calendar.I swapped my SIM card from the old phone, (HTC Hermes/ATT 8525), to this one and it worked right away. ATT mediaNet needed no configuration even though I had only added data/texting to my account from online only minutes before. WiFi works well in my home. This is my first time using ATT MediaNet so I can't really comment, but it helped me compare prices on a microwave oven from inside a store. Amazon got an order for a microwave once I got home and I saved over $50. It is nice not hunting for a WiFi signal as I used to do. Glad I finally succumbed to paying for ATT's service. I am not comfortable with Nokias included browser yet, but it seems to work well. I may try Opera.I can work with office documents and synch up with my outlook calender faster than I could with my old HTC/ATT Win 6.1 smart phone. Nokia PC Suit is leagues ahead of MS Active Synch, and puts Motorola's software to the shame it deserves.Folks that play with it are amazed at how fast the phone responds when selecting applications. Instant response instead of a second or so wait as many Windows based phones have.The one issue I have had is I can not get the included headset to work properly as a headset. I suspect it is intended as just a music headset, but no matter what I do I can not get loud enough sound out of it, and the manual has no mention of it other than showing where to plug it in. When you attach the headset the phone asks what you want to use it as. Whether I select headset or headphones it does not seem to work well. The phone will warn you to use the phone mic. I recommend getting a better headset/headphones when you buy the phone, I am doing that right after I post this. Maybe with more use I can sort it out. I only tested it by calling my office voice mail, since I did not want to annoy friends and family by making them guinea pigs.This brings up the 3.5 mm jack the phone has. I am often on support calls. Sometimes for hours at a time. (Yes, I am an I.T. peon). I did not consider this when thinking about the phone, but there are NO standard headsets that use 3.5 jacks that I can find, they almost all use 2.5. The headsets that do use 3.5 are either iPhone style earbuds, which I find very uncomfortable, or ones intended for PC gaming, which use TWO plugs and are not usable on a phone. Not an over-the-ear one in the bunch. So I am stuck using bluetooth, which loses power fast and can't last long anough, or getting a clunky adapter so I can use a standard 2.5 mm headset, or trying an iphone earbud style headset that has the microphone in the wire, not on a boom, which has poor voice quality compared to a boom and hurts my ears after a few minutes. Slightly disappointing.I do like having the hidden qwerty keyboard, as I did with my prior phone, so that it is there when needed for documents, email, texting etc, but out of the way otherwise. Someday I may try a tablet-style phone, like the E71 or a blackberry, but this works well for me.One big reason I got this phone is the number pad for dialing. While touch screens are nice, having them as the only interface to the phone is a mistake.If you need to dial a number fast, such as 911, it can be very tough to do. Number pads are better, and if the primary use of the phone is as, well, a PHONE, it makes sense. It fits easily into my shirt pocket. I do not need to hang it on my belt and feel like Batman as I would with a tablet PDA.But touch screens are useful. I think this phone would benefit from one for navigating the menus, it would probably be faster than using the various keys. The screen could be larger, there would be room to extend it if Nokia moved the logo from the top of the phone.There is a lot left to play with on this, like the multiple profiles, etc. So there is still more to learn on this.But all-in-all, even with the headset issue, this is the best phone I have had yet, whether smart-phone or not. If this is an indication of where Nokia is going, they are going in the right direction.
With the incarnation of the E75, Nokia successfully continues the E series ideology of enterprise-oriented phones while supporting a balance of personal life and entertainment.The E75 is the first QWERTY slider into the E series, yet maintains a pleasant thinness.  It is not as thin as the E71, but Nokia is fitting quite a bit of hardware into this thin slider body.  Nevertheless, the E75 is solidly built and maintains a great feel while being held open or closed.The QWERTY keyboard featured on the E75 is huge.  Coming from a narrower brick QWERTY, the jump to such a wider keyboard is impressive and helps make typing out messages on a phone less of a chore.  Those who may have bigger fingers may appreciate the larger keys as featured on the E75.  Unlike the E71 the E75 contains a dedicated Ctrl key, the E71's key only being a secondary function.  This dedicated key makes tasks like copying and pasting even easier.Response time from this phone is pleasing - loading applications is fairly quick, and any seldom noticeable lag is minimal.  Multitasking is rather simple, and having a couple applications simultaneously open does not significantly impact the phone's performance.Symbian S60 3rd with Feature Pack 2 is the operating system powering the E75.  Search contacts directly from the home screen is a valued feature - as the name of a contact is typed (even from the keypad), results are quickly displayed above providing shortcuts to call or message the contact.  Mail setup is a breeze and supports Exchange, and using the mail application is very easy and intuitive.  The home screen is highly customizable, and the switching between work and personal modes makes the interface even more flexible.Other benefits of the E75 are its wide range of connectivity - HSDPA, 802.11b/g, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.  Additionally, the phone's video record mode supports a VGA resolution at 30fps.  The phone also comes included with a 4GB microSD card and the slot is external.  Surprising was the quality of the included earbuds/mic - they aren't the best quality on the market, but for included earbuds they are actually nice.  A full 3.5mm audio jack is also onboard, opposed to 2.5mm.  Additionally, the E75 can charge over USB, though not as fast as the provided adapter.While the keyboard of the E75 brings advantages there are some drawbacks, though these are relatively minor.  Because the keyboard is so wide, it can take a few uses to get accommodated to the width - anyone used to a brick QWERTY will need to get accustomed to reaching further with their thumbs.  Unfortunately, there is no double quote character on the keyboard, not even as a second function.  Instead, the double quote character must be accessed through the Character key.  The absence of a left Ctrl key makes moving the cursor over by word practically impossible - both the ctrl key and directional pad are on the right side.  The keyboard could also have benefitted by finger finders to help assist with positioning, though this isn't a serious problem.The keys on the keypad seem a bit small, and this could hinder some accuracy when working with the phone at a quick pace.  However, to accommodate the E75's screen and physical size the keys had to be sized as they are.  While it would have been nice to have a larger screen, it really wouldn't be possible to accommodate one with the face keypad.  The N97 is Nokia's full-face screen model (lacking the dedicated keypad), and as such supports touch.  The glossy face on the E75 means it is a fingerprint magnet - both keypad and screen.  Be prepared to frequently wipe off prints.There are some mediocre aspects to the E75.  The battery is only 1000mAh, which will allow for about a full day of fairly heavy use.  However, for light to medium use the battery should last a few days before needing a charge.  Thankfully, Nokia included the charge over USB option in this phone.  Additionally, the camera quality of the E75 is nothing special.  And while the Nokia browser has been improved upon and supports Flash, it could use some more improvements in navigation and viewing.The perceived drawbacks to the E75 are essentially nitpicks however.  This phone has a number of positive aspects that make it very solid and a pleasure to use.  Nokia's E75 is an adequate powerhouse, fully capable of accommodating the aspects of an E series mobile lifestyle.
All I can say is WOW!! I am totally impressed with it and believed that Nokia has come up with a winning product. I just owned this baby for less than a week but has already become addicted to it. Prior to buying e75, I have done research on various high-end phones on iphone, blackberrry, sony and even various other Nokia E-series and N-series phones and have also read almost all existing E75 cell-phone reviews on the web. Though there are mixed reviews on it, I decided to take the plunge and purchased it. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. It is definitely one of my best investments for the year, can't say the same for my other investments I have made :)===PROS1)Great great looks. stunning design. It is a really beautiful phone. I really liked a candy shaped smartphone that looks like a regular cellphone. Most of the powerful highend smartphone are much wider and have a bulky look. e75 has great dimensions and could easily fit inside a jeans pocket. great! The slide-out full-sized qwerty keypad is simply addictive! it is very easy to use, good-sized keys, slider makes a solid "thud" when opening and closing. amazing style and quality. love it!2)Amazing usability. In the first day, I already set up my email accounts(in a few simple clicks), browse the web, listening to both FM and internet radio, subscribe to podcasts, view office documents, download some latest apps from Nokia ovi store and use GPS as a tour guide. it is just so intuitive that I doubt you will need the guidebook and web reviews to guide you through using *any* features.3)Great build quality. It has a nice weight on it and feels like you are definitely holding something "substantial". I read about various people getting leaky keypad and such. No such issue with mine. As I said before, the sliding keypad feels very solid and snapping back and forth feels very secure with no loose ends. The silver-black and chrome combination makes e75 looks very upscale and all the keys are well-placed and very responsive. Some people are complaining about screen-size too small, qwerty layout hard to adjust etc. I find the screen size very sufficient to read email, browse documents and web. It is extremely sharp and is readable under bright sunlight and qwerty keypad works great. Can type out a long email in no time. Besides it also have a set of regular keys in front so you could do one-hand messaging as well. perfect!4)Good offering of applications. Web and office documents browsing and editing, great media player, easy to use GPS system makes it a fun-filled power business smartphone. A word about audio quality. The loudspeaker may not be as loud as someone likes but it is no worse than the samsung and motorola that I used to own. Call quality is superb. Reception is very good.===CONS1)Well, someone can quip about screen being too small, camera not being 5MP, screen not being the sharpest around, symbian too outdated, audio quality subpar, no touchscreen etc etc. but the ONLY complain that I think is valid and a very serious concern is the extensibility which may be what is stopping iphone users from crossing over. blame it on the App Store. Iphone is amazing not only because of its physical form and touch screen intuitiveness but on its amazing array of 3rd party applications. Sad to say, Nokia much touted ovi-store where we could purchase applications fall short, WAY short. I have browsed around for further-addon apps, very less offering and many are not free. well, even if they are free, i am not so sure i wanted them on. Don't even get me started on their Ngame platform. The games offering is simply pathetic. This lack of extensibility maybe crippling Nokia in the future where customers are very savvy and demanding and they want cellphones that have a long lifecycle and full of applications of anything imaginable not just what is offered by the manufacturer.2)A quick word about battery life. It really is pretty lousy, just as stated by various e75 review articles. You do need to charge it daily.3)I hate to state the obvious but the price tag is pretty hefty considering it didn't really offer any earth-shattering features that are not currently on the market or any out-of-the-world design.All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase. As long as you are aware of the limiting factors, e75 is an extremely well-rounded smartphone with great style and substance. Nokia E75 is everything that a business person would want and need plus much more.** I recently run into a refresh bug where my screen keeps on refreshing itself indefinitely. You may trigger this bug when your phone is running out of battery, and while recharging, you press on your email icon. I think the auto-syncing of email go crazy when dealing with this particular usecase. You don't have to send the phone back to manufacturer or even reset your phone, there is a nifty solution where you just have to press Control Panel->Settings->General->Personalization->HomeScreenMode->ModeSettings->Email Notifications->Disable then restart your phone. Your beloved phone will be functioning again. Hope that helps!
I just purchased an unlocked Nokia E75 a few days ago. Since then I have been quite happy with the phone. While this is not quite an iPhone, the E75 shines in its own right with its lengthy laundry list of features.In fact, one software feature, Ovi files, makes this phone a top notch productivity performer by allowing you to download virtually any supported file from your computer at home to your Nokia E75 cell phone. MS Office files like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint can be downloaded with ease as long as your home computer is running the required software and connected to the internet. Once downloaded, these files can then be viewed AND EDITED right from your phone using Nokia's onboard office program. Edited documents can then be sent via e-mail to another individual. This feature alone makes this phone incredibly worthwhile for any user on the go who may need to access a file at a moments notice. Best of all, this software is completely FREE. There is no additional cost aside from the standard data charges assessed by your wireless carrier. There are no monthly fees to worry about or data restrictions on the number of files you can download. You are simply limited by the capacity of your memory card.As for the hardware, the full keyboard is probably the biggest selling point. Unlike other phones, the Nokia E75 keyboard is large and spacious, making it easy to type for both the smallest and largest of hands. The metal bar dividing the keyboard into two halves is an useful visual guide to remember where the characters are. Otherwise, the keyboard might look like a solid black (or red) block.The camera takes decent photos for e-mailing, web posting, etc. However, my favorite feature is the camera's ability to geo-tag photos, just like the iPhone. Any picture you take while out and about can be tagged with your exact GPS location at the moment the photo is taken. For those using Apple's iPhoto, when the pictures are uploaded they can be displayed on a map with a red pin indicating the location where the photos was taken.Finally, a short note about Nokia's Ovi Store - an online store where users can download applications. Compared to Apple's application store, Nokia's foray into the world of digital downloads is pretty pathetic. But quite frankly, given the phone's other features, many of which I clearly did not mention in this review, make up for the fact that you do not have access to thousands and thousands of applications, many of which are completely frivolous anyways. However, the store is adding new applications all the time so there may come a day when Nokia's Ovi Store may rival Apple's application store but that day seems pretty far off at this point.All in all this phone is fantastic. I am an Mac user and the Nokia E75 does a fairly good job at playing nice. There were a couple bugs here and there, but nothing severe.I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for an iPhone alternative with more productivity features.
Got this phone a few weeks ago...so here are my thoughts.Pros:Good call reception (AT&T;,NY region).Very solid build quality.Like the qwerty keyboard,great for text and email.Email set up a breeze.Fast user interface. No lag when opening apps.Nice display.Metal battery cover. Nice touch Nokia.Nokia included a suede phone case.Also included 4Gb memory card with Nokia PC Suite installer on it.So far phone works perfect. No "connection errors" like my N95.Cons: Ring tones could be louder but it not terrible.Camera not as good as the N95.Just a few interesting features on this phone.Has a bar code reader. Very cool. Funny thing is there isn't any mention of it in the owners manual.The scroll key blinks slowly when you get missed calls and messages. Nokia calls it a "breathing light".Overall very nice phone. If you want something different you can't go wrong with this phone.
The Nokia E75 is my latest Nokia Eseries phone acquisition. Before the E75, I owned and used the E71 and the E51. Emailing with the E75, I must agree, is nice,easy and definetely the large keybord is a plus besides the great Email display . The big  problem I encountered  with the E75 is in the only Fring app version(22) it  accepts to work with. This version is an awfull one compared to the Fring  version 20 which  the E71 and  E51 do accept.  Even though E51 has a numeric keyboard only ,a small screen and a poor Email display, is much  lighter  than the other ones and is a better performer for 3G Voip.The E71, on the other hand , is great for Emailing because of a larger Kwerty keyboard and great Email display but dialing out numbers is very difficult due to the very small number keys it has.For these reasons I decided to stick with the E51, the least expensive one!
I have had this phone now for just over 3 weeks.It works well on everything.Working in Afghanistan at the moment and it took the local sim card no problem.Even updated the local time no problem.As you can imagine no 3G over here so dont know if that is working.Everything else is great, wireless and GPS are superb.The querty keypad is a must for me now.I would reccommend this phone to everyone.Will up date when im in the UK in 2 weeks time and see if the 3G is working.
I'm using this phone on T-mobile, paying $5 for the t-zones service (WAP) since it will not work with 3G on T-mobile.Pros.  Size= for being a full keyboard slider it is very compact  Battery Life= I can usually go 2-3 days between charges with a few voice calls, tons of texts, and browsing the web.  Camera= other than the autofocus failing in darker environments the pictures are clear and the flash is decent.  Screen= high resolution screen is bright and clear indoors and still readable outdoorsCons.  keyboard= I purchased this phone mainly for texting and while i've gotten used to it now the letters are way too close together and completely flat. very hard to text without watching your fingers  Menu Layout= If you're not used to Nokia phones, look for something else. changing simple settings means going through what feels like endless menus and sub menus looking for the correct screen.  texting= this phone displays text messages in a list form, i would have preferred the way Palm and the iPhone display messages which keeps track of conversations much more easilyConclusion= I wish i would have waited for an unlocked Palm Pre but for now this is a decent phone with a few bugs i can live with.
this phone i got is really cool...it has 2 ways for texting, / slide and the front panel; and the capability of it..makes it a good phone to have..camera and video is clear and have more storage/ yet its unlocked which u can use it around the globe..wherever u are...great phone..recommended...
Love everything about this phone. Included push email ([...]) with device purchase is a definite winner here. Battery life could be a bit longer, but definitely more than sufficient (1.75 days with heavy usage). Amazing keyboard. Love Nokia products.
I purchased this phone to replace a Windows Mobile based HTC that also had a full QWERTY keyboard. The HTC was a great phone but I had issues with it deleting contacts when it was sync'd which was completely unacceptable to me.I have owned several Nokia phones previously and the Symbian OS is hard to beat with its features. I'll agree with other reviews that state that it takes a bit of 'seek and destroy' to find various options and settings on this phone. On the other hand, it has a plethora of customization options.The phone is constructed very well and looks great to boot. Its ultra thin construction along with the extra length the front keypad add has made it somewhat difficult the find a quality case for this phone. The case included only provides bare minimum protection and it is not easy to remove the phone from it.The keyboard is relatively easy to use but takes some getting use to since it is completely flat. The buttons do provide good positive click feedback. I do wish the keyboard had a dedicated button to send text messages. As it stands now, you have to use multiple key clicks to send each text message.Text messages are not displayed in a linear, conversational format. Instead, they are divided into folders for Inbox, Sent, Drafts, etc. It's not an issue for me but those coming from other smart phones may be bothered by this.The camera, as with almost all phones, is pretty lackluster. It will do in a pinch but it won't turn you into Ansel Adams by any means. It does have a built in flash which helps in dark situations.The Nokia PC Suite and included data cable make this phone a breeze to sync and tether.Battery life is excellent with Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off and entirely acceptable with either or both turned on.Sound quality is excellent at both ends of the conversation and the built in voice dialing feature works exceptionally well.
I received my new nokia sometime after the first of June '09. I was pleasantly surprised at the "perfect size" it was.  It worked right out of the box and all the features that I tried I was able to use with just common sense and on board instructions.  I have tried most of the features (e-mail, internet, maps, videos, etc.) and have not had a problem with anything.  The battery lasts me 3 days without recharging.  I owned a touch screen phone before this, and it great getting back to keys.  Just a soft touch and you know exactly what to expect as the keys are unambiguous.  This one is definitely a "keeper"!
Phone has a lot of promise (turn-by-turn GPS works pretty well, nice form factor, solid build quality...), but the OS is not as polished as it should be for a $400+ smartphone. Two examples that were quite frustrating to resolve:1 Some of the VOIP functionality has been stripped away. It is necessary to install additional software to restore the same functionality that was present on the E65: [...]2 There are issues with the way access points are managed which can make email over VPN a pain in the rear if you don't get the configuration right on your first pass:[...]I'm sending mine back to Amazon. The overall user experience with my E65 is /much/ better.  I'll stick with the E65 until Nokia irons out some of the kinks with the E75.
I love this phone i live in the caribbean to be exact Aruba and it works great here! It works great I love it had some problem at first with the memory chip but it works excellent now! Love it!
Nokia-mania, I wanted a phone Blackberry-like, but from Nokia. A phone with Internet capability. A phone with dictionaries. A phone to make my office with (I was accustommed with the Nokia communicators with MS Office and so on). A phone with wide keyboard. A compact phone you can easily handle. A phone with GPS. And a phone which simply phones and eventually take pictures. Nokia E75 is all that. I have replaced the micro SD card by a microSDHC card (8GB): so I can even use my phone as a flash disk... My only question: why not a 5 megapixels camera? E75 is the phone for your various situations...
The idea of this phone is pretty good, nice functionality and quality. The battery dies after 15 hours with messenger and/or email enabled. Nokia's email client is nice but pretty limited. I had to purchase an external solution to get the phone working properly with my email accounts. Also the phone is getting hot while working with internet connection related applications. I would give it 3 stars since the battery life is really painful issue.Pros: design, functionalityCons: poor battery life
First: The bad.I purchased this phone because my old phone, (a Sony Ericsson), broke. One week after I received the phone the internal screen broke/cracked on its own accord. I take amazing care of my phone and treat it with much TLC. I was very disappointed because Nokia phones are supposed to be the most durable and reliable. I talked to Amazon.com and they replaced it for free because it was in the first 30 days. Kudos to their customer service! Anyway, I received the replacement phone and so far the screen has not cracked. However, the 4GB MicroSD card keeps messing up. Sometimes when I slide the phone open to use the QWERTY keyboard it thinks that I've removed the memory card. It must be the jolt from the sliding action that is causing it to do this. I have to remove the MicroSD card and put it back in for it to read it. It is very annoying.The Good:As for he memory card problem; I formatted the card and since then it has only malfunctioned once. The OS for this phone is incredible. It's very intuitive and efficient. The phone itself is beautiful in its appearance. The QWERTY is the most comfortable to use phone-keyboard I have ever used. It is an incredible phone and even despite the bugs it has still been worth the money. Nokia really is the best. It may not be as beginner-friendly as, say, the iPhone but compared to the E75, most other phones (e.g. iPhone & Blackberry) seem so limited.I would recommend the E75 to anyone who wants a phone that can do almost everything that a $800 phone can, but doesn't want to spend a fortune.
I bought a E75 last Sat on Nokia Sale for $265 to replace my E51 that I really like. After 3 hours of use I decided to keep my E51 and sell this E75. Here is why.1. Cheaper plastic is used compare to E51. (THis E75 is made in China while E51 is made in Finland)2. Too heavy for my taste.3. Screen should be bigger.4 Voice quality is not as good as E51.5. The micro usb port feels fragile.The only thing I like about this phone is the Keyboard design ( Not the material they use to made the keyboard). For $265 this is one decent phone..but not @ $399!!I guess I will wait for E52/E55..
all the features are like a regular nokia phone and i have only ever used nokia phones so i have had no issues getting used to it.my only complaint is that the numerical keypad is a bit cramped. otherwise everything works perfectly.
Good Feature set, nice looking, keyboard works pretty well but it's not as nice as my Curve. I started up the device and had no problems, configured my e-mail started going through the phone's features and was very impressed.Unfortunately the devil is in the details with these devices, when I set up my mail for exchange it created two mailboxes, One called "Mail for Exchange" and one the name I chose in the wizard to identify it. I thought that was a bit odd so I decided to re-do it and removed both of the mailboxes and reset it up in the wizard, that was the last time mail for exchange ever worked. It retained old mailbox information that was uneditable, you hit change and absolutely nothing happened, it even survived a firmware reset via Nokia tech support. The mail log advised there was a ~System Failure and Nokia tech support advised me to return it.So great device mostly but major features not working due to what may be a software glitch on Day 3? Not so much, if I did that on day two doing pretty standard stuff I am afraid what may have stopped working on day 20. If a phone is going to cost $450 is has to be on point in every way.
I have purchased 2 of these phones hopeing that one of them would work. I even went and got a new AT&T; SIM card because I thought it must be the SIM card not the Nokia phone. Nope, this phone just sucks! No wonder Nokia is losing market share to Apple and Blackberry. I have used Nokia phones for the last 10 years and loved every one. This one is awful. Cheap plastic construction on the top keys that you can see the screen when you press the 3 button. It sounded like the person calling was in a well and a lot of static when I would talk. That was the first phone. The second one would not complete outgoing calls and anyone that called me it went directly to voicemail. I thought it may be the SIM card so I got a new one. Same problems with the new SIM card installed.I will say that the qwerty keypad was great though. I loved it. The sliding mechanism was fine also. Nokia needs to care about PHONE quality as much as they did on this phone about texting capability. My fingers are too big for the E71 so I am sticking to my 6822 til I find a suitable phone. Nokia has really let me down on this one.
Phone, so far, works very well in the United Emirates, Dubai. Definitely would recommend this phone.
I am a long time nokia fan - using Nokia for last 14 years. My last phone was Nokia E51 - a robust and compact smart phone. Then I decided to upgrade to E75. It was a bad decision. Here are my views on E75Bad -1. Slider is wobbly - I thought the issue was on my first handset - got a replacement from Amazon - still same issue. Looks like it is an issue with model itself.2. UI not crisp - Music player on home screen has the title overlapping with time3. Phone switches off randomly - while using Nokia maps, phone switches off. Similarly during browsing and receiving calls and listening to music......4. Numeric keypad not user friendly - single row keys are not the easiest to use. I ended up frequently pressing the wrong buttons (and I am used to Nokia E51 keyboard for full messaging).5. Navigation between apps is not clean - difficult to close an app through d-pad keys. I had to frequently use menu->exit option to close the applications - which was very inconvenient.Good - Nothing really stands out when compared to other E series phones.I would recommend people not buying the phone unless they check the instrument themselves physically.
I would like to warn T-Mobile subscribers to stay away from this phone.I bought it and used it for 3-4 weeks before finally returning it.  I should explain the 3-4 weeks delay by underscoring I loved everything about this phone (granted, I didn't try/need all the features, so some of the complaints may be legitimate), but as a phone it (reception) simply sucked.  I had been using previously, and reverted to a Nokia E51, excellent phone, and reception, even on T-Mobile (my E51 is an unlocked Singaporean model, so the bands don't necessarily match T-Mobile's).I will miss the E75's keyboard mostly, but the device is very feature rich, as everyone details herein.  If only it also functioned as well as the E51 as a phone... on the T-Mobile network.
I am a big fan of Nokia and the Symbian Operating System.  I currently use a Nokia E71x, which is a great phone, but had used a predecessor to the E65 in the past (Communicator) and really liked the various sliding / flipp open keyboards.  Honestly, this phone is a perfect size, seems sturdily built and really I wanted to love it (I love the looks).  However, where it totally fell apart was trying to set up Mail for Exchange to synchronize my e-mail.  On every other phone that i have set up M4E on, the process has taken literally seconds...on this phone I have spent the last week looking at support forums, trying various configurations, hard resetting the phone, all to no avail.  Finally I am giving up and sending this thing back to Amazon...again, the phone looks and feels fantastic, and if you are only going to use it for POP mail or SMS/MMS, I would recommend it.  However, with the problems I had trying to get it to access my M4E account, I would be wary.
I just bought this device. standby time is too short, I have to charge it everyday. when use for internet browsing, it's better to use touch screen device. And the browser doesn't support other languages except English. I am still using this and I believe will find more inconvenience.
I returned this item for the following reasons:Political-I am completely disgusted with Nokia's involvement in supporting the Islamic regime of Iran in further oppressing its people. By cutting off its digital airwaves Nokia has colluded to perpetuate isolation of the Iranian freedom movement.Phone Features-1- After using a Palm for many years, I could not get over the inferior visual quality of the screens and the icons.2- The phone keeps locking and I had no way to asking it not to lock the home page.3- the text messaging was chronological but it did not keep a conversation string on the same page.Overall-As someone who uses Mac and Palm, I was surprised that non-user-friendly phones like this still exist.If you want to use it for business it had features that were helpful and if you don't care about the political bend of who you support, this phone might be a possibility. For me I feel literally and figuratively liberated after I returned this phone.
I picked this phone up for my wife, replacing her aging E51.  Overall, it's an improvement over the E51, despite it not being intended as a replacement for it.She loved the form factor of the E51, and is willing to tolerate the added thickness of the E75 in exchange for the slide out qwerty.  She wanted to do email and facebook on the phone, primarily, so the qwerty was definitely on the menu as far as she was concerned.Build quality isn't as good as my E71, though it's pretty good.  when working on the qwerty, it feels a bit cheap in my hands, though I suspect that's a common problem with phones of this genre.  Application-wise, everything worked, except for repeated problems she had with the built-in Mail for Exchange support (Google Sync for Mail, Contacts & Calendar).  This was positively awful.  So unreliable, that we wound up purchasing a license for RoadSync, which has proven to be quite acceptable for her.  This fact demonstrates that it wasn't a service-related problem, rather a software one.Battery life is decent, though she's not a super-heavy data user.  I'm pleased with S60 3.0 FP2's use of AP groups, allowing you to stack the home wifi above carrier gprs/hspa, which is a huge improvement over FP1 devices.  Nice touch - it can charge over the micro-usb connector, a welcome change for Nokia devices.
Simply the best, same quality as E71 but with full-size keypad, free 3 month Nokia turn-by-turn voice guidance is also very nice.Bought 5800 XM too for my daught to use in her coming college life.
i brought this phone and enjoyed it overseas. When I came back would not work on 3G network although was told it would. They sale a similiar model called LG KP500 cookie that they say will work. Same phone same info on the phone. AT@T says you have to use on old network. Check with carrier and recheck.
these phones are not unlocked!!  i got two and both of them rejected the sim cards.
Delivered in the spected time but it came with the gsm card slot broken, so the telephone says "insert card" all the time while the gsm card was inserted.Had to send it to repair.So its has to be "refurbished" not new as advertised or RIM has bad quality inspection...!?
very disspointed in this product! the camera quality is poor, the view is blurred, the call button has to be pressed so many times before you can redial a number. the black berry cd appears to be a fake as it wont install!! i am absolutely dissapointed.
I'm a long-time blackberry user and genearlly like the OS.  A salesperson at the ATT store talked me into to buying this phone - even though the trackball looked like it would cause problems.  And it has - I've already replaced it once and the new one only worked for a few months.  I can still use the phone but navigating menus are less than optimal.  Additionally, the SIM card holder is loose so I often get "SIM card Errors".  From my experience, this is the worst phone that I've owned - below even Motorola...
I got my Blackberry Pearl about a week ago...and I LOVE it.  How cool is it that I can check my AOL email right on my phone??  The same phone that I can take awesome pictures with, send them by email or Picture mail to friends and family, go to websites, text message, play games, watch tv...this phone has endless things to do.  It's just like having a little palm sized computer!!  I find myself spending hours playing with it...I used to see people doing that with their phones and wonder what the heck??? Now I know!!And don't be scared!!  I thought it would be so hard to learn things...but they actually have a website, blackberry.com, that has little tutorials and all kinds of helpful tidbits that made sense, and were easy for me to pick up on.  I'm so thrilled I chose this phone...I've been looking for months, and was just scared to get a phone I thought would be too complicated for me.  I'm so glad a friend of mine talked me into this.  I got a red pearl, which thrills me even more, lol.  This is a wonderful phone, and pretty easy to to do ANYTHING you want on.Get you one, you'll love it!!
I ordered a BRAND NEW Blackberry Pearl 8100 on July 31, through amazon.comIt looked new and worked well only the first day.Then started having problems: the battery lid is hard to open. The sound volume is weak and the volume key is blocked. The Blackberry msn doesn't work. The software can't be updated. "The PIN has problems". Don't have blackberry internet service and my cell phone company Digitel informed me the cell is not new but refurbished.I demand my money back! And I'll send you the cell back.I am expecting for solution to my problem.
Unfortunately I was not lucky. The product was bought to be used in Venezuela but same came with problems with the dash board, when i took it to be repaired they told me that this product was refurnished. I wrote to amazon with this observations and they were really kind in reply to me and they assure that the do not sell refurnished products.Nevertheless after having it repaired same seems to be working fairly well. I just can't send voice notes.
The sale of this phone is a scam, although it comes with the features offered in the sale, the phone comes with the Black Berry PIN blocked. This means that can not be activated Blackberry functions, such as msn, receiving mail, including any operator. The only thing that works is to to make and receive calls, send and receive sms and other functions of the phone, except for which is bought, the PIN.Because the phone, do not have any submissions to the light, it is possible that they come have been used to make the PIN and IMEI to be placed in any other Black Berry, and this completely unused leave.Therefore it is recommended not to buy this phone and take special care with the products of this shop, as were two DEFECTIVE products that came from it and the answer to the security and the return of the money was unsuccessful and unsatisfactory until point that both have failed to be specified.
We were very happy with this product. we bought the product for our 16 year old daughter and she is very happy with it. The phone came as pictured in perfect condition and with everything it was supposed to come with. It arrived in a timely manner. Would purchase from this supplier again.
I have been this phone for a couple of weeks. Seems too be working fine and this is the excellent choice for any business user. I get all my emails promptly, easy to manage calender and contacts.This is a pretty decent phone.
As promised. REALLY NEW Blackberry Pearl, fully unlocked. Is better to buy directly from Amazon's store.
I went through approximate 4-5 models not the one working properly or after 3-4 days will just die on me, I going back to my IPhone no blackberry for ever again. Thank you.
Señores estos telefonos son una estafa, vienen con el PIN bloqueado lo cual indica que son usados o robados, estafadores y lo peor de todo es que no se hacen responsables con ellos... NO COMPREN ESOS TELEFONOS POR AQUI..
The item is not what is promised .. This was a old refurbished phone and not a new phone .. I would strongly recommend people to not buy this from amazon
Despues de pensar tanto acerca de comprar este telef por este medio, debido a las tantas malas opiniones al respecto, escuche a un amigo, y me dijo como hacer la compra, y resulto ser excelente, llego el telef en un tiempo estimado, y en excelente estado, mejor imposible. Todalmente nuevo, con todos sus empaques, y tambien vino desbloqueado, inserte el chip gsm y funciono, luego tuve q hacer la activacion y tambien funciono el PIN, estoy contento con esta seleccion. SE DEBE TENER PRECAUCION A QUIEN SE LE COMPRA.After much thinking about buying this CEL by this method, because of so many bad opinions, listen to a friend, and told me how to make the purchase, and turned out to be excellent, I get the Phone on an estimated time, and excellent condition, better impossible. Todal again, with all its packaging, and also came unlocked, insert gsm chip AND worked, then I do the activation q and also works the PIN, I am happy with this selection. Caution should be exercised Who would BUY.
Good:1. item came on time2. looks in great conditionBAD:had a couple issues1. The earpiece sent with the device has a 3.5mm connection while the pearl has a 2.5mm jack so i will have to buy a new earpiece or an adapter for the 3.5mm2. The enter key sometimes presses itself... for example typing a message in blackberry messenger and it just sends in the middle of typing.
The product has work fine so far, but is not new. And Amazon sell it, like was new.
Does not have a very good reception inside. The numbers are really small, but is is comfortable because of its size.
these people steal from customers. They sell refurbished, used cell phones when you paid for a NEW one.
This phone was stated to be a new one but it was actually refurbished. You can't get a signal often and when you do you can't hear anyone on the other end of the line. I'm highly disappointed in Amazon.I learned my lesson.
This cellphone is refurbished not new like they said and I can't use the blackberry internet service, honestly don't buy it. Cuidado: estos celulares no son nuevos son reconstruidos y el servicio blackberry no funcionana correctamente al ya estar registrados por otra persona.
I am very happy with my Blackberry Pearl, but was a little disapointed that it didn't come with an instalation CD. I was able to download the CD on line to enable my desktop management. Nonetheless I'm still very happy
BlackBerry Pearl 8100 Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM,GPRS, EDGE, 1 MP Camera, Camcorder, and Bluetooth--International Version with No Warranty (Black with Silver)Bueno primero que nada por nada del mundo deberian de cometer el gran error que cometi yo al de buenas a primera comprar sin leer los comentarios del vendedor ya que en ellos dicen que tal es....Ahora bien yo hice una compra de dos celulares los cuales me salieron malos los dos ya que el vendedor dice que son nuevo y resulta ser que ya que son equipos totalmente usados y reparados..... De por si uno de los equipo me llego con todos los contactos y mensajes del dueño anterior y el otro me llego totalmente dañado, el cual lo he llevado a varios servicios tecnicos en los cuales me dicen que el equipo no tiene reparo en lo absoluto ya que vino con la tarjeta logica totalmente puenteada y dañada inclusive hasta me dijeron que el equipo era robado..... De verdad deberian de sacarlos de amazon por su gran estafa al vender como lo hacen ustedes. Sean serios.
Overall, this has been an OK PDA. My biggest gripe is that every 60 days I'm required to update my hotmail password through some obscure process with poorly written instructions siting links that don't exist. I am left trying to figure out the update without instruction. If I don't jump through the hoops, then I don't get emails from my hotmail account to the blackberry pearl.  It is painfully annoying.  If they must do this, why not at least make it a more clear straight forward process? It is almost as if either hotmail or blackberry are discouraging use of these products together. It has certainly made me consider trading up for an IPhone next time I upgrade. The other querky thing is that my blackberry changes the typing style (double click or recongizing what words I'm trying to type)periodically without a known cause. I keep my phone in locked mode when not in use so perhaps it is a software problem.  In all other aspects is has been ok, but in no way exceptional.
The Housing Case Cover Faceplate was not the OEM Original Black RIM, and was the same with the battery.
I've had this phone for about two years and have no intention of switching in the near future.  I have sampled all the Blackberrys on the market and none suit me better than this slim phone that I can easily handle and text from with one hand.  Besides it fits securely in my front pocket like a small wallet.I have tried the Iphone and am not crazy with the touch screen which my fat fingers have a difficult time with.  All the advanced apps do nothing for me that I can't do with my laptop.I really like the Blackberry Messenger feature.  I am told that I can easily chat with any other Blackberry (if I input the device's PIN) anywhere in the world regardless of the network reception (or non-reception) of my local provider.Call me old fashioned but I still only use my phone for talk and text.  For alot of other things it is amazing what you can do with the text feature by texting Google.If I were to upgrade I may choose another Blackberry Pearl with slightly wider keys.  Otherwise I think I will stick with this phone for awhile.
this cell become in perfect state and is new with all accesories in the box and is t-mobile. buy.
These phones are not unlocked. Are lies!! I am very upsetThe sereal is blocked
I bought this cell about 3 months ago looked band new but now I'm wondering if it really was. it started malfunctioning 3 weeks ago  by turning off itself and doesn't come on for hours , now the permanent problem is the screen is blank I would never recommend this product.
Initial response when the phone was received was great.  It was in "Almost New" condition.  It also worked and showed no signs of being defective.  The only problem I have with this phone is the 2 of the letters on the keyboard does not work.  When you try to write a text message using the T or Y, a Z appears on the screen.  I have to push the Z button to get a T or Y.
The blackberry pearl was not one of my favorite phones. I expierenced many difficulties with this phone and i would never purchase a blackberry again. The scrolling ball fell out of my phone multiple times until there came a point where i lost the ball which lead to me not being able to get any of my numbers because they blackberry saves numbers straight to your phone instead of your sim card. Another problem i had with this phone was every night all of my text messages and phone calls would delete from the recent history, i took the phone in multiple times and they said there was nothing to do about it. with all this being said some people loved the blackberry pearl but i HATED it!
Operators of movil telephones in Venezuela told me this phone have a invalid serial. This is beacuse use one serial for two phones aparently. No one movile operators right here cand help me aboput that case.
when you buy something that says NO WARRANTY, probably it will fail. That's a murphy's law and It was my case. I bought two units and one of them never workedThere is no case, I was warned, but it was very cheap.It was my fault and I do not intend to claim a guarantee that never exist.My recommendation is that you think very carefully before buying.RegardsJose Gomez
Was talked into this phone at the cell phone store.... am not impressed with it's signal, we live in a rural area.  Nothing beats my old Nokia!  I originally lost this phone so insurance sent another, finally found it and transferred it to my husband.  Both the exact phones and both have the same problems.  Phone mutes, then unmutes, calls people on it's own, texts on its own.... Sometimes it freezes up, sometimes the sound goes out.  Can't get it to switch to roaming when in a specific nearby town so have crappy signal there, if it would just switch over it would be fine.  The roller ball on both of our phones does not always work, in fact doesn't work more than it does work.  Would not recommend this phone even though it's made in Canada.  Would love to find one made on this continent that is worth a darn and not have to by china made phone.  Have had 2 different Nokia's and loved them both, too bad my kid dropped my last one in the lake, couldn't find a replacement then got talked into this blackberry.
Hi, I'm about to buy one of these phones to my wife, but after reading all the reviews, i'm kinda worried, seems like aren't new ones, but does Amazon.com's direct store sells the good stuff? appreciate your help.Thanks.
Bettter than having to extend my contract with t-Mobile. But, would have liked to have been able to address the problems I had with the brand new phone conveniently at one of the million t-mobile stores around. I guess you trade one thing for another.
[...]. I opened the package and everything seemed perfect, install the sim card of my operator and all excellent ... until the second day when the keys started to fail and the phone did not fall within any application, will lead to a service shop and they believe was the surprise ... the team is totally rebuilt, but that's not all bad but because the phone rebuilt serves neither to spare, I recommend not buying this article at all.
I have used the pearl for almost 2 years now, and I love the phone itself.  I used to have a newer model and loved it, but now I have this one.  It's not quite as nice as I'm used to; some features are missing and a few of the buttons are difficult to press, but overall I'm very happy with the functionality of it.  I can multi-task and get things done quickly without having the bulkiness of a standard size blackberry.PROS-size-functionality-battery lifeCONS-buttons stick and cause mistyping-drop down menu not available like newer models
I recieved a brand new BlackBerry Pearl fully unlocked and 100% functionality. I ordered it directly from Amazon and it was delivered on the estimated time. The phone needs a software actualization that i haven't been able to make, but besides from that it is a very good choice, every function of the phone works perfectly.
I like my Blackberry Pearl a lot. I use it both for personal use as well as for my job. Having my emails and my instant messages coming to be on my BB Pearl lets me get work done without having to be at my desk on my computer. It seems to be quite durable as well, I've dropped mine MANY times and have never had a problem with it (lucky for me) The only problem I have with this phone is the roll pad, it does stick sometimes and then you have to take several minutes to roll it around to get it to work. I would highly recommend the BlackBerry Pearl!
The phone works great. It allows me to do everything i want on it. Texting was made easier for me on this phone.
I recommend this product blackberry pearl 8110 unlocked phone, total guarantee of delivery and estimated time, in a 1000% responsible, the team is brand new, definitely recommend it.
I am traying to lern how to use it. keybord totally different from other cell phones.
Pros: It has a built in calendar, memo pad (you can leave the stack of post-its at home now), alarm clock, and stereo bluetooth to name just a few of the extras you get WITH the phone. It can use downloaded ringtones, or you can make your own from mp3's with the included software. The software can also lower the bitrate of any mp3's you want to put on the phone so you can put more of them on it. It also serves as an internet portal for your laptop if you don't have a wireless card for it (my wife's Compaq doesn't even have a slot, so this worked great when we took a road trip last year) ... Oh yeah - it's a pretty good phone, tooCons: It doesn't have GPS built in, it won't make the coffee or tie my shoes. The sound from the mp3 player tends to be a little muddy, but considering that its first duty is a phone, it's passable
I have only had my phone for a day so my review is based solely on first impression. The phone has no visible flaws. Initially, I was very timid with the phone when opening the back, removing the battery, inserting the sim card etc. The back is not easy to remove nor to replace. Everything is working fine. I checked the features and found them easy to manipulate to suit my preferences. The phone indicates exactly what each icon represents and its purpose; it prompts to confirm most changes but not all. It's lightweight, smooth and shiny so it deserves a protective case to avoid scratches.
My blackberry definitely took a couple of weeks getting used to. I thought it would take me forever to get comfortable and quick navigating through all the phone's features but now I am finally using the phone to its fullest. If you like to BBM, send photo messages, and email this blackberry is for you. Internet is useful once in a while but I don't use it unless its for something urgent.
First of all the item arrived two days later. Then, the second time I was going to charge the phone, the device came off.
I bought 2 Blackberry Pearl 8120 and both of them didn't work!! The blackberry started to turn off and the message "media card removed" was all the time in the screen... So I couldn't use the cell phone. The other one had only a blank white screen and was not even turning on!!! I return the cell phones and lost TIME and MONEY... I am so disappointed! It caused me so many PROBLEMS and I lost a lot of calls. I definitely don't recommend it!!!!
I was so disappointed with this phone when I received it that I returned it the following day after using it for about 1 hour. The display and keys were just way too small. I knew I didn't want a full size Blackberry because I think they are too big to comfortably carry everyday, but the Pearl was not the answer either.
Blackberry does not honor their warranty.  If you must get one, buy insurance.  The USB connection breaks because of poor design.  I have had two fail.  One had insurance, the other did not.  Blackberry claims that this does not happen and WILL charge you $180.  There is no escalation.  I got the device back with a broke screen and no battery (new one too).  Poor design, poor software, and the worst customer support.  You have been warned.
This phone is one of the best is very little and very nice de aplicacions works perfectly it was sold by SHOPCELL i love my phone i got it for my birthday and it was just the best... i dont know what remanofactured means but i know THAT THIS PHONE WAS NOT SOLEN OR USED OR REFURBISHED.... SHOPCELL Y TRULLY HONEST, the only thing is that when you open alot of aplicacions it can LAG OR BE SLOW BUT is just the best.......Any coments can be responded...Thanks
i purchased this phone to my sons and they are very happy with this, averything works perfectly since i receive them they can use every single function of the blackberry... thank you
This is my first blackberry and I like it. It has a lot of functionnalities, my only fear it's if the mouse freeze. I think it's a good deal.
I've purchased my phone from Tiger Direct and it has an annoying problem. When I make a call, on the top right side an 'ABC' icon appears and never goes away! I have to get in to phone book to have it dissapear :) Strange!
I had this phone for 2.5 years and it's very decent. I dropped it a bunch of times and it kept working just fine. Battery life is great. Good call quality. The case is solid: metallic and feels good (unlike cheap plastic style in some other phones). One of a few flip smartphones on the market.Bad: (internal) power connector breaks overtime (had to be replaced twice). I also had to change the back cover of the case with time as it started sliding (but again, I did drop it a lot and generally sloppy user so..)It's outdated by now but so is the price. If one needs a cheap windows smartphone, this one is definitely a good option.
I wanted to upgrade my old battle worn Motorola that runs the windows operating system with a 'newer' technoloy(only 2 years old)so i picked this phone which runs a newer version on the operating system, etc. the good is that the phone has a nice display and feel to it. the bad is that it would not work as well and allow much ability to confiure it with Activesync...example-it downloaded all 400 of my contats from outlook and would not allow me to filter what went on the phone..old phone did this. same for tasks. the signal would barely 'lock on' in my house, the old phone does much better. the driver in the phone is older than what is availabe from HTC but since it's an IMATE device they will not download new software to this phone. IMATE support is @#$#@. even after escalating to 'engineering' they claimed they made the phone(rather than rebranding it). i think you get the picture. Upgrades to the phone are available if phone is the Cingular version, which MAY solve the problems i had. i returned the phone and got the usual great Amazon support.
I bought this phone for my young daughter and she loved the color and the flip model. However, it came in a box that was clearly used, rundown and unsealed. The phone had Rogers Telecom on it which looked at if it was refurbished. I thought I had bought a brand new phone. We tried to charge the phone and it did not work nor light up. We left it overnight and it still did not work so we called TigerDirect and because we ordered it from Amazon, they processed the return.
This is a great low-cost Sony Ericsson phone.  I've owned a lot of different phones in the past from the Samsung SGH-D900 (Black Carbon), Sony Ericsson W800i, Apple iPhone 2G, and Apple iPhone 3G.  Compared to those phones, I would have to rate this phone just as good as those.Physically the phone is built quite well.  There is a slider which protects the camera lens and allows you to take photos when open.  The phone has good reception (especially compared to my Samsung SGH-D900), the voices come through clear during phone calls, and the built in speaker has great sound (especially with MP3's and other music.Also the built in web-browser does a great job but I really must recommend that you download Opera Mini.  Pages load in around 2 seconds in 3G or HSDPA (in Denver) it seems as opposed to the Sony Browser which takes around 5 seconds +.  What I also like is that the text messages can be displayed in a conversational text which looks like instant messaging.  Those familiar with the iPhone texting will be right at home with this.The only few negatives I could think of is that the camera is only 3.2 megapixel, there's no zoom on the camera unless you're in VGA mode, there's only an LED flash (no Xenon), and my IM (instant messaging) program was missing (I downloaded a new one).Overall I'm going to have to rate this phone a 4 out of a 5.  Mostly for it's features and it's price point.
My teenage son found this phone and had to have it. He read about it online and liked the reviews, especially about the 3.2 MP camera. The first model one he wanted was not the C510a but a different letter model of the same phone. I called AT&T; and they said to look for one with all four of the bandwidths that this model has, so we found this one on Amazon, checked for the bandwidths and bought it. It took more than a week to arrive but it was a good purchase because my son enjoys it. No one else has this phone in his group of friends and it was easy to just swap sim cards from his Krazr and call AT&T; to register it. Of course now he's on facebook with his phone and we had to add internet to our bill but he paid for the phone himself and he's happy with it and it's only an additional $10 a month for unlimited internet.
Excellent cellular phone. Of versatile size, adapted to my needs. I cannot say nothing bad to near the phone. I recommend it widely.
Phone came in on time.  Phone was new not like new.  And unlike other places the seller was honest about all that came with the phone.  If you want to be assured of quality get your phone here otherwise buy at the other place.
Nokia N85 Unlocked Cell Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, GPS, MP3/Video Player, MicroSD Slot - U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)I purchased this with the free shipping saver option on a Thursday night, it was shipped Friday, I received it Wednesday.My previous phone was the Nokia N85 8GB and I have to say that I like this more. Its smaller, fits in my pocket, and screen is so much more brighter (OLED vs traditional LCD). I know there were some complaints about the builds quality of these devices, but rest assured the Nokia N85 has a great build (I heard some of the older copper ones had issues, but the black is of newer production).The camera pictures are great (probably the best camera out of all other camera phones) when viewed at a desktop sized zoom-in, but if you goto a 100% then it doesn't; I guess thats with all camera phones. If you need something sharper go get digicam or DSLR.Video recording is good too, Alot better and faster then those crappy webcams that are selling for like 70 bucks nowadays. Video recordings can also be geotagged (somehow).Maps are cool. Nokia allows you do download a Map Loader app from their website and download offline maps directly to your phone. I did that for a few states that I plan on visiting this summer. I love the geotagging feature and geotag every photo I take. You can upload them to Flickr, Panoramio, Google Picasaweb (and others), and they will recognize the geotagged information in the pictures and display them on the map. Quite cool.GPS locks fairly quickly without A-gps (for the ones who do not have mobile broadband plan).My recommendation to everyone who gets this phone, is to purchase some type of cover for the screen + body and my highest recommended product for that is the InvisibleShield from [...] I would install this within minutes of taking the N85 out of the box. Hey you gotta protect your investment!Some other features/options I like: slide to lock/unlock, slide to talk/hangup, auto. power saving mode, text-to-speech for incoming calls (says the name of the caller), there's a bunch more.The only negative thing I can say about the phone is that the keys can get a bit painful if you are a major texter. If so, then probably best to look into a qwerty phone (i.e. Nokia N97). Also the phone does get a bit warm when running the gps and camera for really long period of time. I ran it for an hour or so and it got quite warm for my taste.
The N85 is an awesome phone. Especially for the price.If you buy a Nokia make sure it has the latest software update. Which you can get from Nokias website. I found an update for the N85 that will allow for upgrade, from 8GB, to a 16GB micro sd card. The phone has so many incredible features they a to numerous to list. One of my favorites is the ease of using the N85 as a modem to connect your home computer to the internet. I don't know the connection speed, but it is fast.
After researching for about one year and constantly changing my mind, I found it. The perfect phone. It has everything I was looking for and left me wanting nothing. The camera quality is great, and changing the settings are super simple. The screen is absolutely beautiful with rich vibrant colors. Call Quality is top notch. Music player is easy to use and video playback is superb on the OLED screen. The OS took some getting used to but I haven't purchased a new phone in about 7 years. So much power in such a small package. I haven't had any problems or glitches since turning it on. I have always heard that Nokia made great products and now I am a believer.
I have this phone for about 5 months and it's been really great for me.  I use this phone to check emails, watch videos and take pictures.  My favorite thing about the phone is the camera (5.0 megapixel).  I've read mixed reviews about the quality of the pictures and video, but in my opinion it's pretty awesome.  As with any device, you need to know how it use it.  I did have to learn what the best situations for the camera to take pictures, but once I did that it has become my favorite thing to use on the phone.  Is it really a replacement?  No, but pretty darn close.Taking video on the phone is pretty cool too.  For a phone, it takes great video (30 fps) in great lighting without any lag time even when following moving objects.  I've compared the quality with the HTC Hero a friend of mine has and the N85 is def better.  Low lighting is a little bit different but the duel LED flash turns into a light source and is great for taking low light video from about 10 feet away.I don't have a data plan so wifi was a must for me since I also use it for emails and just simple web surfing tasks.  The best browser in my opinion is the Opera mini 5 beta which allows for tab browsing.  The Youtube app works pretty nice and is a life saver when my daughter needs a quick distraction.Other info to note is that this phone is feature packed.  It has an OLED screen which is super bright, FM transmitter, FM radio, wifi, GPS, TV out using 3.5m jack (included), Bluetooth 2.0 A2DP and music player.The GPS is pretty slow if you don't have a data plan for some reason and you have to pay for turn by turn (it's free for 3 months if you get the phone new).  The FM radio is pretty handy in the office and I didn't think that I'd be using it as much as I do. Bluetooth is a great funtion for file transfers if ever you need to share files with others too.Pos:1.  Camera2.  Wifi3.  MP3 player4.  FM transmitter5.  OLED Screen6.  Bluetooth file transferCons:1.  User interface is a bit slow at times2.  Activating the camera is sometimes slow3.  Is prone to crashing if you try to do too many tasks at once.4.  Uploading pictures to Flickr and Ovi is nice, but whenever I try to do it, it shuts the phone down.  (I've started using Shozu as a work around)5.  N-Gage is very buggy.I really have been pleased with this phone.  It still amazes people who see the pictures on my Facebook how good the pictures can turn out.
Pros:- Features: it has EVERYTHING what technology can bring (but touchscreen)- Size: the same than a regular phone and smaller than a PDA- Brightness, definition and color quality of the OLED screen- high quality camera and lensCons:- life battery- Too poor GPS sensibility (some times it even seems not to work at all)- plastic case (I expected something really better from an N Series ...)
I've been using this phone for about a month. Thus far I mostly love it.I like:- slim size- nice look;- quite easy browsing (though it was difficult to find some functions and also as I used a Siemens phone before, I had to get used to some new key assignments)- FM radio- music player (both give you sound of decent quality)- headphones that came with the phone (pitifully, without a mic)- wi-fi- camera is good as for a phone.I dislike:- it could be less expensive, the technology of wi-fi and A-GPS is not something that new;- charge indicator could be more uniform (last dashes disappear really quickly)- the screen is 'tender', I kept it for a day in a pants pocket with papers and cards, and it got those whity stuff on it. Not scratches happily.- A-GPS need about 5 minutes to find satellites sometimes. Also I had to find out on a forum that you need to go to the menu and check Assisted GPS in Positioning, so it works better now.- I still haven't found if I can manage the main screen text menu, it's kinda annoying.I'm still arguing if I like this A-GPS. It doesn't remember my previous position as usual car GPS units do. So every time - the first time. All the application I used this far worked well, though I haven't been using many of them. Also I didn't understand from the product description that it caomes with a 8 Gb card, so don't order any more! Please, read about this A-GPS before you buy it!I give it 4.5 stars.
I've had the phone for a bit more than 2 weeks and only found 4 bugs.The first one is that you can't turn on the camera flash w/out recording a video like if it were a flashlight, silly but helpfull trick I used to use a lot on my previous Nokia 6265 when in the dark.Second, speakers could have been noisier. It sounds clear but lower than my old one-speakered 6265.Third, keypad is a bit uncomfortable untill you get used to it because it is all flat with no separate buttons and a bit small so if you have big fingertips it would be a bit harder to get used to it.The last one and more important is that I find the phone slow in comparison to my old 6265. I've heard that symbian phones were a bit slow so I don't know if this is "normal" or it's faster or slower than other symbian phones but i remember that i could be writting a SMS back just right after pressing Answer option, with this phone it takes 3~5 seconds before it allows me to start writting also it's a bit slower to get ready to shot a pic with the camera.Besides this sense of slow motion(dunno if it's normal for a symbian) and the other 3 minor bugs, it's an excellent cel phone, camera capabilities are far beyond expected, specially the superb video recording. Simply awesome when using high quality and very good on mid-low ones.Sound on calls (both sides of the conversation)is Excellent using the device and also using the included hands-free.Media sound using earbuds is also Excellent, Nokia earbuds offer less volume than regular earbuds but I think it's more a health restriction than a technical isuue so if you wanna hear your music rock loud, use another earbuds =)Screen resolution and energy duration is also good for the little device, which also feels very solid for a 2-way slider, and I really mean it, it Feels Solid.GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi work simply flawless with high data transfer ratio for BT and WiFi.So generally speaking it's quite an excellent cel phone if you like sliders.
If you are looking for a small sized cell phone with everything in it .. and i mean everything .. The only thing you may miss is the keyboard if you really care about one ..the display is super .. the speaker is little low but acceptable.. GPS works fine as well as the FM transmitter
I bought it on friday afternoon, with free two-day shipping, it arrived on monday.I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and it works great, It is a multimedia computer, with all kinds of functions that you discover day after day. Definetly the nokia N series is the best, and this phone is on the top 5 of this series, Works excellent, and I'm happy with the option I've made, I was not sure about getting this one or the nokia 5800 Xpress Music, but I've finally decided for this one because of the ngage service. I totally recomended it....
Toi rat vui khi mua do qua mang luoi cau Amazon ,khi mua va goi hang nhanh chong ,va dong thoi re hon nua ,cam on rat nhieu ,day co teh cho cac ban VN doc xem nhe ,I'm very please with Amazon ,when we buy online ,good price ,good shipping ,and correct the day ,soo thank you Amazon .
Seems like a good phone. There aren't any clip on cases available for this phone that I can find, so if that is important to you you might look for another phone.
With a very low use, the battery was exhausted after only five days instead of 15 as reported on the nokia website.I returned the phone and I got another one, but the problem was the same and in addition the sliding door was shaking.Also the keyboard is very uncomfortable.I gave two stars, since the reception is good as well as the speakers but in general I am very disappointed with this phone.I shipped it back and asked to be refunded.
I bought two nokia n85 and one is good and the another have a problem with de bright of the screen
I bought the Copper and the Black one ( the copper 4 my wife ) - both were from Amazone , and ther are good , the sound is really good , wifi , Gps i used it and it was helpful... bye
Yes, the N85 (black) does have Wifi and will work on AT&T; 3G network. You will be very happy with this phone.
Pros: N85 packs a lot of features in a small body - see other reviews. Some say it's flimsy - I disagree. I dropped it twice on the floor at home and once on asphalt in the street. It works as if nothing happened.Cons: People mention minor things. I'll talk about the most important. (1) When I was travelling outside the US, my N85 stopped functioning. The local service center refused to repair it, even for money, even though I had an invoice proving that I was the original purchaser. The representative said that's Nokia's anti-smuggling policy. What the service center did not want to do for $36, a local pirate did for $14. When I posted my negative review on NokiaUSA, they censored it out. (2) Only beginning users can be happy with Symbian. I am an advanced user, and I buy an advanced phone like N85 to be able to do many more things than Symbian allows.
hello !i want to buy the n85 black today and theres not written that if this black model has wifi.so please tell me does it has?
This phone is loaded, It had more than every feature I could have wanted. I ended up trading it however due to the fact it was to bulky for me to use in everyday situations.
damn,I have got a used N85,i cant use the GPS,and I found there are so many photos were taken at JUly 2008 stored at album.it looks like a old cellphone was renovate
I got this as my first cell phone and at first i was pleased that i could get a phone so cheap and have unlimited texting through virgin for only $20 a month.Long story short a month after having it hear are my impressionsPositive-Its only $30-You can throw it at people and it will not breakNegative-Even after only a month of texting i can easily out-text this phone which is very very annoying-Very poor reception, then move over ten steps and you have great reception, only you can be outside and do that and still same thing it has a horrible time picking up a signal-Sometimes takes half an hour to receive a message which as you can imagine gets very old very fast-Marks messages as sent when they arnt at all sent, this happens very frequently-Randomly out of the blue freezes, ALOT which is also stupid having to pull the battery sometimes 4 to 5 times a day-You can add words to your word list for texting but when you have to pull the battery because the dang thing froze it loses some words and never quit works rightThats allMy ompinion is that unless your desperate for the very cheapest plan with the very cheapest service DO NOT EVER THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS PHONE!!!
Works great and is very cheap to own. Plans are what you want with no hassles. You can buy topups at target.
I purchased this phone (blue E63-2) three weeks ago. Overall, I am very happy with this phone. $200 for this unlocked smartphone is a great deal.I add my application background first in the following. Because I think a review will only be fair with certain application background. For example, for the email application, Blackberry is more powerful for the business user, it can have more functions or better performance when it is hooked up with your company exchange server. Also for data service performance in wireless network, I only use it in T-mobile network; I don't know how it performs in ATT's 3G network, so I don't comment on this.My service provider: T-mobileMy service package: voice + 100MB/month data serviceMy application: personal usePro:1. Full Q keyboard. Yes, a lot of smartphones have the full Q-keyboard. But the keyboard of E63 has the better design, the shape of each key enables you to type with less error-stroking.2. WI-FI: 802.11g compatible. The setup is very easy, it supports WEP/WPA/WPA2 wireless security features. And the link speed is very good. This enable me to go to internet and download applications at home (or hot-spot) without using the 100MB data-service bandwidth.3. When the "bluetooth" and the "WLAN scanning" are turned off, the battery life is GOOD; thanks to the physical size of the battery. When the "WLAN scanning" is off, you still can use the WLANs that have already been setup in the phone; it just won't search for the new WLAN. But for the "bluetooth", you will have to turn it on in order to use it; and the "bluetooth" seems draining more power than WIFI.4. Email service: I am using Nokia's free (for now) mail push service; it pushes my yahoo mails and the other mails to my E63, it notifies me when there is a new mail. Most time, it worked very quickly in T-mobile network (but my emails are more text oriented, HTML contents require additional download time). This is a great feature, I don't have to go to the internet to fetch the mails manually. One can download this email setup software from Nokia website. This is only available for BlackBerry and iPhone before, with a more expensive data service.  (I don't know when Nokia will start to charge this service.)5. Completed PDA functions and reliable sync with PC (Syncing with PC by bluetooth is great!)6. Compare with the Nokia E71, I like this one better. The reasons are: lower-price and thicker body with plastic finishing. Although the body of E63 is plastic, but the texture feels very good and not easy to get the finger-prints. The thicker body has the acoustic advantage, the speaker performances well even when you are listening music. Of course, the lower price comes with the trade-offs: comparing with E71, the E63 does not have integrated GPS and the resolution of the camera is lower (3mp via 2mp)7. Music function: E63 has the 3.5 mm standard connector, which means you can use your favorite headset to listen to music. Although, the headset comes with the phone is stereo, and it has an in-line microphone; but the frequency response is not good enough to listen to music (if you are serious about listening). By using a standard headset, you still can make calls or receive calls, but you will have to speak to the microphone in the phone.Con:1. Image quality of camera. I can live with the 2MP resolution, but the noise of the camera is too obvious; even the pictures taken outdoor.2. Micro-USB cable is not included: This phone uses the Micro-USB interface, which is smaller than the mini-USB. I am sure most people have one or more mini-USB cables, which is widely used. But a lot of people don't have the micro-USB cable, at least I don't. So I have to go to a local shop to buy one ($15), and it is not easy to found one too. Very unfortunate, Nokia did not throw one in the box. Sometimes, it is very useful, such as when you want to copy a hundred songs to your phone's memory card; bluetooth is simply too slow to do this task.Update:Here is the update after three month use.(A) Don't put this phone into a case that is too tight; especially: preventing the keyboard to be touched when it is in the case. I found out if the keyboard is being touched, the phone will not go into the sleep mode and the battery runs out really fast.(B) The IP phone function(aka Internet phone) is great for the international long distant call (you must sign-up the "Gizemo" first), you can use it whenever you have the WIFI access; it cost much less than your wireless service provider's international plan. But after you finish a call, you should disconnect the phone from the WIFI completely; otherwise the battery goes down real quick. The reason is: as soon as you connect the IP phone service, it will contact the WIFI access point (such as your wireless router) periodically even when you are not making calls, this activity will use a lot of power.(C) The "Remote lock" is a great feature, and it is very easy to setup. First, you need to setup the "lock code" of this phone (after setup, write it down). Then enable the "Allow Remote lock" feature, it will ask a lock code again; it can be the same code in the FIRST step or a different one. If you lost your phone or simply forget your phone in the office; just grab another phone and send a text message to your phone, the message is the lock code. The message must contain the exactly same lock code, case must be matched and no extra space. Use another phone to send a text message is the best way to do it; some computer programs can send a text message to a wireless phone, but it tends to add some extra text in the message automatically, this will fail to lock the phone.
I want to start off saying that after using multiple phones over the years, I find this to be one of my top phones I have ever used.By being unlocked from the start, the phone is completely umbranded, meaning you don't have all of the cute AT&T; or T-Mobile logos everywhere, and have complete access to all of the settings that most providers will restrict you from changing. You also have 110MB of space free on the phone (a ton) for basic apps, and of course you can buy a MicroSD card for even more memory.The phone itself looks great. The blue color is actually an extremely dark navy, and can look black in most cases. As for the thickness compared to the e71, I think it actually feels better in your hand, and isn't that noticeable. The headphone jack is a great touch, allowing you to use any headphone set you want.As for the software, it uses the Symbian 9.2 Feature Pack 1, and includes software you can use to open and edit Word and Excel documents on the go. The built in music player is decent, and set up like an Ipod with its ability to have playlists, genre searches etc. You can even download the free Divx player and watch movies to go! Then theres the Nokia Ovi store. Sort of like the App Store for the iPone, you can download apps directly from Nokia, although at the moment due to its recent launch, there aren't that many things (especially free) being offered.The WiFi was the deal sealer for me. Living on a college campus which has wireless internet all over, I didn't want to have to pay to have internet and email on my phone. Its fast (compared to a friend's iPone, about the same speed)and it is great for surfing, along with using the build-in YouTube application.There is a ton of great free software on the web for the phone if you look for it, things like weather applications, instant messaging, mapping software (requires either a WiFi or a data plan to use) etc.I find the speakerphone loud and clear, and good enough to play music over.The keyboard is absolutely amazing. I haven't experience many misspellings while using it, compared to my past palm treo I had. The keys are comfortable and easy to press down.Battery life is great on this. I was able to get 5 days out of a charge with light usage (30 texts per day, maybe 20 minutes on the phone per day and 10-15 minutes per day surfing using the WiFi)The cons I've found:Nokia still hasn't set up a threaded text messaging system as default (IM style chats). My Windows Mobile phone from 4 years ago has this feature, and Nokia has their own application which does this, but you cannot set it as the default Txt messaging.Weak vibration feature. I can barley feel it. My previous Nokia was weak as well though.The Operating System (Symbian) does not assume or remember any connection settings. If you open your web browser, each time it will ask you what connection you want to use. It can get annoying if you are constantly in the same place.Other Tips I've foundIf you don't have a data plan, go into the Network settings and change it to be GSM Only (NOT UMTS). UMTS is 3G, and you will get better battery life using GSM only with no downsides if not using the data plan.To change volume with internet radio, press the function key, and then the up and down keys change the volume.In media player, you can start typing the name of a song or artist using the keyboard and it will show up.
I've had the E63-2 (North American Version) for a few days now, and am really loving this phone so far.  It's my first Symbian (S60) phone, so I was a little hesitant about the learning curve.  And to be honest -- it's not anywhere near as intuitive as the iPhone or Android.  But if you're a little bit tech savvy, it won't be a problem at all.The phone feels great in hand.  I've held the E63's big brother, the E71, and I prefer this one better.  The rubberized plastic doesn't feel cheap at all, offers a superior grip, and maybe best of all, doesn't get all smudged up with fingerprints.  It's still relatively slim, though not as sleek as the E71.  But again, I prefer it -- it's just easier to hold.The QWERTY is nicely designed, and the keys feel great to push.  Numerically, the "0" is to the right of the "9" instead of underneath the "8," which is kind of jarring at first, but I got used to it.  Another design annoyance is the lack of a volume rocker on the side... you have to use the D-Pad, which means taking the phone away from your ear mid-conversation.  No dedicated camera button either, but that didn't bother me much at all -- you can take a picture in two button clicks away from the home screen.Voice quality is crystal-clear, rivaling any land-line I've ever used.  The ringer's nice and loud, though getting to the Sound settings themselves require a series of button pushes, instead of being "right there."The default mail client is decent, though I've run into some problems connecting to my ISP's POP3 mail server.  I downloaded Nokia's new mail client, which is a lot more graceful.There are lots of apps available on the internet for this operating system, but they're scattered all over the place and they're hard to find unless you really know what you're looking for.  However, that's going to change very soon, as Nokia's "Ovi Store" is set to open next month (May 2009).  Looks very promising -- and even appears to have the elusive S60 Facebook app that's been conspicuous in its absence.Anyway, great UNLOCKED smartphone for the price.  Might be lacking in some minor areas (no GPS, average camera quality, no volume rocker), but it makes up for it in others (WiFi, stable operating system, app store coming soon).Strong recommendation from me.
I wanted to "upgrade" from my old N95 (had it 2 or 3 years)and get a phone with full qwerty keyboard. Using Nokia's "Switch" utility, all my contacts were transfered to my new E63 within minutes... It was effortless... Thank you Nokia!TV SCREEN: The E63 screen is brighter, wider and better proportioned than the N95. Great for watching TV - yes, there's a $15 TV application that gives you CNN and about 100 other channels - Google "Spb TV"SPEED: It's much faster and more streamlined than the N95 - maybe the E63 has a faster processor?FAST CAMERA: REALLY FAST! It boots up in about one second so it's much easier to point and shoot than the N95. 2.0 Megapixels isn't a problem - I prefer the lower resolution because it's much easier to email and share the pics on the net.PRIUS BLUETOOTH INTEGRATION: Bluetooth transfered ALL my 170 contacts to the Toyota's Address Book in one shot. The N95 couldn't do that!INTERNET MODEM: Works flawlessly... Nokia PC Suite allows me to connect my notebook to the internet anytime by just plugging the phone into its USB port and clicking a button. T-Mobile gives me unlimited access to the Internet for just $20/month.BATTERY: E63's battery is huge - about twice the size of the N95's - without making the phone more bulky - amazing. The E63 easily lasts far longer than the N95 without re-charging.VOLUME CONTROL: There's no physical volume control buttons on the E63. Instead, you use the central cursor control (during a call) and it works just fine. Honestly, who actually alters the volume of each call? I set the volume once and it normally stays at that level for all my calls - I don't miss having a separate volume control. Good job NOKIA!GMAIL: Nokia's combined email/message application works better than Google's own separate Gmail application. Setup was easy and Nokia integrates a Gmail inbox alert into the phone's main screen.BLUETOOTH TIP: Quickly turn on/off Bluetooth by pressing and holding the asterisk key * for a couple of seconds (from the main screen). Great for when you're in the car with passengers but don't want them listening to your "hands free" conversations.PRICE: You just can't beat it - there's NOTHING that comes close. You'll also need to order a Nokia USB cable (about $2 on Amazon) and why not treat yourself to an 8GB Micro SDHC card? (about $20).NOKIA E63 ROCKS!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!!!
People, people...this is an amazing opportunity; move on it.  This phone is an EU phone that is being offered here in the US to gain market share and put the phone in the hands of the more casual user.  Go ahead, go to CNET and PCworld and check out the reviews; the E63 is typically compared with units costing 2-3 times as much.  So, it falls a bit short in some areas (camera, headphones, et al) so, it's not perfect.  For under $200, who cares?  Come on.  All current phones are obsolete in three years anyway, (or after the first drop on the airport floor)!The E63's got a vivid screen, great speaker, gets FM radio, a decent app store @ NOKIA.com, MicroSD slot, easy to sync up, great build quality and offers clear reception for TMobile, ATT and international travel, whenever we decide to do that again.  QKeyboard, ability to netsurf in hotspots w/o dataplan, US WARRANTY and by the way, currently less than $150 beans with rebate.  And no two-year contract.  Yankee Blue or Sox Red, they easily stand out among the Crackberry drones.  Wake up and smell the symbian, Baby...getting a great deal is the hot trend.
Unlike the E71-2 which supports "HSDPA class 6, maximum speed 3.6 Mbps/384 kbps (DL/UL)" this (the E63-2)  supports "WCDMA 900/2100 or 850/1900 or 850/2100, maximum speed 384/384 kbps". So, if you have ATT HSDPA in your area you will not be able to take advantage of it, max download speeds 90% lower than the E71-2.  I respectfully suggest getting the specs directly from the Nokia web site for any phone of interest, rather than relying on the marketing dept.'s ad copy. Cheers.
I was originally planning to purchase an iPhone. However, after seeing this phone on Amazon, along with many positive reviews and an excellent price ($150 after rebate), this phone looked to have the right price and features for my needs. In particular, I wanted strong messaging capabilities, WiFi, a few games, and reasonably capable web browsing to check the news, my RSS feeds, weather, stocks, etc. However, I really don't need (or want to pay for) the more advanced iPhone capabilities.I've had the phone for just over 2 days now, and my experience has been consistent with many of the other reviewers. For example, I really like the keyboard and overall construction and form-factor. The core applications like email, web browsing, calendar, and address book also meet or exceed my expectations. However, I found parts of the setup and configuration to be counter-intuitive and the software and handset as a whole to be less "seamlessly integrated" than I would have hoped for.The above being said, now that I've fully configured this phone, and I'm further along the Symbian learning curve, I believe for as long as I own this phone, it will prove to be an excellent value; i.e., it has excellent features, capabilities, and performance for the price.A few specific pros and cons include:* "Virtual GPS" with Google maps - If you purchase this phone, I'd definitely download Google Maps. Having done so, I was pleasantly surprised to find Google Maps used the cell-tower method to give a "virtual GPS" location within 200 meters (at least for me on AT&T;), and fully integrated this information with its other capabilities.* Software and handset capabilities not seamlessly integrated - For example, I purchased a 4GB mini-SD card, and proceeded to fill it with hundreds of photos in numerous folders. By default, the built in photo browser doesn't include the folder structure on the SD card, but instead lists all the photos as one big flat list. There is a work-around to organize the pictures into a second set of "folders" on the phone, but why is this duplicate organization necessary? There are also 3rd party photo browsers you can download/purchase. As another example, I configured the start-up screen to show some contact information to call if someone finds my lost phone, but also configured the phone with a lock code; however, the phone only displays the startup splash screen *after* the lock code has been successfully entered, sort of defeating the value of my "if found" splash screen. In general, many of the features and capabilities on this phone work very well individually, but there's room for improvement to make all these features integrate more smoothly with respect to the likely workflow of a person using the phone.* Email setup was a snap - When I started using the phone, it prompted me with a step-by-step (wizard based) configuration of email. In a few steps, the phone was properly configured for my gmail account. However, in the future, using email as a representative example, I'd suggest Nokia put more effort to simplify/automate common tasks in the initial setup process, such as pairing with my bluetooth headset, or specifying predictive or non-predictive text entry.* Awkward Connection Management - Most of the built in applications have a choice to always connect to a specific WiFi/3G/Edge connection, or to always choose a connection during startup - Wouldn't it have been simpler to specify a prioritized list of connections to try, such as your home WiFi first, then 3G?* Lots of keyboard shortcuts - I'm still learning many of the keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing and holding the "Home" button to display a list of open applications, pressing and holding the email button to start a new email, or pressing and holding the calendar button to enter a new meeting. While there's a learning curve, I'm appreciating the added efficiency of these shortcuts.* Works well with iSync - Being a Mac user, I downloaded the iSync plugin. So far, I've found iSync does a job synchronizing the phone with my local iCal calendar and Mac address book.
6 Month Review - Update (12/21/09)I've had this phone for just about 6 mos now and now I'm ready to write a final review.There are plenty of comprehensive reviews already on the internet for this phone, so I am going to give a short and sweet real-life review of this phone about things care about the most:Reception:  My old phone had 0-3 bars throughout my house with frequent dropped calls.  This phone has 4-5 bars constantly and never drops a call (both with same carrier).  Nokia phones are rightfully famous for having the best reception and you will not have reception problems as long as coverage is available in your area.  AT&T; doesn't have the best reception everywhere and don't blame the phone but the carrier if you aren't getting reception.  AT&T; suffers badly underground, between lots of tall buildings and in many rural areas.Battery Life:  If you are playing music, watching movies, using data/bluetooth, and other battery draining tasks...don't expect for it to last more than 3-4 hours.  But if you do some data, some multimedia, some texting and about an hour of voice a day...the battery can last about 3 days.  If you are a casual user, it can last you a week.  Spare batteries are about $15 on ebay, just buy an extra one and swap out when needed.  Additional travel and car chargers are awfully cheap too...around $5.  Even though the battery cell is made in china, it is high quality.Software:  Symbian S60 interface isn't the best, but it's powerful and you have good multi-tasking capabilities, unlike many other smartphones.  There are lots of apps out there, although not may too many good free ones.  Nokia's Ovi App Store is live now and this phone connects to it just fine.  Recently a Facebook app became available (a lot worse than iphone version), still no Yelp app, and no official Twitter app (but the freeware TweetS60 and other not-free apps like Twibble are nice).  It comes with just Tiger Woods Golf for gaming but many Soduku, Bejeweled, Chess, etc games are available.The built-in browser leaves a lot of features to be desired (but it is a full web browser) but pages that don't work so well, works fine in Opera Mini or Mobile.  A limited version of Flash is included.Keyboard/Features:  The keyboard (also found on the E71) is the best among all smartphones IMO.  I've used the Blackberry Curve 8900, and this Nokia phone is much easier to type on.  It's predictive text feature makes sending e-mails a cinch and the Push e-mail works well with gmail and hotmail.  This phone lacks GPS, but A-GPS through Google Maps is adequate for most.Screen:  Not quite as good as the Blackberry Curve 8900, but still great.  Display is crisp for all uses and Youtube videos come out respectfully.  Hopefully Nokia soon offers OLED models.Etc:  Wi-Fi works great (far better wi-fi reception than the Curve 8900), this phone supports AT&T; 3G (Curve 8900 only supports EDGE) and downloads are speedy on both.  It does not support 3.5G that the Nokia E71x and Blackberry Bold supports.What is Bad?:  Phone occasionally crashes and reboots (largely fixed with newer firmware), built-in camera is lousy in quality but functional, no side volume control button, Lack of free apps available on Nokia Ovi Store.  Lot of people have said Nokia tech support sucks, but I have never needed to call or write them.This phone is A-Okay!The recently available 4.0 firmware upgrade adds a brand new version of Nokia Mail (which makes it much more comparable to blackberry e-mail), and comes with Chat (which allows you to use Google Chat, Ovi Chat, MSN Messaging and Yahoo IM (but no AOL Instant Messenger).  Push e-mail can be spotty at times (but mostly due to AT&T; Packet Data dying from time to time).  This firmware has also resolved most issues with phone freezing or rebooting by itself and works faster.  Recent updates to Google Maps and Opera Mini will enhance the device's capabilities.  Nokia is good about upgrading firmware periodically.  Unlike iPhone, upgrading the firmware will delete your entire phone, so you do need to do a complete back-up.
I've had this phone for almost two weeks now, and I'm loving it! I came from an iPhone 3G, then a Moto Q9h, and now to this. So far it gives me what I really want from a phone, VERSATILITY! I mean, I love to customize my phone to work FOR me, not the other way around.I loved my iPhone, but the lack of multi-tasking hampered me, and the data plan from my carrier was $30/mo. The Moto Q9h has all the features, but WM 6.1 is what it is, Windows Mobile. It tended to freeze and require at least one or two soft resets a day.This isn't my first Symbian phone, so I knew what I was walking into with the OS. What amazed me was the speed. This has got to be one of the most responsive OS UI's ever implemented, especially for a Nokia! All the features just come together nicely, and you can easily customize the phone to your liking.Quick examples:HARDWARE- 8gb Class 6 Transcend MicroSD- OtterBox Impact CaseSOFTWARE- Opera Mini (Web Browser)- Photo Browser (Nokia Beta Labs)- Fring (Instant Messenger)- Google Maps- ThreadSMS (Threaded Text Messaging)- Mail For Exchange (Nokia)- ProfiMail (HTML Email Client)Sounds like a lot of personalizing there, but it's more like you're starting with a blank slate for the phone, and you're just adding what you really need.As for the rest of the phone, the thing feels rock solid. The keyboard takes a few days to get used to. The keyboard shortcuts are great, and I really dig that this model has a dedicated "Ctrl" key. The preset buttons for Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging can be remapped to what you want them to do. The screen had me worried because I didn't know if it was made of a scratch-resistant material. The OtterBox case comes with a thick screen protector, so that solves that.In a nutshell... Snappy performance, fully customizable, mp3 and video ringtones (not kidding), good signal, doesn't need the more expensive data plan from At&t;, when a program were to freeze just hold the home key (task manager) and close it from there (doesn't usually happen), and it's great for multitasking!
I have AT&T;, and I did not want the $30/month data plan forced with an iPhone purchase.  I am a first time smart phone buyer and looked at them all.  I really liked the e71x, but I am not up for plan renewal and didn't want to pay over $200.  I also didn't want a phone with a lot of crap-ware on it, and I liked some of the feature that AT&T; took out of the e71 (like the Internet Radio, modes for home and work, etc)  Looking at the e63, it's a great value.  A little bigger than the e71, but it has the same features and they all work!  The 3G is great, call quality is crystal clear, email downloads are fantastic.  I would recommend this phone.
Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Full U.S. Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)I just got this phone a week ago 07/01/2009.  All prior reviews were right on the money.  This phone is truly a quality product.  I just want to comment on 2 cool features and its practical application that no one yet has mentioned as follows:1. All songs and/or any other sound bite you upload to the phone or micro SD card (including the ones you recorded using the phone's recorder) can be used as ring tones - FREE OF CHARGE.  My sons tell me they have to buy ring tones for their iPhones at $1 each song and a buck more to crop a 30-second ring tone out of the entire song.2. You know how these big companies record conversations between customer service agents and customers for "training and quality assurance purposes", and days later could not refer back to a playback of the recorded conversation to settle an issue/dispute ... well, with my trusty Nokia E63-2, I can now use its recorder to record all customer service phone interactions I will have.  And I will let them know it "to ensure you satisfy my needs as your customer and get assurance that you will do whatever we agree on to make things right".  So now, if these companies can't produce their recordings for whatever reason, I'd just play mine for their listening pleasure.I gave this phone a 5-star rating as it met, and even exceeded, all the functional requirements I predefined as part of my smart phone selection process.I'm also happy with the usual professional order processing and prompt hand-over of the package to the courier administered by Amazon.com.I wish I could say the same thing about UPS as far as this delivery is concerned.  While the UPS driver did deliver the package on time (2-day shipping/"2nd Day Air"), I found the package inside my backyard right beside our locked 6-foot metal sheet gate and hollow block fencing alongside the alley.  This begs the question on how the package got over the 6-foot gate and fencing.  I can't help but think the cellphone (with all the sensitive electronics in it) that I bought just got dropped from 6 feet in the air onto the concrete floor.I just wished the UPS delivery person who walked 15+ paces from the curb to my rear gate took a short-cut to my front door (which is just 10 steps from the curb) where I would have received and signed for the package, and thanked him for the prompt yet careful handling and delivery of my package.Nevertheless, the phone seems to be working fine having tested most of its features.  I hope I don't need to return it because of any future malfunction or internal damage that's plausible considering the way it was handled/delivered.Amazon.com is my preferred online source for quality products.  I hope it also tracks performance and complaints about its designated couriers to ensure end-to-end customer satisfaction.
Just got it a few days ago. Love it.Some points I'd like to talk about*A smart phone for 150 without a contract? Unbelievable.If you install the Skyfire browser, the phone will run ANY website. It'll run flash, AJAX, java.*The lack of 3G on t-mobile is a bummer but Edge works fine for my needs. Nokia has fantastic apps like "internet radio" and "here and now", which tells you the hourly forecast and movies and events nearby your exact location.*The lack of GPS sucks but it does include Nokia Maps so you can look up mapquest directions directly on your phone without internet.*The internet plans for this phone is very reasonable, much lower than the crackberry, sidekick or iphone plans. This unit offers FREE push e-mail which is exactly like blackberry phones except...FREE.*Mobbler works on this phone and is very close to Pandora Radio.*This phone plays flash very well. So, youtube, hulu, etc etc runs pretty smoothly. It doesn't always play perfectly (without a little skipping) but works well.* Features it gained vs the Nokia e71: A flashlight (the led for the camera) button, which comes on by pressing spacebar on the phone, a backslash button, 3.5 mm jack for music(the gym).*Features it lost vs the Nokia e71: NO side buttons for volume control, 0.1 inches thicker, no GPS, no HSDPA, no case.In closing, unless you need GPS, HSDPA, or a fake leather case, GET THIS PHONE.
This is my first smartphone, and I can't beleive I waited this long to migrate from my old Razor. Pairing an unlocked smartphone with the ATT family data plan keeps the montly cost down.Pros: Call quality, Wi-Fi (works great at home and office), Keyboard, email set-up, VPN/intranet access, bluetooth, FM radio, Real Player, Maps, Opera browser (downloaded app), huge battery.Cons: no external button to quickly silence the ringer, hard to unlock while driving (2 key sequence), only 6 application Icons on main screen, screen a bit small.Overall: Very happy with the phone. I recommend it to anyone looking for a cost effective smartphone.
i have an iphone, an HTC hero from sprint, and I recently got this phone. I initially bought the iPhone to use as my work phone since my company uses AT&T.; I loved the iPhone as a gadget since I am always an apple fan. However, the device has lots of issues from a business user's perspective. My main complain was the flimsy alarms for meetings. There is no way you can customize the alert tones in that phone. HTC hero is a very new product that I use for my personal use from Sprint. I like the device but the bluetooth sucks on this device. I paired it with my car's hands free connection, and the hero stopped connecting to the car from the next use. I think Sprint needs a major bug fix on the bluetooth area of this device. With all said, the e63 keeps making me happy. i love the utility of this device. I do not have a data plan since my company uses text messages for paging since it is cheaper than blackberry service. This has not been an issue since I have wifi on this phone. The bluetooth stereo works seamlessly with my car. the call and signal quality is perfect. I can synch the phone with both my outlook at work and my music on iTunes on an iMac at home. it even transfers the new podcasts. I have a 2 GB card in this phone. This is more than enough for my use as I only have a hundred or so songs that i listen to. I listen to a lot of financial and news podcasts. To make things more sweeter, the music transfer is possible over bluetooth. Apple does not allow that even on their own iPhone from a mac. Don't get me wrong, I love the macs, but I think Apple does not know how to make a perfect phone yet. They still need to learn a lot from an experienced phone maker like Nokia. My specific unit was manufactured in Finland. Has an excellent workmanship on the product. The keys are smooth. Much better than the virtual keyboard that iPhone or the hero sports. The device has a substantial feeling as not too light and not too bulky.  Did I mention the FM radio and the nice web browser? well, buy one and enjoy if you are a serious business user who is not too crazy about a berry.
This phone does everything that it says it will do.  It works great and has a wonderful battery life that lets me use it the entire day and still have a little bit of juice left.  I really like that I don't have to have a data plan to be able to use the internet and other features that would require me paying a large monthly fee.  The wi-fi works great and has amazing speeds.  Top class phone.
I absolutely adore this phone. I think for under $[...]there is not a single unlocked handset that would match with the Nokia E63's value. And at [..], the deal just got sweeter. If you disagree and has a better mobile phone in mind, feel free to comment and rebuke! :)Do not be fooled by the pictures and videos. They cannot do this phone justice. The camera adds 5 pounds to the phone! ;p But the phone feels actually very compact in my hands, with a very nice grip because of the rubbery back. It feels quite sturdy in spite of the plastic construction.The Ultramarine Blue is SEXY. It is very subtle and looks almost onyx at a certain angle, while at other angles it is actually shiny and stylish (thanks to the large 2.4' screen and the metal direction pad).The important thing is, if you think this phone may be too bulky for you, you need to actually see it and feel it in your hands to feel its efficient design.Good:- uber large battery (I can go on about 4 days without charging, and that is with about everyday use of 30 text, an hour of music playing, web browsing, youtube, email, few calls etc)- Functionality - does everything: mp3 (3.5mm standard jack), video, email, bluetooth, etc.- Expandability - S60 V3 FP2 is very nice and is supported by a large pool of freeware (much much more than iphone apps)- Full QWERTY - took me a few days of texting to get used to, but the Predictive learns very quickly, and if I hit one or two wrong letters, it'll automatically correct me and give me a list of what it thinks is what I intended to type.- Solid construction - feels like it will last for a long time- Keys feel very good and easy to press- Business ready - very good multi-email account management/sync, contacts, PIM,etc- Wi-Fi is very fast and handy. I can stream youtube videos all day- Fast processor, multitasking is much faster than Windows Mobile devices---------------------------Now you need to be realistic and know that when you buy a unlocked phone for $150, you aren't gonna get a 8MP camera, or 3G, or GPS, or touchscreen (I sold my 5800 for this cuz I hate touchscreen). But those are all that you are missing from a power house like the N96, and the features on this phone rivals or even beat some of the more expensive unlocked phones out there.One thing I love about this phone is that I can just hold space key, and the camera flash will light up as a flash light! That's the kind of usability I am talking about.If you need an unlocked phone, this is a no brainer. You got the most widely used and customizable smart-phone platform out there (Symbian S60), you got a nice full QWERTY for text-maniacs, a full-featured music player with 3.5mm jack, camera with flash and self-portrait, bluetooth, Wi-Fi. I cannot think of another sub-$200 phone with such complete feature set. Nokia is the best!
This E63 is good if you do not want to be locked into another 2 year contract with a phone company. The phone works pretty good for the price I got from purchasing from amazon, I am suppose to be getting a $50 rebate from Nokia so the purchase at the time was a decent value for a smart phone. (it has been 8 weeks and I have not seen the rebate yet so I may change my opinion on value :-)I do like my old Blackberry phone better for some of their features but for the price, this Nokia E63 does the job. Be sure to order the CA101 cable from amazon if you decide to purchase, Nokia in their dumb wisdom do not include this "must have" cable with the packaging.
I have been using this cell phone for the past couple of days and I have to say that I am really impressed!  Previously I owned an SE P1i --> Nokia N82 --> E63.  I chose the e63 because I am a heavy texter and the n82 T9 just wasn't cutting it.  I looked at the e71 but since I am on t-mobile and already have an external gps I opted against it (although I still think it is a much nicer phone!).Anyway, having used 2 different symbian s60 devices I can say that the e63 is much improved over the n82 in many ways.  For starters everything on the e63 just seems snappier.  For some reason even though the n82 has a faster processor it is much slower.Secondly the build quality on the E-series is so much better than the N series.  I have seen several E series and N series phones and the E series always feels much more solid.  The n82 which was around $300 when I bought it had such poor build quality I almost returned it.  Although this may not matter...my E63 was built in finland while my n82 was built in china.  The keyboard on the E63 is good but not great.The keyboard on the p1i (which is the best I have ever used on a candy bar) is light years ahead of the E63 but then again i think that the E63 is light years ahead of the palm treo so take it as you will.  The thing that I don't like about the E63 keyboard is that it is a little "soft".  i like my keys nice and clicky so that I know when I've pressed them.Software on the E63 is really solid.  Everything "just works".  The menu system on all symbian systems is a little confusing though and will take a while to get used to.  Its a little annoying to have to break out the instruction manual to look up something but I'll live with it.All in all this is a ridiculous deal for a phone that costs less than many carrier subsidized phones.  If you are looking for a smartphone and don't need 3g or gps I think it would be hard to find a better phone than the e63.  Really.  It is very good.
i am on tmobile and had a dash for about 2 and a half years before the e63.  i did not want to go on contract for 2 more years but wanted to keep my relatively low priced voice and data plan.  i strongly considered the bb 8900, but i think a d pad is more reliable than a trackball. as for the 3g dash or other wm phone, i am tired of waiting for windows mobile to improve.  i do not care about 3g since i need a phone primarily for business usage and want battery endurance for mostly pda and call functions.i have had the e63 for several weeks and am very happy with this phone. compared to the dash, the e63 runs faster, nicer screen, better reception for both voice and data.since my internet provider does not work with the nokia messaging service, i set up a gmail account for the nokia service to forward my pop email accounts.bluetooth connectivity works well.for me, multimedia functions are lagniape and work fine.  youtube (latest update), preloaded internet radio and mp3 look and sound surprisingly well with my headphones or an audio cable to my car's speakers.  mundu provides additional internet radio. i also recommend google maps, opera mini, skyfire, and neoreader (someday the us will use this more).modem/tethering gets 3x faster throughput than the dash, better than dsl.reception/bars/sound quality on both ends are much better than the dash.  tmobile does not have the best coverage, and black hole areas are still black holes--my job takes me to many rural areas.  however, the e63 has better reception overall than the dash--the black holes are a little smaller.volume could be a little louder but is adequate.  speakerphone is a little weak, but i do not really use this function.it did take me a while to learn the menus; but after a few weeks, i navigate pretty quickly.  after a learning curve, i am much happier with the e63 than the dash.
paid $150 after the rebate.  great phone for the price.  comes with Facebook app, myspace app, and ability to view youtube app.  It was easy to set up having your emails from gmail and yahoo forwarded to the phone.  dropped it a couple of times already and still working fine.  when wi-fi is available i surf the net that way and the phone is very fast. disappointed T-mobile does not offer this phone or one like it, not a big fan of blackberry.  was in Ecuador and i used a local chip with this phone and it worked fine.
The product page explains it, I mean there's really not much more to say about it. Although one feature I didn't pay attention to, the flashlight (push the spacebar button for a second while unlocked, or hold it down when it's locked) is really bright. It's actually the flash for the camera too.
FAST WIFI, I USED IN MEXICO IN MOVISTAR AND WORKS FINE, WITH MY CLARION AUTOESTERO YOU CAN STREAM MUSIC, MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS WITH NO WIRES (BLUETOOTH).
I specially like the key board size of the phone. I have big thumbs and I do not get well with touch screen, and that's the reason i tried to find a full key board phone.Good quality phone with reasonable price. You get what you paid for.
Nokia E63First some background.I had a BlackBerry Pearl (8100) before and it worked pretty well, but I grew tired of not having a full keyboard. The Bold is a good phone but a but pricey for me, so I hunted around for an alternative.The Good -This phone is quite responsive, comes with decent built in memory, (110MB) I added a 1GB card to it. It takes decent pics but does not compare to a real camera or a camera phone. Plays most music and video formats but does not handle WMV. Email is a snap to set up, supports hotmail, gmail and yahoo mail with out you having to know anything other than your email address, will do IMAP pretty well too.Wireless LAN or HotSpot is easy to use, and I got some good free apps for it as well, including putty, so I can ssh into my servers when needed.The Not So Good -There are two ways to get your email, using the built in email client or you can download an application called "Nokia Messaging" The build in client is simple and straightforward, as is the Nokia messaging, I have one gripe with the Nokia messaging however, which is that it doesn't stop playing the email alert tone when tap a key. This can be a real pain in meetings, so I basically use the built in email client exclusively now.Lack of MSN /Yahoo / chat support is a pain, but apparently support in a new version of the phone's Operating System.Why oh why didn't they include a USB cable in the box???End result -  Good business phone at a good price. Buy it.
First off, I love Nokia...with that being said I love this phone and this is my first phone that has a qwerty keypad.  I switch phones at least 2 or 3 times a year and I think I finally found one that I can be 100% happy with.  At first I didn't think I could dial numbers like 1-800-GOFEDEX or any number with letters in them but I finally figured out how.  In case you're wondering here is how:Once you have typed the numbers, press the function key once. Pressing the function key takes you out of the numerical mode and into ABC mode. You then press the shift key twice to enter the **ALL CAPS** mode and then continue typing the letters.-Type 1 800-Press the function key once at the lower left corner of the qwerty.-Press the shift key twice and look at the upper right hand corner of the screen to verify the ALL CAPS status.-Type the remaining letters for GOFEDEX.****************************The battery life seems to last forever,  The response time is very quick, and I like the music player. The picture quality is excellent and so are the videos.  The videos could be a little more crisp but for the most part its great.  It has a nice loud speaker phone and the call quality is great.  Very easy to use!  And how can you beat the price??  I got it for $[...] after a $[...] mail in rebate.  Love it!!!!  Nokia has yet to let me down.
I bought this phone to replace an older Blackberry 8700, and it has been a very pleasant surprise.Physically the phone is light, thinnish, and feels good in the hand. The back is easy to open/close, and the build quality is high. Feels solid in the hand. I rather like the lack of external buttons and sliders. Once I got used to how to adjust the volume, left/right on the trackpad, I don't even think about it any more.Starting at the top, the screen is very good to excellent, with the only drawback being lessened readability in bright sunlight. Colors vivid, text crisp (especially important for my old eyes). Keyboard very functional, the smallish rounded-top keys work well with my fat fingers. It's not a Blackberry keyboard though. My main complaint with the keyboard is that the 'function' key in the lower left is an odd shape due to the rounded shape of the lower left side of the phone. I sometimes hit it rather than SHIFT, and vice versa. But a very minor complaint.  Speaker very robust and clear, call quality is great, and speakerphone very loud. Battery life is very good for a 3G phone, and I get 2 - 2 1/2 days of use easily, but in practice leave the phone tethered to a charger at night. I do dislike the fact that even this newish phone uses a proprietary charging and sync cable, and the power cannot be used to sync. I've had quite a few Nokia phones over the years (and even lived in Finland for about five years), so I have a nice museum of discarded chargers and sync cables. Why not use mini-USB or micro-USB?3G service (North American 3G only on this E63-2 model) is excellent here in New Mexico, very seldom do I fall back to EDGE or GSM. Good call quality, very few dropped calls.Software. Since I bought the phone unlocked (SIM-free), not a lot of crapware/bloatware was present. Email was a breeze to set up, but I will say that BB email is far superior.  Syncing to my desktops and laptops is a no-brainer using Bluetooth. I'm primarily a Mac user, so I use iSync with a Nokia add-on to sync calendar and address book. Software updates are not over-the-air (OTA) for this model, so I bought yet another nokia cable to update the firmware/os. And, of course the nokia update is/was windows-only, so I did the update from a netbook running windows7.  Media software is pretty good, but it's not an iPhone.On-going costs: I bought the phone unlocked, and use AT&T; GoPhone PAYG (pay as you go) service, plus a data plan. $100 voice service is valid for a year (and can be topped-off/extended and the amount rolls-over), and the $19.99 for 100MB monthly data plan 'rolls over' if extended within the 30 days. A secret:  Buy 100 MB initially, and then extend it with the $4.99 1MB plan if you're not using it all. This continues the roll-over process. AT&T; only allows 300MB in reserve, so I did a couple months of $19.99 to get the MB up, and now add $4.99 monthly. Point of this: the Nokia email client is very data efficient, I can't use the entire amount of data on the plan, even when I try. Adding light browsing a few times a day (facebook, googling, etc;) is hardly noticeable. I don't do massive music downloads or apps downloads, so, your mileage may vary depending on your usage. I add videos and/or music from my computer directly to the phone via micro-SD card. Anyway ...All in all, for the price (around $225 at the time), this is a great deal! An excellent, solidly-built phone, a superior screen and keyboard, trackpad (rather than trackball), and, great call reception and quality - this is, after all, a mobile phone.  I like this phone so much, in fact, that I bought a second for international travel, the E63-1 with 3G for 'the rest of the world.'
Nokia can sometimes be like Toyota - they build a model, then they improve on it. This is the case with the E63 as a successor to the E71 and E61. Cheaper and better. Period.There are a number of arguments for this - no metal case (plastic, here. But hard plastic...); camera isn't something to write home about - but then neither is the previous one.Anyway - who asked for a high-end camera in an efficient business phone? Someone who from Enron that moved to AIG? Gimme a break.Getting back to my starting point - the E61 is a great phone (it still works, after three years, three deep dives & umpteen kocks and drops) which the E71 improved upon - the improvement being that you can no longer buy the E61 but the E71 gave you the same capabilities in a better-looking package.And this is where I get to why I actually like the E63 - it is like the E61 even though it don't got the E71 nifty metal frame, and it's much cheaper, and it still has a great battery life. And because I can't get my hands on another E61 any more. Shame on Nokia.I probaly do not need to make the point but I will - all of the above phones give you document, spreadsheet and .pdf capability. I wrote and sent documents on letterhead from under the beach umbrella on all. I hated my phone bill later (and my lack of patience to use the laptop on a wi-fi hotel link). Then again - all of these Nokias have wi-fi capability - which is a lot more than you can say about a lot more of the competition. And that makes the guilty feeling all the worse.I must pay (lip) service to the competition:1. Aplle i-phone has no battery life which you can't replace and is not a business phone. Please - it's a phun phone.2. Blackberry will give you all of the above, excepting battery life like the e61 or the e63 (Nokia, can I get the e61 battery in an e63 phone? Pretty please?)3. Sony-Ericsson I will not badmouth because I never could get used to using them.If you must have a Nokia that will do all of the above while fitting where it must - this is the phone for you.Finally - the e61 brought back the good old times of analogue digital phones from the early '90s: "Is that a Nokia in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"
I got this phone because my wife had problems texting with her blackbeary perl. It was a serprise. She wasent sure. But after a few days. She loves it now. The price for a unlocked smart phone like this, well I think you just can't beat it. The only problem is my  kids want to replace there phones with E-63s.
I have now had this phone for about 4 months. I've been reading through the reviews where people have problems with the battery heating up and the phones not charging, but I have never experienced this. The internet browser works very well, the phone supports PDF files, you can create microsoft office documents...etc. Ovi files also works well with this phone so its easy to transfer files between your phone and a computer.The music player is decent, I don't really use it as a primary mp3 player,but as long as you have a decent pair of headphones its fine. Call volumes are also better than any phone I've ever owned.The only problems I've had are when texting/emailing the response is a little slow, but its not really much of a problem. Also be sure to buy a micro-USB cable because there isn't one in the box.
I've been looking for a new cell phone for over two years but couldn't find anything that I liked.  I love this phone.  It's extremely easy to use and has everything that I was looking for in a new phone.
Pros:Good CameraHot-Swappable microSD card slotKeyboard very responsive and has great tactile feedbackHighly CustomizableGreat Signal Strength, where other phones get 0-1 bars this gets at least 2Fantastic Battery life even under heavy useTough Case, not a cheap feel at allThousands of available apps that meet almost every needEasy to set up wifi but still has the advanced settings for more complicated set upsVery internet friendly, loads pages quickly and accurately3.5mm headset jack makes it easy to use any headphones with this and the phone knows what type of headphones you're using so it sets up most settings automaticallyKeyboard design is better laid out than e71Can use $15 a month unlimited data plan with at&t; getting this phone unlockedCrystal clear call qualityCons:No Volume rocker, definitely missed but not neededProcessor power leaves you wanting just a bit moreEarpiece Volume is a bit lower than expected but adequate for everyday use.Range of the wifi locater is greater than the range that the wifi can actually connect to so it leaves you unable to connect to wifi you can "see"No GPS, but it will use the cell phone towers to approximate where you are within 300 feet, so Google Maps and other map applications will still know generally where you are.Overall you can't beat the quality you get for the price you pay. If you're struggling between this phone and the e71, e71x, or even e72, the features that they off are identical except for a few perks. Really think about what you're going to use this phone for and you'll find that this phone will usually meet all of your needs.
I had a Blackberry Pearl, but I hated the keyboard and the Blackberry predictive text correction software drove me up the wall. I wanted a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard. I went to ATT and looked at the E71, but I did not want all the ATT crapware. After doing a lot of research, I thought the E63 would fit the bill for me and would not include all the ATT fluff. I was right.I really like this phone a lot. I'm able to use my iTunes music as ringtones, which is nice. Bluetooth, WiFi, email work pretty well. I have NO data plan, so this phone uses WiFi only to do email and that works fine for me. I'm also able to sync with my Mac after downloading the iSync plug-in and software from Nokia's website. I do this via Bluetooth, so I haven't needed the data cable.The only 2 cons I've found so far, is that I can not get Mail for Exchange to work with our Exchange server here at work. So I have to just use IMAP on our Exchange server to connect to mail. Not sure this is Nokia's fault, but their documentation does leave a lot to be desired.And other thing I wish it would do is just automatically connect to the closest defined wireless access point. It ALWAYS asks which access point to use, instead of just automatically connecting to it. Nokia should see how the iPhone does this and make their software work like that.Otherwise, I'm a happy camper and would recommend the Nokia E63 to anyone.
I've had the phone for less than a week. So far it's been great. I would recommend buying the data cable with the phone. I couldn't find a way to sync my contacts from outlook without it.
Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Full U.S. Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)My service provider: T-mobileMy service package: Voice (No data service)My application: personal useIf you are considering buying a smart phone and you don't want to pay a whole lot of money I would say BUY THIS PHONE NOW. This phone is the lil brother of the Nokia E71x and I would say buy the E63 and save your money. I bought this phone on 6/30/09 and it was sent to me 2 days later. I bought the phone for [..] and received a $[...] rebate, so I paid [...] for the phone. The phone is easy to setup and and the user interface and not hard to navigate once you get used to it. There phone is very much customizable so you can fit it just how you like it.Pros:-THE PHONE CAN READ TEXT MESSAGES, ALOUD!-QWERTY keyboard is large enough so you don't accidentally hit the wrong keys.-Shortcut buttons can be setup however you would like.-As always nokias are sturdy as a brick so you don't have to worry about this thing breaking in one drop, however I would still recommend buying a case for it though.-THERE IS A WAY TO SET THIS UP TO SYNC WITH MICROSOFT OUTLOOK 2007! I was able to sync it with my calendar as well as my email that is used through my school(baylor).-Can connect to any wi-fi signal as long as it is public or you can get the data service from your provider.-You do not have to pay for a data package because you can set the phone us to use various wi-fi signals wherever you are.-There are a whole bunch of apps that you can add to your phone:[...]Cons:-The phone only has a limited amount of memory so you will have to buy a microSD card but I bought an 8GB microSD [...] with an adapter for only $[...], and it works well.- There is no high speed data transfer for this phone, but like I said if you connect to a fast enough wireless signal this should not be a problem.-If you have AT&T; you can use 3G if you have tmobile you will have to use 2G but it still is fast enough.
On Receiving this phone write a review, the phone is much more than i expected, before i got it i want to swap for a blackberry but as soon as it came into my hands i killed the idea especially  because it has all the features of a berry - full key, wifi, small and compact, stylish and totally irresistable.  I would go as far to say buy this phone and forget about any blackberry they only have name nokia E63-2 can be compared to blackberry and their features, the wifi is off the hook i just turned on my router and that was it. For $200 i would gladly buy this baby over a blackberry again.
I will qualify this at the beginning by saying that my first pick for a mobile phone would be the iPhone, but that's unfair since the iPhone is hardly just a phone. But at the moment the ATT service for the iPhone is simply out of my budget and I still have a few months left on my T-Mobile account. I went searching for a quality phone that had a full keyboard since I text a lot, and the quality and versatility, the ability to sync with my Mac OS. After searching at the other options (blackberry, palm, samsung, lg) there was simply no comparison for the price, and in fact I after receiving the phone and using if for almost a month, I am really pleased with it. But since I am not going to write a novel here on the virtues and vices of this phone (or any other 'thing-product' whatsoever - ain't that just losing sight of priorities a bit?), I am making this effort just for those in similar conundrums (their phone broke, lost, etc. and need to buy a new one, but don't want to spend $400 or up)Pros: Ergonomically, the phone seems a perfect balance of size and weight. In fact in has a nice weight to it that lends it a solidity, without being too heavy. It's not clunky like the blackberries and is more elegant. (the keyboard is slightly small, but makes sense to keep the width nice, and it's manageable (probably more so for female hands). The battery is quite large and gives it a long operational time. I seem to go at least 4 days without charging (if I don't connect with wi-fi, that certainly uses more power). As for going online, the wi-fi and browser work really well - certainly it's not for the most functional online experience, but great for checking some news, sites, and works especially smoothly if it's a mobile web configured site. The most useful aspect of the wi-fi is VoIP, that is, making calls via the internet - I cannot boast of this more highly. I used it almost right away and it works superbly - this is a big, big advantage if one doesn't want to use their account minutes (it comes configured with Gizmo - where you can purchase credit - but if you download Nimbuzz, you can add you're Skype account (and about a gazzillion more (chat accounts, yahoo, msn - it coordinates all these communication accounts under one account, and works well so far!). The Calander, Contact syncing works great with my Mac - and it's all bluetooth wireless.Con: Nokia doesn't have the app variety of the iPhone (but that is not really so much as a complaint as I didn't expect it would!) The interface is ok, but some steps seem to be redundant and could be tweaked better (like when wanting to make a call, one has to keep navigating through a few steps. Nokia still has not added this phone to it's Ovi suite (which coordinates your cell phone with your computer and online account to make it more seamless, but they say they will) ; also waiting for their Ovi suite to work with the Mac OS (once again, they say it will happen soon).  Could go on, but must have a life - - I highly recommend this phone as an affordable intermediary between iPhone and the mundane!
I have been using the Nokia E63 for several weeks now and have been thrilled with it.  In my limited experience with friend's IPhones I found the touchscreen difficult to accurately type on, but I am happy to state that this is an excellent keyboard with good ergonomics and tactile support.  I have found the phone easy to set up and install apps on.  The battery life is incredible, and having the wi-fi has proved very valuable as I have no intention of investing in a expensive data plan.  The web browser and email client are both very good under wi-fi conditions, and data transfer is very good as well.Negatives:  The camera is a big disappointment after my Sony Ericsson W810i.  Images are just generally poor.  The Nokia Ovi app store is still a long way off.These complaints aside, I like the phone so much that I have ordered the Ruby Red version for my wife.  I have found the free Skyfire app helpful, Mobipocket, Google Maps, DivX player, and Olive Tree Bible software are all good apps for this phone.  I did a lot of research over several days before purchasing and found that the Nokia E63 represented the highest value/quality ratio available in a smartphone.  Now that I have it, I have not been disappointed.
This phone is wonderful!!!!The audio quility is crisp and clear.The phone is easy to use and, it is sleek, light and sporty. It is also hardy and for someone like me who travels a great deal, it simplifies life.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm glad I bought this phone!!!!!!
There are major issues when syncing Contacts with Outlook.  When Outlook data is transferred to the Nokia, a great deal of the data shows up in off-the-wall places (and some doesn't show up at all).  I've found no way to do an initial field mapping to assure data populates in the correct fields when doing a sync.  User Manual is sketchy.If entering phone numbers directly in to the phone, it seems that there is no way to separate the 10-digit string using either hyphens or parantheses.  Not a huge problem, but annoying.
I've had this phone for two weeks now and after a minor learning curve with Nokia's Symbian operating system, I must say I'm very impressed. For $200 and no contract, this is an excellent deal.First off, it looks gorgeous (I have the ultramarine blue) and feels great in the hand with the slightly rubbery plastic case. The display, though smallish, is beautiful and while it's not a touchscreen, it's very easy to move around the various menus with the D-pad.Connectivity is great and the phone always offers different ways of getting on-line. Wi-fi, T-Zones (I use T-Mobile) and Edge all work seamlessly. The phone, in most applications, will ask how you want to connect. The phone supports G3 on ATT's network, but not on T-Mobiles.All the usual functionality is there: great email support, various messaging protocols, calendar, nice media player, decent camera, Bluetooth, App Store, Google Maps (no satellite GPS, just cell tower triangulation), very nice web browser, movie player and a ton of stuff I haven't figured out yet.I highly recommend this phone. If you already have ATT or T-Mobile service, it's a no-brainer in the unlocked smartphone realm.
This is my first smartphone and loving it since it was delivered.  It's very intuitive to use and has a good long battery life.  Excellent value for money for an compact, unlocked, stylish smartphone.
I love the phone. Let's start with that. I don't have much more to add to anyone else's review. Except - while I was futzing around with the phone I discovered it had the Tiger Woods EA golf game. Now, I am pretty technically adept but I had no idea it even came with the phone as you certainly can't find it off any menu. [...]From there I was trying to customize the Short Press Messaging button and as I scrolled through the list of choices (options/change) one of the many many options was this game.If you find any other cool widgets, please post them here.Fore!
I like so much this phone!! The WI-FI and other features are excelents!! Amazon is a good seller the product come to me on time!
I bought this one after my wife had already used Nokia E71 for good 6 months. I was planning to buy the same one for my self when I saw this deal and after reading reviews and going through its specs at various websites, ordered it. Needless to say I was not disappointed. It is a great business phone. My emails work like magic and I do not have to bother connecting to internet everytime I need to check mail. The keys are better than the ones on E71. It has the looks as well as the functionality of E71 but costs much less. Highly recommended. The best upgrade for any basic phone user. CHEERS!!
I am very happy with this device. Works perfectly, the keyboard is very good. The software is very easy to use, and the programs run very fast. The applications are very good (quick office, calendar, contacts) and you can sync your devcice with google (address book, calendar) and read your e-mail.I recommend nokia E63.
Following is my experiece with E63. I know specs very well before deciding to purchase, so i know what i m going to get in this price.First of all I wanted E71 and waited for few months but price did not dropped as expected. Then i checked my usage and found that i m not at all using 3G as most of the place i have wifi available. GPS i already have in CAR. So why to shell 140+ buck over just 2 fetaurs...which i m not goig to use. So this is totally my own requirement based decision. Now more regarding pros and cons:- Phone is blesing fast(same as E71) No compromise in speed even cheapear then E71.- As whole world know 3.2MP in E71 or 2MP E63 both are crappy. As most of the time business ppls don't mind this.- Productivity softwares are limited, but who cares, on Symbian everything available.- wifi and bluetooth works greate, without any glitch.- Sound quality is more then good enough. But don't compare it with any music/walkman series phone... as this phone's usage is different.- Display is crystal clear. In full sunlight also i can read even smallest character without efforts.- Keypad: initially i thought it's very small keys...but in just 5 minutes i can type very fast without much mistakes. It's really good one.- U can use your own choice of headphone. One came with bundle is just formality in package.- Nokia missed a USB cable. I am sure it will not cost them 3 to 5 bucks to give with bundle. Anyways i ordered from Amazon in just 2.5 $ + around 3 $ shipping :) instead of 29.5 $ on Nokia site.- Next most important thing is fancy Colors. All E series should be available in minimum Black or Dark grey colors. I opted for Blue one :(.- Browser requires some more improvements. Web pages without mobile specific version some time not displayed properly. Speed is good enough.- Build quality is rock solid. No voice of lose plastics. Even you don;t feel it's made up from plastic.Again selection of buying this one is just my intended usage based. Also i specifically does not want a touch screen due to i never take care of this gadgets. One more biased thing is that i have never used phone other then Nokia. I can't leave without nokia in my pocket.Hope this will help you and thanks Amazon for creating such trusted  & reliable market place, which provides merchandises at rock bottom prices.
It's a good phone for the price and all the features you can have with this phone. Although there are couple of issues I find with this phone - I always seem to get network connection error when I dial a number when I am inside a building. I am on AT & T service and my earlier phone (Nokia 6620) never had this issue. Also another issue I see when I dial a number, it happens numerous times, the dialed number never goes thru and I end up dialing the same number 2 or 3 times to get thru.
This is an economy and powerful 3G phone even it doesn't supply the best 3G functions comparing with new models (E71, E72), we actually don't need that many functions, most of cases we need a phone with reasonable price and reliable functions, this is the one better than most of US phones.
I got this as a gift.  Recipient told me: 'Well i tought it was very good. ring tone was loud as i liked. buttons worked so fine, id really advise people who love texting get it. its awesome.'
This is a great cell phone, specially for the Wi Fi connection. I've have always have nokia mobile phones and this is one of the best ones. I didn't want to pay extra money to get internet on my mobile, so this is the best deal!Nokia E63-2 is a little too big, but still I love it! Buying it by Amazon was secure and I received it in Quito, Ecuador sooner than I thought.
a excelent product from Nokia...easy to use, the best battery long life i have never seen.the relation price-benefit is ok.Like a bussines phone, have a good performance.The Camera would be better but it's not a problem for me.important... this phone not have a external VolumeControl and sommetimes it could be necessaryResumen.. is a very good phonegood signalgood battery
The Nokia E63 is one of my best phones that I ever owned. Everything about this phone is just perfect, starting from the price to the performance. Anyone interested in buying this phone I have nothing to say, but just go right ahead.
Ok... I was fully satisfied with my newly purchased Nokia E-63. Although I wished it could come with a Memory stick and a data cable. Overall the phone works just fine, and was all new.
I bought this Nokia for my husband as a birthday gift, his old Nokia was damaged.  He totally loves it, can hold all his contacts, the camera takes clean and clear pictures, his ability to use the internet and even access hotmail is a plus.  I would say that this Nokia is a great replica for a blackberry
I actually bought this phone for my brother that travels abroad and has international service on his plan. Th phone worked right of the batch. I also like all the email capabilities.
I received my phone on time in excellent condition. The box contained everything expected, and the phone was unlocked, as you said in the promotion. Good service and very good product!But after three months of use my phone lost two keys (Chr,Ctrl)on the keyboard .. which I had to change again and it lost keys again, this time the center key, the key on / off and "p". Nokia should think about improving the layout of the keyboard keys to ensure a durable and resistant to the frequent use should have this type of equipment.
This product has been great so far.  It has crashed only twice in the two months that I've had it so far.  Navigation is a bit annoying with the smaller screen but this only happens when the site does not have a mobile version.  I fell about from a 1.5 feet to the ground one day and it affected the sound on the touchpad a little but no further damages have been noted.  The keyboard has been my greatest liking of this product. Dislike the fact that the radio only works with headphones as I have wanted to put it on loudspeakers because it has great reception quality.All in all a good device.
This is a very good phone at a reasonable price.I have not had any problems with it so far and it has all the features that i want in a phone. I would definitely recommend it. You can also use it with any GSM service provider such as T-mobile or AT&T.;
It's a great phone for the price, and all the features you can have with this phone. The only issue for this phone that can make video call is that Nokia should made it with a front cam.I don't understand why make a phone with video call without front camera. In this phone you have to use de back camera for the video call. But taking that out, this is a super phone if you don want to spend much money for a 3G phone.
Its working fine and i do not have any major complaints on it.Features I like :Wi-FiEmail ClientInternet RadioKey Board DesignMusic Player, Camera and flash lightYou TubeThin designDo not like:No volume controls on the sideInternet Radio volume control works with Fn+Up Arrowonce in a while hangsUSB cable was not supplied
I have had this phone for 6 months and I am very happy with this Nokia. The camera is nothing to write home about, but it is adequate for my uses. The IMAP and Exchange syncing is very smooth. I am on at&t; here and 3g service is spotty, but when I travel the e63 manages to keep me conected in some very precarious locations. I strongly recommend this device especially for it's tethering capabilty.
Purchased the phone a few weeks ago for my son. Has been very well accepted. All features work great.
this a wonderful phone......strength of nokias and very verasitile....calls sound great and software works almost flawlesly.... Some could be twaeked somewhat like the voice recognition which takes a bit of getting used to... However a overall great phone and though it lacks some of the extreemities of its bigger brother (e71) both phones are pretty much the exact same
Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)Excellent phone, very complete, ideal for business people, very friendly and easy to handle.
This is a good product.  It took a while to setup with my exchange network, and it also required some effort to get familiar with it.  Once I invested the time in setting it.  It is a good smartphone and after looking at many alternatives this turns out to be a great deal.  I travel allot so the unlocked phone saves me money since I dont have to pay $1.5 dollars per text message when I am traveling.
Timely delivery.  Everything as stated.  Brand new to enjoy hopefully for a long time.
I am just using the phone for couple weeks and so far it's been wonderful. Very easy to use, feels great. The soft plastic body is a great advantage, I don't have to worry about getting scratches or marks on the body. I love the applications it came with. Especially the "facebook" and "youtube" applications are the best. This is my first smart phone and I am thrilled with it.There are couple things however that made me give it a 4 star. First of all I experienced several dropped call since I am using it. It didn't occur at an alarming rate, but happened more often than I experienced with my past 2 phones. I use T-mobile and a rep once told me this is a common thing with unlocked phones for T-mobile. So can't really blame the phone for that.Secondly it is little complicated to download applications or games on the phone through Nokia. I tried couple times and seems like I need to spend more time to figure out the way. I found some demo games on a random gaming site that the phone supported.Overall it is a great phone for the price and conditions (or no conditions). The Wi-fi is great. The camera works perfect if you don't zoom in. I am very happy with it. It is the best first smart phone you can have.
if you need a smartphone, good branded, nice looking but low priced, this is the one.The phone feels great in hand, voice quality is crystal-clear and there are lots of apps available on the internet for this operating system but if you want an super-easy to use phone, you better look for other model. The camera is not too good and it does not support high speed download.Said that, it is a good purchase.
Works cool , no issues to be reportedPros :-Easy to operate , Blazing internet speeds , Speedy processor , customizable home setupcons :-Key pad is flimzy , camera quality not very good , headset jack design is bad
This nokia smarthphone is really outstanding, totally recommend it, it works great, navigation through it is so easy and so accessible, wi-fi is really good and most of all, size is so convenient, its slim, great for any customer!
Lovely product works well with my network. I absolutely love it. Go for it anytime anyday!
Bought this phone for use on Cincinnati Bell's network and it works great.  The phone has many features, and all seem to work great.  The call quality is great, and texting is much easier with the full keyboard.  The wifi works really good.
This phone is great. like all nokia product this phone has a good battery life, work for days great wifi good softwares good signal great price and if you buy it before june 30 you will get 50 dollares in rebat from nokia. my only problem with this phone is that the Symbia os is not supported buy medical softwares producer. I was not able to get medical softwares for my phone and i have to keep using my palm to access a PDR.
I had recently upgraded to the Nokia E71x via AT&T.; Per AT&T;, the $10.00 Media Basic Plan I had from Jump Street was not qualified with the phone and I was required to purchase separate Data & Message plans. Heck NO, said I. I returned the phone and fought for days to have AT&T; reactivate my Media Basic Plan since they canceled it during the activation of the E71x. I then saw the NOKIA E63 advertised at an unbelievable price...yup, I jump on it. Well, the phone was delivered and I am just freaking happy I purchased the E63. This phone is DYNOMITE and awsome as the other reviewer says. This phone came with applications that the guys at AT&T; though was unimportant. Sure there is no GPS included, the cam is 2.0. So what! Big deal. The pictures are reasonably good. Look, I have several digi cameras. There is no love lost for not getting the E71x. In fact, I think i'll wait to get the E72 within the next 18 months or so. I'm sure the price will drop then. For now, E63 rules!
This is a great product, a lot of value for your money. It keeps ups with all of your business tasks and brings you entertainment when needed. Too bad it doesn't have a GPS, but for the price it's OK.This is a great purchase, I recommend it.
Bought the phone around a month ago. So far its been great with minor flaws internet crashes sometimes after it freezes but so far happened twice. Using it with tmobile tzones and has worked great. Apps wise not close to iphone but its still has normal apps. Camera decent quality for the phone. All an all satisfied with the phone.
I love this phone it is easy to use and has great features built in.  The only problem with this phone is the plug you have to remove every time you are going to use the headset.  This is very small and not connected to the phone so myou have to be careful not to lose it.  Otherwise I reccommed this phone highly.
The phone is really good overall.Pros:Love the wi-fi, 3G, e-mailing is a breeze, texting can't be easier and has a solid feel.  Unlocked!!! Zero 24 month contracts...I hate those...Cons:No volume key,no usb cable, no memory card, bad pic resolution, battery life...18 days??? yeah right, more like 1 day tops...I know 3g eats up your battery but some days I don't use it much and I have to plug it at night...Verdict:I know I listed tons of cons, but, overall...great smartphone, great bang for buck...would recommend to buy one...
Had this close to a month now. Works nicely with AT&T; 3G in the US. Once I set it up with google sync, all my contacts came in without any problems. I love the SIP client where I can setup multiple sip accounts. Internet calling works well in wi-fi zones but the audio is kind of choppy using AT&T; 3G. Overall an excellent phone for the price.
Only had my E63-2 a few days and like it very much so far. My first smart phone. So many features to explore. Sound quality is excellent (just don't put you hand over the microphone ;) Very nice size for me, solid feel, like the 3.5mm std headphone jack, enjoying the Internet radio app right now. Have not had trouble with mistyping on keys even they are small, dome shape seems to really help insure proper key presses.The gotcha that any business oriented user should know about. Out-of-the box VPN client only supports ipSec.  PPTP VPN (used by Microsoft's VPN and others...very common) is currently ONLY available via a not for free 3rd party app (SymVPN) I'm using free 14 trial right now to verify it does what I need. So far so good. Nokia should fix this if they want to compete for business users.Wifi (WLAN) appears to work very well, that's big for me because I do not want to pay for data plan, so at the locations I'm at most (home/work) of the time I have full/fast/free net access. Very Sweet!The Symbian S60 OS appears to have a fairly large community of folks willing to develop software for it so I'm looking forward exploring lots of free addition functionality on my new handheld computer...er.. phone.With the big price drop (I waited just long enough!) this was a great deal for me.
this fone  is grr8, it does evrytin it says it does, its easy 2 use an set-up, tha internet is flawless, call quailty is good, good user interface. 2 thumbs up.
The phone has several providers speical settings (AT&T;, TMobile and others) preprogrammed so setup is very easy (texting and internet settings). User can turn off provider internet service and only use WIFI if wanted to save on data plan.  The only negative I have found is that MMS are limited 300kb, but my AT&T; branded phones allow 600kb.
I received my Nokia E-63-2 phne a few weeks ago and it is great. I had an old flip phone before and couldn't wait for the upgraded Nokia. I was disappointed that I had to purchase the connector cable, but so far that is the only disappointment that I have had. It is very easy to use and I love the full keyboard. The calender and the daytimer are great and help keep appointments straight with the alarm. I downloaded several free ring tones from WMMR to personalize it for myself. I haven't had much time to play around and find all of the cool features that can be used but I know that they are in there. Good Job Nokia!
Got this phone over 2 weeks.  I start having reception problems, disconneted in the middle of conversation (eventhough I was staying at the same spot), couldn't hear momentarily, no ring. This phone is a lot worse than Blackjack II.
A new experience after using a first generation phone for over 5 years.  The Nokia E63 has changed the way I use my phone and what I can do on the go
Very easy to use, good product for the price, audio could be better. Shipping was excellent.
It's a great phone.  I just fell out of love with AT&T.;  I have two cases and chargers to go with it.  It's for sell here at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00287XA7S.  Please take a look if you're thinking about buying this phone.
ok well i brought this item as a gift to my cousin and so far they have not complained to me that some is wrong with it and its been a month so far..
it is too easy to navigate all screens. everybody can use it easily. but hasn't got a gps.
The phone was exactly as it was described and it was shipped on time. I am very happy with the product, however I never received my $50 Rebate. I sent off the required information and the appropriate paperwork but it has been well over two months and still no rebate. I am very hesitant to order anything promising a rebate anymore.
this was the best cell  phone and very cheap. if you dont want to pay for the nokia e71
Excelent Phone for the price, the camera isn't have a great quality but it's ok for ramdomly use!
It was my first time but  pleasant experience to buy from Amazon.  Truly professional. For my future shopping, I can depend on Amazon!!!Of course, the phone is great as like other Nokia phones. Buying Nokia is like buying 24 carot gold.
I bought the phone few days ago on Amazon and got it just 9 days after I ordered it. The phone is good and in reasonable price but it has some minor inconveniences, e.g, I can't change the volume when I use internet radio.
Cuando lo recibí, no me imagine lo bueno que ere hasta que lo manejé. posee todas las caracteristicas del E71 ecepto por el GPS y de verdad si necesecitas un telefono con todas las caracteristicas del E71 sin necesitar GPS, este es un buen ejemplar.... Muy Bueno.. Como siempre Nokia es Nokia
The phone seems to be great when the battery has juice.  Problem comes when you actually try charging the phone.  It says charging, but never actually charges the battery.  Told Nokia support this, but they still managed to return it twice NOT FIXED!  Today I sent it off again for the 3rd time.  The support isn't very supportive...  Have to wait 2 weeks each time i send it for repair.  No matter what i tell them or how upset i am, they don't offer any type of consolidation, or speedier postage for all this trouble and my wasted time!  All i can do each time is send it for repair, wait 2 weeks to have it sent back and have it not work all over again.  I decided to just buy a $30 unlocked phone for the time being and simply keep up this charade of theirs at their expense.Sincerely,Not Impressed!
Nice phone to use in work. Very conveniant. I'm not using it as a primary phone I have an iPhone but as a secondary for job thing it's good.
I tried to register my phone on the nokiausa site and also to check if there is a software upgrade for it. When I entered the product code found on the back of my phone I get a message that the code is not found. The IMEI number is correct found in the software and the back of the phone.Have you folks tried this too? If I can't register my phone at nokia then I can't get a warranty on it. Could my phone be a refurb?
I am truly upset with this phone. Like any good buyer I spent countless weeks researching and debating which phone to get. Finally I saw this great deal of a phone on Amazon and was sold instantly. I couldn't wait, and when it came I had high hopes. To my dismay the call quality is poor, very poor, almost non-existent. All the other phone features worked great, except the one that mattered the most, the phone aspect, calling and talking. I hear other people fine, but they say I fade in and out and a lot of the time end up with a bad phone call because of the argument between me and the caller. I am hoping by christmas to get a bluetooth earpiece to help the quality because after that, my only other option is to try and get another phone. In the end, just a disappointment.
as close to a black berry you can get wont bore you with procon if you are moveing up from any nokia some app wont work on this versondid figure out if an app says not compatable  remove card and turn off back on phone then install app this workes most of the time.love the key board and 2 screens while you here at amazion getting this order the ca101 data cable this does not come with it.and youll need to down load nokia p c suit no cd comes with it eather.
This phone has given me more headaches!  I got the phone brand new and it did not charge.  It has never charged.  I have just sent it to be repaired for the 3rd time for the SAME problem that they just never fixed.  So I have had the phone for 2 months now and never even used it.  Because I bought it through Amazon, NOKIA won't just replace it, but rather they keep making me send it back to the same place (PALCO) to "fix" it, even though they have never actually ever fixed the problem.  SO, I have no idea if the phone is a quality product, because I actually have never used it!  Customer service with NOKIA sucks too!  Nokia E63-2 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)
I thought since reading the reviews as I always do and how some compared this model to its more expensive big brother, I would come out ahead and finally get back into the semi high end smart phone arena. I was wrong.From the very beginning it was quirky. I'm not one to pack an electronic device right up and send it back, but within a few weeks I really thought about it and knew I couldnt ever get stuck with this long term...so back it went.Couple things really got on my nerves. First of all the audio was horrible and very low when receiving calls. I was not able to increase the audio to an acceptable level whatsoever. It hadn't occured with my prior phone. I was talking to the same people as before and it was bad with Nokia E63.Another defect was the bluetooth. It would drop out for no reason even using two different headsets. I never had that happen. Its one thing not to make an actual connection when you turn on a second device and expecting the headset and phone to connect, but the E63 would drop out after it was already connected and in time, more often.Lets not forget dropped calls which my present Motorola wouldnt do with my provider. The Nokia E63 was horrible and I had more calls dropped with it than I've ever had in all the years I've used a cellphone.Having been a Nokia I thought it was a great buy, but its a no frills lemon.
this one was birthday gift to my wife. it gets too hot when you are on phone, doesn't matter whether you are holding next to your ear or using bluetooth. the battery dies all of a sudden. this is merely 3 months old and i am giving it up.
This phone is great battery life is the best i have. I give it 4 stars because there is no warranty in the us since it was released in UK. However its great for the money
Hi,When I recieved this phone i was very happy to be the owner of the best value for money phone in the marked. This phone has host of features but has a very serious flaw. The calls get dropped with 'connection error'. In begining I thought this is just 'once in a while' problem due to network issues, but this problem increased with each passing day, until after 2 weeks i decided to return this phone.Maybe this happened only to me.This phone got one star for its battery life.Satish.
I have owned Nokia phones ever since I have owned phones and this is the worst I have seen. I think Nokia is loosing it. It reminds me of companies that become complacent and think they are top of market now and are in vincible - in my opinion this company is going down the tubes (the one behind the comod). Think about it when Apple was coming out with the iPhone (my wife owns it so I know how good it really is) Nokia's CEO (I thought he would know everything - he is the highest paid employee of the company) said apple has no clue what they are getting into. Oh guess what its been 2 years and nokia has no clue how to create a competitive product that can be a iphone clone - forget about surpassing it.This phone cannot play any games and it cannot play any music. I downloaded 4x4 monster tuck game from nokia web site and it would not even install. I sent an email to tech support and then the mess begins. It seems Nokia does not have a US support center. No no its not in India or some cheap country its in Europe. So they call in the afternoon and they can support you for like 2 or 3 hours that it - time to go to the pub. So first they sent me an email that seemed to indicate that they have sent me a link of some sorts on the phone - which never came to me. I waited some more. Then I got a survey email - looks like issue resolved. I responded with a very positive survey and sent them email as well. They came back oh sorry here is the link oh and that link will expire after 2 hours (aka we will be in the pub by then). And that link downloaded the file but install failed - this time certificate error. OK back to them - did not install blah blah blah. Oh just make sure you have correct time and date on the phone. He dumbos who does not have correct time and date on a (apprently) smart phone. Anyway oh OK then reset the phone. OK I did. oh the link has expired - here is another one - oh I need to go to the pub now. After all then still certificate error. Next day it start again - reset the phone... I gave up on that bunch of panzies. The game was only 2.99 but the you get the point.OK I cannot play games on the phone. I can live with that - may be. Can I play my music on it? My old nokia phone that costed me exactly $0.00 (with the contract ofcourse) did the job pretty well. Nope you cannot do that either. If you load more than 20 songs on to the phone - either in its memory or on the external card - you get all sorts of errors and it will not play any thing. Forget about playing it wont even show the song list and every now and then the external card is corrupted. If it plays the song (rarely that happens) try hitting pause - it takes a good 1 sec to pause - hello this is 2009. Is that a 2MHz processor in there - nope its the crappy software I am sure written by the invincible sleeping nokia designers and supported and released by the even more invincible nokia management.
Besides the earlier comment that the phone does not support HSDPA, I think the phone also does not have integrated GPS.  When I tried to use GPS, it tried to bring up Bluetooth to connect to an external GPS device.
Nokia E63-2This phone was too difficult to work with.  I did not like the screen or the size of the font.  It is bulky and I have no desire to carry around the manual to use the phone beyone a call.  I liked the keyboard but there are many many phones with good keyboards for a lot less money.
Hello, I get some question for me Item; I didn't get my phone yet, when I make the research of the Item on the web site of Amazon and USPS, this one show like delivered, but this item is not yet in my hands, I am waiting for my phone, could verify what happen for my phone, could you call USPS and ask what happen, I will explain something, this phone go to Costa Rica and then I am from Costa Rica, If you have any question about it, please let me know, I am worry for this item, and then my money is already charge, please let me know as soon you can.I think something wrong happen with the address, becasue I didn't write the code of my country on the address, code of my country is (SJO) that mean San Jose Costa Rica, here is the example.SJO - Johan Obando Alfaro3537 N.W. 82nd AvenueDoralMiami, Florida 33122United StatesNokia E63-2 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, Media Player, MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Full U.S. Warranty (Ultramarine Blue)
(Note: I am judging this phone against my previous long-term models, which include w200, z310, k550, w350, as well as some others I have poked at)I am extremely satisfied with this phone, but let me start with a couple things which might be deal-breakers for some people.1. The number keys are a little on the stiff side.  Not unusable, but a little stiffer than the w350 or k550.2. This phone does have some creaks and wiggles.  However, I found that much of the creaking in the open position was actually caused by the battery lid, which I fixed by sandwiching a sheet of toilet paper under it.On to the real features, most of them pretty good...>> Sound quality AND volumeThe w595 has the clarity of the old k550, but both the earpiece and the ringer loudspeaker are louder.  It's not as loud as the ringer on the w350, which is among SonyEricsson's loudest for some reason, but it's still louder than the k550, w200, and about as loud as the z310 (without the z310's poor quality).It has loudspeakers on both the top and bottom of the phone.>> DisplayThis phone has a display with good brightness and color saturation, and SonyEricsson's new light sensor to adjust the display brightness based on ambient light (i.e., in a movie theater, the display automatically drops to low, but boosts to full in bright sunlight).The viewing angle is not as wide as the w350 or k550.  It is mainly for direct viewing, but there appears to be a tradeoff because viewing the display horizontally (for videos) is actually better than most other phones.  Most phones look good in the "normal" position, but look bad when turned 90 degrees.  This one is good both ways, as long as you look straight at it.The 240x320 resolution is really good for mobile web browsing (especially with Opera Mini), Google maps, reading emails, and everything else.It's more visible in sunlight than most phones.>> CameraPretty decent image quality, though it lacks auto-focus (SonyEricsson seems to be reserving this feature for their new Cybershot models, so I wouldn't expect it elsewhere any more).  The shutter responds fairly fast, which is actually an advantage over the autofocus models as long as you don't need to take pictures less than a few feet from the subject.If you like to take photos as a way of making a quick note of something (like a product package), you can still do this.  Take the picture a few feet back so it isn't out of focus, and use the volume keys to zoom in on the image when you want to read it.>> Java applicationsIt runs games, Opera Mini, and Google Maps very well.  Opera Mini starts up in just under 5 seconds.  Much like the k550, the w595 will run almost any games.***Upgrade: the new menu system lets you create a shortcut directly to a Java application (as long as it is in the Applications folder).  I have the right-arrow shortcut set to load Opera Mini, so it can be accessed as quickly as the built-in browser.>> Video playbackIn addition to playing 3gp video, the W595 is one of the few phones which will actually play MP4 videos.  Some phones claim it, but actually require you to convert it to a 3gp.  True MP4 videos are much higher quality than 3gp.  I was able to play an hour-long science lecture I downloaded, which makes this cool phone "educational".NOTE: do NOT play videos by finding them through the "Media" menu.  This new media menu is a fancy-looking scrolling interface which is completely unnecessary and causes video playback to lose sync with the audio.  A firmware update "fixed" this by forcing the audio to synchronize every few seconds, which still looks like crap.  Use the File Manager like a civilized human, and all of this trouble goes away.  It's located in the Organizer menu, and you can make a shortcut to it if desired.>> Email clientAs I write this, my w595 is push-enabled by using the IMAP feature offered by GMail.  As of last year, both Gmail and Yahoo have IMAP support for free.  This sends you email to the phone without having to dial out manually to "check" it.  I ignorantly declared that previous models did not support this without a carrier service, but it turns out some did (but no free email services offered it).The email setup is also much easier.  I just entered my GMail address/password, and SonyEricsson is clever enough to find all of the correct server/port settings for GMail.  It was also smart enough to check if GMail supported IMAP, and asked me if I wanted to use it ("yes please!").Regular POP3 is of course also supported, if you don't want a constant email connection.>> AccelerometerThis is the kind of thing the iPhone and Wii have, so the phone can sense movement.  It's not an entirely practical feature, but it adds "coolness" if you want to impress your friends with a bubble level (available on the SonyEricsson website).>> RSS ReaderIf you don't know what that is, skip this section and save hours of your life.  If you are already using RSS and you want the Internet to be force-fed to you, this latest version offers improvements over the previous models:- Set update times for any or all hours of the day, individually for each feed.- New stuff shows up in a popup scroller on the home screen, with photos if available.>> Multi-taskingIt seems to handle running one application while one or two others are minimized.  To minimize a Java application, press the END key ONCE, and select minimize (pressing it twice closes it).It offers full menu access during phone calls, so you can do things like check your tasks/calendar while talking to someone.  Java applications can be run during the call, but Internet access appears to be disabled and media files won't play.>> OrganizerAs usual, SonyEricsson offers a good alarm clock which provides the only structure in my life.  New and existing features:- Multiple alarms- Set any of them to either repeated (on whatever days you choose), or one time- Use ANY sound on the phone as an alarm- Adjust the volume for individual alarms (morning wakeup full volume, tea time a pleasant low)- Add a picture to display- Add a text description.The organizer also include a lot of other good stuff, such as:- Tasks, with instructions and reminders on set dates/times.- Notes, so you can store notes without resorting to SMS drafts.- Calendar, timer, stopwatch, etc.>> Shortcut/event menuThis is one of many models with a really handy button which brings up a custom shortcut menu.  It's complex to explain, but really handy to use.The shortcut menu has 4 "tabs":- New events (usually a missed call, new message, or a task due)- Running applications- My Shortcuts- InternetUnless something special is happening, clicking the shortcut key will bring up your shortcuts.  If something special is happening (new event or running application), that tab will automatically come up.  You can use the left/right keys to switch tabs at any time.This shortcut key works at all times (e.g., while on a phone call or while browsing the Internet).  Thus, you can be browsing the Internet, and if you hear the message alert, you can click the shortcut key to bring up the message and close it again without closing the browser.  Or if you minimized an application to do something else, you can click the shortcut key to bring up the list of running applications without navigating to it.>> Track IDThis is a really neat feature included with many of the Walkman phones (and a few non-walkman models).  If a song is playing on the radio, in a store, etc, and you don't know what it is, Track ID will record some of it, and connect to some Internet server which will tell you the song/band.  It's not perfect, but it works much better than you might expect.>> Battery lifeSo far, it's pretty good.  I watched a 1-hour video, which is a pretty hefty task, and only lost about 15% battery capacity.  I keep the email connecting running 24/7, and I use about 45 minutes of internet and/or games per day.  It doesn't ever fall below 50%.The main reason I dropped one star from this phone's rating is because the housing just isn't well refined.  Everything functions fine, but a 5-star phone just shouldn't have the creaks and wiggles.Yikes, that's an enormous review, and I don't feel like proofreading.  No warranties implied.Tips and stuff:1. Don't use the Media menu to play videos (see above).2. If you are going to use IMAP for email access instead of POP3, make sure you are using GMail correctly or it will try to download every email you ever received (I will post a detailed explanation in the comments).3. The battery lid sucks.  Just pry it up from the obvious spot, as wrong as it feels.  Careful, it may spring out and attack you.  If it creaks when closed, see my ghetto fix (also in the comments section).4. You can set the slider to end the call, or not end the call, via an option in the settings menu.
By far the best Sony Ericsson product I've owned.  Which really doesn't say that much because the last one was an AT&T; branded z750a, which wasn't terrible.. just had that nasty "hey, I'm going to turn off now, kthxbai!" glitch.Lets star with the Pros.Big bright screen, even scratch resistant.  However I do recommend a screen protector, Expert Shield makes a good one *hint*.Solid keypad and face buttons.Clear call qualitySliding motion is slick and tight.Stereo speakersLot of pre-installed apps and themesAcellerometer, it has its uses.Walkman 3.0 player3.2mp camera. Pictures qaulity is good.Comes with everything - 2GB M2 card, USB cable, M2 to USB adapter, ear buds.  About $50+ worth of accessories, give or take.CONSOddly placed walkman button, i sometimes press it while sliding the phone downSlide feels a bit wobbly when slid out.  It's not real bad, but enough to make you be carefull with it.soft plastic.  I dropped mine a few feet when i was laying on my bed and it landed on it's charger where it plugs into the phone and put a tiny nick into the plastic, barely noticable but still there.Ear buds are kinda big and they don't fit in my ear real well, but the sound qaulity is top notch.Other NotesNot compatible with AT&T;'s 3G network, and this can be a deal breaker for some, not so much for me cause I just talk and text.  The phone will automatically turn it's mobile network type to GSM only when on an AT&T; SIM card.  So if you're worried about the 3G/HSDPA looking for a signal and killing your battery and you can't find it in the Mobile Networks menu under connectivity, no worries.. it turns itself off.  I had to figure that out with some software called "My Phone Explorer" good stuff check that out too.Face buttons take some getting used to, but once you got them down. it's a breeze.  I also thought the slide doesn't go far enough above the keypad so if you've got fat fingers and thumbs like me, it can take some getting used to.Overall, 4/5.  Great Phone and i'd pick it up again, it's very compareable to the w760 and a lot better than the w580 and w910.  This is what the w580 and w910 SHOULD have been and Sony Ericsson nailed it.  However, if you want something a little better in the walkman line you can't go wrong with the w705.
I ordered the item but I couldnot receive it. Also, I didnt receive my money back!!! And Amazon could not explain well the reason !
This phone is a pretty good phone overall.  It has a real sleek look, and is pretty thin and lightweight.  I love the volume power it has; it out-performs all my friends' phones in that aspect.  I also like the fact that the speakers are on the ends of the phone, not the bottom, so it gets nice sound quality, and you don't have to always have the phone face-down, or upside down to hear the music well.  The camera takes pretty good photos, but the video is grainy and leaves something to be desired.  I like the media feature, where you can review photos, music, games, etc., but I wish that one could exclude some photos from the media section.  I don't want some people seeing all my photos if they start browsing through them.  I do like the photo tag option; it makes it quite convenient to view photos of a certain category.  The quality on calls is good, and you can enter your friend's picture into their contact, and it shows up when they call you.  If you have a mac, the software for this phone will not work with your computer which kind of sucks.  Sony Ericsson doesn't currently offer any software for it for the mac.  Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this phone, and would definitely recommend you getting it, especially for the price at which Amazon is offering it.  This phone is definitely worth the $200.00.
i just received mine today and i have to say its a good phone but my issue is that when i slide the phone out the bottom part of the slide wobbles , did any one have this issue ?did you RMA? was there a difference?also when i open the phoe the lights on the keys turn all at once but the 7 and * seems to turn on last ? any idea?
If you've had a Sony Ericsson before, the W595 won't be a big wow factor. But if you haven't, you'd be blown away by the unbelievably bright screen, the looks, feel, and interface. I've had many sony ericssons in the past, but this is by far the best I'VE had yet.Pros:- Small (same as the W200, when it's closed of course)- Updated User Interface (very user friendly)- Loud (enough) Speaker, which is Stereo (has a speaker on both ends of the phone)...along with all the other Sony Ericsson perks.- Camera is ok, not the best, but that's coming from an aspiring photographer.- Radio is nice, I don't use it often, but it's nice- comes with a 2GB Sandisk memory card (sweet!)- also comes with a 2 headphone jack cord for your phone (at least mine did)Cons:- NO SMS DELIVERY REPORT. This was specified, at least not where I read thee specs.- No flash, but I knew this before I bought it, and having a flash isn't exactly on my check listOther little annoyances:- Slider is shakey, but not enough to have me worried of it falling apart.- The placement of the oart to charger the phone, to me, is ackward. But hey, that's just me.- No CD. But you can always download the program. I recommend Sony Ericsson PC Suite 4.0. It's really great.SummaryAll around great phone, nice replacement to my R600 and W200 (yes I had 2 phones). I recommend the blue verison, in my opinion, it's the best looking one. Once you've done your research into the Sony Ericsson and you see that this one is right for you, go for it. You won't be disappointed.** Feel free to ask questions about whatever I missed in this review
I love this phone! It was sent to me as soon as possible. Thank you Sony Ericsson. This phone is a beauty, I can't stop looking at it. I'm pretty much the only one who carries this phone. Love that! It's so unique in every way, and it really matches with my personality. I love the colours and the clarity of the mobile. Now I will purchase a Sony Ericsson case to go along with it. :)
love it so far. have been using it for a month now. i like the strong yet semi-bendable battery cover. love the good quality camera as well. it has multiple alarm system that will allow me to have six or seven (or more) different alarms to be set at different times. love the capability to add an external memory card as well. best SE i have ever got my hands on so far. and yes, i have been using walkman phone since the first time it was released, and this one is still the best.
I bought this phone because I didn't want to sign another contract and needed a phone. I love Sony Ericsson products. The phone rings loud. The MP3 player remarkable 100 songs loaded and still have space for more. The camera takes remarkable pictures. Make your own ringtones. Wonderful phone. Great price too. I recommend this phone.
good phone, but for me it takes a long time to connect to a bluetooth device. Also for about $ 40 more, u can get the G705 in amazon, which has wi-fi and GPS
I bought this phone for my mom.  Everything is nice, but when I slide the phone out.  I notice that the top part of the phone feels loose.  It can rock back and forth.  It wobbles.  But when I slide it in, it doesn't wobble and feels firm and tight.  Is anyone experiencing this problem too?  Or is my phone a defective?
I used to be a big fan of Samsung sliders.  I owned the D500, D600, D900, and now this S8300.  I think the styling of the phone is excellent.  The functionality is terrible.Pros: The screen looks amazing. The touch screen sensitivity is good.  Voice quality is good.  The size is perfect for my pocket.Cons: The software!  The phone is always doing things I don't want it to do.  I use the button lock feature all the time but still I find the button volume is always changing.  I like to have it set to zero, but I have the impression that Samsung really wants you to have sound effects for all the buttons.  Whenever I pull the phone out of my pocket I find that he button volume has been turned up.  There is no way to control how sliding the phone during a phone call effects the call.  The phone automatically ends a call when the phone is slid down.  I do not want this to happen, but there is no way to change it.  In order to use the loud speaker you must slide the phone up.  Then if you are finished with the loud speaker, if you slide the phone back down it will end the call, very annoying!The worst is the texting functionality.  The use of apostrophes with T9 is almost impossible.  For almost all words you must manually insert an apostrophe, which requires 4 keys.The side menu is nice but always gets in the way when trying to view an incoming text message. The phone also always goes to function to add a photo contact for some reason.Software is terrible.  this phone is only nice looking not good to use.
I have been using this phone for the past 3 weeks. I originally bought it locked to T-mobile UK paid for it to be unlocked, and De-branded the phone myself to get it to the generic version without the lame t-mobile junk all in it. That being said I really like this phone.Pros:-5 mega-pixel Camrea-DVD quality video-You tube application (unfortunately streaming is played over the DIVX player and not flash)-Google maps-8g of internal memory- Expansion slot up to 32g micro-Email (pop3 and Microsoft exchange)- FM transmitter- Fm radio- High resolution screen- Intuitive user interface- Java-WIFI-Blue tooth with stereo supportCons:-No way to turn off popup events notice annoying ass hell- The GPS takes forever to find my location, most of the time it cant- Very small onscreen keys for texting make it a challenge- Sometimes the phone gets confused about what position its in and wont rotate successfully when typing.- no USA 3GSupposedly according to the help section in the software suite this phone can be used as a blue tooth web cam.. I have no idea how to though.Overall:The call quality of this phone is good, there have been a lot of complaints about battery life but for me this hasn't been a problem. Seems to last the whole day just fine with moderate use. I had a G1 before this phone and its battery life was a lot worse. I used the fm transmitter in my car for the first time today it seemed to work okay considering it's a phone, downer is bass didn't seem to make it.This phone is very sleek and sexy and functional I love how thin it is and how well the camera works. The wifi and bluetoth work very well. And the screen is very clear. Even with the GPS acting lame I love this phone and would 5-star it if I could turn off stupid events notifications!!!!
I had this phone for about three months, until it fell from about 3 feet and the screen broke.That said, I'll write this review being objective, based on the whole experience as a user.Pros:- Capacitive Screen: Yes, just like the iPhone, no need to press, just touch. You can perform gestures such as sliding pictures or scaling them with two fingers.- Nice interface: the rotating cube is great. The contact manager is as good as it gets, I loved it.- Wonderful screen resolution: 480x800- Good looking and not bulky at all, especially for that resolution.- Great multimedia features: decent camera, video with sound, 8GB, nice music player.- Good battery life when used as a music player: I had this phone playing music for hours in a party with no need for a charger.Cons:- Average battery life with day to day use.- Slow: Browsing is embarrassingly slow. I thought that was normal for a cell phone until I saw some other phones browsing way faster, even phones worth half the price. Navigation is fast 90% of the time but occasionally it'll freeze for a few seconds. Same thing with the accelerometer, sometimes it just doesn't realize it has to rotate the screen.- Interface mistakes: regardless of the great looks, it has some obvious mistakes. For example, when you make a call it locks the screen, so far so good. But sometimes you need to unlock the phone (to dial an extension number for example) and guess what, as soon as you click the unlock button on the highly sensitive screen there's a red "hang up" button just below it waiting for you to click it by mistake.Also, IMHO the "call" button on the phone should open the dial-pad and the one on the screen the "recent calls list", not the other way around.- Kind of fragile: I've had Nokias fall harder with no problems whatsoever.Well, that pretty much summarizes it, I hope you find my review useful.
I've had this phone for over a month and I couldn't be happier.  At first, there were freezes, reboots, and other faulty software problems.  However, after updating the firmware, it's quite an outstanding phone.Great signal strength (for me at least.)GPS works very well after a 5 minute modification (Don't quite understand why they didn't make it work well in the first place, however I can't complain.)Camera is nice, not the greatest but no phone's camera is.Video recorder, however, is very VERY good.  It records videos in 720x480 resolution (DVD resolution) @ 30fps.The music player needs touch-ups, however it works.  What I enjoy about it is the sound quality.  It's almost astounding how great it sounds.The major gripe I have is the DivX and XviD player.  You're forced to convert your already-encoded DivX movies to the mobile standard (320x240 or less resolution, while the phone's resolution is 800x480).  However, if you take the time to convert your movies to mp4 format, you can easily play DVD quality videos on the handset.All in all, I enjoy the phone.
We think the LG KM900 is a nice telephone. It is very light, bright screen, and especially the camera mode is great, good resolution and flash! Good and easy internet or e-mail connection at a reasonable speed. Easy to set up features and personalize.Weak point, the battery, it has not given us more than 2 days, even with little use during the weekends, while my i-phone will easily give me five to seven days.
Don't doubt it, it works very well, useful, nice, a really good tool also, I just had to turn it on and insert my SIM card, and done! I tought it was going to be very difficult use it, but its navigation system was easier to use than I thought, sounds really good and wi-fi works terrific.
The Impression is an amazing phone. I chose this over the LG xenon because its bigger and better. It's AMOLED screen is super bright. Pictures and video looks amazing.  The touch screen is responsive and has 4 different levels of haptic feedback. For receiving calls and messages, you can choose different vibration patterns and 7 different levels of vibrate.The keyboard is pretty big and if you have a small hand, it might slow down your typing a bit. There's a handy message button on the keyboard that opens a new message. There are 4 different ways to text(full qwerty keyboard, virtual qwerty, virtual T-9, and you can also draw letters to type). The keyboard is slower than me, so I'll stop typing and it will keep going.Calls are loud and clear.  You can also use videoshare during calls with other videoshare enabled phones.  The camera is great.  You can't zoom with the camera, but you can zoom in the video mode.  The camera also has frames which are kind of cool.  You can also take panoramic pictures, you take a picture then you put the aim thing in the box and it auto takes a picture and it does this 6 times and automatically lines them all up.Overall, It's a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone who asks.
This phone was just what I wanted with a little more added in. I was basically looking for something that could function like a "smart" phone (iphone, palm pre, blackberry, etc) but wouldn't have a proprietary monthly charge for using. I mainly text message, talk on the phone, take pictures, and occasionally surf the web.The slide out keyboard is a real plus. It is a bit large, so you have to get used to that. The AMOLED screen is really bright and has a great picture. The phone quality is pretty good. The camera doesn't have a flash, but at 3 MP it takes decent pictures. On some screens (viewing pictures, browser, typing a message), you can turn the phone sideways and it will rotate the picture (like the iphone), but the rotating is inconsistent (doesn't work in some places where it seems it should).My main gripe about this phone is that AT&T;'s webmail doesn't include gmail (which I already knew, so maybe it's more of an AT&T; gripe). Also, the downloadable gmail app or just browsing to gmail in the browser doesn't work as well as it should, which brings me to my next concern. The web browser is a standard mobile phone browser, very rough. It loads pages pretty fast, but it's not fun to use it for any length of time. Another issue, is the lock key is on the side of the phone in such a way that it's hard to unlock. Trying to hold the lock key usually results in sliding the keyboard out a bit. After you're used to it, it's not too bad, but still annoying.Even with all the problems, this is a great phone, and I would purchase it again.
I had the Nokia E71x and just didn't like the fact that the screen was so small, the ringer wasn't loud enough, and the keys were right out there to gather dust.  So I ordered the Samsung Impression (much to my daughter's dismay) and I LOVE IT!!!  I like the fact that it is a slider and therefore I don't have to worry about the keys getting anything on them while in my purse.  The screen is twice the size of the Nokia and even though you can't enlarge the font, it is large enough to read clearly anyway.  The ringer is nice and loud and I can hear it when it's buried in the bottom of my purse.I like the other features on this phone such as the touch screen.  I love the way I can slide things from one place to another and customize the screen to suit myself.  This phone takes great pictures.  At first I didn't have a case on it but now I do (I was always afraid I would drop and break the phone).  With the case on it, I don't have to worry about putting my finger on the lens of the camera now.  I have a tendency to put my index finger there while talking.  Now the case keeps my finger from touching the lens.  I haven't learned how to take a panoramic photo like some have but maybe I will one day.The thing I didn't like was the fact that you don't get a manual - except for othe CD that comes with it.  Since it isn't always convenient to use a computer to find out something about the phone, a manual would be beneficial.  Samsung needs to remedy that problem.I think the phone is fantastic and would recommend it to everyone!
Great phone.  If I take the time to figure out how to add "recent calls" to the desk top I will be totally happy.  Now, I have to go to "my stuff", "tools" and then "recent calls".  I also want to figure out how to redial with out going to "recent calls".  Instead of reading the manual I may just get my nephew to look at it.
I don't spend a lot of time on the phone, but it has become increasingly important for people to reach me while I'm away from home, or out of the office. After researching the options, a prepaid phone seemed to be the best choice. No monthly bills, or long term commitment, for a device that would be used infrequently, plus the T-Mobile $100 for 1000 minutes prepaid plan gives me more than enough talk time, and I have up to a year to use it. Anything not used within that period can be rolled over provided you add more minutes before the year is up. Additional minutes can be easily purchased online, over the phone, or at store locations around the country.The Moto W233 has surprisingly clear audio, along with a well amplified speaker, and strong signal quality. Nine hour talk time, eighteen hour standby on the battery. The screens are intuitive and simple, albeit quite basic. Included in the box is a pamphlet style "quick start" guide, however, a full version of the product manual is available on the Motorola web site.The address book and calendar are adequate, and new contacts and phone numbers can be added from the T-Mobile web site, as well as through the dial pad. With the optional micro SD card you can also store photos and music on the device. The downside is that the screen resolution is far too poor, and too small, for viewing anything other than clipart style images. In other words, don't bother downloading your Flickr jpeg collection to this phone. You will be very disappointed.The headphone jack is smaller than a standard earphone plug, so forget about using your favorite iPod earbuds with this one. Fortunately, a decent pair of buds are included in the box. The lime green color gives it a toyish appearance, which may cause some embarrassment when compared with your buddy's fancy flip out Nokia, but hey...you're doing your bit for the environment with this product made largely of recycled plastic.The battery charges quickly (about an hour, give or take), and can be charged through the USB port on your computer after downloading the proper drivers from the Motorola web site. However, be forewarned, the drivers only work on Windows XP and Windows 2000. Nope, no Vista drivers. Amazing, ain't it?Overall, if you're just looking for a decent device that enables your people to reach you when you're away from the land line, and you really don't need another phone bill on your budget, the Moto W233 is ideal.  It's lightweight, small, fits in a shirt pocket, and fits nicely in your hand. For someone like me, this device is likely to be all I'll ever need when it comes to cell phones.
I bought this phone for my son's first phone. He's 11, but will be doing a lot of camps this summer so I wanted him to have a way to call if needed. With the pre-paid option, I can give him a $10 per month phone allowance. He gets to demonstrate that he CAN be responsible, but it's not a huge thing if he loses it. Either way he's learning, and it's a good basic phone. Nice voice quality. Good volume. I'm sure he'll have the MP3 features figured out soon.
I needed a replacement phone immediately.  Because I *completely* resent the $18 'upgrade' fee T-Mobile charges on top of the cost of a new phone, I've decided to buy unlocked or non contracted phones from now on.  I didn't know what kind of 'good' phone I wanted, so I bought this as a stand in... I just slid my regular sim card in when it arrived and I was good to go (i.e. I did not use any sort of pay as you go, pre-paid service with it).The good:It works.  It makes calls. Calls are clear. It was a cheap filler phone and I'll hang on to it for that purpose again.  There's a music player which works well.There are two fun games included with it--sodoku and tetris--which work well and don't seem to be 'demos'.The not great but dealable:No bluetooth, no email client.  It's a cheap phone, so not having those things wasn't unexpected but I realized how much I'd grown to like both of those things.The memory expansion card is underneath the battery--not very convenient.The battery itself is a REALLY tight fit...I've never had one which is so hard to remove (which makes dealing with the memory card more of a pain than I'm used to.The not so great stuff that I didn't like about the design which goes beyond the it's 'it's a basic phone' explanation:The headphone jack isn't a 'standard' one...and the included earbuds are utter crap so I've really missed my stereo bluetooth ones.  It's a shame because the music player itself isn't bad.The photo viewer is a disappointment.  Pictures don't fill the screen well and take forever to load.  Waste of time.Perhaps the most significant is that I've had a LOT of phones and this has the tightest, most uncomfortable key configuration.  The buttons seem hard to press and my hand cramps up.  I'm not a texting maniac but I REALLY hate texting on this phone (and I've never thought about it before).I can't figure out how to turn off the annoying little jangley chirpy sound when I plug or unplug it in to charge.  Annoying when that wakes up my husband late or in the morning.
I bought this phone to replace a much more expensive Nokia phone which I lost. And I end up enjoying this phone so much more than the previous phone. For a basic mobile phone, the Motorola Renew is the best. The battery life is very impressive. Motorola claims you can talk on it for 9 hours. I guess it depends on other factors as well. If you only want a cheap basic mobile phone which does its job well, this is your perfect choice. Its carbon-neutral status is definitely an incentive to buy. However, even if it wasn't a "green" phone, it would still be a very good buy. If you're still in doubt about this phone (as a replacement or a prepaid), just go for it. I think you won't be disappointed.
I bought this phone to replace a samsung phone which is broken because it drops whenever I get out my car. However, this motorola phone is cheap and provide almost the same features as my old phone just that its not a camera or video phone. The music is really loud and clear, and the battery does not run out quick. I am the 1st to get it in my neighborhood when it came out, and have bought a few people one too. People don't even believe it's only 30 bucks in the store. I'll definately recommend it to anyone.*Also, I've dropped this phone a few times and the battery cover just comes off. Screen did not break or crack!
Thisis a great phone with terrific reception!I like that you can check your voicemail using a landline....easy, convenient,and no paying for minutes.I like that you can add contacts to the phone using My Tmobile online:  Add Contacts.  Very easy to do,and fun.I like that you can check your minutes using your landline or the computer.\The 1000 minutes for 100 bucks is great and look forward to not getting a 40 buck bill from sprint each month.I got a gel skin for the phone which gives it some heft and protects it....covers most of the green...which I do like, but like the blackbetter with the green showing just a wee bit.It's a fun phone.  I don't use it for music...have an ipod.  I just can't get over what a great deall lthe whole thing is.Perfect.The only bad thing is tmobilel's cust. service....it sucks....bad.  Hopefully I willnever have to call lthem.
The main reason to get this phone is because it is made out of recycled materials.  The production process is said to be "carbon free."  A great reason to buy this phone is because it's environmentally responsible.Now, this phone may not be for everyone as you have to pay for the minutes you use but the cost is very reasonable.  Simply the best and most simple plan I have found so far.  No strings, no hassle.  The "pay as you go" is perfect for me as I don't always use a ton of minutes every single month.  T-mobile is VERY nice in that you don't have to pay a huge monthly bill.  Instead, you can purchase the number of minutes you want (refill them as often as you want to) and they don't expire for quite some time.  This plan and phone are perfect for me.  It is also very easy to refill the phone's minutes online through T-mobile's website.GREAT phone for people who don't "live" on their cell phones.  Very flexible plans, very easy to use.  I just got my cute little phone and so far I absolutely adore it.  I will buy one for my parents for Christmas and would highly recommend it to others.
The seller promised the phone on the exact day and i did get it! the phone works great and is well pleased with my purchase
Cheap but good,... I like everything cheap and good.My broke now,..that why I'm using this phone.
This phone is small, light, nice looking and inexpensive.The big problem with it is that Motorola Phone Tools (latest version is currently V5.17d) doesn't recognize the phone. This means that, despite what the advertising says, you cannot sync your contacts or your calender to your computer, backup your contacts or transfer your old data from your previous phone. It is possible that Motorola will update their software in time but even if they do, it's deeply disrespectful to their customers to advertise functionality that they have simply failed to implement. The phone should be withdrawn from sale until they can make it work.You can transfer music to it, but there's a trick to it. You have to plug the phone into your USB port and quickly follow a prompt on the phone's screen to switch to storage mode. It then pretends to be a thumb drive.Update:According to Motorola, the phone will never be supported by motorola phone tools, so despite what you may read on review sites that claim to have tested the phone, but clearly just paraphrase the marketing materials (I'm looking at you CNET), the phone cannot sync your calender with outlook, and you can't backup the address book or transfer one from your previous phone. It seems to me that Motorola are trying to kill this phone, perhaps so that they can claim that they offered a carbon neutral phone but nobody wanted it. Shame on you Motorola.
Not getting anywhere near 18days of standby time, maybe only 3days?  Also, poor reception compared to other phones I've used.  Only reason for a two star review is that the phone is cheap...
Won't charge with a standard cigarette lighter adapter (12v to mini usb) It sees that it is plugged in but will not charge - I suspect it requires a Motorola specific charger, FAILCannot use Motorola Phone Tools ($50 - Seriously? $50!?) to back up data to/from SIM card - don't have lots of friends.When mounted as a USB drive on the computer - cannot make or receive calls other than 911 unless you unplug it from the computer.Speaker is REALLY REALLY tinnyPlastic feels like a cheap Revel snap together model from 1967IMPORTANT!!! ---> Because Motorola in their infinite "we're totally failing" wisdom implemented a proprietary USB format - this phone CANNOT be CHARGED!  from a Mac or Linux or (currently) Windows7 computer. It requires specific drivers from Motorola to charge - TOTALLY STUPID - total dealbreaker for me (can force install .sys driver in Win7 if you know what you are doing)Cannot mount the phone as a flash drive to load music - CANNOT BE DONE - again requires specific drivers from Moto which will not recognize Windows7 and therefore will not install, and are not available for Mac or Linux (can force install .sys driver in Win7 if you know what you are doing)if Motorola had just followed standard USB implementation (USB Storage Class built in OS Driver) - this would not be an issue. STUPID STUPID STUPIDUpdate: Finally got it working on Win7 BUT found out the phone is only USB 1.0 speed 356k per second transfer speed, so a 2GB SDMicro card takes 1 1/2 hours to fill!!No call answer button on headset - you can set phone to auto answer but that is very inconvenient.On the plus side - the headphones aren't bad - about par with the ones that Apple includes with iPods  Does allow you to set MP3 files as alarmclock and ringtoneMusic player quits when you go back to the home screen - so no playing games or texting or choosing next song while you listen to musicBest bet would be to use a USB2.0 card reader and not change your music often but the SD Micro card is under the battery so you have to shut down - open the case - take out the battery - slip out the card - and reverse. Kind of a total pain.No playlists - you can navigate to a sub folder and play all music in it - so you could do a crude workaround.If your kids are pestering you for an iPhone - and you don't have that budget - this is still not the phone for you, they will most likely be very unhappy. If you are a casual phone user and want something that will allow you to listen to some music on a morning commute or gardening this might workThis "eco friendly green phone" came in a large plastic blister pack with lots and lots of T-Mobile manuals and prepay upsell propaganda  inside (they appear to be printed with soy ink on recycled paper - but the packaging isn't nearly as eco friendly as it could be. )This is just a HORRIBLE phone!!!Thank you for taking it back without a restocking fee Amazon, you are the BEST
This phone is not very well supported by Motorola.  The latest Motorola Phone Tools does not even support it, so there is no way to upload your saved contacts from your old phone.  You have to type in all your phone numbers manually, which really, really sucks.
From my experience over the last 4 four months this phone has not been reliable. If it is low on battery it the sound will often just stop working - meaning I can call someone, and they can hear me but I cannot hear them. This can happen mid call as well.It frequently drops calls even when fully charged. I will dial with the phone displaying four reception bars, I'll remain in exactly the same place and still, about two minutes into a phone call, I will stop being able to hear the person at the other end, then it will take a few seconds for the phone to actually end the call and display "Call Ended," then the phone will display no bars. However, when I try to redial, from exactly the same spot, it will successfully connect and the whole process will start over again. It is very frustrating and unprofessional.It also seems to take an abnormally long time to load contacts/receive service signal upon being turned on.Pro: Very affordable.
For the first time I am disappointed with Motorola because this phone is just no good and that's the bottom line. Disregard all the eco-friendly hype this phone is absolute trash and I mean that literally. The materials and make of the phone is extremely and horrendously cheap, I am shocked that Motorola has compromised it's standards with such a terribly designed phone made from such cheap materials I know it's recycled but gosh this is ridiculous. I couldn't even get the back to close properly and on several occasions when I turned it off it refused to come on when I tried to turn it back on even though it was fully charged. It actually died I couldn't even get it to charge it was just dead nothing was working I tried everything and I need not mention I just had it for one month and I rarely use it; just a couple times a week so it was not because I threw it around.I have owned two Motorola phones the RZR and I still own the Slide phone both of which I really liked. That is the only reason why I chose a Motorola designed phone for my pre-paid account. This whole pre-paid phone thing is just a waste of money I have discovered that my SIM card worked just as well in another T Mobile phone that I had a regular month to month plan with as it does with the so called "pre-paid" phone. So don't waste your money just try out the SIM card with your regular T Mobile phone and you just may get to use it for your pre-paid account instead of wasting money on a trashy "pre-paid" phone. This is so ridiculous, now I can't even return it because its over a month.Take my advice save your $29.99 I wouldn't even pay $5.00 for this fancy green piece of trash if I had to do it all over again. It's simply a waste of money.
I bought this phone for my young daughter. It's a good basic phone and easy to use. My daughter said it has great rings tones and she loved it. The reviews say that it does not have a lot of memory so if you will be using it more to save pictures and music, etc. This may not be the one for that purpose. However, please note that it is not described as a dual band phone which means that it will only work in North America. We wanted to use this in Asia and I confirmed with Nokia that this model will not work there so I returned it to Amazon.
This phone would've made sense except for the fact that it has no voice dialing (a feature that comes with many free phone offers). You can't take full advantage of the bluetooth feature w/o voice dialing. I can't believe Nokia was that cheap not to include such a simple feature.
Good day friends. It is good to go unnoticed, does not call the attention to the thieves, expires with his(her,your) basic functions several photos can extract to 65K colors. It(he,she) has Radio(Radius) Fm. It(he,she) expires with my needs. I live in Venezuela.
I bought my blackberry to this company and it results that this device hasn't a legal IMEI (identification code) which makes me doubt of the procedence of this phone. I won't ever buy nothing to this seller again. They should have known better.
This is a great phone if you are lonely, as you'll have ample opportunity to talk to the friendly support folks at T-Mobile. For hours. In 2 months, the camera quit, I've re-installed the software 3-4 times, and it still doesn't work right.  The phones goes dead in the middle of calls, the camera freezes, and the WiFi only works if you are no more than 10-15 feel from the WiFi access point.  Forget dreams of free calls over free Wifi.  At this point, I'll probably cut my losses and just pay the 200.00 excess profit cancellation fee and get a cheap phone.  I just can't afford the time to keep this thing going.  It's pretty, though.
I have a big problem! Purchase this item and restart always! has many flaws, and nobody has helped me! Who can I complain to? my blackberry does not work. AND IT IS THIS ARTICLE! I do not live in the United States, I am in venezuela. I need help!
this is my first "smart phone" and i love this thing. since it's my first one i cant compare it to anything so i dont really know what i'm missing but i do know it does everything i want it to. first there is the copy/paste feature which is very simple but if it wasn't there it would suck, then mp3's which you can set as ring tones for free, emails/texting with the qwerty keyboard is awesome, internet is sweet, games, pictures are very clear (but watch out for pocket lint on the lens(no protector over it)), apps, oh yeah and it's a phone. the bad is it's kind of slow,  dont get me wrong it's still pretty quick, but the upgrade to the 8900 is a lot faster, the built in map sucks but you can download google maps which is about the best application ever, and video recorder is crap (nothing good to say about that). i would highly recommend this phone and i could never go back to a regular basic cell phone again.
The curve is a downgrade from previous models. WiFi and gps barely work. You need a very strong signal for wifi. No 3G. The most annoying part is that you will have to change all your chargers and adapters because they changed the connector. The old mini-USB cable was very handy because it is shared by many manufactures so it was very easy to find someone to help you out in case you run out of battery on the road. Not anymore. Do not waste your money.
The unlocked Blackberry was advertise as new and what I got was a used product. Buyers should be aware of bying any products from this outfit. Amazon should also investigate before offering to sell products from this outfit.
OK, First of all, the cell phones are not new one, all of them are used or stole i dont know, the customer services s*cks!!! i bought 2 cell phones with them, the 1st was everything good, but the 2nd one, was an odissey, when arrived the cell it doesn't works, i contact them and after few days they answered me telling that if i want returns i need to pay the shipping expenses by my own, well i sent it back, i didn't hear from them in a 1 week, i was very worried, after all they contact me telling me your phone was dispached this day, and this is your tracking number try to find it...I highly don't recommend this seller, is very not responsible at all.Ok, primero q nada, hablemos en mi idioma, los celulares no son nuevos, todos son usados o robados que se yo!, el servicio el consumidor apesta, yo compre 2 celulares con ellos, con el 1ero todo salio perfecto, se notaba q era usado pero servia, pero con el 2do fue una completa odisea, cuando el celular llego no funcionaba y la caja no traia todos los accesorios, de una vez los trato de contactar y luego de unos dias me responden, que si quiero realizar cambio del telefono todos los gastos del envio corren por mi cuenta , de todas maneras lo hice lo envie de vuelta, despues de una semana sin saber nada de ellos me escriben diciendo tu telefono fue enviado tal fecha y este es tu tracking number, trata de rastrearlo...Yo altamenete no recomiendo este vendedor, no para nada responsable...No compren aqui...
I bought this for a friend in another country.  It was sold as a new product, but after delivery to my friend, it was quickly discovered to be used.  Inside the battery casing were several marks.  The new product software and accessories  were not delivered either.  I will be hesitant to buy through Amazon again.
I have owned this Curve for TWO FULL YEARS. It has another SOLID TWO years plus of life left in it.Quite frankly, this has been the best phone (not to mention the very first PDA I've bought) that has served me very well since 2007.Reading the reviews below me, there are a whole lot of negative reviews, and I actually understand why people have had such a hard time with this phone. This is a smart phone; it's kind of like a computer. You NEED to update the software (Operating System) on this phone in order for it to function properly, much like how Windows XP/Vista/7 or the MAC OS's periodically have fixes they suggest you download and set up.However, it's hard for people to know when to update their OS, and the solution is simple. Google. A good website [...]. They literally have ALL the information, OS updates, and features posted on that site. During the first 4 months I've had the Curve, I had problems left and right. The phone would freeze all of a sudden with that eternally spinning hour glass, or sometimes it would just shut off by itself, other times applications just would not work.The fix was simple: update the OS, do some research on the internet, and don't trust the tech support from whatever carrier you're using, b/c they're just as lost as you are. The original OS on the Curve was a 4.2 version; the buggiest of all. ALL you needed to do to get your Curve running PERFECTLY was to update it to 4.5. Ever since I did that, this phone was fail-proof.I have used this phone everyday for two years. I've made regular calls, Wifi calls, browsed the internet, downloaded many useful applications, took this phone with me to four different countries, dropped this phone on carpet, concrete, plastic tables, and on one occasion, a steel wall. I've taken this phone with me during my time in the Marine Corps when I was driving tactical vehicles around. This phone has survived a 6' drop from the driver's side door of a Oshkosh MTVR onto hardened dirt on the grounds of Ft. Knox.I've used this phone through the heat, humidity, rain and freezing cold.This phone is still in my pocket, ready to go at a moment's notice. Everyone's experiences and reviews may differ from one another, but for me, this phone is good to go.Once you have updated the OS, this phone will serve you well.
The BlackBerry Curve 8320 is my 3rd BlackBerry: I previously owned a BlackBerry 7290 and a BlackBerry 8700.I really enjoy the Curve 8320: it is smaller, offers a bright colorful screen and is nice to handle (with its curved/rounded corners...), while continuing to provide the features I enjoyed in my earlier BlackBerries (keyboard, menus, easy email reading/writing...).The big difference I see in this BlackBerry compared to the last 2 is in the User Experience, which I now find enjoyable. At last a BlackBerry that doesn't feel bulky and that you can easily slide in your pocket!
This supplier sent to me a product with problems more than 6 months ago and at tis time i am not received any information about my celphone returned and recieved in your office. If you have some issue like this don't hesitate to contact me.Tks,Alejandro
I purchased this product as an unlocked item. Thereafter, I purchased another one on September 17 also as an unlocked item. One purchase was from the OEM shop and the other one from DLN Enterprises. Since both were shipped first to a cargo company in Miami and then to my home in Venezuela, I have no way of knowing which one came locked other than providing the sellers (I hope one will respond) with the IMEI and pin which is locked, as follows: IMEI: 358263018275487 PIN: 557606BB. Your assistance to solve this problem will be highly appreciated.Best regards,
I bought the blackberry curve after being told of all the great features: getting email on my phone, being able to access the web,and other great icons that let me check the news.Well, the web never works. Pages never load and usually it just freezes my phone up. Same goes for the helpful icons, all they do is freeze my phone so that I have to take the battery out because it won't even shut off.The only good thing about this phone is being able to access email without being at a computer but I still wouldn't recommend the expense of this phone just for that.Go out and buy another type of phone! STAY AWAY FROM THE BLACKBERRY CURVE!!
The black berry arrived on time, it is great, it has a lot of functions and it came with several accesories, the only complaint is related to the weight because it is heavy.
Blackberry does not honor their warranty.  If you must get one, buy insurance.  The USB connection breaks because of poor design.  I have had two fail.  One had insurance, the other did not.  Blackberry claims that this does not happen and WILL charge you $180.  There is no escalation.  I got the device back with a broke screen and no battery (new one too).  Poor design, poor software, and the worst customer support.  You have been warned.
El telefono que llego en la caja es un telefono reconstruido segun los especialistas tecnicos en blackberry. La telefonia DIGITEL asigno un número, pero se bloqueo la cuenta Blackberry, debido al aparato. Conparando el telefono con un modelo original se pueden apreciar claramente las diferencias.
Buenos tardes, comenzare por decir que el celular este en excelente condiciones, pero vino sin los accesorios, me comunique con la empresa y una tal linda, solo hizo referecia que el manual lo podia bajar de un  link que me suministro, pero nunca hizo mencion al cable de datos y otros accesorios que deben venir con el cel....Saludos Angel Hernandez
This phone is great, the price is pretty good and it has all the functions you need in a Blackberry. The product arrived perfectly and on time.
For $20, this is a bargain replacement phone.  I put in my existing T-mobile SIM and it worked perfectly.Pros:-Bright colorful screen-Slim-Flashlight-FM radio that worksCons:-People report they cannot hear me well.-The keys are slippery, noisy, and hard to press. If you do a lot of texting, you may want a better keypad.-FM radio require Nokia plug
Very nice basic phone.  I think they've deliberately gone with a cheap-and-cheerful look on the side and back plastic to avoid looking too good next to more expensive phones.  Shame, as the front is very clean and stylish.For me it replaced the Nokia 1608 - the previous cheapo candy-bar phone from T-Mobile prepaid.  This is a major step up and addresses everything I didn't like about that phone.  Very good high resolution screen showing plenty of text, keys which are much nicer to use (not perfect), it looks better and it's very slim and unobtrusive in a pocket.  It has a ringtone which isn't an annoying tune, which is a major step up!The keys could be easier to use - I wouldn't want to try to use them by feel in a pocket, though they work much better than they look like they would.  They also click a bit loudly, so any kids wanting to text unnoticed in the pocket in class will not like this phone.Shame the radio doesn't work out of the speakerphone speaker.In case anyone misses it, ear volume is left-right on the 4-way, during a call.If it dies when overcharged I'll be back to change my review, but I assume the other reviewer was just unlucky.Edit: I did see some wierdness when it refused to take a charge.  I popped the battery out and in and all is well again.  We'll see.
So my wife's nice T-Mobile cell decides to quit 2 months before the end of her contract. Naturally, getting a replacement from T-Mobile was a big rip-off, they got you vs you got them when contract expires. So, I stumbled on this prepaid, and since the other review confirmed it would  accept the regular SIM card from the T-Mobile cells, and with its $20 price, became a no brainer. Got it activated with its own SIM, then swapped in my wife's original SIM card and vola, she got a working cell for couple months until she can get a real one.Now, this cell is small, light, kind of cute, but has no volume adjustment (so little hard to hear the other caller), even thought they hear you fine. The other problem was the way it jumbled up the contact list that came on the old SIM card, (when a contact had more than 1 number, it ended up showing multiple name listing for each number, so John 1 was for work number, John 2 for Cell, John 3 for home ...etc). Another issue is the reception, we always had full T-Mobile bars at our home, but this one was fluctuating between 1-3 bars, so it may prove to be a problem with dropped calls, lets see. Furthermore, wife complained about the keypad, sending a text message was a chore when compared with her old phone, but it still worked fine. Don't expect blue tooth capability, but it did come with a wired head phone (useless for her since it is an insult to use it, lol). The charger had an odd port (not the standard USB, what is the problem with these manufacturers)????Anything good?!! Well, it works, is stylish and is very cheap, so I stretched it and gave it 3 stars.
I bought this for 19.98 at [...], after my t-mobile phone died on me.  I didn't want to pay the outrageous prices that t-mobile was asking for any of their regular phones, since I plan to switch companies once my current contract is up.  The chick at the t-mobile store told me I couldn't buy the phone without paying the 50 dollar activation, but wal-mart had no problem.I popped in my old sim card and it worked right away, no need to install the sim card that comes with it first or anything. The phone it self is basic, and kinda cheap feeling, but it was worth 20 bucks. Yes, the keys are sort of hard to use, but I don't text a lot so it doesn't concern me.Overall though, it makes and receives calls, and will get me through the last 5 months of my contract. Mine actually came with a headset to use with the FM radio built in, which might come in handy if my Ipod dies at work or something. It also has a built in flashlight, but you have to press so many keys to get to turn on, you might be better off just using the key glow.
for the most part the the phone looks nice in the package but it really flimsy and i could live with that but i could not hear anything with or with out the head set i took it back to walmart.
I bought this as a no-frills replacement for my six-year-old no-frills Nokia prepaid phone.  I only use my phone occasionally and do not text message so I thought that basic was good enough.  What I didn't realize was that apparently expecting the phone to ring when a call came in is "optional" for this model. I've missed 90% of my calls even with the ringer turned up to the loudest volume and the vibration feature turned on.  Unless it's in my hand or on my lap, I cannot tell someone is calling. I couldn't return it within the 14-day period because I was leaving for vacation. When I returned, I was told that a new phone would be shipped out and when that was received, I should return the first one.  I waited two weeks for a new phone and finally was told today that because the phone was prepaid, I must send the phone in first and then 7-10 days after they receive it, they'll mail back another--reconditioned phone.  The keypad is not easy to use but I could put up with that if I could just hear my calls.On the pro side, it's lightweight and does hold a charge.Overall, it's worth spending a bit more money--and trying the phone in person before buying it online.
Really liked the phone, esp for $20, until it stopped working one morning after about 1 1/2 months.  I looked online and from what I can tell, it looks like I may have overcharged it, since I had it plugged in all night.  I've left all my mobile phones plugged in overnight before and never had this issue, but I guess that is what you get for $20.  I am looking for a different phone now, but if you can find it for sale somewhere, where they also have a replacement warranty with it available for at least a year, then it may be worth it.
Even if you are expecting just telephone and text functions, avoid this junk. Nokia 1661 has an unbelievably poor antenna which doesn't receive signals very well. Nokia 1661 pretty often showed the message 'No Network Coverage' and it was really annoying. I'd used the older model, Nokia 2610. Now I use my old Nokia 2610 again since it is usable unlike Nokia 1661.
I bought this phone on yesterday at your neighborhood Target. It was $19.99 and included the charger and headset. For the price, this phone is worth it only as most reviewers stated: a replacement for the meantime until you get a new phone. This phone is only good for those who don't talk or text much. I wouldn't recommend it for long time use (i.e. more than 1 year) but since times are tough, I'd say it's a great deal! I used to have a LG cell from Alltel, but since they merged with Verizon and my old cell was malfunctioning, I decided to get this one in the meantime. Overall it is a nice cell phone with a nice sleek screen, I only wish that the sides and back cover were just as sleek instead of the cheap flimsy plastic they used (it looks so weird up against the smooth black screen!). So I would recommend this phone to high school and college students (such as myself) and to others who want to save some money or need a starter phone.
This phone is such a good deal.I have used lot of go phones.But I find this one to be very convienent and user friendly.The best low price phone.
Good cheap phone; works with the SIM card for existing plan. So if a dearly beloved drops their brand new phone in the water and your brother runs over it; you can put her SIM in the "Green Phone" until the two year contract expires. Or you can give her your brand phone and put your SIM in the "Green Phone". If you are married you will understand!
1) Speaker is REALLY REALLY tinny2) plastic feels like a cheap Revel snap together model from 19673) IMPORTANT!!! ---> Because Motorola in their infinite "we're totally failing" mentality implemented a proprietary USB format - this phone CANNOT be charged from a Mac or Linux or (currently) Windows7 computer. It requires specific drivers from Motorola to charge - TOTALLY STUPID - total dealbreaker for me4) See above but apply it to mounting the phone as a flash drive to load music - CANNOT BE DONE - again requires specific drivers from Moto which will not recognize Windows7 and therefore will not install, and are not available for Mac or Linuxif Motorola had just followed standard USB implementation - this would not be an issue. STUPID STUPID STUPIDUpdate: Finally got it working on Win7 BUT found out the phone is only USB 1.0 speed 356k per second transfer speed, so a 2GB SDMicro card takes 1 1/2 hours to fill!!No call answer button on headset - you can set phone to auto answer but....On the plus side - the headphones aren't bad - about par with the ones that Apple includes with iPodsMusic player quits when you go back to the home screen - so no playing games or texting while you listen to musicBest bet would be to use a USB2.0 card reader and not change your music often but the SD Micro card is under the battery so you have to shut down - open the case - take out the battery - slip out the card - and reverse. Kind of a total pain.Does allow you to set MP3 files as alarmclock and ringtoneNo playlists - you can navigate to a sub folder and play all music in it - so you could do a crude workaround.If your kids are pestering you for an iPhone - and you don't have that budget - this is still not the phone for you, they will most likely be very unhappy. If you are a casual phone user and want something that will allow you to listen to some music on a morning commute or gardening this might work
Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very satisfied with it...he is now trying the sync the phone to his pc but is having issues locating the proper drivers for the cradle, other than that it works fine and he is satisfied.
You can read on an unopened package what features a phone has but what people really need to hear is how those features you use most "work."  It's a well built phone that I will use mostly for talking and limited texting.  My main concerns about a phone are its quality and its audio performance (both incoming and outgoing).  Because I have owned and used all three, I can compare this phone to the LG600G and the Motorola W376G and this one is the winner hands down!  Audio is as good or better than the Motorola 376 and even better quality of construction.  The 376 has a "flimsy" key pad not conducive to large finger tips and its silver case scratches easily.  The LG600G (or at least the one I received) had POOR quality audio coming and going - nobody sounded like them self and it was not sharp and clear.Samsung produced some features you don't see in the average "prepay plan phones."  The one I appreciate most is an added touch that speaks to the quality of Samsung products and it is the ability to adjust total sound levels up or down depending on your environment (normal, silent, driving and outdoors).They'll continue to improve as time goes on but for the present, the T301G is the best that TracFone offers and is an excellent phone.
Besides being a very good phone, this Samsung phone is Bluetooth enabled, has a nice camera, and the slider is easy to use. Loaded with good features but not complicated to use.
I love this phone! Samsung did a good job here. It has a calander butten to,the pic also look good. The only bad thing was it eats your air time to go on the internet. The camra buten is on the side and looks good with the phone. All around a vary good phone!
I was very disappointed in this phone. Despite Tracfone telling me it was good in my area it did not tell me that web access or multimedia support does not work in my area. I can't send a picture, browse the web or send email. I went to tracfone to download ringtones on my computer and the download failed, but I was still charged for the ringtone. Trying to get technical support I was only allowed to buy new airtime. Phone support personnel do not have any good english speaking skills. The three calls to tech support sounded like they were in a concert hall and they could not resolve my issues. Tracfone is fine for $20 phone and text service and a 3 month card for $20-40, but using tracfone with this phone is a disappointment and I don't recommend it unless you know that web & multimedia support is available in your area.
Very basic phone but thats all you need to make calls.  Cheaper for me that any other "unlimited" plan out there.  I only use it when I really have to ... not to chit chat...I am very happy.
I decided to purchase the w995a after carefully researching some viable alternatives such as the Nokia n86 8mp, the still-good and underrated n96, and the n82. I chose the Sony because it looks and feels better than the other phones, not because it IS better than the others. Let me explain.This phone is absolutely gorgeous. Its made of brushed metal, it feels amazing in your hand, and the sliding mechanism is nearly perfect. It's a feature phone, so you really don't have any options to customize the UI like you would with a symbian phone (i.e. the nokias mentioned above), but if this doesn't bother you (which it did not bother me), it really won't matter because the menu layout is really perfect and intuitive. It has great sound, it's beautiful when lit up, and the call quality is superb. That being said, it's simply not a "better" phone than the nokias I've listed.For one, the camera is simply "ok." Shots taken indoors will disappoint you, while those taken outdoors look very good. The video recording is old-school at 30fps QVGA while the nokias mentioned record DVD quality video at 30fps in VGA. Not to mention the nokias have carl ziess optics (regarded as one of the best lense makers in the world).I decided not to go with the Nokia N86, it's "closest" competitor. The N86 is a better phone, it has an 8gb hard drive while the w995a comes with an 8gb card. The nokia can be expanded with up to a 16gb card, has a variable aperture 8mp that takes exquisite photos, and has the ever- customizable symbian UI. But its ugly, and plastic; typical Nokia.So, to sum it up:THE GOOD:-beautiful-well built-beautiful interface-good pictures-excellent media player-best sliding mech. everTHE BAD:-other phones in its price range are arguable better-should take great pictures, not good ones-video recording is 2004-era phone-has a TFT 256k screen, while all others in its price range have AMOLED 16M screens.It was a tough choice, but for me, the look and feel of this one took the cake!
Updated: Got a different phone recently and it didn't have the battery cover wobble I had with my first phone. I decided to keep this phone as a keepsake as it could be the best of last phones without touch screen.This review is very hard for me as I lovED the phone so much for so many things  but there are few things that really ticked me off for making me hate the phone I love so much. Sounds complicated? Well, first let me tell why I returned the phone.Reasons I returned the phone:1. Battery cover doesn't feel solid when you hold the phone and press keys. You will feel your hand pressure slightly pressing the battery cover that causes movement. This got very irritating for me as this is otherwise an excellently built phone that looks super sexy. First I thought it could be with my phone. But the replacement phone had the exact same problem. Then I went to couple of Sony Style stores and noticed one store phone didn't have problem but another one had. So, looks like some lucky buyers may get a good one but not sure how long that will feel firm if you keep opening and closing the phone. I do that quite often to change SIM cards.2. Fonts are too big for beautiful display with 2.6" screen. Where were SE developers thinking? For example, the contacts screen shows only 6 contacts at once. With a slightly smaller fonts it would have displayed 8 contacts quite easily. They should have had a settings to choose small, medium, and large fonts and the current fonts should fall in X-large fonts.3. Kick stand. What a joke! The phone would have felt better if they left this completely or designed it in a way for users to remove it if they don't need it. You have to place phone in your shirt pocket with screen facing front or the kick stand would pop out easily. Another silly design by their engineers.4. 256-K colors. What are you thinking SE? When will you catch up with others here?Good things about the phone:If you already are familiar with Sony ericsson phones they have the best OS among non-smartphones. Frankly, they have many features better done than many smartphones including iPhone. First, the one's common to all new Sony Ericsson phones.Some of the cool things found in SE feature phones:Smart Dialing, ease of sending SMS, MMS, emails to a contact and the interface of MMS is super cool. I think they have the best implementation for MMS among all phones, FM radio, Accelerometer, Exchange ActiveSync (office outlook emails and calendar syncing and also to sync your google contacts and calendar with Push) and Call logs. With SE phones when in call logs you can select "Open" and it brings up all other contact information for that person like other numbers, email, etc. So, you can easily call that person at his other numbers or just send SMS, MMS, or email from logs. Also, D-pad arrow buttons can be used to create shortcuts (4 applications) to your favorite applications. This is one of my favorite feature in SE phones along with call logs and smart dialing as I hardly have more than 4 apps I like to use on a phone.When it comes to apps for the phone, there are plenty to feed your needs. Check out getjar.com or even  browse Sony Ericsson site from the native browser in the phone and you will see several free apps you can download. If you change the Location of the country in the sony ericsson site while browsing you will find more free apps as Sony seems to provide few different applications for different countries. Also, if you google you will find lot of Free Themes for the phone that will let you customize the look of the menus and standby screen.Some specialties with W995:1. In spite of the problems with the kickstand and the battery cover, the phone feels like a tank and it's sure to 'WOW WOW' your friends. One work around to fix the battery cover issue is to fold a small piece of paper and place it above the battery to stop the movement on the cover. Kickstand? Glue the stupid thing if you think you will never use it.2. Display looks super bright and clear even in sunlight.3. Walkman sound quality is simply amazing. I thought it sounded as good as Zune which I thought sounds way better than iPhone.4. It will be a joke if I mention having 3.5 mm audio jack is a plus with this phone. But, Sony finally did it. Good job there.5. WiFi, GPS, 3G on AT&T; all work like a charm.Some of my favorite FREE apps:Gmail, Google maps, Shozu, GetJar, TruTap, Fringe, Comeks, Opera Mini (of course), Blogger, TrackID.Even though I returned the phone I still am addicted to Sony Ericsson phones for their well thought out software for making calls and sending messages. Unfortunately, most of their recent phones have severe build quality issues. Most of them with the slider design or the battery covers. Still, I sometimes feel like buying W995a and deal with the problems it has as the goodness of the phone over shadows the problems. Moreover, there really is no perfect phone out there. At least for me :-(. Well, I even sold my iPhone after few months of use as I thought it feels too wide, battery doesn't last a full-day, and making calls is not as convenient as it's on Sony phones, or Windows Mobile phones, or Blackberries.The current $399.99 price on Amazon is tempting but I will try hard to resist until Xperia X2 gets announced this week.
The W995 is probably the best Sony Ericsson phone Ive used to date. I was considering higher end smartphones like the Sony X1 and Nokia N900 but couldnt bring myself to paying the high premium price. With the rate technology is going nowadays it would be worthless in 6 months, or the price would drop considerably. I got the W995 for a good deal and feel it was a good compromise. Physically the device looks very sleek. Build quality is very good with the brushed metal finish, definitely feels more sturdy than your average plastic phone. The screen is very nice as with most Sony phones Ive seen, very bright and vibrant display. Also I just learned that it is made out of scratch resistant material which is another plus. The biggest difference Ive noticed on the W995 compared to past phones Ive used is how snappy and fast the UI feels, especially things like browsing the internet over WiFi which is usually a chore on such a small device. Whether its the menus, GPS, scrolling on pages or turning the phone to landscape view (using the accelerometer) everything responds instantly. One cool thing I use the phone for (why I wanted WiFi in a small device in the first place) is to use it as a remote to wirelessly control my Logitech Squeezebox and it does it perfectly. Out of all the phones Ive owned, the SE UI remains my favorite because it is fast and to the point. The phone also includes an 8.1 megapixel camera, walkman with standard 3.5mm audio jack and 8GB memory card. Finally, Sony includes a 3.5mm jack on the phone which I dont know why they didnt do it sooner.. after all it is called a walkman phone. The camera also takes pretty decent photos, still some noise when indoors (or low lighting conditions) but much better than previous models. It wouldve been nice if it had the xenon flash over the LED, like on the C905. But the camera is not my first priority and its adequate for my uses. Ive found that as long as the subject is properly lit the phone will take good pictures. Using the phone for all the tasks mentioned above the battery has held up OK. Almost depleted at the end of the day but thats under heavy usage since its my new toy. For normal usage I think it could last 2-3 days before a charge. Guess Im just used to older SE phones which could last up to week, but they also did not have as many features as the W995. Overall, feature and quality wise the W995 is one of the best phones Ive used and probably the best non-smartphone.
I purchased this phone from Amazon a week ago, after researching for over a month looking to replace my classic iPhone 16GB. I was looking for an unlocked multimedia phone and was leaning towards the Nokia N85. I have to say that while most reviews out there favor the Nokia, I cave into the looks of the W995a. Someone at Cnet said it is not the sexiest phone around, but I beg to differ, the phone is very sleek, the slider mechanism is flawless and the overall presentation of the hardware is much higher end that any of the new (available) Nokias I've seen. It is slimmer that the N85, and the brushed metal case is very elegant and looks way better than the plastic on the mentioned Nokia handset.It should be noted, as mentioned by other reviewers, that this is not a smartphone, meaning that there is limited customization and most of the applications you get are web based, a la iPhone two years ago. Since this phone is unlocked (something I really desired, and the main reason I did not upgrade my iPhone) you have to play around with the settings a little bit to get the most out of the features of this phone. For instance, I had a hard time figuring out how to get it to stream videos over the YouTube application that comes as part of the media interface. I have MediaNet (EDGE) service from AT&T; and was not able to stream any video. Then I discovered that if you turn off the WiFi you will get it, though a bit chopped since EDGE is not the best for video streaming. That being said, I still have to figure out how to get it to stream over WiFi, which should be much better. Oddly, most reviewers elsewhere had the opposite problem: they were able to stream over WiFi but could not get it to stream over EDGE. The workaround for the WiFi problem seems to be opening extra ports on your wireless router, something I am completely illiterate on. So this is a major drawback of the phone: for a phone that is claimed to be the flagship multimedia device from SE, all these bugs and problems should not be present, especially at this price range. Not being able to access YouTube properly is just unacceptable. Paying customers should not have to waste time trying to figure out things engineers and technicians at SE get paid to do. If you go to the SE webpage and look for support for this device you will be able to get the settings sent to your phone for proper web navigation, email and picture messaging... but nothing for the video streaming problem.This phone comes with an 8.1 MP camera with single LED flash. The pictures outdoors with good natural light are OK, but things get much worse indoors or with limited light. If you already have a nice point and shoot, this phone won't replace it. If you are looking for a new phone and to upgrade an old point and shoot, then maybe this phone will save you some bucks. Don't get me wrong, the camera is very good, it's just that reading 8.1 MP on the specs creates very high expectations.The real treat of this phone comes from the music player. The sound is just amazing. I did not know how much sound quality I was sacrificing with my iPhone and iPods until I listened to the music player in this phone: I was blown away. It should also be mentioned that the phone comes equipped with FM radio, which is actually very nice. The bundled Media Go software serves as an iTunes-like application to manage all your media files on your phone. It has a drag and drop interface that makes easy to add any songs, videos or photos to your phone, and guess what? Also from your phone to your computer (take that iPhone!). As any new piece of software, Media Go is not without flaws. When transferring songs from my library into my phone I received many error messages about unsuccessful transfers. I was able to go back and fix some of those but sometimes there were so many that it was hard to keep track (the program puts a check next to all successful transfers but puts no visual indication whatsoever next to the unsuccessful ones). It also failed to display some of my iTunes artwork. However, if you already use iTunes as your music player and media organizing program, MediaGo will easily import everything from your iTunes folder. Another important caveat is that updating your phone's firmware erases the phone's internal memory (not the memory card or the SIM card), so it is important to back up your phone using the SE PC Suite before every update.Call quality is just OK. It can get pretty bad in noisy environments, e.g. supermarket. Google maps works great. So, to sum up, if you are looking for a great-looking phone with a superb music player, OK video player, and OK camera and do not want to sign up for a 2-year bleed-out contract, you should definitely consider the W995a.UPDATE (After 3 months with the phone): So even though the media Go experience hasn't been the best, I was happy overall with the phone. That is until today when I updated the firmware. I backed up the phone as recommended, and followed all the instructions. Then, after the update I restored my phone using my backup. The contacts failed to restore and now I have lost all my contacts, but what is worse, all the customizations I had for some of them, i.e., ringtones and photos. Not only that, but about half the music and all the videos I had in the memory card got erased, which was not supposed to happen, since only the phone memory is supposed to be cleaned during the firmware update. All these things are just unacceptable for a cell phone this expensive. I never had such problems with my old iPhone. I will try to get rid of this phone as soon as possible and go back to Apple's boring but reliable products.
I love the thin/slim design.I love the large screen and great graphics! This works especially well for web and gps.Much improved over previous SonyEricsson sliders I've seen or used.The only drawback is the poor battery life - esecially when using wifi, bluetooth, and internet capabilities. When using these options, I usually have to charge each night. I guess I guess I was spoiled when I was using a phone without these options since I only needed to recharge my phone every 3 or 4 days.
I am using this phone for over a month now and am very very pleased with it. It would have got 5-Star rating if not for the 3 design flaws with the phone.1. Kick Stand design can't be any worse. It is not firmly stuck in closed position. If Sony Ericsson couldn't get it right they should have skipped this hardware. It would have saved them money and made the phone feel more solid.2. Battery cover - like others said in the review doesn't feel firm. You can feel slight movement when you press fingers around the Sony Ericsson name on the back. It feels little annoying to see a well built phone choke on battery cover design. I first thought I got a bad phone and thought of exchanging it but after reading reviews here and other forums it looks like a pretty common not with just this phone but several SE phones. I put a paper folded above the battery and it solved this problem.3. The Call Button and End Call buttons are not positioned ergonomically. They are located little too far from the D-pad and it hurts the fingers to reach them from center.Good things about the phone:1. Looks way better than in pictures and is getting lot of compliments from everyone who sees the phone.2. Feels solid and super sexy. Easily the best slider phone I've seen.3. Bright screen and very readable even in bright sunlight.4. Came with lot of games, applications, and 8GB Memory Stick Micro.5. GPS reception, AT&T; 3G connection, WiFi connection - all are very good.6. First time I saw a 3.5mm audio output which is a great plus for me as I have several good headphones I can use.7. To compliment the 3.5mm audio output, this phone easily replaces my Zune 8GB during my workout sessions. Sounds just as good.8. The flash themes are very very good looking.9. Battery felt average the first few weeks but seem to have improved greatly after few weeks. I am heavy user of browser, office outlook emails, calendar, and songs listener and the phone easily lasts the entire day even after I talk on average over 60+ minutes.10. Works with my office Exchange Server to sync Outlook Email and Calendar as well as my Google mail.Amazon has the best price for this phone.TIP for W995a owners: Install Opera Mini 5 beta. The browsing experience is excellent with small fonts.
Small, sleek and slick. 8 MP camera takes really good shots during day, night time shots are ok. walkman and speaker is great quality. I have ATT service and it works much better than tmobile I had earlier. 8GB memory card is a awesome for pictures, movies and songs.
This phone is unbranded (meaning you cannot get it from your local at&t; or T-Mobile store here in the U.S.) So since the phone is unbranded forget about customer service help from your wireless carrier. All they tell you is contact Sony Ericsson. When you call Sony Ericsson customer service, they're very arrogant, and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their website.The phone is good looking and solid, however many reviewers in other places [...] have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles, and the kickstand is loose and doesn't stay in place. Unfortunately these problem occurs when your 30 days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refund!SE claims a 8.1 megapixel camera, but that is far from taking great pictures, at best their okay!The case IC-45 that SE offers for the phone is generic (meaning not specially made for this model) and when you put the phone in there the latch doesn't close and you have to force it. Forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it. The belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easily!The GPS program that come pre-installed is Wayfinder, and it's a European company not even comparable to Tomtom, Garmin. Telenav doesn't offer a program for this specific model and their CS is another story.So basically you're paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and SE.The music player (Walkman) is great and sounds great! Youtube application doesn't work, you have to mess with the firmware and it's not recommended for none tech savvy people! (this is where you find that at&t; doesn't care since it's not their branded phone and SE doesn't care since they really don't care after they sell you the device, and they tell you you should contact your carrier!).So, bottom line if you're tech savvy, you have $450+ to burn, and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean. However if you want tech support, cheaper phone, buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier.[...]
This was my first phone, so i can't really give you any comparisons to other phones.pros-Durable as a rock. The phone fell out of my pocket while i was on my bike and i dragged it while attached to my earphone. other than few scratches works like new.-Excellent battery life. better than all mp3 players ive had.-Excellent music player - with up to 16 gigs what more do you want.-8.1 mega pixel camera.-Powerful external lights and speaker.cons-Lack of apps-Lack of carriers in the US.-For an 8.1 pixel cam the pictures don't look that good.-Hard to find accessories. (cases, earhpones...)-Lack of high earphone volume.If you have an option go for the silver, the black looks way too bland.
I love the phone the camera features are wayyyy better than my actual camera the sound quality even better than before. I love this phone more than an iphone that every other person in the world has.

This was a gift that made my man very happy. It has a great camera and does good video.  Some of the controls are a small (volume rocker)
Pros: good reception, phone comes loaded with 300 minutes. Nice looking design with a bright, full color screen and buttons that light up blue. Comes with 20 MIDI ringtones, 2 games, and nice choice of wallpapers. Text messages cost 5 cents each. Easy to add minutes right from the phone or online.Cons: has a sort of "plastic toy" feel to it.  Very light, very small. Takes some practice to avoid pressing multiple buttons at once. Callers sound slightly muffled. Cannot download new ringtones or wallpaper. Not recommended for heavy phone users or newbies.This is a cheap, no frills phone. It is not a multimedia device. It doesn't take pictures, surf the internet, send emails, or play MP3s. It makes and receives calls and texts and stores phone numbers. To be honest it's a cute little cheap piece of plastic for people who want a cell phone for emergencies or to make occasional calls. Heavy callers, texters, or people that tend to be hard on their stuff should think twice before buying this phone.On the other hand if you are someone that tends to keep your phone nice and shiny, you are a reasonably competent technology user, and you only want to make the occasional call this is an attractive, reliable little phone for a good price.
I purchased this product three months ago and tried to speak with the customer service people in Guayana. The lady with whom I spoke was very helpful - though we had a language barrier. However, when I spoke with her supervisor - well, he was very rude and condescending. While the phone was okay, I could never recommend the customer service.
Got this phone for my kid to replace her vergin moble phone. It has good feature and works great. The phone also come with 300 free min. At 10 cent a minute and 5 cent per text,its a very good deal.
I purchased this phone to hook up with T mobile, I had many issues right from the start, the blackberry pin function would not work, the ringer functions would go back to the default, and other "minor glitches" including not always getting my emails. After 7 calls to t-mobile and hours of trouble shooting, T mobile contacted balckberry. Blackberry said that the phone was not new! It was used in England and was reprogrammed and the issues I was having with the phone will keep on happening as it was never made to be used with T-mobile. So according to blackberry Amazon sold me a used phone.
The phone was very pretty and looked brand new, however within 10 minutes of using the phone, the famous blackberry trackball began to give problems. It would scroll all the way to the left without warning and then stick, and then you could here the 'clicking' noise goin haywire! I thought i'd let it slide and see if the problem fixed itself, but it only got worse! The trackball would fail countless times and the phone would be rendered useless until i rebooted several times or just left it to work itself out, usually a few hours later. I wouldn't recommend buying this phone as there are much better blackberry's out there.PS I sent the phone back and am yet to receive a refund.
This equipment was sold like new, and is reconstructed, furthermore this lined, the broken cover and presents/displays problems in the connector of data.
the phone comes with several problems it comes with a jvm error i still could not usefull it
The phone arrived at time in good conditions, I had some problems with PIN in Movistar, Venezuela. I had to upgrade the software and it works fine. The phone came in english only, but with the new software was solvented, now I have it in Spanish. I repeat, works fine with Movistar, Venezuela, but need a software upgrade.
I bought my second Blackberry by Amazon, the first one which was a BB Pearl was excellent, but this time I can't say the same thing.I live abroad so I didn't see the telephone until the end of August, when I came back to my country I tried the phone and since the beginning it had a lot of problems, first of all the icon of BB messenger was not there, (I downloaded),the only language it had was English,  then it goes off if I talked  more than 1 minute and the noise you hear is awful. If you connect the phone it works perfectly, but even if you download a program it goes off, I reset it a couple of times but the problem continues. I really don't know what to do any suggestions? I also read all the reviews and they were fine.I feel very dissapointed and I'm not planning to buy more phones through Amazon.
phones are used and rebuilt, very bad, corrupt company.Compre 4 telefonos y vinieron malos con defectos por q son reconstruidos los telefonos son unos corruptos ladrones
I purchased my blackberry curve from another source and got a very good deal and I love it.  It works well for me because i am a full time college student.  It is literally like having a hand held computer.  Its great.  I can go right to face book with one touch of a button.  The phone also has wifi so if your phone has no service in an area but there is wifi you can use your phone.  Its an awsome phone to me overall and i only paid 100$ for it.  I got pretty lucky.
I purchase this phone thinking it was one of the best out there. But is, in fact, a complicated and boring phone.First of all, is SLOW, way too slow. If i want to take a picture, i literally have to wait for almost a minute and a half for the camera view appear, and then i have to wait another minute just for saving it.Another thing is the graphics, even though the cellphone has a big screen with a pretty good resolution, all the graphics and themes are horrible.I put an 8gb microSD card that i used in my previous phone (a nokia) but i cant use the phone as a pent drive, and is REALLY complicated to load photos, videos and music. And if you have a Mac, it is a pain because there's no official programs that can run in mac os x.My phone comes with this rare thing that start to call people without me doing anything... and is so annoying!!Bottom line, this phone is a waste of money!! I feel angry and so disappointed.
I bought this phone and after a week of use, did get locked!... Then after that, the phone does not turn on again!! So, when I did try to fix it at an expert phone company, they told me that the phone was used and repaired, so they can't fix it in this condition! So BEWARE!!... Stay away of this phone!...I don't know what happened with amazon.com, It's my fist bad experience in 5 years buying from you!!... You didn't help me with this case!
My wife used this phone for a few months with high expectations and came away very disappointed.  The UI of the phone appears to be tuned to hard-core "Blackberry nerds", and not casual users.  Basic settings like the ring tone require navigating a twisty maze of menus and options buried under an application icon.The worst UI flaw of this phone is the way applications are left in -exactly- the state they were in when you last used them, even if that state is useless or confusing.  Left a menu popped open when you exited?  It's still popped open when you come back, blocking access to what you're after.  Browsing photos last time you used your camera?  Now you've got to explicitly exit browse mode before you can take a picture.  This may sound like a minor detail, but trust me, in overall use it makes the phone very confusing and frustrating to use.While the call quality on the phone is generally good, it would mysteriously shut off the radio occasionally, making sure you don't receive calls.  By default, the "switch phone profile" control is on a side button that's easy to hit by accident, frequently shutting the ringer off and insuring you miss lots of calls.  Bluetooth access was never reliable.My wife was really interested in browsing the web phone the phone, but the web browser is a huge disappointment - it looks like something out of the 1990s.  Unless the web site has a specially designed "mobile" page, you can expect trashed formatting, difficult navigation, and very slow response.I think the Blackberry was a hot item ten years ago, but the iPhone has raised expectations far beyond what it accomplishes now.
I bought the phone in DLN enterprises, now I know why they send it With No Warranty, because they are OLD and mine was been used since 2006, it's the oldest phone I ever seen, they are thieves. I am very disappointed, I didn't give them even one star, I could give they nothing, be carefull before buying.
I just can say it works. I proved it in two companies: Movistar and Digitel. Sorry if i can't say more....

El producto que me vendieron no se puede registrar en ninguna telefonia en venezuela el pin aparece robado
I bought a Blackberry 8320 Unlocked Phone on Amazon and I may contract a service with DIGITEL, Venezuela. I worked for a few days without problem. From one day to another Blackberry services no longer work. I call my service provider here in Venezuela and told me they suspended my PIN. I need to contact the seller and do not know how to solve this problem. According DIGITEL tells me, the PIN is reported stolen, I buy it through Amazon and I have the receipt. I can do?Aglees GonzálezBlackberry 8320 Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM 850, 900, 1800, 1900, GPRS, EDGE, and 2 MP Camera--International with No Warranty (Titanium)
When i buy this product, I thought that was new, after an investigation I realized that the product dating from 2006 that are defective products, might not accept amazon sell this, my usb cable not working and my phone did not bring headphones do not recommend it is trash of asia, sorry for amazon llc but this time they made a mystake!
I got this phone in August of this year and the first time I looked at it I noticed that something was wrong. I bought it brand new and I definetely paid the price for a brand new phone. However, to my surprise, it really seemed to be an used phone as the screen lid was not very well attached to the phone. It had some air bubbles on the screen and the screen lid seemed to be manually re-attached to the phone. In addition the battery would die within 4 hours, even with very short phone usage. I went to an AT&T; store and decided to get myself I new battery and the battery problem is fixed.The phone has never been dropped off on the floor and I'm extremely careful with it and now the screen lid is coming off. So looking back to the original phone conditions when I got it, it leads me to think that I paid for a new phone and got an used phone instead. I'm very disappointed with the purchase because I feel I was fooled since I paid for something new and got an used phone.
I like the phone. I was able to use  it overseas, where my job takes me quite often.In addition, it was delivered on time
It was an easy transaction. I got what I paid for. And the phone arrived within 8 days.
hola es nelson pereira este producto me llego en mal estado el conector de corriente que es el mismo de introducir los datosestaba roto en la parte interna no estoy conteto con ustedes e tenidoque gastar mucho $ en el y no a quedado bien.......
YA TENGO MI EQUIPO EN CASA, SE VE NUEVO, LLEGO CON TODOS LOS ACSESORIOS, PERO NO ME TRAJO EL CD. LA EMPRESA DE ENCOMIENDA SE TARDO UN POCO, PERO SON MUY BUENOS Y RESPONSABLES (NORTHDELIVERY). EL PEDIDO LO HICE A  DLN Enterprises. YA LE PUSE EL CHIP Y FUNCIONO. COMPREN CON ELLOS
He comprado el teléfono en las empresas DLN, Compre el celular y asta la fecha no lo e visto por que esta en el buzón retenido por no poseer factura.
Performs as I expected, I only had to reinstall the software with the latest release, and hook up with my cell company, and started using the 8320.It has things I didnot know it had, works beautiful.Only thing to improve: the desktop software.
I have been using SmartPhones since 2000 and I feel this is one of the best phones I never had. It is easy to handle y help me to keep just one source of contacts for all my applications. The feature that keeps updated my friends data from Facebook is a +++. I hope to keep discovering new features that make me my life more easy.
Compre uno y esta chevere funcionando con Digitel de Venezuela. Si tienen problemas lo pueden canbiar y son muy atentos en responder y cambiartelo por uno nuevo. Eso me paso a mi con el primero y de inemdiato me enviaron uno nuevo que funciona de maravilla. Completamente desbloqueado. Lo recomiendo y seguire comprando con ellos por ser tan atentos y prestar un servicio de primera
bought this phone with HassleFreeCell, 4 keys didnt work, so i have to pay to fix it a "new" phone YEAH RIGHT...is not made in canada btw..
A todo aquel que quiere tener un Blackberry recomiendo adquirir este telefono, lo tiene todo, incluso WiFi. Tal vez un punto debil podrian ser sus dimensiones (en lo personal me gustan los telefonos un poco mas pequeños).
We've had this phone for about 6 months now and just LOVE it!  Feels great in the hand, easy to maneuver through the menus, strong battery life.  Makes checking email, sending texts, reading/opening files, surfing internet so easy!  Just a great phone!!!
hello, I can not register the blackberry blackberry service tell me that is blocked and what contact you so that you unlock
The battery came with defects but after shopcell knew about it, they sent me back a new battery wich works for free. Their reaction was fast although I was lucky I was still at the US to get the battery. Just next time you should especify the phone doesnt come with all the usual accesories
Good afternoon, it buys a cellular telephone BLACKBERRY 8320 Unlocked Phone--International with Warranty (Titanium) I never think that to buy blackberry by serious Internet in amazon the worse thing, since I was deceived and swindled by a called company ShopCell that offer me a new telephone  and me damaged shipment one, since to one week of use I go out and not turn on, I take to the technicians and they never informed that ram memory this damaged, does not keep the information, ARE NOT LET SWINDLE BY THIS COMPANY, DO NOT BUY to HIM TO THIS COMPANY
I was happy when I got my new Blackberry, but there was no backlight in the keyboard. The solution was to put a piece of paper behind the battery and it worked fine. But this shoul no happen in a new phone. For anything else its a cool phone.
Hi, good nights... I have two questions for the storewhat is the containing of the box?!and does it includes a stick of micro-sdI hope you can answer my concernings....Thank You!Gabriel Peñalver
Prior to my purchasing this phone, I did a (what I thought was) through review at the AT&T; local store.  THE ONLY REASON that I didn't purchase the phone directly from AT&T;, was because it was a gift to my niece.  She had been involved in an accident and her cell phone was damaged, and no longer worked.  As with many young people today, this situation was extemely disrupting to her and her communication of friends, network.  Her current contract with not up for renewal and thus she was left without a phone.When I was asked to help, I stepped in and took all of the details of her request to assist in getting her another cell phone.  Being a long time customer of Amazon, my first (and last) choice was to view the sight.  I was very excited when I found (what I thought was the perfect match) the cell that she wanted.  I purchased the phone and had it delieverd directly to her.  Between 24-72 hours later, she contacted me to relay that the phone wasn't exactly what she wanted nor did it have the features on it that AT&T; phones (of which I thought that I was purchasing one in the same AT&T; compatible phones!) and that it (the phone) was more compatible to another company/brand.I asked for some assistance and was not pleased with the seller's response to "Only assist" in bringing in the phone closer to an AT&T; model/compatable celluar.  Bottom-line........I ended up purchasing (on my AT&T; account) another cell phone for her.  The one that I purchased from Amazon.com, was put back in the box and set aside.Larry T. Russell
Hello and thank you for reading this review.I am a phone app developer and have had some 'face time' with the Nokia N97.  I'll let you know some of the more in depth details so you can decide if this is the right phone for you or not.  There are many positive features about this phone, but a few potential pitfalls for power users as well.  Average users will probably never notice any of the pitfalls, but probably will never use some of the best features of this phone either to justify the cost.This is the new Nokia flagship phone and it packs almost every feature anyone could ever want.  It has a DVD quality camcorder with sample videos found here:[...]Notice how well the mic picks up the creeks of the boats in Monte Carlo, and how rich the colors look.  That is due to the Carl Zeiss lens Nokia has put in.  The quality is also great and can be sent directly to the TV via the TV out cable, but I would recommend making a DVD from the memory card as the quality of the cable isn't as good as the DVD quality this phone provides.  Video starts up quickly, which is an improvement from the previous versions.The pictures taken by this phone are of very good quality.  Many consumers are fooled by 'megapixels' (mp).  Well folks, after 5mp or so, mp doesn't mean much.  All it does is make your picture size better, it does NOT increase the QUALITY.  I assume most of us aren't pro graphic artists that need huge pictures to zoom in on the most minute detail, and if you are, then you probably don't need this review :PThe lens and picture quality of this phone is superb, but not as good as the Samsung 8 sadly.  It is by far tho, one of the best mobile phone cameras around.  You can notice some problems in darker areas and they went with a dual LED flash instead of the Xeon gas flash.  The Xeon gas flash would have provided much better lighting in low light situations, however as a phone enthusiast I feel it's good enough.View sample images from thesymbianblog.com:[...]and[...]Judge for yourself.This phone is a TRUE smart phone OS which means you can download apps for it such as VPN software to connect to your office network and apps such as PUTTY or RDP clients to remote control real computers at the house/office.  With 3G speeds the potential is limitless.Now for the bad.  Nokia decided to use the old ARM II CPU found in the N85, 95, etc. phones but increased the clockspeed (mhz) slightly.  We were looking forward to the new TI cpu which would have provided much better speeds, at the cost of battery life.  They also stuck with 128mb ram with about 80mb available after boot up.  I don't know about you but after I load up all of my apps and get cranking, I eat that up.  I was able to notice some slow down in the pre-build when I:-opened up several websites w/ flash content-ran the music player-opened up 'widget' applications-tried basic functionalityMost users will probably never do that.  If you are a power user, then you probably already know about the Samsung Omnia HD which boasts of similer features, but also the new faster CPU and dedicated GFX chip which means you can play Ipod type 3d games with ease.  The final point is with the potentially underpowered CPU, you will not be able to play the super high resolution videos the Samsung can play.Finally this phone has the slower 3G speeds which don't reach 7mbps, will you need 7mbps?  Probably not.  I think for 99% of users, the current 3G speeds offered by this phone are fine.I tried out the phone and pre-ordered, I can't wait to get it.  I can't wait to develop some 'widget' applications for it and really see the power of this phone with the newer more stable build.Thank you for reading this, feel free to respond, yell, scream, or ask any questions!
[This is an updated review; some of the issues that existed when the N97 was first released have since been addressed.  Also, I have moved some of the more elaborate details of the original text into a new review ("A Guide") that I created for the white version.]Nokia E- and N-series phones have for some years now had, by far, more capabilities than anything else out there - but they have not always been the sexiest or had the widest mass appeal.  Plus, although Nokia sell more smartphones than anyone else worldwide, they have not targeted or marketed the US market very heavily (thanks in part to our combination of non-standard wireless technologies and frequencies, consumers' focus on style over substance, and Nokia's unwillingness to cater to the fairly heavy-handed branding and crippling of functionality demanded by US network providers).Much of that is changing with the N97.  As you can see it definitely has the visual appeal.  Also, its main enhancements over the most recent N-series phones (such as the N95, N96 and N85) are user interface centric:>> 640x360 WVGA LCD>> Touch screen>> QWERTY keypad>> Faster CPU (ARM11 at 420 MHz vs. 332/369 MHz in the N95/N85, and two ARM9 cores at 265 MHz in the N96)>> Configurable widgets for the home screenThere are a couple of other improvements as well:>> 32GB of built-in storage, µSDHC card slot for up to 32GB more (Nokia always advertise only the tested configuration, 16GB)>> Additional sensors: Magnometer (electronic compass), ProximitySo, yes, Nokia have finally bit the dust and moved onto the post-iPhone touch screen bandwagon.  But whereas Apple borrowed quite a few UI elements from the Motorola Ming, and other manufacturers in turn tried to copy the iPhone look and feel, Nokia has taken a decidely different approach: They have taken most of their new design elements from their own Internet Tablets line (e.g. exchangable home screen widgets, keypad layout, etc).  They have also done so while keeping the underlying OS from their previous smartphones, Symbian/S60.I don't care much for this direction.  To this day, I would take the E90 any day over the N97, had it been released with support for North American 3G (UMTS) bands.  The E90 does not have a touch screen, but does have a numeric keypad on the outside in addition to the QWERTY inside the shell -- this allows you to "type" with one hand using the native T9 predictive input, and mostly keep your eyes elsewhere while dri... eh... walking.As it is, Nokia ended up with touch screen phones (starting with the 5800 XpressMusic) kicking and screaming - it kindof shows.  The user interaction paradigm is a little odd at times -- probably mostly due to the S60 legacy. [Lipstick/pig joke deliberately omitted here]. For instance:>> You need to double-tap on icons (once to select, once to open)>> They still retain "soft keys" on the side to access menus an the like (though now they are located on the display itself, and occupying quite a bit of space).  The home (previously "standby") screen has three soft keys; the left and middle are always "Options" and a a dial pad, while the right one is configurable ("Contacts") by default.There are some other usability issues with this phone as well:>> Copy & Paste functionality is a bit more cumbersome.  There are no keypad shortcuts; with the keypad open, cut/copy/paste are only available via the menus!  Moreover, not all text input screens have such a menu available - in which case you need to close they keypad in order to bring up a virtual numeric keypad with a context menu at the top of the screen.  Or, if you use an external Bluetooth keyboard, you can press Ctrl-X/C/V.>> The keypad layout is a little unusual at first.  The navigation keys are on the left (which some gamers like, but I don't).  The space bar is in an odd location on the right.  Mixed alpha/numeric input is cumbersome because the digits 0-9 are "shifted" via a key on the right side of the keyboard, while the standard shift key is on the left.  Plus, in some dialogs you get a helpful numeric keypad on your screen, but it defaults to text input (2=abc, 3=def, etc) rather than give you quicker access to digits! (Why, Nokia?  You already have the keyboard?  What are you thinking?).  That said, the tactile feedback is good, not too "firm" or "clicky", but with a good feedback.>> There is a nice E-mail status widget for the home screen, but you can only have one of these.  If you have multiple e-mail accounts (e.g. for work/home), you can only monitor one of them.  The same goes for some of the other widgets too.>> Direct media controls are gone (the N95/N96/N85 had a dual slider design giving ready access to play/pause/previous/next).  There is a home screen widget available, but it is hardly as convenient (e.g. if you are using an application, typing a mail, etc).Some other limitations that I found so far when compared to their previous N-series phones:>> The amount of available RAM (dynamic memory) available for applications is low (around 55MB, versus about 75MB in the N85/N95).  UPDATE 2009-07-01: This may not be an issue after all. With the latest firmware update from Nokia, the available memory seems to have increased to about 65MB - and in general, the only time I have had a "out of memory" error was while running RoadSync, which explicitly warns that it is not compatible with this phone.>> Adobe Reader is no longer included in the price of the phone. It is still preinstalled, but now only on a trial basis.  If you want to continue using it after some days (about 3 weeks I gather), you need to purchase it - similar to QuickOffice.>> The number of applications available for this phone is somewhat more limited; this is only the second Nokia phone to use the new S60 5th edition user interface w/touch-screen support.  Although most of the older applications will still run on it, there may be some that don't.  Notably, Nokia Internet Radio is not included,  nor is it available for download yet. :(>> Synchronization of phone contacts/events/todos is not yet supported on the Mac, as Nokia have not as of the time of this writing released an iSync plugin for it. (You can still synchronize with Microsoft Exchange, use the built-in "Switch" application to copy contacts from another Nokia phone, or you can transfer contacts as vCards from another phone).>> Getting Bluetooth Stereo Audio (A2DP/AVRCP) to work with your Bluetooth car stereo is hit and miss.  More on my experiences in this regard in the "white" model review.>> The UI is generally a bit "sluggish" - moreso than my previous phone, the Nokia N85, despite a faster processor.  The touch UI probably has a lot to do with this.  (Then again, both the N95 and certainly the N96 did not break any speed records by any stretch of the imagination).All that said, most of these issues are software/firmware related, and will improve over time.  As it is, the N97 is perhaps the most capable phone on the planet today -- a jack of all trades, if you will.  It certainly has improved over previous N-Series phones in a number of ways as well:>> E-mail reading is dramatically improved - especially in clients with HTML support (e.g. System SEVEN). Also, because most of these integrate into the "Messaging" application, messages are listed much more nicely in the mailbox -- the larger screen is used very well here.>> Web browsing - what a pleasure. This was the main attraction of the iPhone - but I think the N97 surpasses it. Kinetic scrolling, variable zoom, and quite a speed improvement.  Of course the previous strengths are there too - the way the "Back" button brings up snapshot views of your previously viewed pages, Flash, etc.>> The phone has quite a "solid" feel to it, without feeling like a tank.To be sure, there are phones out there with better cameras (e.g. Samsung Pixon), more newbie-friendly user interfaces (iPhone), better support for a variety of corporate e-mail standards (Blackberry), and so on - but hardly any that have the combination of all these features in one device.  The closest may be the close cousin Samsung Omnia HD, which:>> runs the same OS, has the same screen resolution and many other features>> has a better camera (yeah "megapixel blur" but also optics), HD video recording>> faster CPU (600 MHz vs 420 MHz)but:>> does not have good support for U.S. 3G frequencies, and>> does not have a keypad (QWERTY or otherwise).These two shortcomings pretty much kills the Omnia HD as an alternative for me.Also, aside from the N85, the N97 is the first Nokia phone to support tri-band UMTS ("worldwide" 3G).  This means that you will get 3G speeds (mostly) where they are available: 850/1900 MHz for AT&T; Wireless and other carriers in the Americas, 2100 MHz elsewhere (including Japan).  That said, for complete worldwide coverage you would need "penta-band" UMTS, with the additional inclusion of 900 MHz for Europe, and 1700 MHz for T-Mobile USA.  No phones currently support all of these bands.  NOTE: There is also a "standard" version of the N97 for international markets, with support for 900/2100 MHz internationally and 1900 MHz for roaming in the Americas.You probably won't see this phone subsidized on contract by a carrier anytime soon.  The primary candidate would be AT&T; - but it looks like they have passed on it (perhaps they don't believe it has mass market appeal).  Then again, if you are looking to get this phone, you are not likely to be the type of person who would accept their lockdowns in the first place.  Look no further than the differences between the unlocked Nokia E71 versus AT&T;'s E71x for a prime example: In AT&T;'s version, various features are disabled (keyboard shortcuts for copy&paste;, the S60 native e-mail reader, network selection), and instead a number of non-removable, non-renamable, non-movable AT&T; specific applications are installed.Another upside of buying an unlocked phone like this is that it may cost you less in the long run.  It seems I'm unable to get actual numbers past Amazon's editors here (see comments) - but if you have a standard SIM from AT&T;, you can plug it into this phone and add a standard "data unlimited" feature.  In contrast, if you get a smartphone on contract from AT&T;, your data plan will be at least twice as expensive - which adds up over the 2-year contract term to cover (at least) the price difference between most of these and the unlocked N97.  Plus, you would of course not need to renew your contract with an unlocked phone like this.  AT&T;'s generally subsidize their phones a couple of hundred bucks versus the unlocked equivalent (except the iPhone, where the subsidy is closer to four hundred, but where the more expensive data plan is mandatory).Finally, if you take your unlocked phone with you abroad, you can walk into a store and get a pre-paid SIM -- that way you local tariffs, rather than pay (outrageous!) roaming fees to AT&T.;Now for a couple of practical aspects and caveats:>> If you are looking for a unique look, go for the white model, not this black one.  Some also think it is better looking.>>If you are going to use the N97 in your car, to play music or for GPS turn-by-turn directions, do yourself a favor and get a cradle/mount for it.  For instance, there is a Brodit cradle (available from ProClipUSA) specifically designed for it; this is one part of a two-part mount, the second part will be specific to your vehicle; you can get one from either ProClipUSA, PanaVise, or Pro-Fit International - they are all compatible.  Or, if you want a universal holder, the Bracketron Grip-IT works nicely for the N97, and can also be put on the same vehicle specific mounts.Finally, if you are looking to get this phone, it is important that you get it for the capabilities, not ease of use.  Like other Symbian/S60 phones, getting used to it takes a little persistence and discovery, but it will grow on you over time as you explore it and learn more about its esoteric features.
When I first learned of the n97's release, I was excited.  I had been waiting for Nokia to release another ground-breaking phone, like the n95 of years ago.  The n96 wasn't it, nor was the n85.  Then the n97 came - with a touchscreen and QWERTY keyboard to boot!  I was sold at once, but did all of my research anyway and found it to be full of innovative ideas and modern must-haves.  I bought it nearly two weeks ago at a reasonable discount from NokiasUSA after Amazon ran out of stock and jacked up the price.**If you read the specs, you will find all of the high points, but here are some more:-I found the phone to be fast and responsive when given input.  The keyboard is phenomenal - the key spacing and feel is just right and the offset space bar is not as big of a deal as it is often made out to be.  The only thing I could ask for is a little click to acknowledge the button was pushed, though if the sound is on, the phone makes a small noise.  The keyboard could have been even bigger yet if they dropped the D-Pad, which I rarely find myself using as it is a touchscreen (maybe make it a secondary feature for other keys?).-The GPS unit quickly finds a satellite signal (faster than most Tom-Toms) and accurately places you on a detailed map.  The turn-by-turn voice directions work well, except they do not read the street name.  Best of all, it doesn't make you agree to do-not-drive-as-you-use-this-device waivers every time the program launches.-The call quality is excellent.-No contract and not bogged down with un-deletable carrier apps and tacky logos that remind you who bought your soul.**The bad and the ugly:-My first thought when I handled it was, "a little chintzy, eh?"  It does give off the impression for a little while, primarily because of the battery cover.  They used a plastic, snap-on/ pry-off cover whose snaps are easily bent out of shape, but did not break and easily bent back.  The rest of the construction, especially the hinge, seems to be very solid now that I have used it extensively.-The 5MP camera takes remarkable photos and videos, unless you want to use the flash, which is too close to the lens and whites out a third of the image.  Thinking about this more, I decided Nokia has used a very similar camera since September of 2006 when the first n95 debuted and such a quirk is unacceptable in something that has been around the technology world for so long.-The battery life is terrible.  With normal use, it will most likely get 24-36 hours.-Reception is bad.  The internal antenna does not pickup signal where my Blackberry does and my Samsung smartphone (4 years ago) before it did, to include my apartment in Boston (not exactly East Reeve, Wisconsin).-The FM transmitter is hardly worth having.  After trying numerous stations I know to be unused in my area, the reception in my newer Audi with rear-mounted antenna was terrible unless I held the phone out the sunroof.  I assume if you have a hood mounted antenna, it would be a little better (does anyone know?).  UPDATE (4 July) - In two different cars with front mounted antennas and my home stereo the FM transmitter has still proved worthless.  You can hear the music, but it comes through with more static than its worth.-The resistive touchscreen is outdated and  somewhat unresponsive.  Resistive touchscreens are great if you wear gloves, and if they are huge, but that doesn't happen on a mobile phone.  Resistive touchscreens use a grid-like system to figure out where they've been touched, as they have invisible lines that make a grid across the screen.  When the selected area is touched, the corresponding up/down and left/right lines are pushed against sensors on the screen's edge and send the information to the processor.  Capacitive screens measure minute differences in its electric field cause by the conductive human body and are generally much more accurate.-The inertia scrolling is not as one would expect, probably because of the aforementioned screen.  It does not matter how fast the screen is flicked, the information displayed travels the same measly distance and stops rather quickly no matter what, if it works at all.  Navigating web pages is probably the only reason I would use the provided D-Pad just because the scrolling with the touchscreen is so terrible.  UPDATE (4 July) - The inertia scrolling is not as terrible as I first said, but does vary with applications and takes some getting used to.-The accelerometer, which detects the direction the phone is tilted, is often incorrect and the phone is very slow to change the screen's display between portrait and landscape.-Oftentimes, the phone must be unlocked 2 or 3 times to get the LCD's backlight to turn on.  This may be a software or a hardware malfunction, I do not know.-The talk and end button are not raised but should be, especially because the phone does not acknowledge them having been pressed for a second after.  Plus, real buttons are always preferred.**Then there's the software:-The user interface is not so good.  Every application has an options menu, but after the application has been customized, you probably will not find much need for any of the other options except exit, which is buried at the bottom of the menu and needs to be scrolled to.-The phone screen is inefficiently laid out.  On the screen there is a "Call" and "End" button, both of which are physical keys on the phone itself, as well as a "Contacts" button which can be found on the previous screen.  I would rather just see bigger numbers.  Also, the phone is setup to display two lines of numbers and forces a single number from the area code on on the second line when I would rather like to see bigger number buttons and ALL US numbers on a single line.-The homescreen widgets do not update as freely as one might like, the AccuWeather is rarely connected and my Hotmail account will ONLY refresh manually, even with full service.  The FaceBook app is good.-The homescreen has a button on it to change the sound profile, but tapping the power button brings up the same menu - Nokia should just get rid of the redundancy and dedicate the space to, well, uhhh, anything else.-No QWERTY keyboard option on the touchscreen.-Being able to run multiple apps is great, but switching between them shouldn't mean a fight with the options menu, there should be an external button to switch between them.  UPDATE (4 July) - After further messing around, I found one can hold down the Main Menu button, the silver button to the left of the flat Talk / End buttons, for two seconds to bring up a menu with all open apps.-The homescreen has an option to compose a new message, but not one to read old messages.  The button should be dedicated to going into the messenger application instead.-Half of the menus require a double touch while the other half require a single touch.-Plus a dozen smaller "Oh, that's silly" features not worth mentioning.-My phone has needed to be reset because one or more different things were not working correctly at least once a day, though it has never frozen completely.  Once, strangely, the touchscreen would highlight the selected app/item, but fail to execute the command completely.--UPDATE (4 July)-One can hold down the Talk flat key for two seconds to activate voice commands which can do anything from call a contact to open an app.  This is very slow and often incorrect and cannot be customized to one's voice.  Once activated, there is a bar that runs for about six seconds, far longer than any command would take to say, and then takes a little while to process, before bringing back a series of possible matches.  If you don't say anything else, it will automatically select the first option after another short duration.  I could navigate manually to almost anywhere twice before the voice command finds the desired function, if it finds it at all.  On the upside, users can customize what they want to say to the voice commands by typing (not speaking) the desired input to find some combination the phone can more easily recognize, though this is tedious and annoying.-When paused and exited from, the music play can remain on the homescreen with the Launch, Previous, Play, and Next options available.-The native video player has a very limited number of playable file types and I have not found a third party video player that works for the n97 yet.--END UPDATE (4 July)--UPDATE (23 July)I might be getting nit-picky with these software anomalies, forgive me, but I expect more from a $700 phone.The battery life, with average use, averages 48 hours now.  I think eliminating the default AccuWeather widget from the homescreen helped out as it was constantly updating and crashing (and never that accurate).The new software update has been out for almost three weeks.  It is an improvement and has fixed the backlight problem, amongst others, though not compeltely.  Oftentimes, there is still a lengthy delay between unlocking the phone and the backlight turning on (2-4 seconds).  Additionally, closing the screen will occasionally exit whatever program is running at the time. I notice this most frequently with the built in web browser and Nokia Sports Tracker.  The GPS reception can be quick as lightning sometimes, but others it will not find a signal for an eternity.Compared to Opera Mini, the standard web browser is slow.  Unfortunately, Opera Mini is quirky when dealing with the touchscreen.  When it works, the SportsTracker is an excellent program, though Nokia has taken the n97 / 5800 version off their web page and it must be found through a third party.When the contacts menu is used to find someone to call or message, a new app is opened to perform the calling or messaging, thus when a second call or message is attempted to be made by navigating through contacts, the contacts menu opens as it was left with the last person dialed still highlighted on the screen.The symbol button is downright annoying.  It accesses a list of symbols, most of which are already on the keyboard as secondary or tertiary options, and is located right next to the space bar and is hit frequently on accident.  I would rather just see a bigger space bar than a useless key (at least I have never used it).--END UPDATE (23 July)--UPDATE (06 OCTOBER)I've gotten used to a lot of the quirks, though I'm still not entirely happy with them.  The single most annoying feature is the inconsistency when turning the screen on - half of the time a message appears saying the key lock must be turned off when that is the only key I've pressed.  It takes 3-5 seconds to go away, crippling anyone's intimate desire to use their ridiculously expensive phone on command.The phone's battery life seems to be much longer in Europe.  I can go on a three day weekend, using the GPS, phone, and music features in moderation, without a charge.  Maybe the European system is more efficient?--END UPDATE (06 OCTOBER)Overall, it is a good phone, but certainly not worth the money.  I recommend you wait for the first (SECOND) major software update to be released and reviewed before purchasing.
After installing the battery and turning on the device:As an illuminated white screen became adorned with those blue branding letters, the friendly handshake, and the ubiquitous Nokia jingle, I could only think of immediately setting up a Bluetooth partnership with my MacBook. All seemed to work perfectly as I keyed in location, date, and time information, and then it appeared...the home screen and its grouping of widgets. When the AT&T; network secured its grip on the SIM inside and brought the 3.5G reception signal to life, my index finger proceeded to explore the interface. I kept a word document to record my initial experiences with the N97.-Bluetooth setupBluetooth partnership setup with my MacBook Aluminum was flawless. Network access (a.k.a. Tethering) appears to be possible, so I will test this later with my bluetooth connection.Update: Tethering the N97 network connection via Bluetooth was just as efficient as the E71.-Missing Sync for SymbianHad absolutely no trouble downloading Missing Sync for Symbian to the N97. I figured it logical that if the XpressMusic 5800 running S60 5th edition was supported, then another device with the same OS should work just fine. All of my PIM data of contacts, calendar events, and tasks synched successfully to my N97 with no problem. Even the contact photos synced properly! Bluetooth proximity syncing worked perfectly whenever my MacBook was turned on with the N97 nearby, but there was an error message with a stop sign graphic that appeared after each sync session: "Unable to execute file for security reasons". After about a second this pop-up disappeared and all was well, so it did not bring any inconvenience. I can only assume it stemmed from this model not being officially supported by the Missing Sync app. Overall, I am very pleased to see that this crucial application continues to be supported through the newest NSeries device.-Stereo speakersWhile it was nice to have stereo speakers from the mono variant of the E71, their volume was not impressive in comparison to what I remembered from owning the N95. They were certainly not bad and did give a suitable audio playback experience. Ring tones and alerts had no problem in being heard throughout the day amidst public surroundings. The speakerphone was acceptable in volume and a bit louder than the E71.-Music playerThere was nothing special about the music player other than its widget for the home screen and the enlarged album art for the Now Playing screen. An unexpected surprise was the absence of visual art effects that I remembered from the N95 and E75. There was a FM transmitter included with the N97 that was simple to configure with my car stereo, but my use of this would be an extreme rarity due to my iPods.-Contact SearchSearching for a particular contact was interesting with a new type of searching that reminded me of the SureType technology from the BlackBerry Pearl. When the text field was touched, blocks of alphabetic characters applicable to the first letters of all contacts filled the screen. When a letter was selected, all blocks were then narrowed down to only the characters that could be second to that first selection. As each of these blocks was touched, the contact list itself was also narrowed down appropriately to the possible matches.-CameraThe 5 megapixel Carl Zeiss lens was very nice for stills and video. I was amazed at the 16:9 widescreen ratio for the captured video footage as well as the included video light feature. Playback of the MPEG4 formatted file on my Mac happened in a default widescreen view in the Quicktime player and showed acceptable results via the 30 frames per second with suitable sound recording. The image mode for the still pictures appeared to not support widescreen in any way. One nice touch was the live preview window for setting color tones and selecting a white balance feature.-PortabilityThe sizing of the N97 was similar to my E71 and iPod Touch and I had no problems carrying it in my pocket despite its thicker dimensions.-Reception/Call qualitySignal strength was no different than my E71, but I did run into a situation with the first few calls I made on the device. A friend of mine on a voice call noticed a faint hissing noise in the background on his end, but I didn't hear any of it. While it could have been my friend's iPhone, it was also clear that the only plausible fault in this situation was the N97 since every previous call with the E71 had been trouble-free. Since then, every call thereafter was clear and normal just like the E71.-Nokia Email clientDifficulties certainly came with the downloaded Nokia Messaging app for email access. I was not surprised to see that the enhanced email client of Messaging was not preloaded to the N97 since it's main purpose is multimedia. However, some software issues from this particular app irritated me.First off, I did learn that SMS Provisioning is the message to watch out for when the Nokia Email .sis file is already downloaded to the handset. Whenever I had a link sent to my device via text message from the Nokia Messaging site, I would always click on that link and be forwarded to email setup for the native S60 app. I used to repeatedly get frustrated and wonder why the other client setup was not being initiated. Upon searching Google, I read that there are two messages sent to the device from the Nokia Messaging site. Of these two messages, the first one was to essentially be ignored and the second (SMS Provisioning) would pop-up automatically on-screen. This discovery made every future installation of the Nokia Messaging app much easier.However, I guess that I was not out of the woods just yet. After a couple hours of diligent email message updating, the touch response on the app was gone...completely gone! No matter how many times I would exit and reopen, the listing of incoming emails would not respond to either finger or stylus input. After almost a half hour of seething, I deleted the application from my N97 and proceeded to resume email access with the native S60 messaging client. While much more reliable, it was ungodly clunky and lacked the well designed interface of Nokia Messaging. I soon quit this alternative to make another attempt to use my previous email access.Everything worked fine with the installation process, but there was trouble with the login for my mailbox password. There were no spelling errors and I was certain that no caps lock or number lock was activated, but the login error kept popping up nonetheless! After about a half hour wait, I was able to log on successfully and the Nokia Messaging app worked perfectly ever since.One thing that did catch me off guard was opening attachments. On the E71, attachment links were usually shown under the email address information at the top of the email entry. This didn't appear to be the case with the N97, for even though an attachment was listed at the top of an email under the sender's name, it was not a clickable link. I eventually discovered a "Details" tab above the entire email. When this tab was tapped, it expanded to display all of the sending details of the message (Subject title, time and date of sending, "TO:" field) along with a clickable link.When an email is received from a N97 contact with a stored picture, the same picture will appear in the upper left corner of the message.The only con for this email client was that it appeared to work independently of the other native S60 apps such as Notes, Active Notes, Photo Browser, etc. Whenever I tried to send a photo or note via email directly from an alternate app, the N97 would always want to send it via the built-in messaging application instead of the downloaded app from the Nokia Messaging site. Since I did not have my Gmail coming through that older client, there of course was the prompt to set up a new mailbox. Nokia Messaging's lack of integration with the other onboard Nokia apps is somewhat distressing, especially when the Facebook widget has flawless integration!!Update for 6/27/09I deleted the Nokia Messaging application from my N97 again. Even though there were alerts played aloud with incoming emails, I could not access the inbox via the widget that had completely blacked out. A couple attempts of deleting the email widget and reinstalling it produced no results whatsoever. Being that the Nokia Messaging app for Symbian 5th edition did not support HTML and was not fully integrated with the rest of the apps on the device, I decided to resume with the native S60 client for email. This is truly unfortunate for a flagship device that was supposed to have so much potential.-Google MapsThis maps application is just as perfect as the version on the E71, but is made even better through a bigger screen with touch navigation. Installation was no problem via the S60 web browser.-Battery Life/noise malfunctionI noticed that some touch inputs on the screen did not generate haptic feedback. Every now and then a faint, high-pitched whistle-like sound would emanate briefly...very strange. While I wanted to associate this with low battery levels, this same lack of haptic vibration also took place when the battery was fully charged.Speaking of battery life, the N97 was certainly not the E71 and barely lasted for one day on a full charge. This got even worse when a bluetooth headset was used for voice calls in addition to music listening. One morning after having used the GPS-intensive Nokia Sport Tracker for an hour with the music player, I took a voice call that lasted for 2 and a half hours and used my bluetooth headset. Upon hanging up the phone, it immediately died from low battery levels. Not once did I ever have this kind of experience on a previous Nokia device...not once! It was certainly a must to have an auto charger handy and be diligent in charging this device EVERY night.-Notification lightThe notification breathing light worked in two successive pulses when it was alerted, whereas the E71 worked in rapid pulses equally spaced apart. To my surprise, it appeared to only work for missed calls, voicemails, and SMS alerts. Unlike the E71, there was no integration with the Nokia Messaging app for email. Even after a new email alert was sounded from the device, the notification light just pulsed in standby mode as if nothing had happened. The rim around the menu key seems to be thinner than the select key on the E71, so the light isn't as noticeable unless surroundings are darkened.Update: Since I had switched to the native S60 client for future email retrieval, the notification light worked accordingly for incoming mail.-Gravity application for TwitterThis was the one and only reason that convinced me to restore my Twitter account after a TWO-month hiatus! It runs just as smoothly as the online video and is integrated perfectly with TwitPic! The scrolling of Tweets and navigation of sections emulates the iPhone in such an impressive manner that I had to pinch myself.Update: I started experiencing a frozen timeline on my Twitter account where I could see only my own tweets, but none of my friends. Even though this was no fault of the N97, I had not been using Gravity as much anymore.-Nokia Sports TrackerThis application remained as one of the most impressive I had ever come across in a smartphone. Starting from where the E71 left off, the Symbian 5th edition version was much more useful with the enlarged touch screen in navigating training data and route maps for my daily 5 mile runs. Setting up my Nokia account and uploading my fitness results to the Nokia Sport Tracker site proved to be just as easy as the E71, but with a touch screen. I was actually taken aback one day when my iPod Touch had completely froze in the middle of my run, rendering my Nike Sport tracker useless. But all was not lost, for the Nokia Sport Tracker continued recording my running progress. To make things even better via a godsend of a 3.5mm headphone jack, I was able to switch my Sony headphones to the N97 and hear music via the player!! For the first time, I could actually see the Nokia Sport Tracker as more than just an alternate to the Nike Sport Kit.-Ovi StoreI was simply FLOORED with the flawless experience I had when I purchased the Gravity application from the Ovi Store! No lagging in the browsing of applications and games was experienced at all, and entering my payment information was very easy and convenient.-Software UpdatesOne night after having a voice call conversation on the N97, there was a prompt that asked if I wanted to allow the phone to check for any software updates. Out of curiosity, I selected "yes" and watched as the device opened the Software Update app. Even though no update was available at the time, it was nice to get the impression that the N97 was considerate enough to at least ask!Update: I read online from two tech blogs that Nokia was planning to release a firmware update on July 1st. I hoped that this could be efficiently obtained via an over-the-air download and address nagging issues with my N97 such as the unpredictable backlight. Unfortunately, after numerous checks throughout the day on July 1st, no firmware update was available for download.-Potential Cons:1. The qwerty keypad layout is not bad at all with the space bar being shifted to the right. Honestly, I found the space bar to be in a great position for my right thumb in the midst of typing messages. However, the tactile feedback of the keys was extremely minimal, and they certainly did not offer comfort for prolonged typing of emails and potential word documents. The flattened surface area of each key was almost as bad as the E75, but it at least had some raised texture to enable touch typing (if at all possible). I could understand that I was a definite minority when it came to using my smartphone as a word processor, and it was apparent to me that the N97 qwerty was not meant for such writing.2. There were certain moments when the touch response would not register accurately. While these were few and far in between with menu navigation and application performance, there was one incident when the screen appeared to freeze. Just when I considered taking out the battery, every single touch input began to register and resulted in multiple apps and windows opening simultaneously.3. I had already become used to the screen backlight of my N97 not working properly. Whenever the device was in standby for an extended period of time and I pressed the lock switch to activate it, the backlight remained off even though I could plainly see the home screen widgets. This was always fixed by pressing the lock switch two more times. This should not have been tolerable for the amount that was paid, but I was willing to overlook that quirk. I guess that that only proved my allegiance to Nokia and what I was willing to tolerate from a so-called flagship device. Honestly, going through the hassle of dealing with returning the phone for a replacement was not worth it for such a minor setback.4. I had a mishap with the N97 from an incoming voice call during the playback of a movie file. As the phone rang and vibrated, the movie went out of sight as expected and the telephone screen with a contact picture became visible with touch commands to accept or reject the call. When I pressed on the touch command to accept the call, an error message appeared: "Request rejected". Long after about a minute when a voicemail symbol had appeared at the top of the screen, the phone continued to ring and vibrate with the same telephone screen. Opening the qwerty only placed the screen into horizontal orientation, and pressing any of the hardware buttons (qwerty, menu, camera key, and hold switch) had no effect either.  The only thing that worked was holding down the power key to turn off the device. Upon turning on the phone, I noticed that the AccuWeather widget was still stuck in a loading data stage after almost fifteen minutes. This was solved when I removed the widget and reinstalled it again onto the home screen. A sudden malfunction such as this reminded me of Windows Mobile, and I was not happy about it. I truly began to miss my E71 at this moment.5. The Facebook widget had its unpredictable moments. Often there would be a glitch where the home screen was still visible through the area for the soft keys on the right of the screen. Simply exiting the widget and reopening it did solve that problem, but provided a minor irritation. When a photo was taken with the N97 camera, it was usually saved in the Mass Storage of 32GB where it could then be accessed via Facebook's upload utility. This worked successfully for the first few photos I had taken on the Carl Zeiss camera, but then after while none of the new pictures would show up in the Facebook app for uploading even though they had been taken AND saved into the Mass Storage drive! The only way to successfully upload a N97 picture from the Facebook widget is to activate the camera via the uploading feature, making this a huge inconvenience! At one point, there was a glitch where only the function key characters worked for inputting text into the status update field. This was rectified by removing the widget altogether from the home screen and then reinstalling it again.6. The lack of an editing version for Quickoffice really bothered me when I was informed of it from an article on AllAboutSymbian.com, but I decided to give the N97 a try anyway. I missed my E71 all the more without being able to edit or create word documents. Whenever an attempt was made to buy a license, a screen appeared with the words "no data" since an update was not available. To make the situation even worse, it was version 4 that was bundled with the N97. This meant that there was absolutely NO support for Office 2007 file formats! At this point, even Windows Mobile started to look good. I knew that I was in the minority when it came to using my phone as a word processor, but this issue certainly was not exemplary of a flagship device!I thought I found a solution in downloading the trial version of MobiSystems OfficeSuite 5 for Symbian 5th edition, but I was somewhat wrong. True, this application did grant me editing of word documents on my N97 along with Office 2007 support, but the typing performance was simply lousy. Characters registering on the screen as I typed on the qwerty proved to be painfully slow and reminded me of the Sony Ericsson P990. Taking steps to save a word document were a bit confusing and not straightforward like on Quickoffice. Overall, I was not convinced that purchasing a license for this app would be the best alternative. If I happened to hold on to the N97, waiting for Quickoffice to release an editing version update would be the best thing to do.7. I didn't think that the low RAM would have much of an effect on my usage, but it certainly did. While my daily routine of writing messages, managing calls, surfing the web and listening to music were hardly affected, the playback of video content was a different story. Depending on how many apps (and maybe even which apps) were already running, I would get a memory error pop-up on the screen advising me to close some applications. While I didn't have a problem in closing some apps, this did seem to be an inconvenience for something that was claimed to be a flagship device. On the other hand, I was aware of the low amount of RAM before purchasing this N97, so in a way this was to be expected.8. There was one frightening moment after the N97 had run out of battery power in the middle of a voice call and I had connected it to the AC charger. After about an hour of charging, I disconnected the charger and attempted to unlock it by moving the lock switch. There was no response from the screen, but I assumed that it was the backlight malfunctioning as usual and moved the lock switch again. There was still no response after moving the switch, but the keyguard alert did illuminate the screen when the following buttons were pressed: menu key, call key, camera shutter key, volume rocker keys, and power key. I was also surprised to notice that holding down the power key did not turn off the N97, and opening the qwerty did not change the screen to landscape orientation...the backlight STILL did not come on! I had no choice but to remove the battery and return it in order to bring the N97 back to normal. This brought me to the next con.9. Taking off the battery door was no trouble, but it almost seemed too easy in comparison to the E71. I watched an online video for a drop test of the N97 and was not shocked to see the battery door popping off. Removing the battery was impossible without an outstretched paper clip to pry it out! On my first try to pull it out, I learned the hard way when my nail was bent backward! There may be an easier way for taking out the battery, but I have yet to discover it at this point.10. The N97 could be enabled in mass storage mode when connected to my MacBook via the USB cable. It was at this moment when the disk images for both the 32GB N97 storage and the 16GB microSD card appeared on the Mac desktop. Sometimes the disk images would not appear on the Mac screen, but simply turning off the phone and turning it on again solved this.11. Gaming seemed to be a worthwhile venture when I saw a listing for the Hero of Sparta game in the Ovi Store, so I purchased it with the expectation that it would be like the iPod Touch. I was wrong. It was probably unwise for me to assume that the N97 version would equal that of the iPod Touch, but I couldn't help but do just that. The experience on that particular game reminded me of the 2D graphics of Street Fighter on Super Nintendo, and I was leary of buying another game from that point on.It had been a while since I unboxed the new N97 and welcomed it into my home with open arms, and I had a conflict. No matter how great the device happened to be with multimedia content, I always seemed to have a yearning for the word document editing ability and the tactile qwerty feedback of my previous E71. Aside from the quirks that came with any touch UI, those two factors were the only things that caused me to sometimes doubt my N97's usefulness. For a moment, I even began to debate whether I was better suited for the ESeries instead of the NSeries. It was quite obvious that the N97 ran circles around the E71 in regards to certain multimedia features, and I questioned if it was enough for me as a phone user. Through the irritation of not having an editing version of Quickoffice and enduring a failed attempt with MobiSystems OfficeSuite, I started to justify a return to the E71 and its familiar qwerty keypad.As I wrote the previous blog post on my impressions of the device, I noticed more cons than pros and began to actually feel frustrated with the N97. For some reason, I felt somewhat let down and disappointed in what this phone had to offer in terms of software and overall qwerty performance. When these negative feelings began to tempt me to sell the N97 and go back to my E71 (and maybe even look at the Touch Pro 2), I had to get a grip on reality and look at the situation rationally. It turned out that in comparison to every other Nokia that I had owned previously, the N97 was truly a worthwhile convergence device that could potentially suit my needs from a multimedia AND messaging/doc editing perspective. So where was all of that negativity coming from in my seldom dealings with certain quirks of this flagship model? I finally figured it out: the term "flagship".When the "flagship" moniker was added to the N97 device, it of course brought more attention in the best way possible. But along with that attention came the mounting pressure of high expectations. In my opinion, a flagship device was to successfully represent the technological prowess of its parent company, be on the cutting edge of mobile features, and be the absolute holy grail for EVERY potential user. In such a situation, it was possible to expect filet mignon and lobster when only spam and vienna sausage was available. While the N97 didn't fall into that extreme manner of discrepancy, there was a clear indication that it did not deserve to be called a flagship with the features (or lack thereof) it had to offer. Honestly, NO device could ever be appropriately termed as a flagship since it was IMPOSSIBLE to please EVERY smartphone buyer. Whether a phone was indeed perfect ultimately remained subjective. From a standpoint of meeting the flagship requirments, I understood that the N97 failed...but certainly not in a horrible fashion.That realization helped me to see the N97 in a different light and not be so critical of its issues. I could recall that my E71 was not always a pot of gold in its performance and capabilities, yet I still preferred it because it worked for my personal needs. Accepting the N97 despite its flaws and being patient for any upcoming fixes was more reasonable than disregarding it as a total failure. This was especially true since there were some positive features on the device that I did find worthwhile in comparison to my E71. The more I worked with this N97, there was a sense of amazement equal to the first time I had used the E90 Communicator just years ago. As much as this fairly new UI had its own hangups such as irregular touch responsiveness, potential instability and memory errors, I was still mezmerized by the presence of touch navigation and a tactile qwerty. I remembered using slider qwerty/touchscreen devices with Windows Mobile and wishing that my E90 Communicator could essentially be the same. I remembered wanting to take the multimedia features of the NSeries line and possibly adding some ESeries touches to it. Technically, my wishes were answered by the N97, but I also needed to understand its marketed purpose. At the end of the day, the N97 was primarily a media/Internet device, not a business-oriented word processor/PDA.It is no secret that the touch interface of Symbian 5th edition was not graceful by any means. Instead of exhibiting the ample speed and grace of an adult gazelle in the African grasslands, it was more like an awkward, stumbling newborn gazelle that still managed to keep up with the herd. The flashy transitions were not prevalent in the N97 like the iPhone, and there were moments of boredom with the same old appearance of the Symbian OS. But the transitioning theme effects that were offered did add some refreshing to Symbian navigation, and there was still the benefit of superior hardware features to be considered over the iPhone. Resistive touch did seem to be more convenient when I could freely use the tip of ANY available tool as a stylus for more accuracy. The inclusion of a tactile qwerty not only granted more efficient text entry to me, but also more versatility in how I could use my device instead of being forced to comply with only touch. Stereo speakers on the N97 didn't really knock my socks off, but they performed MUCH better than most smartphone speakers! The Carl Zeiss camera was still the object of my affection in regards to using my Nokias, and its quality results were always more than satisfactory for my needs in both stills and video. A protective lens cover and widescreen video capture were definitely welcomed features! 32GB of onboard storage still boggled my mind every now and then, for it was almost unbelievable that I could cram a plethora of picture, music, and video files onto the phone AND have more capacity with microSD support! It was like being a child in a candy store! Having the privilege to experience the same quality of reception and voice calling was definitely great, despite the initial interference issues a friend of mine had noticed on the first two conversations spent on the device. For the most part, my own experience with the N97's call quality and signal strength had been no different than previous Nokias. The enabling of 3G support in North America was always a much needed feature for bluetooth tethering and faster network data performance...if only that damned E90 had it! Nokia's services such as Messaging, Podcasting, Internet Radio, Ovi Store and Sports Tracker had been instrumental in enhancing my user experience with every compatible device. Last but not least was that 3.5inch screen of the usual 16 million color support. The small, confined space of the E75 and E71 screens was most certainly trumped by the N97, and I witnessed this via Internet surfing, OS navigation, and multimedia viewing! This touchscreen alone (along with the 32GB) had FINALLY granted me a Nokia multimedia/messaging experience that could at least remotely provide competition to the iPhone in my eyes!The home screen layout of widgets had proved to be a most useful presentation of Symbian and also provided real time updates on the go! Widgets finally made a positive impression on me after I had resisted similar implementations on non-touchscreen Nokias. What better way to facilitate personal customization than widgets that can rearranged according to one's preference? Even with my favorite contacts, music controls and application shortcuts on the home screen, I still found myself amazed with such connectivity and access at the tip of my finger instead of being confined to a d-pad. The mobile Facebook app continued to be one of the most captivating features, for it provided a user-friendly and intuitive means to manage my Facebook activities. Internet surfing via the S60 browser was a GODSEND compared to the E71 navigation I had been accustomed to for so long! Similar to when I use my iPod Touch, surfing the web on the N97 is a pleasure and not an E71 chore! Flash video on YouTube was supported just fine, but slow loading times and skipping seldom occurred. Browsing the web for text reading on certain sites did reveal a caveat: the zoom feature did not restructure words to prevent horizontal scrolling while reading. The use of T9 had returned when I learned to use the phone vertically while on the go, and the touch experience really endeared me to the N97.From that perspective, it was easy to discover once again what made me become a Nokia fan in the first place. Through the limited potential of Apple, Windows Mobile, Palm, and RIM, Nokia stepped up to the plate and was not afraid to believe in giving exemplary multimedia hardware to its users. My impressions of Nokia devices were further enhanced through the support of mark/space and its implementation of the Missing Sync software for PIM data syncs to my Mac computer! Those days of endless searching for Apple iSync plug-ins came to an end long ago after I invested time and money into Missing Sync software. In fact, I had become even more supportive of Missing Sync when I discovered its compatibility with numerous OS versions in the mobile industry! Anyway, the N97 did not come onto the market and take the world by storm, but it had left a promising impression on me nonetheless.Just a week ago, a great friend and fellow Nokia owner suggested something that had stuck with me since that moment: Nokias were like Swiss army knives, jacks of all trades. While numerous capabilties were not perfectly implemented, it was a benefit to at least have those within the realm of possibility as Nokia users. This essentially awakened me to be an optimist in my relating to the N97 since it had potential; looking for ways to adapt and make it work for me instead of being too critical and unreasonable. However, this didn't mean that I would turn a blind eye to issues that bothered me in my daily usage. It would remain acceptable to point out the cons, but what mattered most was my reaction to those cons. The choice would be between giving up prematurely amidst the presence of worthwhile benefits or remaining steadfast, rational, flexible and open to patience to a certain extent. It would be one thing if the N97 was absolutely terrible like the Sony Ericsson P990 or the Palm Treo Pro's qwerty, but that was not the case at all. In spite of some areas of improvement, the N97 had been able to meet all of my needs successfully in a most intriguing manner and I was not ready to let it go (if ever). Unless a touch upgrade was given to the widescreen E90, I was surely sticking with the N97 in the meantime.
My colleagues got their iPhone 3GS on June 19. I had the pleasure to play with them. After one week with iPhone 3GS, I am glad to have my N97. There are no so-called perfect phone. but this is what I can do with my N97, very basic, I can change the battery any time I want. I can pop in or take out my SIM card for or from another phone. I can expand my memory capacity by switching my memort card. When 32GB MicroSD is available, my N97 will have 64GB in total (my colleagues were so mad when I slowly put in the battery and 16 GB MicroSD card in front of them). The phone is solid built with great screen display quality. I love the keyboard. iPhone 3GS costs $699 without a contract. I paid less than that for my N97. I have no complain.
This is a great phone if you haven't been a iPhone user.Pros:- Elegant phone- Excelent touchscreen for a resistive screen.- The quality of the camera is amazing.- Endless space (32 GB)- I like very much the home screen (you can add widgets, like shortcuts to your apps)Cons:- Included email app doesn't work.- Cpu is slow.- Ovi store is just starting, lack of apps.- Included web browser is good, but could be better. (sometimes crashes)As I said, if you are an iPhone user you won't like the resistive screen, you will find the phone unresponsive, but if you haven't used capacitive touchscreens, (like me) you'll find this phone really cool (although I'm looking forward for the N900!!!)I've never liked the iPhone, and I have always trusted Nokia, so for me this is the best pick.
I've got a BlackBerry Bold, as well as an iPhone 3G. I'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side, but given the price of this phone, the bar is set reasonably high. Obviously, nothing's really "as good as" a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail (and you're using a BES), and nothing available right now is "as good as" an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability. So for reference, those weren't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package, with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual. The included software doesn't run on OS X, so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box, I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings. What impressed me immediately, is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services. This is the first unbranded phone I've used that didn't need me to enter the settings for my carrier (AT&T;).The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal, and started filling the home screen with information. I placed a couple of test calls, and was extremely impressed with the sound quality. Without question, this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I've ever used.And then, the wheels started to come off...First task: sync my work mail, contacts, and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy, until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly. Unfortunately, once you have something in the wizard, it's there. There's no "Back" button. So, the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately."No problem" I thought, I'll just change the settings. This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be. "Options" doesn't give you a path to the settings. You have to go to hit the silver button, then go to Applications, then go to the "MfE" folder (which is incredibly cryptic, if you don't know what you're looking for) to change the settings.Once I had them changed, the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server. I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options, like setting "prime time" for a constant sync, and a schedule for when you don't need instant access. There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications, and the overall experience was quite good.Second task: set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already, this was straightforward. The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail, and I confirmed that I did. Mail showed up, and all was good. Until I tried to leave the program. That's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed, but willing to accept this limitation, I tried to put the account on my home screen, along with my Exchange account. Apparently, the N97 can't do this, either. You can have one mail box on the screen, regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task: connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone. Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones, Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun. Pairing the N97 wasn't a problem. After it was set up, I made a couple of calls (which again, had awesome clarity) and thought everything was fine. Until...When I returned to my car later in the day, I noticed that calls weren't being directed to the speakerphone. As it turns out, the N97 won't re-pair with anything on its own. So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all, the N97 requires you to hit the silver button, then go to Setup, then Connectivity, then Bluetooth, then Paired Devices, then pick the speakerphone, then hit "pair" every time.Speaking of which...Fourth Task: answer the stupid phone.I'm not 100% sure this is even possible with the N97. When the phone rings, you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing, and is labeled "Answer". If you tap it, nothing happens. If you hit the green button, nothing. If you unlock the phone and try either, nothing.Feeling like a complete moron, I had to look it up. It turns out, the bars are sliders, similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone. Yet, this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task: get Facebook working.This wasn't difficult at all. Enter your name and password, and go. The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version, which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you'd expect it to, until it crashes. Yes, that's right. Until it crashes. Constantly. Sometimes it does a full "I'm kicking you back to the home screen" crash, and other times, you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted. Sometimes the red box goes away on its own. There's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task: read my e-mail.Well... on the first try, I had a message that said my phone was out of memory. You see, despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies, the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited. The out of memory message suggested closing other applications, which I did, and which resolved nothing. Rebooting the phone worked.That's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that isn't plain text.That's also where I started to give up on the N97. In between all of this, I also discovered that:*Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer, or disabled.*Some things need to be double-tapped, others single-tapped, with little indication as to which is which.*The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess.*The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing.*There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you, and how much battery life you actually have.*The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly, there are some bright spots:*The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures.*The included weather application is actually pretty cool, since it uses GPS and updates often.*The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure, there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want. But in my estimation, the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable, given this phone's cost.I've also heard that a new software update is imminent (as of this review, the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24), so that may solve some problems. But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date "any day now", the N97 is for Symbian fans only.
First, let me say that I've been a user of S60 devices for years now.  I even had that awful 3650 with its goofball round keypad.  Off the top of my head, I've had and used 3650, 6620, 6682, 9500, 9300, E61, E70, E50, E51, E61i, E65, E71, N73, N82, N95 and the ill-fated N97.  I even had a 5800XM for half a day, but returned it when I found that the 3G capabilities were hopelessly borked.  Fortunately for those users it got fixed, but I never did jump back in on the 5800XM.Back to the N97 though.  Crazy version number jumps aside (I read something about 4 being considered an unlucky number in some Asian cultures, so they skipped from S60v3 to v5), I was jazzed about the N97.  Under the hood, the Symbian underpinnings that I've grown to know & love over the years, with a slick new touch interface.  I even went to the launch party in NYC.  That commercial with LL Cool J had me humming "Mama Said Knock You Out" so much in my head that I went and bought the song from iTunes.Then I got the phone, retiring my N82.  Cue the sad music.  First problem - no iSync support.  At all.  No worries, been there before.  I hacked together an N95 plugin back in the day, so how hard should it be?  Bzzz..  No go.  My method of sync on the device was using Mail for Exchange with Google Sync to sync up contacts & calendar events.  It worked mostly, but was a bit of a pain to set it all up.  To get the data to the phone, it's My Mac -> Google -> Phone.  Of course, that's 2 different 2-way syncs, so there's always potential to have change collisions at the Google part of the equation.Next up - battery life.  Wow.  It's not iPhone-bad, but it's pretty bad.  I will take my hat off to the boys from Espoo on one point here - Micro-usb charging.  It's about time, kids.  Seriously.  Keep that up.The CPU and available memory felt a bit anemic.  Not as much CPU as I'd thought would be the case - out of memory was a common message I saw.  Definitely slower than I'd have liked, so I must also say the CPU is definitely not up to snuff.The screen.  Oh the screen.  It's certainly beautiful to look at, no disputing that.  I thought the colors were vibrant and looked great.  I was concerned that a touchscreen would mean it would be hard to see anything from finger marks, but not so here.  My chief problem with the device, which ultimately led me to return it was the screen.  The resistive touchscreen employed on the N97 just wasn't sensitive enough.  I found myself doing 3 or 4 touches when one should have sufficed.The camera.  5 MP, dual LED flash.  It took very nice pics, but why not use a single xenon flash?  The flash on the N82 is the best I've ever seen on a phone.I really really tried so hard to like this phone, but between the screen that didn't really seem to work correctly and the < 1 day battery life, I couldn't in good conscience keep it.
I absolutely hate touch screens, yet I bought this phone.Why?This is a question for Nokia: if other people hate touch screens like I do--and they do--why do you think they'd buy the N97 with its inferior resistive touch screen over the iPhone's superior capacitive screen?Here's the reason: FULL QWERTY KEYBOARD.So when you make a phone with a "full qwerty keyboard," and then you omit a dedicated row of numbers, it's not really a full qwerty keyboard now, is it?  I come from a long line of QWERTY Nokia phones such as the 6820/6822, E70 and the Nokia E90 before this.  The E90 has a full keyboard, complete with ctrl key so you can do seemingly simple things like copy (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+v).  With my Nokia E90, typing was a breeze.  You could even skip between words in sentences while typing text messages by holding ctrl and pressing left or right like you can in Windows (or even highlighting those words by pressing "shift").So imagine my disappointment when it took me a full minute of hunting through menus to forward a contact's phone number to someone via text message.  Short of looking up the number, writing it down on a piece of paper, then typing it back, there's no other way to do this.  What was a simple task on E90 and E70 (simply click options on the contact and it takes you to a sub-menu where you can copy the phone number into your clipboard), is an unwieldy chore on the N97.  Here's how to copy a phone number to your clipboard: Contacts->Click on the contact->Options->Edit->Click on the phone number->Options->Editing Options->Copy->Start->Drag your finger across the number->Click Done.  Absurd!  And Lord knows how to paste it once you have it on your clipboard (you can only paste in apps that support the "Editing Options" submenu, so forget about pasting information in forms and menus on the phone for a quick lookup).  I've scoured the Internet and there's simply no way to do this.Nokia has literally reduced functionality on this phone.Also, I can't stress enough how annoying it is to have to shift to type numbers, and to have to shift to type a comma.  Are you kidding me?  Commas are (or should be) the most used punctuation, up there with the period.  Nokia's choice to make you shift to get a comma is dumbfounding.About the apps:-----------------Browser: the browser is frustratingly stupid.  In older Nokia phones, you could simply type shortcuts while browsing 1 = enter URL, 2 = search, 3 = reload, 5 = switch between windows, etc.  They removed this functionality from the browser.  Why?!  It's so annoying I could punch a vase.  Why did you remove functionality that you had before, Nokia?  Why?  Nice one.-Facebook widget is okay; mostly sizzle, little steak.  The presentation is nice, and it updates pertinent information, but you can only scroll through 20 or so entries in the live feed.  There's no way to go trawling through a day or two of updates like you can by simply pointing your browser to the mobile version of Facebook.-Amazon app: throw it away.  It's little more than a mobile front page that literally takes you to browsing on Amazon's mobile site.-AP News: does what it's supposed to.  Video quality was good, news is what you'd expect from AP.  Fairly functional app.-Guitar Rock Tour (like Guitar Hero): boring and unresponsive on the touch screen.. you have to tap too hard to register a click, so it slows the gameplay down and is exhausting to play.-AccuWeather: fairly accurate weather forecasts, though typing "weather [zip]" in Google seems to give more accurate results (AccuWeather seems to return results for the city you're in, but in a large coastal city like Los Angeles for example, a few miles can make a big difference).Usability:-----------There's a volume control button on the side that pivots up or down, and it only seems to work on calls.  Since the buttons are there anyway, why not put them to use by allowing users to scroll up or down through menu items or web pages?  Dragging around on the touch screen is frustratingly inaccurate and a chore.-There's a nice lock button on the side of the phone that seems fairly responsive (you can lock/unlock with a flick of your thumb).  It did occasionally leave the screen black when I unlocked.  I've updated to the latest firmware and haven't noticed the issue since, but it's disconcerting when it happens.-Exiting applications is TORTURE.  In other Nokia phones, it's fairly easy to exit (just click the menu item, press up and it takes you to the bottom of the menu to exit).  Or simply press the red "hang up" button and it will exit most apps.  Not here.  Pressing the red button does nothing (it only takes you to the home page).  So before you know it, you have 20 different apps running in the background, all hogging up memory.-When you enter a sub-menu like the one for choosing symbols by pressing the "Sym" button on the keyboard, it's impossible to exit this menu.  You have to choose a symbol, even if it's one you don't want, and then erase the symbol you chose.  This underscores how poorly thought out the usability is.-Typing while in touch screen mode requires you to use a 10-key pad like on a traditional cell phone, and doesn't allow you to type using a full on-screen keyboard.  This is so incredibly stupid that I almost vomited.Anyway, the phone has some pluses, such as the 5 MP camera, good 3G support, good storage, fairly quick, etc, but I won't go into the positives because there are a lot of other reviews on here that do.  I've found that the negative reviews are always the most helpful on Amazon, even when an item has thousands of reviews (the negatives always point out stuff that I would also find annoying), so I hope that's also the case with this review.As I write this, I look at my pretty new N97 sitting next to my clunky old E90.  The E90 is a beast of a phone, and yet, it did what it was supposed to do, and didn't make you jump through hoops to do it.  I'll probably go back to the E90 and its dated apps, even if I have to use the terrible EDGE network for Internet.  What I lose in transfer speed will be made up for in typing speed.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 11/30/2009I've now used this device for a few months, and have a few more insights and grievances:1. There is very little thought put into the alarm clock function.  This is something basic I use all the time--instead of a real alarm clock in fact, so it's important for it to work well.  When you set an alarm, the default setting is to create a permanent alarm that would repeat in 24 hours. Most people use alarms for quick reminders, such as when you park at a meter, or to take something out of the oven.  So it's super annoying to have to go through and click "do not repeat" through a sub menu 5 times per day.  Here's what really annoys me: even Nokia doesn't believe it should repeat 24-hours by default, because when you set an alarm for an event in your calendar, the default is to NOT repeat.  Why the inconsistency Nokia?2. The slider button to unlock the phone is STILL GARBAGE.  I thought it was a good idea, but it works correctly only 2/3rds of the time, even after numerous firmware updates (I always keep up to date).  The slider leaves the screen lit every now and then, even when the phone is locked.  Sometimes it does nothing (it vibrates but screen stays dark).  Sometimes it's laggy so when you unlock it, it does nothing, then you do it again and it quickly unlocks and locks.  Stupid.  Get it together, Nokia.3. When you're on a phone call and you have to access any applications (such as your contact list to give someone a number), it's hard to get back to your dialer quickly (so you can switch to loudspeaker or switch calls).  You have to hold down the button in the lower corner for 2 seconds, then flip through your open applications to your dialer.  Stupid.  Why does everything take so long to do on this phone?4. Speaking of, the entire phone is TOO SLOW.  Basic functions like flipping from portrait to landscape, or pulling up your contact list, or going from locked to unlocked when you answer a phone call are almost always laggy (even with no running applications).5. Browser still has no keyboard shortcuts.6. Copy function is slightly improved (you can drag your finger across text in a text message and a "Copy" button will come up), but pasting is still IMPOSSIBLE unless the application specifically allows you to paste.  So if you get a text message with an address in it, and you copy the text message into your clipboard buffer, you can't paste it into another application like say, Google Maps.  You know, THE ENTIRE POINT OF COPYING AND PASTING ADDRESSES.  UGH.7. The proximity detector doesn't work half the time.  I'm so tired of the phone going to mute or to some random application because it was held up to my head while the phone's screen was active, so it thinks I'm pressing buttons with my face.  Stupid.8. I hate this phone.  The only reason I'm still using it is because of a few opensource apps that only exist on it, and it supports the US 3.5G networks, which the old E90 doesn't.I miss my E90.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 9/8/2010I absolutely hate this phone. I hate it.I've upgraded the firmware 3-4 times, I lost count. Nothing seems to help. The device lock still doesn't work. Sometimes it locks the screen (if you wait 3 seconds after a call), and sometimes if you don't wait long enough after exiting an app, it locks half the screen (most of it is dark but parts of the UI are still lit). Sometimes it doesn't do anything.I'm rebooting this phone 3-4 times per week due to lock ups.  I tried to update Ovi Maps, but it still tries to download to the C: drive despite setting my download drive to E:, and it runs out of disk space. There's nothing more I can remove or delete on C: to run this update. I'm so tired of Nokia. I'm not the only one... the people who used to run Symbian Guru shut down the site recently. This is a big deal. There are no bigger advocates of your product than loyalists who run sites like Symbian Guru.  To quote them:"To Nokia, you guys are losing. Hard. Wake the hell up. Doing the same thing repeatedly while expecting different results is the definition of insanity.  I've been a huge Nokia fan since my 2nd cellphone, and I just can't do it any longer. You guys aren't competing like you once were, and everyone but you seems to see that. You used to build the world's best smartphones, the world's best cameras, the world's best GPS units - you've lost pretty much all of that, and with nothing to show for it. You unveiled your Ovi vision over 2 years ago - I was there. Today, it's still a complete mess. I have to log in every single time I visit the site - regardless of how many times I check the `remember me' box. I spent 6 months (and about 3 hours at Nokia World 2009) trying to find someone to help me with Ovi Contacts on the web - no one knew who to point me to. You spent millions of dollars purchasing your Ovi pieces - Ovi Files, Ovi Share, and a host of other little companies - are you proud of what you `built' with them? Most of your own employees (that I've talked to) don't even use them, so why should I?"I hate almost everything about this phone. If it didn't support the faster 3G network (faster than other Nokia phones), and migration wasn't such a chore, I'd have ditched it long ago. Alas, there are no great Qwerty phones with all the features I'm looking for, except maybe the new Droid phones coming out. I think that's what I'm going to move on to. Nokia's inability to satisfy their core user base with high quality, high up-time units has lost me as a customer. Nothing short of a full refund and an apology would get me back to Nokia's arms again.
First of all thanks for reading this review and hope it helps.My story with this phone is that I purchased it right after it came out into the market, from the start had to do a firmware update, and unfortunatly the phone keeps on presenting problems.  I am at firmware 2.0 and it just seems that this firmware just made the phone worse the before.  For starts, the phone presents constant lock ups and memory loss requiring hard reset (having to take out the batrery and memory card for the unit to start up).  Lock ups are most noticeable when the phone memory (ram) is low, even though no widgets or programs running the phone eats up ram by itself, and you receive a phone call.  Right after hanging up the phone locks ups and have to go throught the whole process of reseting the phone.  Options for the different screens are hard to acces since have to go through several menues to get to them. The camera lens is very prone to scratches, taking night pictures is basically unusable due to the flash being reflected from the scratches of the lens. Key pad feedback is basically not there, keys have no real sence of travel. The phone is under powered, there is a very noticeable lag between screen selection of a program and actualy opening of the program, screen rotation is slow to the point were you have to shake the phone to make it realise that you wish to go to portrait mode or back to landscape. Overall I personally do not recomend the phone, specially for the price of the unit.  There are a lot of other phones that even though, might have less functionality, work a lot better and are less frustrating to use then this unit. Support from Nokia is lacking, not very helpfull when you finally are able to contact them.Overall a very disapointing experience, leaves you feeling as if your were ripped of for paying a premium price for a substandard so called phone.
I changed from a blackberry to this phone and definitely prefer it.  It surfs the internet a lot better than the blackberry. With Nokia Messaging I still get my emails real time.  The only downside is that I can't seem to find an app that I like to connect to msn messenger, so I miss the instant messaging.
I waited for this phone for a long time. I was planning to buy iphone but i have been a loyal Nokia customer for last 6 years so I waited for this phone and got it from Nokia flagship store even before it was even available from amazon.The touch interface is horrible. Sometimes when there is an incoming call, I have to press accept button 3-4 times before it is recognized.The GPS is even worse. I have owned this phone for quite some time now and it has never captured satelites when I need it to (in total it has been able to capture satellite twice  but both these times I just switched GPS on for fun). my friends Iphone has never failed him even a single time.battery is average. I am moderate user and for me it lasts 48 hours.Now some positives (thats why it earned 2 stars):plenty of storage. Music quality is awesome. camera is great.Bottomline: This would have been a great phone had it come 3 years back or had it been available for $350 but for $699 (though todays price is $529) definately not worth it.
I just got my N97 phone few days ago and I'm already enjoying the everything about the phone. Its fast, it responds very well to touch. One of the great thing about the phone is the double clicking. It means you can open/select what you really wish to open instead of mistaken opening something else because you touched the wrong part of the screen.Well, with the problems all other people are having with the phone, my advice for people buying this is that:As soon as you buy the phone, before you install, copy or enter any contacts, calender or even do anything. Just put your SIM card in the phone and go to the Nokia PC Suite to upgrade to the latest firmware. That was exactly what I did and its working great.
The N97 beats out the iPhone hands down. Every single feature the iPhone has, Nokia has done better... plus it has more features. It has a significantly better camera (actually it has two cameras). It can have up to 64 GB of space. Tethering is easy. You can have multiple apps running at once. The only downside is that the Nokia apps store is small compared to the Apple apps store.
I have owned a n95, n96 and just recieved my n97 in the mail today. I was so very excited when it finally arrived. The first thing that I noticed was the back piece that holds the battery in and how poorly made it is. If you attempt to put this difficult piece on the little clips will bend to a point you have to use a pair of plyers to unbend it. I was starting to get a little nervous.After an hour of activation my phone officially "bricked". The unlock button would not work, no matter if I took the battery out, it didn't matter. I was totally screwed. I googled it online and apparently a lot of people are having this issue, the worst part is you can't connect it to your computer because your computer won't recognize it. So you are literally screwed. Nokia's only response is to send it in for repairs.I have always loved Nokia's phones but after this phone I will never buy a Nokia phone again. $700 for a paper weight. If you don't believe me about all of these problems just google it. It's literally 50/50 if you will get a good one or not, and for $700 that is completely unacceptable. I feel like I've paid that much to be a beta tester.Not acceptable.
I have been using this phone for the last month, I use this phone for my corporate email, and occasionally for web browsing. I rarely game on this phone, and don't expect to game on it. This is a great business phone over the iPhone and E63/E71.Pros- Keyboard: Great for email and SMS, but keys might be too small for people with big hands, I have a medium size hand and occasionally still makes typo- Battery Life: A lot better compared to my iPhone 3G, on average expect 2 days before needing to charge, on par with E63/E71- Camera: Good pictures, not great but definitely workable. Video are great, I take them occasionally, and then upload them back to my computer, and they are great (not HD, but color is accurate and video is smooth).- Ovi Store: Good selection of apps, much less choices compared to Apple's App Store, but a good start. My only complain is that the apps are expensive compare to Apple, even though they are the same program by same developers.- Ovi Suite: Great program to sync all your note/contact/calendar/photos/sms/programs, it even allows you to do backup/restore from the phone, great if you need to reset and format the phone. Syncing has been flawless!!- Nokia Map: Works great, same as iPhone, but voice navigation will cost you extra. My complain is that it is slower online to load maps than iPhone's Google Map. Remember to download Maps for your area to the phone through Ovi Suite, so you don't need the constant internet connection to load the map.Cons- Memory Implementation: My biggest complain, Nokia decided to split the 32GB of memory into 2 parts (System-74MB, and Mass Memory-31GB), this just doesn't make sense to me. As some program forces you to install on the system memory, you can run out of memory literally within days or weeks. After it is full, some of your program which require the memory simply won't run unless you clean it up, which Nokia doesn't provide a good tool to do.- Tilt Sensor: Poorly implemented during calling/hanging up, I had to tilt and tilt the phone around and around to answer call and hanging up. I just decided to disable the auto sensing feature all together. Nokia should allow the user to further customize the tilt function so you can choose which program you don't want the tilt to work.- Games: This phone is not meant for gaming. Games are horrible on this phone, there are few choices in the store, and pressure sensitive screen aren't as good as the touch sensitive screen on the iPhone.- Hang & Freeze: Right out of the box, my phone hanged on more than 10 separate occasion during end calls, and closing application during its 1st week. Honestly the firmware and my carrier aren't working together, after a master reset, and reinstall all the application myself, things were much improved, only 1-2 hang & freeze when I try to run multiple application at the same time and syncing at the same time.Tips- Master Reset: My carrier decided to install lots of program into my system memory, leaving me a poor 5MB, I literally ran out of memory first day using the phone for emails. I recommend you do a master reset to remove all the application, and install the ones you really need and install them to Mass Memory if possible. My phone is working flawless now, 4 email accounts, 30 apps installed, and still 10MB left on the system memory.- Version 2: Upgrade your phone firmware to version 2, should be an improvement.
On paper, it has everything that you would expect from a $600 phone (its available for $529 now), but its only when one starts using it that all the software shortcomings come to light.5 MP Photo Camera - great quality photos, but flash leaves a clear white mark on photos when used at night. I keep it turned off unless absolutely needed.Video camera - video quality is better than when i take video on my Sony 8.1mp digicam32GB internal memory - limitless space, but some apps dont install on this memory, instead defaulting to the phone memory(which is already very small). So whats the point of so much space, when it cant be used for proper management.Email software - doesnt support HTML; cant set unique notification tones for different email account, so when a new mail arrives and a person has 5 email acc setup, they will have to browse through all 5 Inboxes to see which one has the new emailBrowser - satisfactory;Battery - satisfactory; lasts more than a day with average usage.Google Apps/Facebook/Youtube - not satisfactory at all; facebook crashes all the time(I have finally uninstalled it), GMail app doesnt notify of new mails like it does on Blackberry; Google Maps has great interface, but I loose connection all the time when I am out of my wifi range.Multi-tasking - good feature and works well as long as all phone memory is not used up!Am waiting to download the v2.0 firmware upgrade that is being so much talked about. Hopefully it will fix the software issues.
I got the N97 a couple of months ago switching from the Iphone 3g. Since just about everyone has the iphone now a days i decided to make a switch. The N97 is a little bit harder to get used to but it works pretty well my only complaints would have to be the lagging between programs and my phones memory keeps filling up with browser data. Other than that i like the fact that i can customize everything to make the phone look different and all of the 3rd party apps.
Un equipo espectacular... al llegar a mi pais solo le intruduje un sim card de otro movil y a funcionar, Lo unico que tengo que agregar es Nokia ya anuncio que las ventas de este equipo ya llegaron a los 2millones de unidades todo un record que sigue creciendo... antes de comprar revisa la version mini.... Nokia N97 Mini
Like a Nseries real fan, my last purchase was the N96. I was willing the N97 to have a serious gadget, computer and entertainment all in one device. Now i am happy that i made a good decision. The only thing i am facing right now is that there are little apps designed to the 5th edition Symbian OS. I have to recommend the quickoffice great application which gave me the oportunity to transfer my adobe and quickoffice licenses to this edition. The other problem is the battery, i thought nokia was going to fix the duration but it's better to purchase more batteries or i recommend better the new and updated cradle from boxwave. Nokia N97 Desktop Cradle (With Spare Battery Charger) The qwerty keyboard is so great that when you combine the autocomplete option you obtain great productiviy. I'm so happy with the design, but i'm so concerned that the Symbian OS isn't so develop like others, but the multitasking feature is what ended taking my final decision. I chose the black version and now i'm so happy to obtain great features with ovi sync and professional email program of ProfiMail, Try it you're gonna love it!!
I've been n95 user for more than one year, experiencing  a lot of frustrations in terms of interaction (lack of touch screen, keyboard, speed). Now with my new N97 I feel much more comfortable, navigating in the web, working documents, mails, messages. For videos and photos N97 is as good as N95 (very good), except for the len cover in the N97, that eliminates my worries about damages in it. GPS features are identical in both machines, but I perceived better results in my N97 I guess because of the processor speed (loading maps, etc).In terms of storage capacity, 8GB of the N95 was enough for me, but 32GB in the N97 is even better.Finally, I've read some articles related to the dilemma in the market of touch-screen only vs touchscreen+keyboard in smart phones. After one month with my N97, I bet for the second model.
This would have been a 3 Star rating, but I subtracted one star for value.I received from Nokia and have been using the N97 from the first day it was released.It is loaded with great features, and has about all the capability one could ask for.It has great call quality, both send and receive.The touch interface is nicer and faster to use than a non-touch screen device.Bluetooth works great.GPS, especially linked with the new Google Maps release is stellar.Still camera quality is super, video adequate, except for audio pickup.Nevertheless, I would never advise anyone to buy an N97. Here's why:Battery life is inadequate. Can't get through a day with average use.Keyboard is slow and difficult to use, poorly designed, poor tactile feedback, impossible to see small blue function labels on every key except in low light when the internal lights are illuminated. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I really hate the old style telephone keypad text entry, but it's actually faster and easier that the QWERTY hardware.Operating system is arcane, clunky, and NOT user friendly.  It has some features that just plain defy logic.Phone lock switch sometimes works, sometimes not.  Even after installing the firmware upgrade.There are many, many features, but few perform well.Really screwed up memory management. Very small C: drive that fills up over a few weeks. The cure advocated by Nokia tech support is to reformat the phone. Then it works fine for a few weeks until you have to do it again. That means hours reinstalling and reconfiguring the phone each time. If you don't reformat, the phone will bog down completely, most apps won't run, and you will be tormented by Memory error messages.  This flaw alone makes the phone unusable unless you have the time and enjoy constantly tinkering with the phone.  I'm as geek or more as the next guy, but when I depend on the phone to work, it constantly lets me down.The C: drive issue can be partially resolved by spending hours un-installing apps from the C: drive, then going to the Ovi store to re-download and manually install to the Mass Memory.  Kiss your weekend good-bye.The RAM on the phone is too small.  In normal use, is it almost fully  used.If have installed programs you have paid money for on the Ovi store, once you reformat, you can't download them and reinstall unless you PAY AGAIN.!!  (This surprises Nokia reps every phone call, but there are incapable of resolving the problem.  Finally after 2 weeks, I discovered the secret formula:  get a refund, and then download again.  (What's a few hours of voice mail/support purgatory every few weeks?)FM transmitter is poor.  Unusable in an automobile.Numerous re-boots required each day to squash operating system and app bugs.Voice command function is poor.  Not practical to use.Numerous bugs, especially via text input into the Facebook app.  It gets stuck in the function key mode frequently, and you have to go back to the archiac touch screen interface.Symbian, and the overwhelming majority of apps available are Euro-centric. Nothing wrong with Europe; actually I would rather live there, but I don't. That means functionality for US users always seems "once removed", kind of like always dealing with a poor translation into English.If the Apple phone would multi-task, integrate with Exchange server better (multi-task again), and have user accessable battery, microSD and SIM card slot, I would put up with no keyboard.I can't stand the thought of using a stylus, but may be driven to an HTC WinMo device soon. The N97? Maybe for $100, but then you would still have to use it.In the meantime, I may have to fire up the E71x again sitting in my drawer. With all the hassles and bugs in the N97, and even after coming to appreciate how nice it is to have a touch interface, the device has to work; but the N97 doesn't work without a continual fight.The marketplace is screaming for a smartphone with the connectivity of the N97 (Quad band w/tri-band 3G, FM receive/transmit/ wi-fi, bluetooth, standard cable connections), great battery life, fast CPU, user accessible battery and micro SD slot, a decent operating system, great UI, no stylus required, excellent QWERTY hardware, quality video and still capture, flawless Exchange server interface, that can multi-task. Unlocked of course.The good news is that smartphones will get better; there is huge room for improvement.HERE IS A POST OF MINE FROM THE NOKIA FORUM.  IF YOU HAVE A N97, YOU WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEMS DESCRIBED.Some observations and comments about the N97. The biggest issue I would like to see remedied in a firmware release is the RAM and C: drive memory management problem.  The default should be "works fine without user input".  Right now, unless one dives into the system and makes all kinds of tweaks and setting changes, the phone eventually stops working and torments the user with endless memory related error messages.  Nokia tech support has "never heard of this issue".  Right.I don't know the answer, but I do know the question:  Why is C: drive (phone memory) separate from D: and E: drive (mass memory).  ?  Why is so little free RAM space available after phone bootup?How about fixing the Profiles so that you don't have to drill down through menus via Settings to reach the timed option.  That should be available right from the home screen Profile status icon.  I should not have to use valuable space on the home screen to make a second link to profiles.The native email application should be Nokia Messaging.  Why can't I install Nokia Messaging on Mass Memory??Roadsync should be able to be installed on Mass Memory, not C: drive.Why are plenty of apps that come with the phone installed on the C: drive?  Facebook, AP news, Bloomberg, ennui all work fine when uninstalled from C: drive, then re-download from Ovi and reinstalled in Mass Memory.  What kind of user experience is that??What's with Boingo and Joku?  I bought the phone unlocked for plenty of $$.  Come on Nokia!!  Let me remove the Crapware, especially when it interferes with functionality, like Boingo taking Priority 1 for connections, and being locked in place.  ARRGGHH!!! Let me remove apps that can't be used in the USA.  For example, when selecting My Nokia, I get a message that it's not available in my country, but I can't remove the app from the phone.How about an option to select QWERTY keyboard internal lighting ON, independent of the external light sensor?  The blue function key items can be nearly invisible without internal lights "ON"..  The keyboard is bad enough, at least we should be able to see it.In fact, the slideout QWERTY keyboard is so bad, why not put one on the touchscreen?How about making the Access Points and Destinations boondoggle user friendly?  A little automation would go a long way in user experience.  Connection to the Internet should be seamless, whether through GSM or Wi-FI, without disabling the phone when out of range of the one being used.WinMo has Symbian beat on text input.  At least fix the unpredictability of when a letter will automatically be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence.Fix the Ovi store.  For example, after reformatting the phone, the only way to get some previously paid-for apps is to pay again.  (e.g., RoadSync).  An option to download the installation file  to my PC for storage and installation via Nokia PC Suite would solve that problem.  Right now, it MUST be downloaded directly to the phone, where it installs itself automatically to the C: Drive.  Grrrr...Fix the audio capture during video recording.  Boost the sensitivity! Audio on video playback is way too low.Can the FM transmitter power output be increased?  It sure doesn't work in my car, and is marginal sitting right next to the antenna on my FM radio in the office.Make the ability to close an open app consistent.  Some can be closed from the open apps window, others only from within the app itself.So many things are not well thought out.  Let's see if Nokia can recover and turn this lemon,  aka know as the N97, into lemonade.If I have some things wrong guys and gals, let me know.  If I do, it's an indictment of the poor job Nokia has done on user experience, because I have spent days and days of research time to get and keep the N97 working. It should be easy, not a constant struggle fighting the phone.  I like to geek out as much as the next guy, but the N97 is not dependable;  it will let you down when you need it most.Nokia only has so much time.  Once the iPhone gets multi-tasking, better Exchange support, accessible battery and microSD, better still and video capture and MMS support, the lack of a slide out QWERTY will not be a deal killer.Do you have a punch list of fixes you would like to see?  Maybe Nokia will read this forum string, and we can help them and ourselves out by giving them a clue.[...]
I ordered this phone from Amazon assuming that I am getting the right phone as I am used to Palm lines of phone with both Qwerty and touch screen phones and I wanted an unlocked one with the same function. There were issues with Nokia. They shipped with a wrong battery type which even after full 4-5 hours of charging, would discharge the moment I disconnected from the charger and did an ON/OFF. I called Nokia USA customer service 2-3 times and they didnt even bother to call me back even after a week.Then the address book search is not very user friendly as the search on firstname or last name is not bringing out the correct match. In all, those who need a real qwerty kb and touch screen phone, this may not be the right choice - Atleast it wasnt for me. I decided to return the phone to Amazon for a full refund.
I loved this phone.. I bought it for my sister and she too loved it. It has all the latest features that any mobile should have and it closely resembels iphone in functionality. No doubt it is not as complete as iphone but yes it has that style and looks that could make it more popular.The price was excellent, amozon is the best.. It was cheaper here that if we bought it in India. So it was worth a buy!
Amazing piece of hardware. Fast, reliable, has all the basic application I would like it to have. Great camera, nice touchscreen, the keyboard helps a lot. The only thing I miss are better PIM tools. When registering a new contact, it is not easy to access address data as well. As a rule of thumb, it's to-do and memo notes are less intuitive than Palm applications. Aside form that, again a magnificent piece of hardware.
I sent three of these things back due to defects.I have been the proud owner of an e71, N95, N95 8gb and not so proud owner four N97s.The phone has giving me nothing but problems from memory loss to software bugs(that have mostly been cured by the resent firmware updates).I really like Nokia but this phone is  just not worth the headache for example my current n97 is in repair with Nokia due to screen issues, the endless problems have been overwhelming, i am back to using my e71 and that phone just works the N97 doesn't.I have pre orded an n900, i am hoping that with the new operating system things get better and the n900 turns out to be the device i was originally looking for. If this is not the case i will have to move my smart phone allegiance elsewhere.
I absolutely love this phone. My only complaint about it is that the web browser could be better. A few sites like Google Wave will not render correctly and other times the browser will just crash out and bring me back to the home screen.
When i receive the N97 I was very exiting because I wait many months to have on  in my hands.but in the next or second week of use it, start the problems.Many problems or the same problems of many people say here.What's wrong Nokia? I always say N Series is the best thing in cell-phones' world!! but now you disappoint me and all your fans!!some people say there is 2 kind of N97: the USA version (that it's very very bad) and the european version (the nice and works very good!!)I don't know if it's true or false but we need some explanation about that, because if the rumors are true we need in America same things, good as other places!!
Things that could be better:Facebook app. I think that the IPhone application is betterNo multi touch screenThe pdf reader application is not free like other nokia phonesThings I like:Great sound[...]Very easy to use
I think that the Nokia N97 is a great phone. I would be the first to say that it has some issues that should be solved by future firmware updates.(kinetic scrolling throughout, ram issues) I'm by no means a power user. This phone accomplishes everything I need it to do and also gives me options to do some fun stuff as well. I'm a Nokia phone guy. I grabbed the N97 and was up in running in no time. The os is very familar. Some would say that this old and boring. I say that this is a major selling point. I don't want to learn everything over again just because I'm getting a new phone. It's great being able to listen music, check my email, and chat with my wife. I love the camera. This is a major selling point to me because most phones have crappy cameras. The Fm transmitter is also a plus to me. I've used that feature more than I can count. The touch screen is very usable. I wish they would have included a virtual qwerty keyboard. I use the virtual T9 keyboard often and I must say that it is great. The physical keyboard takes alittle getting used to but within days I was typing without much effort. In closing I would say that this phone is great. If you are looking for an Iphone killer this isn't in the same boat as the Iphone. If you are on the fence on buying this phone go ahead you will not be diappointed.
It's a great cell phone so much better than the iPhone but it weakness is the battery. The internet wi fi is fast and stable, the "32Gb hd" is almost unlimited and allow you to do a lot of things and save files or data. But if you use the cell phone a lot like me to work you will agree that being all the time charging the battery it's a pain in the ... (Just 1 day for hard work). But it is the best cell phone that I ever had and I keep telling to my friends change the iPhone for one N97, better camera, better keyboard, better navegation, better memory (I add a extra 16Gb memory card), it doesn't get to hot as the iPhone when you use it. It doesnt get 5 stars because of the battery.
I saw the iphone 3gs and th n97, both of them are fast but the n97 is easier to work and have a camera with 5.0 mp and flash!!
Well i have been using Nokia for as long as i can remember. I had the N 95 ,N 95 8GB ,N96(useless) and now this great N97.At first i thought that Nokia trying touch screen might suck,but i have to say the phone is very impressive and the OS is new version with beautifull colors and easy to operate,look and work with. I dont want to do a review here as a lot of people have done it.Its a great phone if you can afford it ,prolly the best atm.I got it in perfect condition from amazon ...eeeks they dropped the price 24USD since i bought it but thats always the case with new elecs.Great buy ,beautifull feel and pretty good elegant looks.Lovely i just noticed that i praised it soo much already ,oh well as it is obvious its a very good phone.I could not find a problem with it so far.Enjoy
I was looking to switch from my Blackberry to another Smart phone that I thought could handle my daily requirements (I'm what you would call a power user). I paid almost $600.00 for the phone and consequently had high expectations. I had the phone for one day and realized at the end of the day this definitely wasn't the phone for me. The software was very unstable and if you haven't used the Symbian Interface before, it is not as intuitive as other smart phones. I'm not exagerrating when I say the phone for whatever reason froze up while being used at least 3 times an hour. I would have to remove the battery and put it back in to get the phone working again and this was the ultimate deal breaker. The fact that I couldn't browse the internet or perform basic functions on such an expensive smartphone convinced me to return the phone the very same day. Amazon.com offered spectacular customer service and I was immediately given a refund. Hope other buyers have a better experience than I did but for me, I'm back to my Blackberry Bold 9000 and waiting for the Blackberry Bold 9700 to go on sale at Amazon.com...
Hi. I have N97 from 3 months ago.  Very slow, a lot of problems with the applications, in special "phone Application".. freezing many times. Low multitasking performance. Many times I have to take off the battery. The battery life ULTRA LOW.. for example when I used wireless hot spot function, in 45 min it's empty.  If I use the music player and the ear set...  1h:30min..  If I used the speakers... 1h:10min for drain the battery.Finally some months later appears N900. With the promise of solution about that points...  My sense.. I was a RAT LAB..  N97 is a BETA VERSION, VERY EXPENSIVE... of N900.I think is a unfair offering when I pay US$600 for the "last tech" but only some months late appears a "new Model". NOKIA is out of my  options for unfair.
well the first thing, i'm write this post from my very cool N97.Ok, say that go to the important thig.1. The phone ship in the date estimated. Great!2. I'm live in Chile and this phone work great in my country. Very nice!3. The keyboard it's espectacular. Very comfortable!4. The feel&look; it's really cool.5. Absolutty all my contacts i have sync from my gmail account. This is really great, because all thing that  i have in my cell phone sync to my gmail and the same in the other way.6. The camera it's ok. Is not a espectacular, but cam on, it's a cell phone.In the other hand. The Symbian OS it's ok, but i think with Android or Maemo this phone Rocks! -is not only a phone, actually in my first day i use a variety of functionallaty but i don't recive any call and i don't call anyone XD.I installed putty for my SSH connections and other thing that a think it's the posibillity of download multimedia files and management.In the past few days i download a zip file which containt a lot of mp3 files. The cell phone download them and when i open the zip file, the browser offer my extract the content in any path of i want. I extract in the music collection and after i updated the collection. The new files was added to the collection. That it is a really cool thing.
I bought my N97 from Amazon in July, but since day one it shuts down on me at least once a day. This is really annoying specially when it does not turn back on immediately. Besides this inconvenience, the N97 is really a great phone with nice features and a much easier to use touchscreen when compared to the Iphone.
I recommend you this phone, after the last firmware's update  installed it's a SUPER PHONE!!!The internet calls works excellent, i've a connection with a zultys pbx (Using WiFi) and the quality is amazing, video calls in 3G are very good too!!
Great phone with some issues as you can read in others reviews. I'm happy with N97 and hope Nokia can bring to us new firmwares updates.
Had this phone for over a month and love it. Sure it has a few glitches and bugs, but have already done two firmware updates and most of these seem to have been ironed out. What piece of technology doesn't have weak points? The only thing that is a little off seems to be the signal strength. I live in a marginal area and it doesn't seem to be as good as previous phones. Call quality is good. In saying that it has improved slightly since the updates. GPS is a little slow acquiring the satellites, but this also is better (not perfect).The one issue everyone seems to worry about is the qwerty keypad. I can assure you that once you get the hang of it, it is simple to use, and it seems that it was designed well. Once you learn the shortcuts it is pretty fast to type on.Battery doesn't last very long - but what do you expect when you are running all the features non-stop and constantly opening it up to play on it - because it is a cool phone.I recommend this phone to anyone. I am very happy with it.
Perfect phone, perfect pictures, really good GPS, hudge memory!! It is a great smartphone! I had before a N95 8gb, and the N97 is better!! And finally a Nokia phone really beatiful!Just some weakness, sound for ringing is not so load, and de vibration is weak to. But is just that!
i've had my n97 for a week now and i LOVE it!!! the only problem i had with it was the backlight wouldnt turn on sometimes but last night i updatedthe firmware and it went away...so now, my n97 is PERFECT...IPHONES are sooooo overrated!!!
This is Amazing Phone. But you must keep firmware uptaded!Theres some uptades avaiables. It's very important! and It's very easy!
So far I like it,  it's very stable for the most part but ocasionally it has issues with connecting to the net,  this might be due to the phone or due to the fact that the at&t; network in my small town has been neglected last 6 years and barely works. it tends to drop calls easily but overall is pretty good.  also it doesn't get nearly as good of signal as a blackberry in low signal areas.  it does require quite a bit of fiddling to get some of the settings the way you like but overall it's very easy to use,  I love the 32 gigs of internal memory,  provides lots of space for apps and music,  the video quality on the phone is also very good but the format support is limited.  the camera is exceptional,  it takes extremely clear crisp images and the video quality when using in video mode isn't bad either.  the second camera for video chat is of poor quality,  it's not good for making pictures but it is perfect for what it's ment for,  video calling.some questions I had about the phone when I ordered it I would like to provide answers for in case others have same question.first off,  the phone has several types of memory avalible,  your ram,  which is required to run programs,  it's got quite a bit for a phone but I think it could use more.  second is the phone memory,  I'm not sure how much is avalible total,  never bothered to check,  but I believe it's around 40-60 megabytes.  this is the primary location you'll install most of your applications.  the third area of memory is the 32 gigs of storage space,  you can store anything in it and even install more programs here,  please note not all applications will run properly from this memory,  but most do.  be careful about installing apps that are always running into this memory,  cause when you plug the phone into your computer in mass storage mode,  this memory is not accessable to your phone and apps running from it will run into problems.  the same is true for the last area of memory,  micro sd cards.  insert any size you want up to 16 gigs and you have just that much more storage added to your phone.  works just like the 32 gig memory,  you can put apps or whatever on it,  same thing about apps that run all the time in background applies to cards too.  also some older apps will only recognize the first memory card device,  the 32 gig memory looks like a card to most apps.  meaning many older apps will see it,  but will not see the sd card.  this is a limitation of the older apps,  not the phone.the gps reciever in the phone isn't very good,  it takes a long time to get a lock and looses signal pretty easy,  but it does work and works well enough to get the job done.I can't tell you how good 3g is on it,  I do not live in area with 3g coverage,  but edge is decent,  that is,  when I'm away from home,  edge network here creeps at about 2kbs,  it used to be much much faster but at&t; neglected the network and it's gotten very slow and unreliable in past few years.problems I've found with the device is sometimes the os will get unstable,  it's rare,  but when it happens you'll just have to reset the phone in most cases,  there is two methods to reset,  one is to dial a code,  the other is to hold a combo of keys while turning it on.  I know both work as I've tried both,  however I can't remember them of hand,  google can help.  the back doesn't seem well made to me,  but it's held on rather well so maybe it's a little stronger than it appears.  there is one app,  accuweather that comes on the phone,  I've had issues with this app from the start,  it rarely works,  recomendations on fixes or a better app is welcome.  often times the phone will have issues connecting to the net,  for no reason whatsoever the web browser will keep giving connection errors,  most people have recomended powering the phone on and off to get it to reconnect.  I found a quicker way that usually works.  exit your browser and go to home screen,  hold the end call button till it asks if you want to end data connections,  answer yes,  relaunch browser.  works nearly everytime but sometimes you still have to resort to restarting the phone.overall my thoughts on the device are it's worth the money.  most of the problems it has are fixed with the current firmware update,  there are still a few lingering problems I hope the 2.0 update coming out will fix.  but for someone who wants a decent media phone with lots of space,  it's definately worth the money.
Cannot get GPS to work other then that the phone works fine. Also trying to download some apps failed.
I had an N95 with which I was so happy, so I decided to buy the N97 seems fantastic complies perfectly with every item that N97 promised.Phone to make calls perfectCamera 5 mpx very good its time to have more mpxMemory 32 gb perfectGps (garmin) perfectSynchronize phone and pc (via bluetooth) perfectWireless very goodTouchscreen perfectThe keyboard perfectTo play music very goodIntegrated Ovi Applications goodto be honest I had no problem with the phone, it works to perfection
The N97 is a good device but not great...It includes all these great features and while the device is not great in any one of those features, it does all the features well enough....kinda like how a swiss army knife behaves. If you are looking for an all-around device. This may be it.A couple things to consider before buying the device:1. The touchscreen uses resistive technology and not capacitive technology (like the iPhone). As far as resistive touchscreens go, the touchscreen is as responsive as a resistive touchscreen can get. The key is to use the tip of your finger for best response and not the bottom flesh of your finger (resistive toucscreen responds to pressure and not static electricity like capacitive).2. I also recommend going to [...] to have the nokia messaging client installed. It is far better than the built-in default client.3. Right now because the product is quite new, there are a few bugs. Nokia is excellent at product and software support, and just like most of their phones, the stability and performance of the N97 will be very good after a couple of firmware updates. You just have to patiently wait for that to happen (this is the price of buying a product as an early adapter).4. The keyboard is okay. It's not the best keyboard out there and there isn't a lot of tactile feedback. However, its still a lot better than having only a virtual keyboard on touchschreens like the iphone. After a couple of days, I was typing quite fast on it.
Okay i'm not going to be like the other who is going to write about so much details that it will not affect us, i will try to talk from user point of view:Good:1- FM radio, transmit MP3 songs to your car radio ( i love it)2- 48 GB memory capacity so good3- Video Streaming from Device to TV and the other way around (Excellent feature)4- Camera quality is good (Not the best but better then many mobile cameras)5- Front screen template you can organize it the way you want making it so easy to dial, check your email, face book or any other application with just one touch, (Can never be better)6- very easy to be used7- Processor speed, way better then any other phone especially Iphone 3G, this mobile 5 times faster then Iphone especially when you are trying to access sms masseges and other application, iphone really slow this phone is way betterNeutral:Scrolling is not at all competitive to Iphone, it's better then the previous nokia version 5800Bad:Battery: Same battery used on Nokia 71, its good but not good enough to support such mobile with FM transmiter, Blutooth, 3G, WIF etc, you need to charge the phone once a day at least if not more, depending on your usage for the phone and application.The biggest disappointment is the application, this phone comes with no business applications:A- Adobe reader, trial 15 daysB- Office, trial 15 daysC- Internet Radio - Not compatibleD- Same boring softwares and applications that we used to download for the past 10 years is still repeating it self in more boring waysE- Exchange, is still very basic version, ASCI code reading and does not support HTML, making the Exchange emails and other POP3 etc so ugly experience and basic comparing to Iphone.When i have purchased this device i have concluded that it's not good enought to be my business phone, i concluded that this device complete the problems of the Iphone and i have to buy both to have proper solution.Now i'm moving with 2 phones Iphone 3gs 32GB and Nokia 97, which it's really disappointing from my point of view.Nokia N97 mistake is the limited applications available for it, i wish that nokia can really improve it by adding free of charge upgrades for the following:1- HTML format email reading, exchange2- Office3- Adobe4- FlashReal player should support more video codecs MKV, H.264Regards,
I am a Nokia customer and enthusiastic for over a decade. In the recent past, I have lectured a lot to anyone on how N95 (my previous cell phone) was far better than iPhone. Finally, I've waited anxiously for N97 release since it was announced until I bought my own piece in Amazon, by the opportunity of a friend's trip to USA, because I live in Brazil.The phone handling is quite good, but lacks a lot of functionality and intuitive commands you find in iPhone, but so far so good. It irritated me a lot the constant auto-reset "obsession" shown by N97, but I looked to me as an issued to be fixed in next firmware. It was sooo frustrating when I had to configure my e-mail account more than 3 times because it simply disappeared from my phone without any trace...When I was just getting used with all N97 peculiarities and handling, just listening to some music (with no other application running simultaneously), I tapped on the playing song's name and tried to add it to a specific playlist and the phone just froze... and showed the same froze image for over an hour, until I decided to take off the battery and reset it by force, since the hard reset (hitting 3 buttons) wasn't working at all.Well, ever since my phone did not work anymore. Whenever I start it up, it stops and freezes at the white page with Nokia logo. Not even the start-up song is played... In a desperate measure, I left it "thinking" alone for over 7 hours, but it didn't revive. Plugging it to a computer and exchanging batteries also did not work.Left it in a Nokia authorized tech support, but they just returned it to me with its death sentence, since it would be necessary to replace the mother board...Now, I'm trying contact with Nokia and Amazon for over 5 days, but still no response from none of them. I think they are going to just turn their backs to me...That's why I am buying tomorrow the new iPhone 3GS 32GB, a more reliable and fancy phone. Why I didn't buy it ealier? Because iPhone did not have video camera and still does not have a true GPS with navigation. Guess what? N95 showed me how it sucks to be trying to reach somewhere and someone calls you... It's annoying. That's why I'll buy also a dedicated GPS, which will certainly work better than N95, N97 and iPhone all together.PLEASE BE SMART AND DON'T BUY N97 AND ANY OTHER NOKIA CELL PHONE.Leandro Armani
I've now used my N97 for 2.5 months or so. Even though the device has already lived through two important firmware updates, it has still got some major bugs and inconsistencies in usability, stability and performance. Even after the updates, I'm surprised how badly and half-way the software is developed and designed, and how this ultimately cracks all the promising value from many intendedly great features that cannot be found anywhere else in a single unit.Before buying my N97, I had an iPhone for two weeks. I returned it because of some major feature limitations, including the lack of multitasking & file system, among others. I loved iPhone's user interface and the "it-just-works" fluency in most dimensions. Now I regret my decision.So what's wrong with the N97 concretely? First, for a great user experience, fluent and reliable operation is an imperative. The N97 doesn't have this and probably never will - even after several firmware updates. The phone is incredibly slow, especially when multiple apps are open. Some apps are just slow regardless of how many apps you have open, including the camera as well as active notes. This majorly distracts the use of the device and usually generates frustration. Many of the applications are also prone to jamming. This requires constant restarting of the device -- which is slow and consumers the battery considerably. Perhaps related, the memory needed for applications to run is incredibly small. Often you have to close programs before doing something.Second, several services that many use frequently, such as Skype, Gmail, Facebook, YouTube, PDF reader, have either badly designed apps for N97, or no apps at all (e.g. YouTube, Skype). Comparing to my iPhone experince, there is generally a night-and-day difference. Third, there's a number of rather stupid usability design flaws such as: music doesn't stop after unplugging earphones but instead activates speakers (I've had several humiliating experiences with this); menu structures of most apps are overly complicated; different sets of special characters are available through keyboard vs. on-screen keypad (sometimes you have to switch to the other to get them); cannot adjust wakeup beep volume, cannot change to any international language (like iPhone), and many others. Small things, but add to a larger reservoir of dysfunctionality.Fourth, even though the physical and technical features of the device have been praised, they're not without problems either: camera cover scratches the lens, camera flash distorts the picture on other side because it's too close to the lens; GPS is incredibly inaccurate and slow in updating the location -- much more so than in earlier Nokia phones I've had; the quality of voice is very bad -- many of my friends keep constantly complaining about the quality of voice calls from me; the battery life is poor -- in normal use I have to charge every night, sometimes even more often; there's difficulties in connecting via USB to Ovi Player on PC (phone not recognized by the PC software).To sum up, in everyday use the Nokia N97 involves a lot of waiting, restarting both apps and the phone, charging, solving all kinds of problems, as well as unintuitive and missing functionalities. It's not fluent. Rather, it's frustrating.So is there anything good? Yes, there are a number of - intendedly, at least - great features. Cameara with excellent 5 megapixel accuracy, lots of mass memory (though not for running apps), multitasking, the widget-based home screen, coverage of all thinkable network technology, gps and maps with navigation, music store & manager, FM transmitter, software market, etc. Precisely because of these intendedly great features I'm giving two stars instead of just one. However, all these potentially great features are now suppressed under the major design flaws in and half-way developed user interface and software.With this product, Nokia may be able to generate some sales with a relatively high price. But the price is not based on the value of the product. Rather, it is based on Nokia's brand as the largest and most innovative mobile phone manufacturer. However in the long run, if the products are not able to match the brand promise.. Well, I'd not buy Nokia's stock.
Bought this phone in September. Really frustrating phone.Complaints:-- Processor is not good enough to handle phone's own applications -- phone freezes all the time...-- ... In order to reboot it you need to pull out the battery...-- ... And than wait for a long time for it to load...-- ... Which doesn't happen all the time so every now and then you have to remove the battery and restart it again-- Its happening now AFTER I upgraded software, before it was an even bigger nightmare-- Applications are scarce and of much lower quality than iphone apps-- constant "not enough memory" error messages. Come on --  the phone has a ton of memory -- its just that N97 OS doesn;t know how to use it. My overall experience is like i'm running windows95 on this phone...Bottom line --> if that was a car and Nokia was a responsible company they would have recalled the phone. It's really not a good finished product ...
I purchased this phone in June, 2009, and have had quite a bit of time to work with it; here are my impressions. First, let's put aside the period before the new update came in (from June through November). In that time, the phone clearly was unfinished - from a cranky USB connection that, by the point of the update to 2.0, was essentially no longer functioning for data transfer, to the lack of an ability to Sync with a Macintosh, to the barely-functioning GPS system, to an interface that was startling in 1999, but which had long since lost much of its zip. Many, but unfortunately not all, of those problems were fixed with the new operating system that came in November, version 2.0. I say "new operating system" because significant changes came - a new feel to the menuing system (that gave you a kinetic movement to the menus, along with other enhancements); changes to the GPS system; a fix to the USB problem ... etc. But that should point you to some of the very real problems with this phone: it was released unfinished, and still lacks much in the way of what should be there, particularly for this price!Beyond the mere hardware - and the other reviews highlight the shortcomings of that - there's the question of the bigger picture. It's simple things like: can I find a good range of cases for this phone? (No, not really.) Are there decent apps? (No, the Ovi store is  a bleak, pathetic place.) Does it seem as if Nokia will continue supporting this phone for some time to come? (Well, no: they announced a new flagship phone, the N900, as early as August - a phone that uses a completely different operating system.) When you compare the cost of this phone with what you'd pay for, say, a top-of-the-line Omnia, or one of the Windows OS phones, or an Android phone, or - best yet - an iPhone - it just doesn't stack up.So what did I do? Well - I'm fortunate to live in a country where I can legally purchase a factory unlocked iPhone. When I travel back to the U.S., I'll be using it with TMobile (still one of the most affordable networks - if you live somewhere that's got coverage.) My N97 will still be used, as a backup/secondary/charmingly expensive accessory - but never, never as my primary phone. Basta - enough - that's it, I'm done with Nokia, perhaps just for now - perhaps forever.
So far, I was not able to test it fully but until now it didnt disappointed me.
What a great phone, so far everything with this phone works great, the full key board is easy to type with, great email connections, very bright screen.
I'M NOT MUCH OF A INTERNET USER BUT TO HAVE A PHONE, HAVE NOKIA.IT HAS A BETTERRECEPTION COMPARE TO ANY OTHER PHONE THAT I HAVE COME SO FAR.EVERY CELL PHONE WILL ALWAYSHAVE NO MATTER HOW BEST THEY TRY TO INVENT,IT WILL NOT ABLE TO SATISFY THE USER TO THEIR NEED.TAKE MY ADVISE AND CHOOSE THE NOKIA FOR YOUR GOOD AS NEW.
If you want a cellphone you need a Nokia....Nokia N97 is awsome! This is a real phone....a real computer....
1. Nokia is always been known for their battery life and signal quality it shows on this device2. The battery life is great 1500mah. You can easily go a day or 2 without worrying about charging your phone.  All my calls are loud and clear haven't had a drop call yet.3.Touch screen is resistive not capacitive. Being a ex iphone user It did take me a while to get used to  b/c its not heat sensitive. All you have to do is use your fingernail or stylus and you will be surprise how responsive it really is.4. Great thing I love about nokia is there customer service and firmware updates. U never have to wait long for a firmware upgrade.5. UI/Symbian  Personally I found the software very basic/plain looking they could of done a better job. But the software works well and it does what its suppose too. The phone gives you sooo many options and features to customize the phone to your needs Which I like but Some people may find it confusing though. Symbian OS is not for everybody i think the software is great easy to use, doesn't glitch or freeze, syncs up to your multiple emails with ease, Able to multi task unlike the iphone.6. overall its a great device, If you like being different and if your service with att is great in your area. I would totally recommend this device.SOO many features, Fm tuner,fm radio,5mpcamera,facebookapp,32gb. If your a iphone fan boy you will most likely hate this phone haha :P. This phone is not made for idiots unlike the iphone :P. If have trouble syncing up your damn email account on your cell phone. This is tooo much phone for you :O
Perfecttt i also used iphone 3g before. N97 is much much better. Iphone is ahead slight with web browsing
Nokia N97, the best little everything phone I've owned. Works like the quality phone it is with all the intellect that you could possibly ask for. I can honestly say I am only dissapointed in one thing(but I can wait) and that's not having Sirius radio here in Hawaii. One day I imagine they'll get it together.
I have owned the n95 for a few years and it's the best phone/camera/phone hybrid ever-a bit buggy but OK-the N97 is a great improvement-I also have an iphone. The n97 must be the king of all phones-how can you get GPS, high quality camera and video in one device-a mini computer minus Microsoft? I tested both the camera and video on the n97 and is much better than the n95-close to a HD camera-and then you get the touch screen as a plus.
If you are a power user, don't buy this phone.For comparison, i had a blackberry 8800 that I wanted to replace.Bottom line up front: Don't buy it.  I'd rather take a risk on the HTC Touch Pro 2 if you can wait for it on your carrier/afford it unlocked.  Or wait longer and see what android phones come out.Rather than bore you with discussion of why I originally chose the n97, lets just get into my experiences:Major Issues:1. It no longer receives text messages except when sending.  (This is within a month of buying)2. The exchange email sync locks up regularly and normally has to be manually sync'd when it is working.  Also, notes doesn't sync at all for me.3. Even if you install everything to the phones 32GB memory, the phones small internal memory still fills up causing the phone to basically lock up.4. I find myself rebooting the phone regularly to get it to work.5. The web browser becomes unresponsive while loading pages (so if 1 picture on the page isn't loading, you can't browse the rest of the page.  I find myself regularly waiting for pages to load rather than reading what is already loaded.)  Also, even when loaded pages don't scroll around very well.6. The software availability is much less than I expected.  Maybe I'm just bad with google, but it seems like most the programs I want are from the US.  And US developers seem to develop in this order: 1. iphone 2. blackberry 3. windows mobile.  They just don't develop for s60.  For some reason I can never fine the European equivalent of the programs I want.  Also, very few programs seem to have been updated from s60v3 to s60v5 so even if someone HAS done the software, it doesn't necessarily work on this phone.  That includes most of nokia's own software.7. Battery life is not enough to make it through an entire day if you're using it regularly throughout the day.  It'll make it if you leave it in your pocket while you're at work, but if you leave it on your desk, (say because work blocks all the websites you want to visit), you better plan to have it plugged in the whole time.8. The call log stopped recording so I can't see who called me any more.9. I have to leave it on vibrate so it doesn't ring at work yet can rarely actually feel it ring.  I don't know if it's not vibrating or just so week I can't tell but I miss 100% of the calls I get when I'm not looking directly at it.10. The phone app does not interact well with any other app so you'll likely screw up a call if you're in an app when you get it.  Alternately I regularly have trouble actually hanging up.  I don't think the red button on the bezel works the same as the "end call" soft button.11. It takes at least 3 clicks to do basically anything whether it's run a program, view a contact or pick who to send a text message to.  nothing is well laid out.Minor issues:1. All the configuration options are buried, obscured or unavailable.  It's a hunt to try and configure anything.2. The Facebook app requires 2 clicks just to tell it 'yes you can connect to the internet' every time you open it.  (This is pretty consistent.  Everything wants your personal interaction to tell it how to connect to the internet.  This is easy: if available, use wifi, if not use cellular.  With AT&T; there are another 2 or 3 options I don't even understand.)3. The Facebook app stopped loading pictures.4. It doesn't come with a password keeper and all the options are mediocre on this phone.  (There are 3 or 4 options but none I consider acceptable.  I could do an entire post on whats wrong with the different password keeper options.)5. Ovi Store doesn't let you re-download programs.  It knows you've bought them but it won't let you reload them.6. The podcast program doesn't automatically download your podcasts in the background and it doesn't save your spot in them.  (However, I found out if you play the podcasts through the music player it will save your spot as long as you don't play anything else in between.)7. The screen does not redraw well8. The music player is mediocre at best.  It seems I have to dig down to the song just to play anything.  I'd like to hit 'play' and have some random song play.  This is an acceptable player for maybe 2 or 3 years ago.  Today people expect a reasonably thought out interface.9. The rss reader is built into the web browser and has to be dug down to.  Why can't I just hit an RSS app and have my RSS's, updated, at my fingertips?10. Ok, I know below I throw a bone to the keyboard, but it's quirky.  I regularly hit the 'right' key on the d-pad when trying to type which sends my cursor to the front of the text, (where I then type half a sentence before realizing it).  Also, I regularly confuse the 3 'alt' keys, (which you'll use regularly).  This slows me down and causes me to retype a lot.  Also, I'll get an 'alt' key locked in place and type a whole sentence in numbers and symbols.11. Just can't find a reasonable game for it.  I just want a simple RPG to keep me busy when I don't have a cellular connection but can't find one that will install.12. The cut and paste are very poorly implemented.That said, it's not a completely terrible phone1. In general, all the hardware is good.  They've got a decent platfrom, their just abusing it with terrible software.2. I get a TON of use out of the 32gb of memory.  It's just like having a 32GB memory stick with you as long as you've got the cable.3. I like podcasts on my phone. If the software was a bit better it'd be perfect.  I let them download in the background and then play them in my car whenever I drive, (and all things considered and morning addition aren't on).4. At least it can kinda sync.  It brought over my exchange contacts and calendar.  That is pretty nice though I'm not sure it's actually sync'ing changes backwards.5. I like the integration between the GPS, the Nokia 'locations' program, google maps, etc.  There's even a program to GPS tag your photos.6. The camera takes great photos and reasonable video.  Qik is cool for streaming/sharing video online.7. The keyboard isn't bad inherently.  The keys are definitely ok to type on.8. Size and feel of the phone are pretty good. The flip up is great.9. The widgets are nice though I don't use the facebook (I had it up for a bit but I never really cared about anything it was showing me) or the weather (the weather has a solid background which is an ugly contrast to most other widgets that are semi-transparent) widgets.10. It makes a great modem for a laptop, whether as a wifi access point or as a tethered modem.  That said, I wish the hardware supported WPA because, being at DEFCON this week, WEP is just asking someone to crack it.Hope this helps others avoid a very expensive mistake.  I'll probably try and sell it on ebay and go back to my 8800 while I wait for AT&T; to get the HTC Touch Pro 2.  I just hope it's not crippled in some way.
I bought the N97 phone as an upgrade to my unlocked N95.  The phone is larger than the N95 and does indeed have a resistance based touchscreen.  The touchscreen was he only thing I felt would make the N95 the best phone ever.  However, with the N97 as you chat on the phone your face will activate items on your home screen, particularly an alarm setting.The phone did not come equipped with free symbian software for word, spreadsheets and abobe documents as the N95 did.  That you had to pay $20 to download which was disappointing.The internet connection shifting from webpage to webpage is slow to load, even with a 3.5G network, it was very fast(moreso than my computer) on the N95 phone with a 3G network.Many of the features are hard to figure out without a manual and it is annoying to have the memory card inside the same compartment areas as the battery.  Everytime you wish to remove the memory card you have to remove the backplate cover of the phone, instead of having a slot on the side of the phone.  There are many icons whle connected to the internet and looking at your email that you have no clue what they mean unless you are used to seeing them.  Lot of trial and error.  Simply the N95 was easier to work with, more compact and lightwieght and came preinstalled with many items of use that I appreciated so the price was worth it.This N97 is too pricey for the lack of preinstalled full useful versions of symbian software.
The phone is amazing, because it s very complete and very friendly... If you re kind of smart...lol, you can have almost everything in it
I just bought my cellphone, at the beggining i was very scared because i use to be a blackberry user all my life because my work, so i bought this phone here at amazon, and its great! YES is a brand new PHONE! so it have a lots of BUGS but almost at lot of the have been fixed, thats why i gave 4 stars! but the phone its amazing i used to have the blackberry storm, bu believe me this one its GREAT the  things that i dont like are the backcover its plastic made, the MSN LIVE is not working at all,the video support (only MP4) and they are not to much app right now, but im sure that we will have a lot of apps early in this future. but believe me i love this phone and everybody looks at my phone! it looks great in your hand! AND THE INTERNET SURFING IS JUST AMAZING!!!! im in mexico and im having a 1.3 MB of 3g speed! is not too bad! i gues that in USA will be faster! but i dont need to much speed.the bugs im having till now are:*CANT UPLOAD ALL MY PICTURES to FACEBOOK (this is a facebook ISSUE)*When you have low battety theirs a very low frecuency sound (on the next update nokia said that it will be fixed)* I cant put to wallpapers at the same time (this is not a bug, you just cant, but i hate that i want a landscape wallpapper an a portrait wallpaper)*All othe issues have been already fixed (locks, reboots, lights)The batery life on my n97 its like 24 hours but please believe on this im almost 15 hrs on my phone internet, because i use it alot on my work, and i have this program that i recibe my emails just the moment it was sent, just like the blackberry so its 22 hours on the net! when im not surfing too much on the net it can hold up to 3 days!Sorry about my english, but im typping really fast, and i dont have a great grammar! but what im trying to tell you is that,if you are not specting a laptop and you are realistic about the things a smartphone can do. this cell phone is GREAT dont hezitate on buying it! it looks great and very like executive! LOLgreetings!
Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)
It's complete, the only downside is the ram memory, but I guess nokia will be fixing it in the next frimware update.
N97 is, to me, the best phone available right now!In this Amazon item it does not come with Comes With Music or any other accessories (just the charger and head phones). But the low price make it a great by!Totally recommend it!
I made a lot of research before ordering this phone. Saw all the pros and against in many sites and based my decision upon them since I didn't know anybody who had it. I was willing to spend some money so I tried to choose carefully. My main driven was the physical qwerty keypad, updated technologies and the large screen. The N97 fulfilled them (except for the size of the letters in the keypad where Nokia did it again - TOO SMALL for people above the 40!). It's nicely built, very powerful and rich in specifications so I guess it covers almost every possible need with its 3G, GPS, bluetooth, WiFi, qwerty keyboard, touchscreen, SD slot, excellent camera, etc but I am afraid I (or it) was not prepared to deal with too many technologies put together. The system is not fast enough to manage them all and probably because of my anxiety it had actually frozen and had to be restarted twice in one week using it. I also fail to recognize the logic behind the menu tree, probably my fault as well.I still have a lot to learn and explore, since, as I said, it's a very resourceful machine. So, while I do not intend to give up, I am a bit disappointed with the so waited phone but, having experienced the only competitor for most of my needs, the Iphone, and being unable to deal with its touchscreen keypad, bottom line, it is still the best choice for me so far.
Coming back from iPhone and Palm and HTC i thought this N97 would be a breath in the fresh air. TO begin with the OS Symbian is aged. Man they really should have worked hard if they want to compete with the smoothness and sleekness of iPhone. Phone gets slower by the day.More apps you put on it it becomes more slower to use. Dialing is really confusing.The Menu button beside dial button is asking for trouble. While you are in a hurry you would press the menu button mistakenly for sure.To find a contact takes ages. It does not have smooth scrolling like iPhone so you have to type on the keyboard to find the contact.And it keeps on asking for data connection. If you dont have data package this will make you crazy. Even if you have wifi every time it goes online asks for access point. Real bummer.By the way the silver metallic finish on the edge of the keyboard got bad paint job. It comes off after a month of use. I mean come on the $1000 dollar phone should have had better build quality!The only thing attracted me about this phone was physical keyboard. Which I now only use for SMS as the email software built in to the phone is totally useless. The best email client is on iPhone no question about it.Anyway 2 cents.
Last year I purchased the Nokia N-95 8 GB unlocked cell phone, which I thought was a great phone.  However, recently I purchased the Nokia N-97 32 GB, 3G unlocked cell phone, and I have to say it is far superior to the N-95.  The ease with which you can access and interface with the telephone is outstanding.  If you are looking for a new cell phone and have a little extra cash to spend, I would highly recommend this phone.Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)
I never thought I would hate a piece of technology, but the N97 phone changed everything. The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are OK, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunction, until I can afford another phone.
I just received my N97.  Upgraded from my E71 which I got at Christmas time.  I have been playing with my N97 all day.  I am really enjoying it.  It has tremendous features and many options I am still learning.  My kids have had I Phones since they came out.  I was never interested in Apple's product.  I resisted a slider for a long time.  I did enjoy my E71 but always wanted a bit more.  I will write more after a few weeks but my initial reaction is GREAT PHONE!
My order- N97 unlocked Phone, was delivered in 5 days as stated, and it was brought in brand new package with all the accessories inside.
While we have previously reviewed this product for the Vine Program, we enjoy its features very much. The cell reception as a phone is excellent in our area. The bells and whistles are fun should you want to use them. There are plenty. 3G is great too.
This phone is amazing, I had the n98 8 GB before and this blows it away in performance and functionality
I actually DON'T own a N97 myself. But nearly everyone around me had one. Everyone had different comments on the N97, just like people here had different words about this phone. There is a situation: I can rarely see any insight reviews... Most typical example: lazybones, you don't just compare iphone to N97, OK?? I've been a s60 and Nokia user for years and years until I lost my N82 a year ago. By that time, iPhone already spread out in the world. Needless to purchase a new phone, my dad had a spare iPhone, which substitutes my N82. And you know what, I found it's poisonous, because it's completely built for lazybones, and when people start becoming lazy, they never wanna change back. It's a easy thing to use iPhone, for sure, install things by touching once, but it never made me feel like a real owner and user of the phone like I did when I was with s60 in N82... Maybe I seem to have no points on what I'm saying, but I had this statement: if you are a fan of iPhone, then you would never start liking symbian, and most unlikely Nokia...Well since I did not have a N97, I don't deserve to RATE this stuff...instead, i just typed what I wanted to comment on all those pointlessly negative reviews... And I gave a three stars as a median rating... It's probably bad for N97 on Amazon, cuz it's actually a 3 1/2 currently...
It's not worth it with the price $699. It is really suck, with small amount RAM (128mb) and slow cpu. That's why phone always lag and error. Firmware outtodated, app sometimes error and hang, also sometimes u need do 2-3 times to unlocked key pad and wait for backlight on, so annoying. It is not what i expected for $699.
I've just received the Nokia N97 a few days ago and it's amazing.It has everything I was looking for... huge memory, high quality camera, good reception.Howerer, I have to say that I had problemas a couple of times when the phone stopped working... I guess it was because of the firmware because when I uptaded this issue no longer exists...There's one thing... I'm a music lover and the music player is not as good as the iphone's (that I owned before) I wish some day we can get iTunes on this phone, and everything would be wonderful
The best phone of the moment, it has everything in the same box, neither apple can achive that goal. Apple phones are just screens with icons,  useless applications and with middle technology, are just multimedia players with a GUI, not really phones.N97 is the best choice for everyone who wants to have everything in one gadget.
i need some information, if somebody buys this phone here in amazon, a need to know if is the nokia n97 made in finland or made in china, and wich if the RM number.thanks to all...
I was a rabid Nokia bigot for over a decade. I wanted a Nokia smartphone so badly that I couldn't wait for the n900. However this will be my last Nokia product. Best said on the forums "$700 and you too can become a beta tester for Nokia."  I spent a month trying to workaround all the bugs and kinks. The second firmware upgrade did help in that the charger stopped draining the battery and crashes were much more rare.  I never got the hang of answering the phone and touching the device without setting off the camera proved imposable.  Then the screen broke at day 31. Nokias support has taken a nose dive and told me it would be a month to check it out. However I found a workaround with recalibrating the screen.  Sick of the bugs I gave it away to someone who's HTC phone broke. His opinion toned down my hatred of this phone saying it's a great phone for free but paying for the phone makes the quality unacceptable.Pros.-With the warranty GPS upgrade OVI maps 3.0 is fantastic. It stores locally and replaces the need for a Garmin when on buiness trips.- With the warranty lens cover upgrade the camera takes pictures beyond any other phone.-  If you delete all the stock apps and reinstall on the 32 gig phone area the multi tasking is flawless beating all other phones hands down.- Once you figure out how to configure the setting the applications are very professional and reliable.- Battery life is vastly superior to other smart phones but not what one has grow accustom to in Nokia.Cons- Quality control has taken a nose dive.  It is only beta at best.- Customer support is useless and on the att bad level- Need to sent the phone to Nokia for upgrades.- No t-mobile 3G support- The notifications are too common and awkward ie loud painful beep in your ear telling you the data is not active when dialing on a GSM based network.-  Answering is a nightmare.  There is a magic combo of lock keys sliding arrows and button presses. I never answer on time.- They throw the camera in your face it is very annoying to always press away from the video call option.- Lots of dead batteries with pictures of you answering the phone and inside of your pocket - There is a wide array of activities that stop the charging process.- poor touch screen response- None standard USB cable-n900 is much better.
I am impress with the new Nokia N97, the picture quality is sharp as your camera, the video is much better. I like the interface, as you can hide the destop if you don't want it shown.  so far so good...
[...]Nokia OS is a joke -- takes 3 steps to answer a call or you may just miss it and disconnect it.More issues1) Cannot access email or even get it set up for a yahoo account2) very limited apps3) phone is a brick. too delicate to even attempt to use if you are active like at the gym but way to clunky to put in a pocket4) Edge is slow as [...] on Tmobile. This may not be the fault of Nokia but my blackberry 8900 flys5) the design is terrible, the keyboard is cheap and hard to use.
What a disappointment for a phone costing this much. Even though it has lots of features build in, phone just doesn't hold up to it's old reputation anymore. First week I tried it, phone froze multiple times, only way to fix it is take the battery out and let the phone go thru a hard re-boot. Most of the time the phone's ring tone settings mysteriously jump to silent and I missed a lot of phone calls. Ring tone volume and vibration are weak even though I set it to highest and loudest setting. Signal reception is weak compare to my old Nokia N95 (same sim card with same service used in same geographical area) meaning in weak reception area where my old N95 got 1 to 2 signal bars, I can still make and receive calls versus the N97 in the same area will say no signal.Very disappointing for a phone costing this much. If I wanted a phone with problems costing this much and made in china, I'd rather buy the iphone 3Gs at 1/3 the price. At least if I were to have any problem, I can just walk into an Apple or AT&T; store and either place will honor the warranty. I will be keeping my Made in Finland, Nokia N95 (high quality, no problems after 2+ years of use) phone for a few more years.
This is the absolute worst smart phone I've ever purchased.  It's really a dumb phone!  The user interface is overly complex and sluggish.  The apps (especially email and messaging are quite dated). Screen resolution is okay at best.  The keyboard is an embarrasment (there's no key travel), there are glitches in some of the apps.  The apps are very basic at best.Nokia claims that it's n-gage enabled, which it's not. Finally after 4 days of back and forth with tech support they said, "sorry about that".I tried to return but my call was 10hrs past my return deadline. I explained that technical support back and forth and they offered NO FLEXIBILITY. Nokia is the most unfriendly customer support company there is.I am going back to AT&T;, change my plan back to iPhone and then change to the new HTC Hero when it comes out.My phone will be on eBay this afternoon.This is almost like having a Chevy Nova engine in a Ferrari chassis. What an utter disapointment all the way around.
After using nokia for 10 years with almost all models now i decide to switch to iphone after trying this n97 low quality battery compartment the battery is  not enough to use it for 1 day  you need an extra software to manage the battery just to be able to talk for 1 day the handsfree is terrible everyone is complaining that they are not able to hear you and no way to compare with the touch screen quality between n97 and iphone so pls try it before buying this  very bad mobile phone
Hi all, I am the biggest nokia fan. I had around 10 or 12 phones in 8 years. I ordered Nokia N97 two weeks back [...], I recieved it on last week. I was so much happy to see my new N97. I opened it worked for 10 minutes then it didnt detect any network. I tried it with both two service providers in US. Didnt work, then I shippied it the next day and I ordered new N97. then I was waiting for 2 days then I received the new N97, opened and switched on, again defect. What the Heck.... there were two dark lines on the display. Come on what you nokia guys thinking.. are we stupid I paid $700. Now I am going to ship it back to them tomorrow. And more nokia in my life. switch to someother standard phone. So guys beware don't buy it. Thats all i can say.
I purchased the N97 with high hopes that it would be the Iphone killer. I opened the  box with great anticipation. I charged the battery popped in my ATT sim card as red to go only to have the screen go black and the phone cut off.  Turned phone back on. Input my email account,FaceBook info and Accu Weather information. Had to turn phone off and turned it back on and all the information i entered was gone. Re entered my information and tried to check out some you tube videos. At best the performance of the N97  was mediocre.  the videos played in partial screen and were not of good viewing quality and that was over wifi connection. Turned off the phone for the night only to turn it back on and have my information erased again.  Returned phone.This phone is worth maybe 199 tops. The S60 UI is dated and unresponsive on the touch screen and very slooooow. Touch Screen required multiple taps to get into every applications.  Not sure it i just got a bad unit or what but was very unhappy with this phone/ piece of crap...
Sorry I bought this product - I should have bought the Apple 3GS - oh well
I would never imagined that a $600 N97 would have a touchscreen keyboard like the old phones, with 3 letters per button. You need to touch up to 3 times a button to get certain letters. I returned it inmediatly.Cheers
After a year of bliss with my iPhone, I decided to see what the competition had been working on to try and catch up.  On paper this phone seems pretty good but the list of dissappointments is a mile long.The overall feel is delicate and cheap.  The flip up screen is poorly angled (too steep).The menu lists are excessively long and not the least bit intuitive.  This phone can do a lot of things most people will NEVER use and none of them are easy.  And to access all those fancy features, you need to navigate this Ovi website and software which I found hopelessly complicated and not really that powerful.The user manual is nice and brief but does not cover everything you need to get the phone online and using the music, voicemail (not mentioned anywhere!), text messaging, maps etc.  It says all this should be done from the Ovi web site but after hours of trying I only managed to get my email linked up and get some music on the phone.  There is no 'airplane mode" that I could find.  Big minus for me.  Even switching the ringer/sound off requires 2-3 steps.The touch screen is really primitive compared to the iphone and while the iphone screen can be too touchy sometimes, this one is just slow and unrefined for a $600 phone.I used my ATT SIM card and got phone service without any problems however. And the 16GB SD card worked without issue.  The size and weight of this phone are good but for a couple ounces I will trade back to Apple.This phone  IS NOT  a replacement for an iPhone.  If you love Apple's ease of use, common sense functions and overall high quality of finish, do not by the Nokia.  They are not even in the same league.
"I received a pre-release Nokia N97 from Nokia SA yesterday to take a look at and test for a couple weeks. The version I received is not the same version that will be shipped but it is probably pretty close. In a sense this is a release candidate so there is still a chance the software may be a little buggy and the phone isn't really supported by 3rd party providers. I've noticed a couple quirks which will probably be resolved by the time the phones ship (I understand that the devices will start shipping internationally in a matter of weeks although Nokia can't confirm any details at this point)." share your views with me at [...] it's a site for N97 users.  see ya
Hello, I shared this review with the black version of this phone, but I wanted to share it with this one as well so we who bought this version can get some insight. :)I am a phone app developer and have had some 'face time' with the Nokia N97.  I'll let you know some of the more in depth details so you can decide if this is the right phone for you or not.  There are many positive features about this phone, but a few potential pitfalls for power users as well.  Average users will probably never notice any of the pitfalls, but probably will never use some of the best features of this phone either to justify the cost.This is the new Nokia flagship phone and it packs almost every feature anyone could ever want.  It has a DVD quality camcorder with sample videos found here:[...]Notice how well the mic picks up the creeks of the boats in Monte Carlo, and how rich the colors look.  That is due to the Carl Zeiss lens Nokia has put in.  The quality is also great and can be sent directly to the TV via the TV out cable, but I would recommend making a DVD from the memory card as the quality of the cable isn't as good as the DVD quality this phone provides.  Video starts up quickly, which is an improvement from the previous versions.The pictures taken by this phone are of very good quality.  Many consumers are fooled by 'megapixels' (mp).  Well folks, after 5mp or so, mp doesn't mean much.  All it does is make your picture size better, it does NOT increase the QUALITY.  I assume most of us aren't pro graphic artists that need huge pictures to zoom in on the most minute detail, and if you are, then you probably don't need this review :PThe lens and picture quality of this phone is superb, but not as good as the Samsung 8 sadly.  It is by far tho, one of the best mobile phone cameras around.  You can notice some problems in darker areas and they went with a dual LED flash instead of the Xeon gas flash.  The Xeon gas flash would have provided much better lighting in low light situations, however as a phone enthusiast I feel it's good enough.View sample images from thesymbianblog.com:[...]and[...]Judge for yourself.This phone is a TRUE smart phone OS which means you can download apps for it such as VPN software to connect to your office network and apps such as PUTTY or RDP clients to remote control real computers at the house/office.  With 3G speeds the potential is limitless.Now for the bad.  Nokia decided to use the old ARM II CPU found in the N85, 95, etc. phones but increased the clockspeed (mhz) slightly.  We were looking forward to the new TI cpu which would have provided much better speeds, at the cost of battery life.  They also stuck with 128mb ram with about 80mb available after boot up.  I don't know about you but after I load up all of my apps and get cranking, I eat that up.  I was able to notice some slow down in the pre-build when I:-opened up several websites w/ flash content-ran the music player-opened up 'widget' applications-tried basic functionalityMost users will probably never do that.  If you are a power user, then you probably already know about the Samsung Omnia HD which boasts of similer features, but also the new faster CPU and dedicated GFX chip which means you can play Ipod type 3d games with ease.  The final point is with the potentially underpowered CPU, you will not be able to play the super high resolution videos the Samsung can play.Finally this phone has the slower 3G speeds which don't reach 7mbps, will you need 7mbps?  Probably not.  I think for 99% of users, the current 3G speeds offered by this phone are fine.I tried out the phone and pre-ordered, I can't wait to get it.  I can't wait to develop some 'widget' applications for it and really see the power of this phone with the newer more stable build.Thank you for reading this, feel free to respond, yell, scream, or ask any questions!
When I first learned of the n97's release, I was excited.  I had been waiting for Nokia to release another ground-breaking phone, like the n95 of years ago.  The n96 wasn't it, nor was the n85.  Then the n97 came - with a touchscreen and QWERTY keyboard to boot!  I was sold at once, but did all of my research anyway and found it to be full of innovative ideas and modern must-haves.  I bought it nearly two weeks ago at a reasonable discount from NokiasUSA after Amazon ran out of stock and jacked up the price.**If you read the specs, you will find all of the high points, but here are some more:-I found the phone to be fast and responsive when given input.  The keyboard is phenomenal - the key spacing and feel is just right and the offset space bar is not as big of a deal as it is often made out to be.  The only thing I could ask for is a little click to acknowledge the button was pushed, though if the sound is on the phone makes a small noise.  The keyboard could have been even bigger yet if they dropped the D-Pad, which I rarely find myself using as it is a touchscreen (maybe make it a secondary feature for other keys?).-The GPS unit quickly finds a satellite signal (faster than most Tom-Toms) and accurately places you on a detailed map.  The turn-by-turn voice directions work well, except they do not read the street name.  Best of all, it doesn't make you agree to do-not-drive-as-you-use-this-device waivers every time the program launches.-The call quality is excellent.-No contract and not bogged down with un-deletable carrier apps and tacky logos that remind you who bought your soul.**The bad and the ugly:-My first thought when I handled it was, "a little chintzy, eh?"  It does give off the impression for a little while, primarily because of the battery cover.  They used a plastic, snap-on/ pry-off cover whose snaps are easily bent out of shape, but did not break and easily bent back.  The rest of the construction, especially the hinge, seems to be very solid now that I have used it extensively.-The 5MP camera takes remarkable photos and videos, unless you want to use the flash, which is too close to the lens and whites out a third of the image.  Thinking about this more, I decided Nokia has used a very similar camera since September of 2006 when the first n95 debuted and such a quirk is unacceptable in something that has been around the technology world for so long.-The battery life is terrible.  With normal use, it will most likely get 24-30 hours.-Reception is bad.  The internal antenna does not pickup signal where my Blackberry does and my Samsung (4 years ago) before it did, to include my apartment in Boston (not exactly East Reeve, Wisconsin).-The FM transmitter is hardly worth having.  After trying numerous stations I know to be unused in my area, the reception in my newer Audi with rear-mounted antenna was terrible unless I held the phone out the sunroof.  I assume if you have a hood mounted antenna, it would be a little better (does anyone know?).-The resistive touchscreen is outdated and  somewhat unresponsive.  Resistive touchscreens are great if you wear gloves, and if they are huge, but that doesn't happen on a mobile phone.  Resistive touchscreens use a grid-like system to figure out where they've been touched, as they have invisible lines that make a grid across the screen.  When the selected area is touched, the corresponding up/down and left/right lines are pushed against sensors on the screen's edge and send the information to the processor.  Capacitive screens measure minute differences in its electric field cause by the conductive human body and are generally much more accurate.-The inertia scrolling is not as one would expect, probably because of the aforementioned screen.  It does not matter how fast the screen is flicked, the information displayed travels the same measly distance and stops rather quickly no matter what, if it works at all.  Navigating web pages is probably the only reason I would use the provided D-Pad just because the scrolling with the touchscreen is so terrible.-The accelerometer, which detects the direction the phone is tilted, is often incorrect and the phone is very slow to change the screen's display between portrait and landscape.-Oftentimes, the phone must be unlocked 2 or 3 times to get the LCD's backlight to turn on.  This may be a software or a hardware malfunction, I do not know.-The talk and end button are not raised but should be, especially because the phone does not acknowledge them having been pressed for a second after.  Plus, real buttons are always preferred.**Then there's the software:-The user interface is not so good.  Every application has an options menu, but after the application has been customized, you probably will not find much need for any of the other options except exit, which is buried at the bottom of the menu and needs to be scrolled to.The phone screen is inefficiently laid out.  On the screen there is a "Call" and "End" button, both of which are physical keys on the phone itself, as well as a "Contacts" button which can be found on the previous screen.  I would rather just see bigger numbers.  Also, the phone is setup to display two lines of numbers and forces a single number from the area code on on the second line when I would rather like to see bigger number buttons and ALL US numbers on a single line.-The homescreen widgets do not update as freely as one might like, the AccuWeather is rarely connected and my Hotmail account will ONLY refresh manually.  The FaceBook app is good.-The homescreen has a button on it to change the sound profile, but tapping the power button brings up the same menu - Nokia should just get rid of the redundancy and dedicate the space to, well, uhhh, anything else.-No QWERTY keyboard option on the touchscreen.-Being able to run multiple apps is great, but switching between them shouldn't mean a fight with the options menu, there should be an external button to switch between them.-The homescreen has an option to compose a new message, but not one to read old messages.  The button should be dedicated to going into the messenger application instead.-Half of the menus require a double touch while the other half require a single touch.-Plus a dozen smaller "Oh, that's silly" features not worth mentioning.-My phone has needed to be reset because one or more different things were not working correctly at least once a day, though it has never frozen completely.  Once, strangely, the touchscreen would highlight the selected app/item, but fail to execute the command completely.Overall, it is a good phone, but certainly not worth the money.  I recommend you wait for the first major software update to be released and reviewed before purchasing.UPDATE (4 July) - I've made updates on the n97 (Black) page.
This gizmo is full of gadgets, that I guess are attractive to game players and tech people.  It simply chocked on my 1,400+ contacts and six email accounts.Worst of all, making a call is an exercise in patience.  I am giving it to one of my kids.
UPDATE: (Changed review from 1-star to 3-stars) After shipping the phone to the Nokia Service Center for repairs (sent on a Friday received back by the following Wednesday), the phone is working fine. There are still a few, small glitchy software issues - but otherwise functioning properly. I am not sure if it was this individual phone or if all N97s have software issues to start. However, now I am afraid to update the phone software, for fear that it will have more problems. One note: it was difficult to get in touch with support and speak to someone "live." I sent the phone in on blind trust without speaking to anyone - but all's well that ends well..._____________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this phone since July 3, 2009. Since purchase I have had to deal with one issue after another, all related to the software and application interface. The hardware (physical) phone itself was great.Negatives:Too numerous to list all of them here, but essentially the software and applications are not intuitive and have MAJOR issues. I am fairly tech savvy and I cannot even imagine how someone who is less knowledgeable in this area would be able to deal with this phone. Very high maintenance.--It took me, and several tech geek friends, A LOT of time to figure out how to set up 2 email accounts.--The wireless access would not "remember" my wireless WEP key and typing that long# in repeatedly is not fun! It started 'saving' it on its own one day. (see reboot story below - now it doesn't save any more)--Facebook app and "Favorites" app won't load onto the home screen (just says "Loading" but never does). I tried to reinstall the Facebook app, but had to go to a 3rd party site to find it. Nokia's Ovi store no longer has a FB app available. Once an app is gone from your phone - good luck trying to reinstall it. Impossible. If you can even find the app anywhere.--Apps randomly work, then don't work. Very mysterious.Yesterday I had to do a hard reset back to the factory settings (which means I had to back up and then delete all of my data, photos, text messages, music, and loose all of my settings, including difficult-to-set-up email connection settings, etc), to try and get the non-working/disappeared apps to work. There wasn't much else I could do the software was so messed up. It was the last resort to get the phone to function properly. However, resetting it essentially "killed" the phone interface entirely. It is so bad that I just sent my phone to Nokia's repair site in Alabama (their "customer care" phone and email are essentially non-existant: phone tree loop and a "generic" email response is what they consider "care.") Now, I am waiting to see if/when they fix the phone. Here is how the phone was "working" after the hard reset (that was supposed to bring it back to the original factory settings):--The key pad won't function (on screen) so I can't even try another hard reset.--The phone doesn't work (can't access it).--The camera won't function.--Most of the apps are missing. Including facebook and 'favorites'.--Most of the apps that are still on the phone won't function.--The phone shuts off when connected to the computer to update software.--The phone randomly shuts on and off when you try to access an app.--The 'memory full' message keeps appearing when there is nothing on the phone and there are no apps open.Among other issues...My main concerns about having to mail my new, $700 phone to a far away repair place are:(1) now I am stuck with NO PHONE for "7-10+ days" and I am trying to run a small business (ironically enough it is for usability testing of products such as this - and boy does Nokia need to test their N97 interface - have they actually read the Nokia Users Discussion board?), and;(2) the "Repair form" instructions for returning the phone state that they will "call me with an estimate of the cost(shouldn't it be free?!)" or that they will "return the phone if it is not repairable." That's just great.  Can you tell that I am really annoyed? The phone cost $700!!!Positives:Nice hardware. The keyboard is easy to use and read. I liked the matte feel of the keys. The screen is large and crisp in terms of readbility, and I love the fact that you can use your finger or a stylus (or finger nail - which you can't do on the iPhone) to activate the touch screen. I love the weight and solid feel of the phone. The silver buttons and edging is also a nice touch. The camera, when it worked, took nice photos that rivaled my digital cameras' pics.The white phone is pretty cool looking - too bad it doesn't work!
I got the Nokia N97 Unlocked Us version in black.  The construction is solid and tight.  I have read some doubt in reviews about the plastic hinge on the sliding screen, but I believe it is unfounded.  The screen feels like it is gliding open and shut, so no worries about "slamming".  I had  an HTC Fuze(Touch Pro) and the screen on the Fuze was loose.The N97 also adjusted between landscape and portrait mode with the screen open or closed much faster than the fuze.  No delay at all.  The keyboard layout is not as much of an issue as some reviewers like to claim.  I have had no problem with it at all.I am glad to be finally free of the contracts and carrier agreements.
This phone and the Nokia service are superb. After the V2.0 Firmware update the phone runs smooth and fast. All the issues i was complaining about when I got it got improved and now it is a perfect phone. The keyboard is good the screen with kinetic scrolling are nice and the homescreen is not only good-looking but also very user-friendly. With 32 GB you can leave your mp3 player at home. It comes with a 3.5mm headphone clinch so you can use your normal headphones.I needed to send it already to repair because i dropped it really hard on the floor. The phone wouldn't switch on anymore and the slider was damaged, too. I send it for repair hoping not to pay anything. I waited a week for a email and actually wanted to call already but then the phone arrived without send me even an email. One week, inclusive shipping! The most impressive part was that they didn't just make it work again, but they also corrected all cosmetic damage. I didn't get a bill or anything. I was really surprised and that is a major + for this phone.I have to take off one point of this phone because of the Ovi Store. Most apps are ''light'' or you have to pay. There are actually very few apps only available. Most of the Ovi stuff are wallpapers and really bad ringtones. They have to really improve that store.My conclusionN97+appstore=the perfect phone. It is still an iphone killer i would say. If you're not to main stream and like phones nobody really has. Go with this. It's nice
So I started using this phone about 5 or 6 months ago and have recently come to this decision to ditch it for a Nokia E75. I will list the pros and the cons I think that the Nokia N97 has....pros*Nice and eye-catching design....Many friends really liked the look of the phone and the sliding keyboard really excited some people*Satisfying web browsing....It has been really nice to look at some much-visited web pages and do some shopping online with the phone, most web sites load quickly and fully*Nice camera*Pretty decent music player....I used this phone with a 16GB card full of music as my primary head-phone music player most of the summer*Large screencons*widgets are a mixed bag...most of them are not really useful and would not connect consistently*"lock key" on side of the phone has been a real pain....sometimes it would work, then not work, then not unlock, get stuck, etc*the touchscreen is just soooo not smooth and slick. I would often wonder if I had pressed something hard enough or not hard enough.*QWERTY keyboard is not very easy to use. The "character" button is right next to the "space" button so I was CONSTANTLY calling up a page of characters at the wrong time, which really slows down typing*on screen numeric key-pad is ok for T9 typing but very clumsy.... I am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messages*not pleasing photo gallery....the biggest problem I felt with this was just how unattractive it looks. I once had a Nokia N85 and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking. This device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if I were trying to show someone a photo*general bulkiness of the device*high price tagand finally I just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly, re-booting itself, not being able to unlock it with the lock key, etc.So, as you can see it really isn't a bad phone. It just fell way short of my expectations for a Nokia "flagship" phone and also as a touchscreen device. I ordered the E75 out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen. I've only had the E75 for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen, I now have a smaller, easily pocketable phone with a VERY VERY VERY nice QWERTY keyboard and a traditional keypad for T9 texting. Very happy with my new phone and kinda glad I don't have to deal with the frustration of all the N97's inconsistencies. Thanks for reading!
In general this smartphone is nice but el software S60 has difficulties. Some menus disappear, navigation with the scroll bars is complicated, answering calls is not very functional and not very intuitive, has no blocking software toolmaker.
This is the first smart phone I've purchased. May be my expectations were high but I was dissatisfied by the following lacks:- You cannot browse multiple web pages at the same time.- Memory efficiency is low. Sometimes phone quits all the open applications itself.- There are some minor usability problems while navigating in the menu. For example there is no easy way of closing applications except for 'Options->Show Open Applications->Options->Exit'- The phone is not so smart when it comes to the connection settings. For example you have to modify the access point you want to use for checking emails every time the previous access point is unavailable. You can't sort them in a preference order.- You have to pay for additional language support.- Music equalizer is ridiculously simple for standards of this phone. Included headphones are also not great.- The location of arrows and shift key on the keypad forces you grab the phone in a very awkward position while using Shift+Arrow for selecting text.
hi. im a owner of n97 white.. i heard lots of complains about the n97.. but hey.. n97 for me is the perfect phone.. most of the complains on n97 are based on the software.. but dont worry guyz coz by just updating new firmware it's going to be fixed.. unlike the other phones. let say the iphone 3gs.. ti heard that the main problem of that is the phone is overheating even on standby mode.. and they said mostly when using gps... and that is really a big problem coz new firmware can't solve that thing... and the best solution for that is keep your iphone turned off.. lol.... most of the people are comparing this to iPhone 3gs...... and they are saying this is the iphone killer... and i think iphone died already since july... xD....comparing n97 to iphone 3gsiphone specification:2 mp camit can record video now(iphoniacs-" w0w it can record now".. they are so happy)( nokiafanatics - zzZZzzz.. going back 3 years when nokia started video recording on their phone )faster than 3gresistive touchscreenweb browser(can't play flash content)QWERTY KEYBOARD( yes it has----- on its screen)FM transmitter( you can buy it then connnect it into you phone)32 GB storage ( nice)need a contract with a carriern97 specifications5mp cam (wow?)QWERTY KEYBOARD ( very nice )capacitive touchscreenweb browser (w0w it's like surfing on real pc it can play flash content files )WIDGETS ( really nice )built in FM transmitter( i like this one )NGAGE GAMES32 gb storage  and..... you can upgrade up to 48 GB by micro sd memory ( xD )IT'S UNLOCKED
I had a Nokia N95 and I loved it. It was getting a little long in the tooth, so I was looking to replace it. I considered the iPhone but was convinced by someone not to get one but to stick with Nokia. So I purchased this phone. I have never been sorrier about a purchase in my life.The phone not only doesn't hold up next to the iPhone, it doesn't even do everything my old N95 did!No VIOP calls, No Slingbox player, No internet radio, ( all of which the iPhone and the N95 did )all you get is a touchscreen, but no decent software to run on it.I did however try to make the best of it. Until today when it had hung, and I had to power cycle it. Now it is just a lump of useless plastic, as it never came back from the reboot.And Nokia support requires you mail the device in for repairs ( at their discretion ), If I had an iPhone I could walk into any Apple store in the USA and get it serviced.Will I ever by a Nokia product again? Hell no. And please save yourself the aggravation and avoid this phone tool.I wish I had returned it the moment I got it, as now its 14 days too late to return it to Amazon.UPDATE 10/23/2009Well, I got it fixed, and put it up for sale on eBay. Its gone, and I now am the happy owner of the Apple iPhone.Guess what? The iPhone JUST WORKS, no messing about, everything works like a charm. What was I thinkingbuying the N97? Ok. as hardware went the n97 had much going for it. Pretty much everything the iphone had.What was the problem? The OS. The OS on the N97 was junk. Its almost like they weren't trying. If I wanted that experience, I would get a Microsoft phone. Now I see Nokia is suing Apple, maybe because Apple gets what customers want, a phone that is high tech and works.
This is a follow up on a review I wrote for the black version of this phone ("Beauty and Brains, Together at Last"), where I covered more of my initial impressions, including some of its pros and cons.  Here I will go into more detail about certain discoveries I have made using the phone for a little while.I should probably first mention again, though, that in all honesty this not the phone for everyone.  In particular, the user interface is a bit quirky (inconsistent, and not always as responsive) - and it does take a certain amount of persistence to explore and appreciate all the features and capabilities that this phone offers.=== Hooking up to your car stereo ===Chances are that one of the first thing you will want to do is to set this phone up for handsfree use and perhaps streaming music over your car stereo.  Doing so is going to be hit or miss.First, it would not work in "Bluetooth Audio" mode (i.e. to stream music over the A2DP Bluetooth profile) with Pioneer DEH-P7000BT unit that I had installed in my car, and which worked perfectly (albeit after a Nokia-specific firmware update from Pioneer) with my previous two phones, the Nokia N85 and Nokia N95 -- though it worked fine as a handsfree unit in "Bluetooth Telephone" mode (over HSP/HFP).I went through several car receivers (both buy/return and in store) to get one that actually worked:* A Sony MEX-BT2700 (works fine, nice intuitive controls, but inferior sound and also inferior handsfree pickup),* A Clarion CZ509 (complex controls -- I had to download the user manual on my N97 right in the store in order to figure out how to pair it; would only work in "Blueooth Audio" mode and NO SOUND would come through in handsfree mode)* An Eclipse CD5030 (very nice unit, good sound, integrated steering wheel controls for Toyota and Honda; but same problem as the DEH-P7000BT: No A2DP/AVRCP with my phone)I skipped on Kenwood, because from prior experience using a KDC-X492 along with a KCA-BT200 adapter, there was a delay from when Bluetooth Audio were initiated from the phone until it was heard over the speakers. This may seem like a nitpick, but I also use my phone as my GPS/navigation system - and the result was that instructions like "In 400 yards, turn left" would become "n left". No dice. The Pioneer unit, at least, did not have this problem.I did finally find something that works for me: A newer Pioneer unit, the DEH-P6100BT.  From my original unit, I also knew that this one has excellent sound quality and controls (good dynamic range, good sound shaping features, etc).  The one problem I'm still having though is that each time this unit connects to my phone, it initially gives me only "handsfree" functionality (not stereo audio). I need to manually go into the menus EACH TIME and enable A2DP and AVRCP (that's quite cumbersome), OR start playback from my phone (in which case A2DP, but not AVRCP is enabled automatically).  In other words, getting my steering wheel controls to do what they are supposed to do - control the playback - is usually more hazzle than it's worth (except for longer trips).All this said, a Bluetooth-enabled stereo is not necessary with this phone.  If you have an auxillary input or a tape deck in your existing car stereo, you can hook up to its 3.5mm jack using a standard auxillary cable or a cassette adapter.  You should then dock your phone close to your driver's seat (I use a Bracketron Grip-IT holder until a N97-specific holder is available from ProClipUSA), since you'll be using the internal microphone when making calls.  (I actually got better sound as well as better handsfree pickup with this setup and my factory stereo compared to the Sony I mentioned above).  You will need to use the phone itself to control music playback (as opposed to the receiver or steering wheel controls) - but that's why there is a "Music Player" widget available for the home screen.EDIT: If you read the N97 specs carefully, you also know that it (like the N85 before it) has an FM transmitter.  I did not even bother to mention this initially, because quite frankly, I don't see the point.  It is far too weak to produce the signals required for your typical FM receiver, even as the antenna is fairly close.  All you get is static.=== Tethering (phone as modem) ===A little known fact about GSM/GPRS-enabled phones (except the iPhone) is that they can be used as a modem for your laptop or other device, e.g. while on the road.  You can connect via a USB cable (one is included in the box) or Bluetooth.  In fact, if you have a Mac from the last 3-4 years (e.g. MacBook Pro), it will automatically set up this modem connection when you pair it with your phone (There is a checkbox that says "Access the Internet with your phone's data connection").  For Windows, you can download modem drivers from Nokia's support site.You will need an Access Point Name (APN) from your cellular provider, as well as a dial-up number (often optional), username/password (ditto).  This information is readily available on the Internet.  It should be noted that such tethering is NOT included in the price of many data plans, unless they specifically state so (this is why it is not enabled in the iPhone as sold in the US) - and it certainly would not be wise to use this as your main internet connection.  I find it invaluable for light web and e-mail access on the occasional road trip though.=== Downloading Applications ===The N97 comes with a number of third party applications preinstalled, including JoikuSpot, which allows you to turn your phone into a WiFi access point for internet access; Adobe PDF, QuickOffice, and even an Amazon app.  But of course one of the primary joys of owning a smartphone like this one is being able to continuously explore new applications and uses.The N97 runs the "Series 60" User Interface, 5th edition (a.k.a. S60v5) on top of the Symbian operating system version 9.4.  S60v5 is the first version of this platform to support touch-screen input, and this is only the second phone from Nokia to do so; previous N-series devices (such as the N95, N96, N85) all ran on S60 3rd edition.This means that even though the N97 represents a new type of device for Nokia, it is mostly capable of running applications that were written years ago.  Many of these are being updated for the new touch platform, to be sure, but the main outcome of this backwards compatibility is that you will find some pretty esoteric stuff out there.  For instance, I make frequent use of Salling Clicker - an application that lets you use your phone as a remote control for your (Windows or Mac) computer (over Bluetooth or WiFi), e.g. media/music control, powerpoint presentations, etc., even though that application is not specifically written for the new platform.  I also use the PuTTY telnet/SSH client, which HAS been updated to take advantage of the new touch screen, but otherwise was developed long before the N97 (or even the iPhone).  Then there is Nokia SportsTracker - always invaluable; keep it open while you go jogging, biking, etc; you can later view your route superimposed on a map, speed plots and summary, and even what music you were playing at various times.In addition to Symbian/S60 specific applications, and like most (non-US made) phones, the N97 can run "generic" mobile applications written for Java (J2ME).  For instance, Opera Mini is an excellent and super-fast web browser that can run on most mobile phones (not the iPhone, Palm Pre, BlackBerry though) -- thanks to its use of proxy servers that compress the traffic sent over the air to your phone.  I myself got a kick out of a HP 45 calculator emulator I found recently, which uses the original HP45 program code and even has a picture of it. :)As you can guess, the applications that you can download for the N97 are not concentrated in one location, as they are in the iTunes App Store for the iPhone.  This is a fact that Apple exploits very well in their own marketing - and to be sure, discovering or searching for applications is unfortunately quite a bit more cumbersome for Symbian/S60 than for the iPhone.  On the positive side, that means that there is no central control (you know, where someone decides that there shalt be no third party web browsers, mail readers, or GPS/navigation apps).  In fact, it is this very open architecture that allows the "write once, run everywhere" paradigm of the J2ME platform, whereas Apple, RIM/BlackBerry, and Palm/Pre are only capable of running applications that are specifically written for those devices.Now, Nokia has had a "Download!" service for years, and have recently opened an expanded application store, the "OVI store".  The content is still somewhat meager in both places; moreover, as I found by trial and frustrating error, once you have purchased and downloaded an application from the OVI store, there is no way to re-install it (should you happen to uninstall it at some point).  I was attempting to get a newer version of RoadSync (a Microsoft Exchange client with very decent HTML support) working, but because it got into a state where I wanted to re-enter my Exchange Account information, I had to reinstall.  (This is also an issue in RoadSync -- there should be a way to reset the information without having to uninstall/reinstall).  However, the original installation package was never saved on my phone, and there was also no way to download it without purchasing again.  For me it was thanks, but no thanks - both to RoadSync (poor design) and OVI store (poor design).The bottom line is that if you expect to be fed with a teaspoon from a central app store, then maybe the N97 and Nokia's infrastructure is not for you.=== Cohabiting with the Mac ===The N97 comes with software for Windows, but not for the Mac.  Well - that's standard fare.  Unlike most mobile phone manufacturers, Nokia have at least developed software for the Mac. :)You will want to download two things from them for ANY of their phones: Nokia Multimedia Transfer, and an iSync plugin.Nokia Multimedia Transfer is a background application (access it via a little menu bar applet) which allows you to, well, transfer multimedia between the Mac and your phone when connected via USB (using the "PC Suite" mode on the phone).  It imports captured photos and movies from your phone camera into iPhoto, synchronizes selected playlists between iTunes and the phone (transcoding any movie files that are not natively supported on the phone in the process), and allows you to synchronize web bookmarks between Safari and the phone's browser.The iSync plugin WOULD let you use iSync on the Mac to synchronize contacts, calendars, and todo notes with the phone.  Unfortunately, almost a month after initial release, there is not yet any such plugin available for the N97 -- frustrating since they already have one for the N86 MP, which has not yet been released here.  In the meantime, you can at least transfer contacts from your Mac Address Book to the phone: Select all contacts (Command + A), select File -> Export -> Export vCard; transfer the resulting "vCards.vcf" to the phone (E:\Other\Contacts), then open "Contacts" on your phone to select "Options -> Copy business card -> From other memory".How to do the latter, you ask.  Well, once you have paired your Mac with the phone, you can browse the phone filesystem from your Mac by clicking on the little "B>" (Bluetooth) icon in your menu bar, then selecting the phone, and then "Browse device...".  You can also simply send files from here, or from right-clicking on the file itself and selecting: More -> Send <filename> to ...Finally, as mentioned above, you can use your phone as a modem by simply pairing it over Bluetooth.  Or, you can plug in the USB cable, then open the "Network" System Preferences pane.=== The Copy/Paste snafu ===Unlike previous S60 phones, there are no keypad shortcuts available for Copy/Paste on the N97.  Instead, you need to access these functions in the menus ("Options -> Editing Options" in most places).  The problem is that not every input field has such a menu available!  For instance, if you are entering settings for a new e-mail account, or the WEP/WPA/WPA2 key for a wireless access point, you are working inside a pop-up dialogue box with no menu available.Ridiculous as this sounds, in these places you actually need to CLOSE the keypad, then tap on the input field in order to bring up the virtual numeric keypad, as if you were using multi-tap or T9. On the top of this screen there is a context menu -- if you first drag to select the text you want to cut/copy, then those two options are available in that menu; if there is text in the clipboard, "Paste" is available.Or, you could use a Bluetooth keyboard -- more on that below.  In this case, Ctrl-C/X/V works as expected.=== Laptop/Netbook Replacement ===You laugh.  Go ahead.If you are an owner of any other recent N-series device (N95, N96, N85), you already know that it can hook up to a TV using the included TV-Out cable, CA-75U.  Well, the N97 does not come with such a cable, but you can order one separately and it still works.Also, while the N95/N96 come with a "Wireless Keyboard" utility pre-installed, it is not included in the N97.  You can download and install it from Nokia's web site though; go to the support pages for their own SU-8W keyboard.  It will complain that the application is not compatible with this phone, but it will work anyway.So, there you have it.  QuickOffice is already pre-installed to allow you to view Microsoft Office documents - you can purchase an upgrade that allows you to edit these documents too.  Adobe Reader LE is also installed (though note that unlike on previous phones, it is now only a trial - you have to buy it after 2 weeks or so..).Personally, I access remote UNIX hosts over SSH using PuTTY.  Obviously you can also do web browsing, mail reading (incl. Microsoft Exchange), etc.=== Reaching Nerdvana ===Just to be exceptionally clear on this point if you haven't figured it out yet - this is a phone for geeks.  People who follow Boy Genius Reports, for instance, best stick to their iPhone and the eye candy that is afforded them there.  It takes a little bit more persistence to appreciate S60 devices like the N97 - but in return, it will grow on you for a very long time as you keep finding new features and new ways to use it.  For starters, the sheer wealth of hardware that exists on this device (5MP camera with flash and video recording, GPS, 640x360 pixel screen, pull-out keyboard, a hundred different types of sensors including electronic compass, accelerator and proximity sensor) are just ripe for new sorts of applications.
I found the product interesting because it promised 32 Gigabyte of memory. However accessing this memory is clumsy and navigation through the functions of the phone is combersome. It's touch screen functionality is primitive when compared to the Samsung Omnia, HTC Google phone and the iphone. I am not too impressed!
Yes, it does, the 128mb ram arent enough. The phone would be perfect if the people at nokia included 256mb ram. It is very slow and wo graphics accelerator so no fancy games or apps. Other than that it would make a DREAM PHONE. Too bad.OHHH and BTW, theres software included that you CANNOT DELETE, and the office part of the phone SUCKS too, you CANNOT EDIT office files, only view and the pdf reader is a 30 day trial. For that kind of money...
The N97 is a very complete piece of technology, great resolution and fast internet access, all in addition to a great storage capability (32 GB plus).It is worth every penny.
This is a truly amazing phone. It can only be compared with the Sony Xperia.It does everything it's supposed to, but has a real stabillity issue with the software. I keep upgrading the firmware and it keeps getting better an better, truth be told. But, I personally believe they should release a new phone only when Software and Hardware are at match, and this is not the case.I know that market dictates otherwise, but that is a different issue.The other disappointing feature is the lack of Xenon flash. The camera IS NOT a slim camera replacement as the Nokia n82 or Sony K800 can be. And I was looking for this in the phone... Night shots are mostly useless and sometimes color capture at daylight is not right (need manual White Balance adjustment). This can again be fixed with new software releases but I'm yet to see it...Overall it's a truly worthy phone for the price and if you are not as AR as me regarding the camera, you can probably live with rebooting the phone once a week.
This phone is so close to being great. Its fine until u start viewing large web pages heavy in flash and ads. Im typing this review from my n97 right now, it handles full desktop pages really well, no need for the mobile versions, but like i just said, pages requiring a lot of memory r slow and  glitchy, an  example is [...]...thats really the only place u'll c a lot of slowdown or lag. If u have multiple tabs/pages open it wont always have the memory to handle it and close the oldest tab without warning. It will randomly fall behind doing other things, but for the most part its quick. Keybooard is great, u'll get fast on it quick, its great. So is the touchscreen, very accurate and perfectly tuned sencitivity, u can draw easily, u can do some greatly detailed drawing w a stylus...but thats just 4 fun... Camera is pretty good, macro is amazing, best close ups ive ever seen on a phone. Video does great w motion, ya no 30 fps, but it doesnt blow up real well on a computer, not to clear, little grainier than i was hoping. Music sounds great. Fm transmitter works great. Does a great job w video playback, but could use better codec support.
I am very much satisfied with all the features of nokia N97. The only problem with this phone is it keeps freezing, like once a week. But, since I complained about my purchase, Amazon was quick in replacing the product in 2 days.So far, I am testing my new Nokia N97, hopeful that it won't freeze again.
I never thought I would hate a piece of technology, but the N97 phone changed everything. The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are ok, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunciton, until I can afford another phone.
I desperately wanted this phone to be a good competitor to the iPhone, but I must say I was sorely disappointed. Here are some of the issues I facea) The phone Freezes often requiring the battery to be removed to reset. This for me is a non starter as the widgets and software on the phone should not impede the phones basic functionality but rather enhance it.b) Applications are just not as numerous and ones that exist (Except Bloomberg) are of inferior quality vs similar iPhone/iTouch apps.c) GPS functionality is poor an took a number of software updates to get it to even workd) Phone seems to strangely run out of memory even though a lot is available, it does not seem to be able to load balance memory between partitions.e) Lastly, poor battery life. I cannot squeeze out a full day on while in a 3G networkAll in all it is a poor imitation of the iPhone and if one wants a device that just works and does not have to wait while nokia gets its act together get an iPhone or an Palm Pre. This phone is a lemon.
This is the best phone I have ever owned, and I have owned plenty haha. This phone is so easily accessible and everything is where it should be. My only knocks on it is the GPS Signal is not very strong. I will have wide open blue skies and still cant get a GPS signal. Also I wish it was compatible with the Internet Radio that Nokia offers. I am sure it is only a matter of time. Some great things about this phone is the Video Ringtones the OVI Store, OVI Contacts, and I especially like the 32GB Internal Memory. It can be an MP3 Player and with the FM Transmitter good bye to CDs and I dont even use my iPod anymore. I also love the fact that the homescreen apps are up to date. I have Facebook, Weather, and a Video Game App that always let me know whats going on.  The camera is amazing and has a great flash. I went to Vegas and took my digital camera and ended up not using it. I just used my N97. The battery life is great too. I had the fm transmitter on all day, along with normal phone calls, browsing the internet and excessive text messaging I still had 4 bars before I went to bed. I would recommend this phone to all. I also bought a phone cover from [...]. It is an extraordinary Industrial Strength full Phone cover and it is guaranteed for life so if it breaks they will replace it for free.
It is actually an Awesome Phone.. despite of the review from websites and other people that N97 lacking something but it does suit my taste the design, the touchscreen actually good I don't know why people complaining.I'm happy i decide to get N97, everyone have different taste but this one suits me.. probably it just need a few software or firmware upgrade to make it more stable but other than that it is perfect.
I got the phone yesterday, took it out the box and the first thing I noticed is how good the phone felt in my hands...turnd it on first problem Acu Weather widget doesn't work properly it is 79 degrees outside and the Acu Weather is stating it's 23 degrees tried to fix it t no avail, also  noticed when this thing is in lock mode for a long time, and you try to unlike it the screen is without light, so locked it, and ulocked it again, and it was fine, another problem I noticed the accelarometer isn't as fast as other phones....the camera  takes beatiful pictures, but all in all it's an ok phone for $600.00 dollars these little problems should not be there
Symbian is an acquired taste, if you don't like/not used to s60v5, you won't like it even with 2.0 firmware. 2.0 firmware is what the N97 should have been released with. Given the N97 mini is $50 cheaper and it is 99% of what the N97 is, I would get the mini instead.
Nice phone. Does not have the license to use all the applications included in it like the document editors, etc.
iPhone killer? Most definitely. Perfect? Almost. This phone packs so many features that users just expect by having a smartphone. Don't let the processor speed fool you ... this phone flies and I do heavy computing on mine. I love the screen, storage, features in general. I bought the white and haven't had any trouble keeping in clean. Camera is amazing. I love the tilt mechanism in the screen and the keyboard is awesome ... a lot better than my previous 2 iPhones. Having a d-pad is very nice! Symbian is the way to go and the future looks bright!
I already own the N95 and purchased the N97 as a touch screen, qwerty keyboard replacement. It falls short. The manual keyboard is great but not available in all situations. The touch interface requires more touching than I thought necessary. Accessibility to programs and applications is not as smooth as with the N95. The GPS mimics the N95 but constantly resets the phone after 5-9 minutes of use. The address data does not transfer from the address book to the GPS address search completely (State and Country do not always transfer), which is a carry over problem from the N95. Night mode for the GPS is about 5 screen touches further than it should be, and it is needed because the screen is so bright at night that my eyes had to adjust when looking to the road from the screen. The lock switch does not always unlock the phone, and almost everytime I take the phone out of the universal pouch I purchased (a custom pouch is not available), the secondary camera is activated. After I installed the 7/1/09 firmware update, the thumbnails for the favorite contacts didn't show. All in all, I've been trying to return the phone back to Nokia for 2 weeks. I'm waiting for a call from them with an RA number that authorizes the return. Can they be that busy handling returns???
I have owned Nokia phones my whole life.  This phone is nothing more than a N95 with a touch screen and poor integration.  There are many bugs in the code right now.It has a chance to become a great phone, but wait till the first software update to see how much time & effort Nokia is going to put into it, right now you are best to hold off.UPDATE: I returned the phone back to Nokia, Too many software inconsistencies, some screens you double touch (click) others you only touch once. Some screens you have to use a scroll bar, others you just drag your finger to scroll down. I don't want to have to learn which screen do what and change my habits depending on the application/menu I'm on. Nokia should have taken the time to make all their apps and menus work the same. I would understand that 3rd party applications might be different but not the installed applications on the phone.This phone really needs to be in your hands for a day or two to figure out the frustrations with it. Don't get me started on the poor use of memory and how if you are not a Nokia user from a long time ago, you install your apps on the default drive only to figured out the default drive is not where all the memory is. Or if you get tons of text messages it fills up the C: drive and you-the owner- have to change system settings to tell TXT MSG'ing to not use the default drive.Search the web for N97 to read and see the YouTube videos of why not to buy this dumb phone - um I mean smart phone.
I've been using my new Blackberry 8220 flip phone for about a week now. Here are my impressions about this phone... the pros and cons.  Keep in mind that this is my first Blackberry phone, so I do not review it in comparison to any other blackberry. Instead, I compare it to other flip phones I've had. My last flip phone was the Motorola KRZR K1. This phone eats it up, and spits it out.Pros:-Call quality: sound quality while making and receiving calls are good. There doesn't seem to be a difference in quality between making a wifi call or network phone call (see wifi)- Wifi: This phone has a built in wifi receiver. This means that if you have a wifi connection at home (or any unsecured wifi signal) you can browse the web with this phone (for free). The pre-installed t-mobile browser is lame (it doesn't let you browse any website you want unless you sign up for the data plan). Download the free browser "Opera" for this phone, and you can cruise any website you want.-Wifi calling: When you are connected to a strong wifi signal... you can make calls over the wifi connection, thereby not using up your minutes on your plan... very cool!-web browsing: Web browsing is as good as it gets on a 240 x 320 resolution screen. Again, I recommend downloading a free copy of the Opera browser. When used with a fast wifi connection, loading time for pages is surprisingly fast.-Built in mp3 player: The mp3 player works well and sounds good, but the layout/interface could be better. (tip: use button #4,#6 to skip songs instead of using trackball) For example, when the phone is closed... you can only access volume controls. The built in standard 3.5mm headphone jack is fantastic, though! All phones should have this... I absolutely love not having to carry around an annoying adapter just to listen to my music in the car or over headphones. It's also cool that it has the ability to display album artwork :) This phone comes with a handsfree headset/stereo headphone... very cool! The included headphones sound surprisingly good too... about as good as a typical $30 set of Sony headphones.-Screen: The screen is small but gorgeous... colors look saturated and images look very sharp.-Camera: For a 2 megapixel camera... it works well and does a good job of automatically adjusting shutter and exposure. Color saturation and contrast could be better, though. Even on the highest resolution... images lack high contrast and sharpness. Built in flash is a nice extra.-mp3 ringers - I really love the fact that you can use any mp3/sound file as a ring-tone, alarm tone, alert tone... etc.-Texting: At first, I really hated the button configuration for texting. It's totally different from most phones. But once you get used to it, texting on this phone works very well and the intelligent word suggestions are pretty good at guessing what word you're typing. The ability to add your own words to the custom library is great, too. I love that when a text messagecomes, you can preview the first few lines of the on the front screen... very useful! Also, there are special status lights on the front of the phone that blinks Red on the front of the phone when you have an unread text.-Picture texting: Photo texting seems to work relatively well, but the only limitation is that you can only add a few words of text along with the image. I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the 'mms message system' or phone.-expandable mini-SD/mini-SDHC. This is awesome for storing tons of images and music for the mp3 player... very cool! Right now, you can expand it up to a 16GB micro SDHC card and essentially have a 16gb Mp3 player in addition to a phone.Cons:-Battery Life: Sadly, the battery does not seem to last very long... even when the phone is only used for texting.  For example, I noticed that the battery drained down to about 40% capacity from just one day of texting (no phone calls). To be fair, I do text a lot in one day (perhaps 50 a day?) Sadly it's a phone you'll probably have to charge every day even if you don't use it very often throughout the course of your day. If you're listening Blackberry, please release a Hi-capacity battery for this phone!-Non-standard USB connector:  I don't like that it has a non-standard usb connection. If you loose the cable, you'll have to get one especially made for the blackberry. They could have easily made it the standard min-usb to USB connection (but they didn't... GRrr!) Oh well, at least they got the standard 3.5mm headphone jack right.- The whole phone is very prone to fingerprint smudging... so it ends up looking oily and kinda gross, if not cleaned like... everyday.Conclusion:  The positive features greatly outweigh the few negative things about this phone. This phone has an impressive array of features... considering how small the device is. It's really a tiny computer in addition to a phone, and it does most things pretty darn well. If you're into flip phones, and want one that does more than probably any other one out there...then this one may be the phone for you. I just wish that the battery on this baby lasted longer! Oh well, even tiny computers take lots of juice I guess :)Fun tip: You can get the game Pac-man for this phone for free online :)
The Blackberry Pearl Flip is an excellent Blackberry option for those of us who need our corporate or web email but don't want to lug something around attached to the belt.  The appearance and design is exceptional and the functionality is equally excellent as expected from all Blackberry devices.The Good:- Small, compact design, full Blackberry functionality in your pocket.- Excellent design (look).- Large keys.- Decent camera.- Blackberry's latest OS.- WiFi.The Bad:- Small screen.- Non-customizable outer LCD screen.The Ugly:- Nothing.For the sake of infomation, this is my second Blackberry owned.  Previously, I have used the Blackberry Curve 8300 series for over a year.  Prior to that, I was on the Motorola Q for several months as well.  While my Peal Flip is company issued, I don't look like a corporate soldier when I'm away from the office.  If you're going for the "I'm an executive" public image, then don't purchase/choose the Pearl Flip.  If you're looking for Blackberry's functionality in a discrete pocketable phone, the Blackberry Pearl Flip is an excellent choice.*** I also purchased the OEM Blackberry Leather Pocket case for the phone.  Excellent choice for the phone, keeps the profile thin and looks fantastic.  Just say no to belt-attached phones!! ***
I bought this phone as a temporary replacement to my AT&T; iPhone. I'd never had a blackberry before, and've always been intrigued by them. I'd heard good things about this phone, and on "paper" it's a great phone for the price: wifi, gps, qwerty keyboard, flip phone, and quadband GSM.However, I've learned the hardway that my iPhone data plan is not really compatible with this T-Mobile phone:1) the data settings are already hardcoded to T-mobile, so changing them has been an unsurmountable challenge for me2) Wifi browser is also hardcoded to only work with T-Mobile Hotspots, although I heard you can download a separate browser that will work with all wifiThings I like- LED indicator for new text messages, missed calls. (I really wish more phones would have this feature)- Talk-time battery life, can easily go 4-6 hours of talk time+3 days of standby without any issue- a typing game on the phone, cheesy, but fun- standard 2.5mm headset connector (and it comes with the phone!)- USB chargingOther things I don't like- the camera. it's a tease. there is a flash and digital zoom, but the picture quality still sucks- the clamshell joint seems to be a little loose- the external LCD screen is made of a soft plastic, great for getting scratchedBottom line: If you are a T-Mobile BB subscriber, then this phone should be fantastic as a secondary or "evening" phone (you laugh, but if you're shopping for this on amazon then I'm probably not too far off target). For other GSM users, this is still a solid offering for a smartphone but maybe something like a Windows Mobile phone might work better for you.
The phone is sold from T-mobile here in the USA and comes in red and black, the phone is very light, the phone includes everything you know and love from blackberries including wifi, pin messaging, web, email and other pda-like functions. The 8220 runs on the 4.6 OS but the stock software from T-mobile 4.6.0.180 can be slow and jerky because it runs on the older arm 312Mhz processor but I would recommended anyone with this phone to upgrade to 4.6.0.122 which seems to be the fastest most stable version thus far. The phone doesn't really live up to the build quality of other blackberries but many can overlook that and accept the fact that it is the first flip from blackberry and they did a good job with it.Operating system: 4/5Build Quality: 3/5Features: 4/5Battery Life: 5/5Overall: 4/5

For anyone expecting this miscreant device to act like a Blackberry, forget it. It has so much less capacity than other models that it barely even functions as a telephone.The device is frequently frozen for up to 30 seconds as it runs background programs and "thinks," to the point where I'm terrified of ever trying to use it in an emergency. It takes up to 10 seconds to recognize that I've started (and finished!) dialing a phone number before it registers the keytones. And often it doesn't acknowledge the first digit, but instead treats that digit as if it were just a button I pushed to wake up the phone, so I spend an enormous amount of time cancelling calls and trying to dial again correctly. Sometimes, mysteriously, the phone actually connects the call before the keytones kick in...Web browsing is no better. The browser constantly crashes, and the only way the crash can be cleared is by breaking out the battery. Restarting the device after replacing said battery takes forever. In one final annoying feature, there's no way to silence or turn down the volume on the "dialing now" keytones, so the phone sings like an old fax machine. I've spent hours on the phone with my provider to troubleshoot, and ultimately I've replaced it -- and the new 8220 has all the same problems.In short, it's a godawful piece of junk. Which is too bad, because when it *does* work, it's a pleasure.
I got my blackberry 8220 flip almost a year ago and wish I would have picked something else.  I've had the battery replaced twice and my 3rd phone replacement should be here in a few days.  It goes dead in the middle of a call and I have to wait for it to restart.  My husband was trying to call me on his way home from work the other day and it died, everytime it would restart, I'd call him and it would ring once, then restart again.  I called Tmobile and they determined it's a known software problem with this phone and are replacing it again.  The next day, it worked 1 time then wouldn't do anything but start and restart and restart again.  I couldn't turn it off, had to take the battery out.  I would never get another one of these again.  The only thing I liked was the rollerball.  Oh well, on to the next phone.
I bought 4 of this unlocked items to bring down to Ecuador S.A. to my surprise the cable thats use to download does not fit the phone, what can u do to fix this terrible error?? i bought under the condition that the manufacturer and the seller are profetionals and mistakes are not allowed?? i need this cables othrwise your reputation is under question and the phones are of no use to me or the people who trusted me to purchase for them. I'll expect from u to give me a solution or your way out is to say NO WARRANTY and that settles your troubles. I'm requesting a solution. Thank you.
The 8220 was a poorly tested product.  Pretty little device designed to do much more than it was equipped to handle. Fundamental issues with WiFi performance, bluetooth, and simple instability with respect to its delicate nature.  The phone often needs to be restarted...battery issues?......SIM card easily dislodged?.....all these things.  This is one phone that you don't want to drop. Also, T-Mobile and BB rarely seem able to solve issues with this device, beyond the 2 most extreme measures of 1)  reinstall the OS or 2) replace the phone.  In my book, that's a lemon.  Please remember, this is a computer....not just a cell phone.  Could you imagine buying a desktop computer and discovering that the errors you've been having are typically fixed by having to wipe and reinstall the OS, or simply replacing the unit?  This would be considered HIGHLY unacceptable performance for a computer and should be similarly unacceptable for this smartphone.Don't buy this phone. Don't do it. The technology is not ready and T-Mobile provides horrible support for the phone's many weaknesses.Main problems:1) Too fragile. SIM card becomes dislodged or requires resetting quite often.2) WiFi - connectivity under the WiFi environment is sporadic. Do NOT rely on WiFi connectivity for phone calls. Your calls will be dropped. End of discussion. I have used this phone, with WiFi, at my 2 residences. Both are in moderate to major population areas and with "excellent" signal strength. The WiFi was the reason we bought these phones and have subsequently killed the service (T-Mobile charges you extra for this poorly delivered option).3) Dropped calls. Dropped calls. Within the cities of Chicago and Albuiquerque.4) Bluetooth malfunction. Check the forums. Bluetooth fails inexplicably and will not re-enable. T-Mobile offers only to replace phone with same model.5) T-Mobile's effective support on this phone is to either a) have you spend hours and hours wiping the phone and reinstalling the software, applications and entering your various user data. REMEMBER...this is a smart phone. Like a computer, you will spend a good bit of time setting the thing up, that is, if you use it for more just a phone. T-Mobile's other support effort is to b) have Blackberry replace the phone.....similarly requiring gobs of your time to troubleshoot, coordinate and then set-up the replacement device.6) Internet e-mail. My wife's phone inexplicably lost the ability to access her online e-mail. T-Mobile's suggested solution.....wipe the phone and start over. If that doesn't work (many of YOUR hours later) they'll get Blackberry to replace the phone.7) Battery life is VERY short.8) Browsing the phone's features is very slow. The phone reacts sluggishly to your inputs....including just dialing phone numbers. I am endlessly having to go BACK on command entry because the lag in response time caused me to sleect the wrong entry item.9) Browser speed is slow. I mean slow to unusable. I tend to run online searches for places and things using the Google Maps application. That may sound silly, however, it's much faster than using the basic browser function on this phone.10) In a nutshell, Blackberry is beta-testing this underpowered, previously untested smartphone and we are the guinea pigs. Nice idea packinking the PDA into this attractive little phone, however, they're not there yet. T-Mobile simply diverts all responsibility for the poor performance of the device to Blackberry.....and you.11) Don't buy it.
is a great phone, but you need to realice a couple o things:-the front is very easy to get scratchs, you will need to buy an protector.-lags sometimes because it lacks the horsepower of bold/8900 to run os4.6 still not that bad-keyboard takes a bit to learnthe rest is solid blackberry experience, a must if you like clamshell phones.
After using this phone for only 2 months, bluetooth failed inexplicably and would not re-enable. I spent 2 hours on the phone with T-Mobile tech support and BB Tech support. All they could do is reinstall the system, which by the way made the clock and the caller ID disappear. Finally, T-mobile agreed to replace the phone with same model (refurbished of course). This is by far the worst phone I have ever used!
I purchased this phone when it was first released, and immediately had problems with it crashing when left charging overnight.  A software update finally fixed that.Now, six months later, the headphone jack is broken (sounds fades from left to right and back again with any headphones I use) and the speaker stops working about 30 seconds into phone calls.In addition, the screen brightness fades in and out randomly as you use the phone.  Sorry blackberry, but this phone is just really flimsy and poorly made.
This phone's pretty capable of doing what most Blackberry's are able-- but the flip thing lacks customization of other BBerry's. Thought I'd love the flip. Not so much the case. And, UNlocked doesn't necessarily mean completely compatible on another network. Calls drop much more frequently.  :-)(
I got this phone couple of weeks ago..I originally had the curve 8900 but due to an accident it stopped functioning..After owning the pearl flip 8220 i found it slower then the curve that sometimes halted during operation,,but it has a nice grip..audio quality is excellent..but the plastic finishing is not amazing..
THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST EVER BLACKBERRY PHONE AND I LOVE IT! THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING I GOTTA SAY ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THAT IT CAN GET SCRATCHED EASILY. YOU WILL NEED TO BUY A PROTECTIVE CASE FOR IT! OTHER THAN THAT, ITS A GREAT PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I bought the device despite of a series of bad reviews that I read about it. The product works great, all BlackBerry's functions in a beautiful designed flip phone. Good reception, Wi-Fi and everything else we know about blackberry services (push email, BBM etc.).But Amazon has to correct the product description of this ''International Version''.1- Not QWERTY keyboard, but qwertZ2- Doesnt come with the wired headphones NOR the 256 MB microSD as it is specified. (probably this is avaliable at the blackberry of T-Mobile Version)3- Not really an issue but quick start guide manual comes in other languages, and I thjnk would be nice from Amazon to specify it...so I expected it to come with the microSD and the wired stereo handsfree headset, meaning a loss of $10-20 dollars. I dont know how I contact Amazon to put up this complainiment. Other than that amazon shipped the product really fast and it was in my place in a really short period of time after the placement of the order.
the phone works great here in venezuela single chip installed and ready to work, the phone is new and came with his protectors all the pin also works super well, the only problem is that the keyboard is not QWERTY QWERTZ but rest excellent recommend[...]
IVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE PERFECT PHONE.BUT ONCE I STARTED USING IT, IVE BEEN HAVING MANY DROPPED CALLS AND IT TURNS OFF OUT OF NOWHERE EVEN IF THE BATTERY IS FULLY CHARGED.BATTERY LIFE SUCKS.RECEPTION SUCKS ALSO.PICTURES COME OUT BLURRY SOMETIMES.
My wife & I have had the same phone for over 7 months now, and it has been a disappointing experience, especially considering the fact that we paid $50 for each.The phone does not automatically update the time through the zones. It often freezes.We've had it looked at several times, and the T-Mobile 800 service has been terrible as well.We do like the size of it. The audio plays great.Would not recommend it.J
My wife is on her third 8220 from Tmo in just about a year.  She really wanted a flip phone, because she likes the feeling of talking on flip phones better than talking into a brick.  She also doesn't want everyone to know she has a blackberry, and most people assume this is just a regular phone.  The hindge works great and hasn't been a problem.  The outside screen will get very scratched up from being thrown around in a purse or bag.  I highly recommend a stick on screen cover for the outside.Two problems - both known by Blackberry and experienced by many others.1) The track ball gets stuck.  not a big deal.  Just push down on it and roll it around.  It has always come back to life.  This is a known problem and the reason new Blackberries use a touch pad instead of a moving ball.2) The bluetooth dies.  This is a known hardware problem and has effected my wife's 8220 twice.  What happens is that - one day, out of the blue - you will be unable to "enable" the bluetooth radio.  It just stays greyed out.  Internet forums are filled with people who have this problem and the only solution is replacing the device. It is not software related and has nothing to do with the bluetooth device you are connecting to - it is the blackberry's bluetooth radio itself.  The bluetooth radio in the 8220 has a very limited lifecycle.If bluetooth is important to you, I would strongly suggest staying away from this.  (The bluetooth on my 8900 has always worked flawlessly.)
I BROUGTH THEM A BLACKBERRY FLIP AND THEY SENT ME ONE, BUT THE KEYBOARD IS  IN GERMAN... IS A QWERTZ OR QWERTZU KEYBOARD... THEY OFFERED A QWERTY MODEL. FURTHERMORE, THEY SENT ME A CELLPHONE WITHOUT A MICROSD MEMORY OF 256MB LIKE THEM OFFERED...
i was not prepared to try and learn German in order to alter my phones language to english.The lack of visual instructions to change this gadget was most frustrating,.. the phone should of had1..an instruction how to turn this fool thing on..2...say at least how to find the section to alter the language.otherwise its an average gadget..the video i finally viewed on the net to assist with these problems did help a little ..however the nurd that did the front for this was truely full of rubbish info ..such as,.. oh how nice it was to hold etc..Seek to do without it and save yourself the agro..blessings to ye ..robert
I recently purchased this phone and really like it.  Blackberry's are great anyway but for the simple fact this one is a flip version makes it even better.  It comes with different power adapters, so no matter where you are in the world, you can plug in.  I just happen to be deployed to Baghdad, Iraq and wow!  what a surprise to be able to plug the phone in directly to the wall.  It takes a little bit to get used to the way the keys are layed out for texting but once you get that down, it's just as easy as any other phone.  The one and only downfall I have is, never having owned a Blackberry, I was depending on the instruction guide to be a useful tool...Unfortunately, I do not read German and that is how the guide is printed.  So, a suggestion to the seller, make sure you put a manual in there that is written in english as well.  Other than that, great world phone!  I would definately suggest if someone is looking for a Blackberry that you can take anywhere in the world, buy this one!
When I first bought this phone to my wife i was concern that this really doesn't look like blackeberry at all, and turns out that this was the advantage of this phone, is confortable and easy to carry on, and with all the powerful tools that makes blackberry the best on the market, botton line, best choice ever, my wife is really happy with it
blackberry pearl flip 8220 unlock phone is work great. it provide wireless function which is very convenient for me when I am outside.unfortunately, this phone is needed wireless service provider for setting up blackberry E-mail account in order to activate this phone. As an unlock phone, I use pre-paid mobile service and this phone is not support this service very well. I reccomend if you want to use full function of this phone, get it from your mobile service plan. if you don't mind about other support function and just like design or its brand, get unlock one because it is cheaper.PS. my suggestion is based on Australian mobile service provider and I don't know about US services.
This phone is excelent. Works fine with Movistar, Venezuela. It's lightweight and small.The battery life is short, working on the phone with e-mail, BB Messenger and some stuff works one day.The language came in deutch, manual and CD too. But, it have other language available. I have in Spanish right now.Came with OS 4.6
This is my second Blackberry (I have also a Bold 9000)No problem at all, the manual is in English, it looks elegant and the keyboard is easy to use once you get used
such a great smartphone, excellent...es el mejor de todos, totalmente recomendable, facil de manejar, buenos acabado, totalmente nuevo, gran precio, funcional 100%.
My cellphone in fact is unlocked! I'm so happy with this buy! Congrats to VibeCellular!
It's an excelent phone i bought two items for my sister an friend. I sent it to Venezuela, and it's working.I recommend
Everytihing is ok with the purchase, but the usb Cable of my Blackberry 8220 is in dissacord with the model.Be careful with that Item.Thanks,Orlando Castillo
Ok, the package came quick but with a surprise. When i opened my blackberry flip all my manuals were in another language and when i turned on the phone it also was in another language and i don't have a clue to change it to English...
Excellent buy for me.Very short mailing time, excellent product, and the best was the time it took to recieve the product, ive bought on other places in the net and almost 3 weeks to recieve the product.
BlackBerry 8220 Flip Pearl Unlocked Phone with Quad-Band GSM 850/900/1800/1900, GPRS, EDGE, and 2 MP Camera--International Version with No Warranty
Este telefono a sido mi favorito, es mas compacto que cualquier otro BB, el teclado inteligente ayuda a la hora de redactar SMS, acabado sin igual (el cual se raya facilmente, se recomienda un forro), las fotos son geniales a pesar de la baja resolucion de la camara, doble pantalla, WiFi, etc, etc, etc. Me gusto mucho.Un posible punto debil, no posee GPS, version flip. Como todo BB al tener poca bateria mata la señal de la antena, asi que si quedas con muy baja bateria practicamente acabaras con un pisa papeles muy costoso.
I kept having keyboard problems with my Blackkberry Pearl 8200. Annonymous calls being made etc. although locked. The Flip is the perfect answer.
I'm still waiting  for the company  to solve my problem.  Several calls, several mails, and nothing yet. I was told that I woudl receive an email  last Friday 9th, 2009-  Let's see how much time they need to finally solve the matter or give me my money back.
I'm looking at the Samsung T239 manual right now (pg. 60) and it certainly DOES vibrate.  The other reviewer is referring only to the alarm.  And while dedicated web and mail keys may seem unnecessary on a prepaid phone, where you wouldn't expect a lot of Internet access, this phone is also used with other types of T-Mobile plans.One other thing.  The product description has an error.  While text messages on T-Moble's monthly plans are $0.20 to send and receive, on the prepaid plans they are $.10 to send and $.05 to receive.  Go figure.
It's better and has more future then the older model sidekicks *The only smart phone I've ever owned* Battery life is great, looks good, plays games, you could use your own music for ringtones *Take that Sidekick* camera is great *and it could Zoom unlike another phone I used* You could change the plan on this phone at any time, free web browser *only could look at some random stuff, sports, and news* the list goes on and on... GREAT PRE-PAID PHONE!!
Samsung makes some pretty crappy phones but this has to be the worst of the worst. I needed a new phone without extending my t-mobile contract and this happened to be on sale (first sign to not get it).Problems so far:Falls apart easily (Back slides off and battery pops out)Bad sound quality (sometimes it sounds like your underwater or talking in a box)Random missed callsHorrible ReceptionOnly Pros:good battery life (very rare for a samsung phone)Bunch of other annoying stuff also.
I had an opportunity to help a neighbor with her "new" Samsun St-239 from T-Mobil.  It's her first cell phone.She like the fact that it had a camera.  She used it on a trip to California last week.  Today she asked me to upload her photos to her computer.You can't do it with this phone.  It does have Bluetooth but it is specifically not provided with any software that allows one to directly transfer (i.e. upload) photos to a pc or a Mac.So how do you get the photos out?  Per the user manual, you email them to yourself one photo at a time!  That's right, one photo at a time..You also can upload them to your Samsung MyAlbum somewhere on the web, but I believe that uses up some of your minutes.Anyway, my personal feelings is that this is pretty archaic.  My 5 year old Nokia 6102 flip phone uses Bluetooth to upload to pc's or macs.Plus the photos are VGA. Her pictures were grainy and fuzzy.  The camera and the lack of Bluetooth uploads makes this phone/service combo more than a bit out of date to me.
bought this phone and had to send it back. poor design w/ the shortcut button setup. the navigation buttons can not be set for user shortcut. when you slide the phone up theres a button only specifically for web (who uses web for this cheesy prepaid phone). also on the right there is a shortcut limited for only mail/text. why would they put this when their is already a shortcut for this on your navigation button? seems poorly designed.my BIGGEST complain is i used my cell phone for alarm and this phone does NOT vibrate and the sound is really LOW. you can barely here it. sent it back and got the nokia 1680 instead. a way better phone with lots of shortcut options.
First a note related to the one-star review of this modem.  Of course, you need service with a mobile operator (AT&T; or T-Mobile in the US ... although you'll only get EDGE speeds on T-Mobile as this modem does not support T-Mobile's 3G service on the 1700Mhz band).  You need a SIM card with an active service contract from a GSM operator to use this product.  If you don't understand this, then this product is definitely not for you.AT&T; sells this product locked to their service as the USBConnect QuickSilver.The Option ICON 322 is a fast modem for automated sending of SMS and MMS.  I use it with the Now SMS/MMS Gateway software product (a.k.a., NowSMS).It also works great for internet access.  It's nice and compact, so it's easy to pack along with your laptop.
I followed all the direction to setup this device and nothing works. I tired on PC and Mac. You will have to contact AT&T;, and get the service enabled for a fee.
On June 24, 2009, I bought this phone to replace my old tried and true workhorse the Moto Razr V3 phone that I had been using on my T-Mobile Pre-Paid plan. And after much studying different newer cell phones, I wanted to upgrade my tried and true Razr so I could email and text and have more features than my Razr V3 had.BEST FEATURES OF THIS PHONE:1) Most important, you can really hear the other person on this phone and they can hear you! Also, on the left side of the phone is a up and down key for loudness in the headset. Very handy! (The reason that I mention this first is many cell phones do not have a built in volume button and some cell phones are just plain hard to hear on unless you put in the headphones or use the speaker phone). By the way, the volume on this phone is very loud when you select the volume button and the speaker phone is very loud on full volume.2) You can set the left "envelope" key for email or IM, or any message things. I set mine to email.3) The EMAIL can be browsed for free, however, to view or read or send an email in the pre-paid plan on T-Mobile it is 20 cents per read or send. I found this out the hard way when I got carried away and sent several emails and read several. I learned to open the most IMPORTANT ones or better yet to "window shop" the emails and later open them up on my laptop. However, I did find this feature so handy when I was away from my computer and needed to check my emails in a pinch!4) EMAILS: You can have more than one email account. For instance, YAHOO, AOL, and more. The set up is easy.5) INTERNET BROWSER: No, it is not a IE Browser! It is a WEB TO GO BROWSER that has: 1) My account, 2) Downloads (for music and sound effect ring tones and gifts) 3) Web to Go Browser has: 1) CNN 2) ESPN 3) ABC News 4) (Can't remember this one)6) Camera with 1.3 pixels (so so pictures, great to send and they even let you add a voice to the pictures). You can send them to your internal SD mini memory card (must purchase as this is not included), you can email the picture, send it to the T-Mobile Album in your page on T-Mobile and MORE!7) Video camera, again this is not a fancy video, however the same applies you can email the video, and more!!!!8) Voice recorder - I like that because you can record your voice and then email it to someone or just do a to do list in a recording.9) Very user friendly phone with MANY more features.10) A great FIRST TEXTING phone that is not that expensive! I bought this to see how I would like texting, emailing etc and found that I really do so this phone is great to have when I am not around my computer at home.11) The MP3 Player. After I installed the mini SD memory card (which I placed some of my MP3 music collection on), I played the music with and without the headphones. With the headphones, the music is wonderful and a rich sound. Without, not too bad either. Also, in the options, you can set any of your MP3 songs from your mini SD card to be a ring tone. I had fun with that one and added several songs to my ring tones right from my own memory card in the phone!12) BATTERY LIFE: Just to be on the safe side, I charge this phone every night and then the next morning, I take the phone with me. After heavy usage, texting, talking, browsing and learning the features, listening to the MP3 player in the phone, etc, after about 4 hours of doing the things, I still had 4 bars on the battery! And to remedy the battery situation back to 5 bars, I quickly placed it on my car charger and after driving around just 30 minutes, the phone's battery had 5 bars once again (full battery), so that quickly fixed the problem until I could arrive home and place it on the home charger. My old Razr V3's battery lasted longer (both in talk time and standby time - just about double the time of the Samsung T349), however, I also did not use the Razr except for just talking once in a while.All in all, this is a SUPERB phone with lots of great features and it is very easy to learn to use this phone in my opinion! I am very glad that I bought this phone, I highly recommend this phone!
I've had this phone for two months and can attest to it's good reception, exceptional call quality, and awesome, text-friendly keypad.  This phone is not only very reliable, but fun too, because the camera takes decent photos that are easily shared via MMS with voice memo. I also love the photo enhancements, cropping, framing, and creating and sending "postcards" with the photo shop that is already loaded on the camera. Of course you can use photos for wall paper, and slide shows, too!  Besides using this as my only phone, the other features that I use the most are the ones that help me stay organized, informed, and on-time.  There are several alarms, a timer, a fantastic calender with many scheduling options.  I have my weekly volunteering scheduled to remind me for a whole year!  I work the first weekend of the month, and I can schedule my calender to sound the alarm the rest of the year, or however long I want it to. I put all of my families appointments on it, including phone numbers so I can call if I'm running late! I set it for a reminder, of course.  Contacts have more than enough info including picture ID, dedicated ringtone, group, birthday, email, and several phone numbers.  I now have no excuse to forget birthdays!  I use the dedicated e-mail button all the time to check email.  The phone notifies me everytime I recieve an email message.  I also have a quiet tone notification, too. The volume is variable for all tones and alarms.  There are also three different tones to chose from. All day long I use the web-to-go to check my yahoo! mail account. It is pretty fast (EDGE) and I can read and manage my email, though I cannot read attachments.  It is an abbreviated version.  I check local weather, local news, CNN, and email all day. I even check maps and traffic.  There is a Yahoo! web browser that you can use to browse the web.  There are many sites to go to, but they are abbreviated versions of the real web site, but you get alot of info, and  many are being added every day. You just have to do a search on the browser and then you can bookmark your favorite sites.  It's that simple.  I never play the games, but there are some already preloaded, and many to download.  You can download music, too.  I even loaded a Spanish language translator for $2.99.  I use that at work because I work in a hospital in Central Florida and I need to speak Spanish!  The mp3 player looks like it will hold about 100 songs, and it is easy to add a memory card on the side, not under the battery like some other phones.  I guess the sound will be good because the audio on the phone calls sound so good.  I really love this phone.  It feels really good to hold, the keypad is very easy to use because the buttons are raised, well lighted, very resposive, and the partial qwerty keypad is fantastic for texting, making to-do lists, writing memos, or tasks to complete. I love to type on it, it is so fast!  I bought this as a prepaid phone, but I use my regular t-mobile sim card in it.  So I pay for my family plan with 5 faves, unlimited family texting, and $9.99 for unlimed web access.  I highly recommend this phone for everyone, especially texters, or anyone who needs to stay organized, needs lots of reminders, or likes to show off photos of their kids!
Very good sound quality.  Nice external sound controls.  Cool looking phone.  Takes a lot of time to get used to the letters.  They are not the traditional, but set up like a keyboard.  Must look at phone to hit select button--too small for casual use.  Super battery life!  Must purchase USB cable and sd card.  Phone came with a $50 rebate.  But must purchase unlimited texting at $15/month for two months.  Thus the net rebate is only $20.  I will probably exchange for the NOKIA 5310 music phone.  It looks easier to use.
I love this phone.It's a great deal for someone who just want a phone with several basic funtions.
this phone is the best prepaid stuff ever! nice looking and half QWERTY keyboard satisfied me. The keyboard is not small to push even though i have BIG fingers.I strongly recommend.
This is a great phone for small hands and basic phone use. The keys are really small and I might get a better phone to trade  this for.I didnt think this phone was okay for me.I like the sound and the quality of music, and basic of the how much does it have.I like to give it back and make into a bigger phone so I can type more.Thanks
Samsung-t349 is a nice-looking phone. The product description and customer reviews have already covered many important topics, therefore I will focus on a few issues that I had no chance to learn about before I purchased the phone. It is very important for me to be able to connect a cell phone to a GPS device in my car via Bluetooth to talk hands free. My old cell phone (a cheap Motorola phone) was perfect in this respect. After pairing it once with my Garmin Nuvi 660, it connected automatically to the Garmin every time I turned the Garmin on. Unfortunately, Samsung-t349 cannot do this. Every time I turn on the Garmin I have to pull the phone out of my pocket and manually confirm that I want the phone to be connected to the Garmin. It defies the purpose of having a Bluetooth-enabled phone. Once the cell phone is out of my pocket I can just as well talk on the phone without a Bluetooth car kit. Moreover, when I don't bother to connect the phone to the Garmin for a short drive I cannot use the Garmin either. Why? Because the two devices try to connect unsuccessfully and the "Phone disconnected" message keeps popping up on the GPS device blocking the map completely. Also, the Samsung-t349 phone book doesn't sync with the Garmin phone book. Maybe I was spoiled by a cheap Bluetooth-enabled Motorola phone but I find the Samsung Bluetooth performance unacceptable. The Samsung technical support did not offer any solutions when I contacted them.
First and foremost--What I love most about this phone is its chicness. Many have actually mistook it for a Blackberry--Pretty impressive for a gophone, don't ya think?I enjoy this phone a lot. It is great to have a full QWERTY keyboard, even if the keys are a bit small. At first i hated the keys, but i've grown to love them. They just take some getting used to.A couple of let downs:1)it isnt compatible with any mp3 or other ringtones that are actual music2)you cant send and receive pictures or sound through the bluetooth application.3)no video recorder4)it's not always off when you think it isOther than that... it is an amazing phone. The battery life is impressive--I accidentally left the phone on for three days but the battery still had one bar left! Most of my old phones i had to charge everyday because I text so much. But with this phone i text more and it will last me 3 days or more. Its great. I've dropped it a few times and it doesnt show any signs of it. The camera has a lot of neat effects to use and it can help make an awesome background. the rubber backing gives the phone a good gripA very good phone over all and i would definitely recommend it, especially if you text a lotOne other thing, the phone was $99 and as with any gophone, you get a $15 card, with this I also got a $25 card for free. So the phone was really only $74Very Nice.
I picked up this phone after dealing with a stupid Pantech Duo for toooooo long!  I hated my old phone & after reading numerous positive reviews on this phone, I went to the store & bought it.  This phone is so easy to use.  I'm already an AT&T; customer so all I had to do was slide my SIM card in & I was set!Great price for a great phone!!!!
this is an awesume phone i love that it has the full keyboard because i text almost all day but the keys are very small and i had to trim my figure nails to text but it was fine after i did that the camera is very good im very proud with this phone
I love this phone.  I've been wanting a pay as you go cell phone with a mini typewriter/computer keyboard type keypad.  It makes texting easier and faster.  You don't have to press the number 2 key 3 times to make the letter C or the number 7 key 4 times to make the letter S.  This phone has a loud earpiece/speaker.  The part where you put your ear is also the speaker when you put it on speaker phone.  It may look little but it's plenty loud enough.  When I have mine on speaker I put the volume down to 5 and it's still loud enough for me.  When I have it where I have to put it up to my ear, I keep the volume at 7.  The 7 has nothing to do with the phone and everything to do with my hearing.  Those are the volume levels I keep it at.  You can adjust it and find the volume levels that work best for you.  The ringer is also loud.  I keep the ringer on mine set high as it'll go--7.  With the ringer volume set at 7 I can hear this phone ring in another room.  Now about the signal strength on this phone.  I have 3 Motorola pay as you go phones, 2 use A T & T and the other uses Boost.  They all 3 have crappy signals.  I thought it might be Boost with the Boost phone but the 2 that use A T & T are almost as, if not as bad as the Boost phone when it comes to poor signal.  Then I got this phone and I realized what the problem was: Motorola sucks.  It's not Boost or A T & T, it's Motorola.  I have yet to find a place where this phone has a crappy signal.  Maybe I should try the mall.  My Motorolas never would get enough signal to work in the mall.  I even bought a signal booster for one of my Motorolas.  Didn't help enough to count.  I'd see other people walking around in the mall talking on their cell phones.  I'd wonder how they did it.  Now I know: They had good cell phones.  This Samsung is a good cell phone.  It must be part Timex.  I've dropped mine a couple times since I bought it.  If those 2 drops hurt it, I can't tell it.  To me, it's still working as good as before I dropped it the first time.  I'm gonna end this review with a rcommendation.  If you want a good pay as you go phone or a good cell phone with a contract and monthly bill, then I highly recommend this phone.5 stars is not enough.
Amazon is the best.  The samsung phone I purchased for my son has been better then advertised.  My son rarely uses his phones to call and the first day he put his old sim card in from his other Go Phone and it gave him a $50 credit for upgrading his phone, didn't even use the $15 that came with the phone.also texting most of the day the battery virtually lasted all day and never did completely die on him.  after 8 hours of use it was only down 2 bars and it shows 5 on a full charge.
I'm very happy with the phone. It's slim, light, and attractive. A great phone if all you want to do is make calls and text.
This  phone works  great, the  cam  is  decent and the  bult  in  imsave my  life  n.n the  batter is  very decent and i  have  ywt a  complante a bout the  phone
I've had this phone for three weeks, and it's just not working for me. I bought this phone to replace a RAZR that I gave to my parents because they needed something simple to use. I like the look and feel of this phone, but that's about all. The volume is so low I can barely hear my callers, even on speaker. I don't get the excellent reception I did with the RAZR. The keypad comes unlocked while it's in my bag or my pocket without even touching it. My talk time is about 2 hours, not the 5 hrs. they claim. My standby time is about 48 hours. I guess it's a good enough phone if you do a lot of texting. I really wanted to like this phone, but I'm going to return it and get another RAZR.
I like the phone.  I seem to get good reception, except at my house.  My only complaint would be that the keys are small.  Old age is setting in and I sometimes need my glasses to see what I'm doing!
I bought this phone (as a business traveler) to send and receive email. It is not fit for this purpose - only links up with non-gmail webmail accounts and then it's a flaky java application with no saved settings. AT&T; service in San Francisco is also flaky.
We were looking for an attractive, pre-paid cell phone and this fit the bill.  It's easy to use, has good battery life, and includes a serviceable camera.  The phone is comfortable to use (something that couldn't be said for the Motorola flip phones), snaps closed with a solid feel, and the menus are straightforward.  Call quality with AT&T; is very good.  There are two things that could be improved:  there should be a way to get photos off the phone without having to send a video text message, and it would be nice to be able to import phone numbers from a PC.  For the price though it's no big deal.  Other than those quibbles we're very happy with the phone.
If you are looking for something simple that has great call quality this is the phone.  I researched low SAR (absorbed radiation) and this was the cheapest most simple phone available.  My other phone was ancient, so this feels like a huge step up.  Love the speakerphone, internal antenna.  The camera doesn't take super clear pictures, but my other phone didn't have a camera at all - so still a step up.  Overall pleased with how it functions and quality of calls.
HIGHS-  good sound quality, good reception, and decent battery life LOWS- VERY small cheap feeling plastic buttons, confusing menu, no flash
In sum:  If you want coverage independent navigation or T-Mobile 3G, you may consider this phone, but you must live with Windows Mobile and the most non-standard headphone jack imaginable.Pros:1.  Offers T-Mobile 3G on my grandfathered plan, though the coverage is spotty.2.  Nice screen--480x800.  Feels good in hand.  Nice form factor.3.  Decent sound in speakers after load Pocket Player.  Sounds poor with Windows Mobile player.4.  Includes Opera 9.5 browser.5.  Sbp interface included.  Quite glossy and graphical interface overlay.  But takes work to set up and is flakey at times.6.  Some nice third party software can improve matters, such as Pocket Player, which has better sound and a resume function for audio books.  Kinoma also is good and includes Audible integration.7.  The Pharos navigation software has ugly and dated graphics but does include turn by turn directions, and is not dependent on the wireless connection.  A 2 gb navigation card in included, but this can be transferred to a card with more more memory.  The gps was not as sensitive as advertised, but not too bad--it did pick up a signal in my tree lined street.8.  Is said to be able to be used as a modem.  Haven't tried this yet.Cons:1.  The most non-standard USB headphone jack I could imagine.  I thought, at least, I could use HTC or Motorola Razr headphones or jacks.  No.  HTC jacks will not fit in the phone, and the Motorola USB jacks yield no sound.  This is quite an outrage.2.  A close second for bad--Windows Mobile.  The level of frustration which this OS presents is incredible at this stage in mobile development.  It takes days to try to set up the phone to work in some reasonable way. The OS is slow and the stock programs are poor.  The browser is bad--Opera is much better.  The Media Player is horrible--the sound, compability and functionality.  It will hardly play any videos. The freeze ups are common--many times per day with constant use.3.  A close third for terrible--the keyboard implementation.  The biggest problem--if you touch the on-screen keyboard even a millisecond too long, you get multiple character entries.  After using the iPhone, this is very annoying.  Also, although it includes a nice sbp keyboard, it pops up inconsistently.4. The touch screen functionality is poor; it is either too sensitive (selecting what you don't want) or not sensitive enough.5. The accelerometer is flakey, being delayed in switching between landscape and portrait or flashing back and forth.6.  The jury is still out, but battery life seems very poor.7.  Many programs don't work--Mobipocket for books (a shame with the big screen); the divx player; and many others I tried to load.
I have read some horrible stories about this model, that I was skeptical at first.However, I finally give a try, and got 137E (no software card). Strangely, mine doesn't have problem some other users stated, I can assume it's different hardware.Touchscreen is reliable, no "single tap, multiple characters" issue.Battery is still kinda short, but I expect that happens, running over 3G is certainly battery killer, I have ordered 2 more batteries along with software card (137E has a coupon, which gives $50 off).Charging this phone from USB hub works with a trick, that you have to cover 2 center conductors on the USB plug to make it NOT data capable, failure to do it will activate ActiveSync and halt charging; same way applies to iGo AA battery charger, NiMH batteries will work, but Lithium AA batteries are recommended as it draws a lot of power.The new hardware has better radio, no "losing reception" problem like other stated; however, the antenna is located on the bottom (back of trackball), and I hate this design, because your palm will affect reception. Bluetooth is OK, but I wish it's Broadcom stack because it works better, wifi is fine.I personally like SPB shell more than HTC TouchFlo 3D, the virtual keyboard takes time to learn, but it's cool, and it can take different language layout.Trackball is OK, but I think it's too slow to scroll on a web, and it's difficult to catch a link, tapping is way better.This phone has a special USB jack, that only wired headset sold from Pharos work; fortunately, I use wireless headset/headphones all the time, that this is not big deal.It comes with SPB TV with few free channels, you can pay monthly fee to unlock other channels; however, wifi and/or 3G connection is required to view. Slingplayer works, but rendering is not so ideal especially in full screen mode. Pocket Player works fine, but you need to disable auto screen off, and let the system handle it.Voice quality is not really ideal, sound comes from earpiece is like some Samsung phones (compressed), even I heard through wireless headset. Audio from wireless headphones is affected by system.Camera is kinda dark if you take pics indoors, video only renders QVGA in 3GP format.GPS takes about 3-5 mins to fix, but currently I can't really test it because software card is on the way.Conclusion: if you plan to get this smartphone, make sure you get 137E model, the cost of software card is worth for better stability.
Pros1. A lot of free Software bundled, including Navigation softare and US Map.2. Unblocked with Quad-band, good for international traveler.Also good for domestic traveling too, Notebook using "Internet Share" (data Modem) software, allow me to connect to Internet.3. Very sensetive GPS receiver.4. Very high resolution in Display (800X480)5. A lot of memory.6. Got 3G bandwidth with T-mobile most of time.Cons1. Stylus easy to lost. Drop it couple of times, but fortunately found it back.
On the plus side, the design of the software is attractive.  The SPB software is nice with a lot of good features.  The GPS traveller is good and the receiver was sensitive enough (not as good as my Garmin though).  Although sometimes finding a POI in the database was not quite intuitive if it did not fall in one of the categories.  I got through to their Tech support very quickly and easily which is good.  Call quality was fine.  Nice screen and resolution.On the negative side mine is on its way back to Amazon.com because I found the camera button does not work on my unit (spoke to Pharos Tech Support to confirm).  Also the G-sensor worked sometimes and locked up in one orientation from time to time which can be irritating.  The FM radio requires use of the provided headphones as the antenna and won't turn on without it plugged in.  This sucks because you have to carry that around to listen to the FM radio?  What if you want to use bluetooth headphones?  Battery life seems short (ran out before the end of the day both days I had the phone).  Trackball feel was iffy (I could live with it) and Internet Explorer was tiny (could not figure out how to adjust or zoom) so it was hard to read or zoom into maps on weather.com.  I read somewhere that the USB headphone jack does not work with all USB headphones although I did not confirm this myself.
call quality and texting is excellent. mobile web is very good and fast. email is great. strong signal and great sound quality and speakerphone is superb. picture quality is decent and the videos are fun. overall this is a great phone and yes i would recommend this phone to a friend.
I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for about two years now, and up until my purchasing of this phone, I thought that I'd never be happy with them.Don't get me wrong, they have some of the best plans I've ever seen (I pay $35 a month for everything I could ever need), it's just their phones that never appealed to me. I had the Wild Card a year ago, and let's just say that it kind of scarred me for life. :DI was urging towards the X-tc, but too many reviews stating that it had all sorts of bugs turned me off. And then I discovered the Shuttle.An affordable device that has almost too many features for its price (which isn't a bad thing, mind you), the Shuttle is a great phone that I'll never regret buying. The 1.3 megapixel camera with a camcorder ain't too bad, either.Since this wouldn't be a review without a complaint or two (I'm a poet today), I'll admit that the camera quality isn't the best, especially for one that can take video. I mean, if I'm gonna take a video of something, I want it to look at least half-decent. The 1.3 megapixel makes your videos look like something on YouTube before they came up with the idea for high quality video support. In other words, videos don't look good on the Shuttle. This is minor, though. I mean, it has 3G.I recommend this to any Virgin Mobile customer who wants quite possibly their best phone. Sure, the Rumor2 is nice, but that's for people who love to text. Even though I admit I'm a texter, I still wouldn't pay $130 for a phone that doesn't have as much as the Shuttle. And that's that.
I'm an on and off Virgin customer, and upon switching back to this carrier after ending my contract with Helio (ironically, now part of Virgin) I decided to get the best device they had available. At that time it was the Shuttle, branded UTStarcom but actually manufactured by Pantech. Normally Pantech is a pretty good device manufacturer, so I had high hopes for this one.The Shuttle is undoubtedly one of the most capable devices in Virgin's lineup. It's a 3G phone- the first one for this carrier, has a micro-SD slot, music player, stereo bluetooth, and touch sensitive keys. The screen is a respectable 176x220, it has a 1.3 MP camera and a neat slider design that looks pretty high-tech.In terms of call quality, the Shuttle is pretty clear as long as you're not using a headset. I haven't tried a bluetooth set, and don't really want to after hearing how bad it was with the UTStarcom-branded wired headset. The sound quality with this is atrocious- and the microphone pickup is really no better. I don't know if you can get a third party set that will fit the jack, but if so it's not available from Virgin's store. The music player is effectively useless as a result. The speakerphone is average, but it has major problems (more on that later). The camera takes decent pictures, which you can save on internal or SD memory, and can also record video. There's voice memo, a simple calendar and address book, and other miscellaneous tools like a calculator and stopwatch. Battery life is superb- I can often get through a whole week on one charge, and when you browse the web it is pretty fast.Now the problems... there's so many it's hard to think of where to begin. First off, the touch-sensitive keys. These are cool... until you try to pull the phone out of your pocket and it ignores the call because it brushed against something on the way out. Or until you push them and they flat out refuse to work... say when answering a call or (ironically) pushing ignore. This issue is inherent in their design, and after a few weeks I really wished they'd just put in old-fashioned regular keys. It didn't take me long to realize that the softkey to turn on the speakerphone was only sometimes working. After a while it stopped working altogether but for some weird reason (which I never did figure out) it sometimes activated by itself. So whenever I wanted to use the speakerphone it wouldn't work, but sometimes it would just answer a call on speaker mode automatically. Not sure what to say about that. After about two months of use, the phone occasionally froze upon receiving an incoming call. It would stay ringing, but opening the slider (even repeatedly), pushing the answer softkey, pushing the talk key, and even pushing the end key produced absolutely no response. After the caller gave up, I could only access my address book and had to remove the battery and replace it to get the handset working again. Even some basic functions like the alarm clock stopped working after a while, and it's clear that the firmware has some serious bugs in it. Additionally, while the web speed is pretty nice, Virgin's web plans are not. Also, the browser that comes with this device is horrible- really no better than what they've always been using. I've heard you can download Opera Mini to replace it, and if so that might be a viable alternative, but it still doesn't fix the fact that you're paying way too much for web access from the carrier.I don't know if I just got a lemon or if it was because I got this device right when it came out, but either way these issues are totally unacceptable. The device was not dropped, immersed in water, or otherwise mistreated- I hardly even used the thing and these issues started surfacing after it was in service for some time (the other reviewers both look like new buyers; I'd be more curious to see how many long-term users had the same problems). What good is a phone that can't even reliably answer calls? Maybe as a paperweight. Virgin doesn't do firmware updates, so you're pretty much SOL if you run into any software bugs, and as far as customer service goes you get what you pay for. They're a very low cost carrier, but trying to get a replacement (or any kind of help, for that matter) is pretty much hopeless. They sent me the wrong car charger for this device, and after 3 useless calls to customer service I just gave it up and wrote it off. They also deleted an existing balance on my account, and when I asked them about this they said 'we can't do anything about it.'After dealing with this $100 piece of junk for a few months, I just bought a new and cheaper Samsung model and am using that now. It hasn't had any of these issues so far and was half the cost to boot. While the Shuttle may be a bold new step for Virgin mobile, it is a device that's clearly got major issues and should be avoided at all costs.
The Blackberry arrives in excelent conditions, very fast and the supplier is very efficient.I recomend them a lot
EXCELENTE EQUIPO , TOTALMENTE NUEVO , LO LLEVE A MI TELEFONIA Y DE INMEDIATO FUE ACTIVADO SIN PROBLEMAS.. LO RECOMIENTO ALTAMENTE
Nobody seems to mention several important things. I'm not sure if all the products are the same, or if the one I bought from this particular seller had these problems, but mine had two major shortcomings.1) It only comes with a Southeast-Asia plug adapter (which I believe is the same as they use in the UK). So out of the box, there is no way to charge it in the US, other than via USB. At some point you will probably want to buy a converter plug.2) There is no Market application installed on it. Therefore, you cannot, with conventional means, install any other applications on this phone. The Android OS that comes with this particular phone is crippled. I managed to root the phone and install a much better Android version on it, but it took me about 6 hours of trial and error and it put me at risk of ruining the phone (drop me a message if you need help rooting your own Hero; I saved my notes from the process).After fixing number (2) above, yes, the phone is great and it works as expected. There are plenty of reviews out there and I agree with what they say -- the good and the bad. But it takes hours of effort and you must take serious chances to restore this phone to its un-crippled state. That is why I'm giving it only two stars.
I'm an iPhone lover, so my review is solely from that perspective. I have also owned & used a Blackberry storm and various other smartphones, Windows Mobile 6.5, etc.1.  The plastic is very unique... seems solid like original mac or a medical device. Seems very thick/durable/dense without being heavy.2.  Angled curve ("chin" as people call it) at the bottom good for holding with one hand. This is definitely an advantage over the iPhone, but only comes on the EU versions as of late.3.  Given the placement of the buttons on the chin, this seems like a right handed person's phone.4.  The touch screen has good sensitivity & appearance. Quality is very high, but is a little smaller than iPhone.5.  The phone is smaller than expected.6.  I can see where users' don't want to open in a screen of "just the apps, ma'am". The widgets add a dimension that iPhone doesn't have. "already open & displaying your data" etc.7.  Setup intuitive & easy.8.  No exchange push. It only seems to poll my work exchange account while the iPhone gets push.9.  No timer setting for screen lock options, but unique locking options. I like having a timer on the screen lock & password options.10. Tactile typing feedback is awesome. iPhone would love this option immediately.11. In the dark, you have to know which button to press on the chin to bring the phone alive. The lights don't come on under the buttons by pressing any of them.12. Doesn't display excel made grids in email as well as iPhone13. Fold  ("chin") at the bottom keeps the screen from hitting the desk flat when you lay it on its front.14. Switching between browser windows on Android 1.5 is more OSX dock than the iPhone!15. Keeps losing connection to my WIFI access point. Can't figure out why...16. App installs are a perfect balance between iPhone's "no questions asked" and BB's ask every security. It gives you a review of what components or feature/data use each app requires.17. Android does widgets. iPhone does no widgets. That's a flat difference that differentiates.18. Light multitasking-- submit a tweet, move on, a pop up tells you on home screen that it was sent successfully. A nice feature that iPhone doesn't have.19. Zoom in & out on webpages is a little slow, and no double tap to zoom a column :(20. Moving icons is easier for the novice than iPhone. Press/hold/where you can move is bright, everything else dims.CommentsApps on Iphone are still richer, but the interface feels "stitched together" after the seamless Android HTC experience.First phone to keep my interest as long as it has, even after having it in hand.When both upright, the slightly wider keyboard on iPhone makes a big difference. I can type faster on iPhone even though I really like the haptic feedback on the Hero.App offerings for Android will only get richer, while we don't really know what's going to happen with iPhone's interface or the forethought of something "widget-like".  In many ways, Android does apple better than Apple does, or more true/similar to the OS X interface.My world is basically an iPhone world these days, so any concern I have for a mobile device focuses around "is it better or at least equal in usefulness/desirability". In this case, I can conclude "YES!" It is of equal usefulness & desirability as iPhone. Very pleased.
I've had the G1 and the MyTouch and both of those phones don't compare to this one.  The Hero Sense UI runs smooth and there is lots of Eye Candy.  There are lots of Widgets that makes the UI looks so cool.The call quality is much better than the G1 or MyTouch.  My wife says that I sound much better on the Hero.The build quality is also top notch.  I find that the G1 and the MyTouch feels a little too cheap.I also like the fact that there is a standard 3.5 headphone jack.  On the G1 and MyTouch you still have to use an adapter.All in all I am happy with this phone.  The only downside is the heavy price tag and the 3G does not work on AT&T.;  The only US version available is the Sprint CDMA.
Caveat: This is not a tech-savvy review. So if you're an average user, this is how I, a fellow average user, found the phone.This is my first time having a phone that isn't ghetto. I got this through Orange the day before it was due to come out in the US, which made me feel quite spiffy. It's meant to be an alternative to the iPhone, and I think it works quite well. I must say, Google has yet to steer me wrong; I'm digging the Android system.The Hero is very adaptable. For example, I have a variety of home screens set up on my phone. There is the main home screen that has the time, weather, and the main settings like on the picture above. I also have screens that show: my e-mail, text messages, more detailed weather information, one that has main widgets like Google Talk, one for music, and one that has additional widgets I downloaded for free. There are a wide variety of widgets that can be downloaded--I got useful ones like a currency coverter, MSN, Skype, etc, but I also downloaded a lightsabre that makes awesome swishy noises and a Star Trek soundboard, so now whenever I get it a text Worf says "Captain, incoming message."There are a couple of annoyances and quirks I've found, but I'm not sure if it's due to the phone or the fact that I haven't figured out how to make it easier on myself. It automatically adds EVERYONE to my contact list. A person I e-mailed once about a job? On my phone. Forever.  It's annoying. Also, because my contact list is now large and a bit unwieldy, I have to view contact groups, and it takes far too many presses of a button to get to it. Perhaps there is a way to install a shortcut, but I haven't figured it out. Also, sometimes the e-mail screen isn't completely up to date and lags.Otherwise, though, I've had very little trouble with it and I've learned to use it quickly and easily. It gets great reception and I was able to chat with my friend as I was riding through the countryside. The map function is good as well. It's an excellent phone. However; I would never spend so much money on it; I'd get it with a contract, definitely.
As the owner of a small IT consulting business I jumped at the chance to test out the HTC Hero for a few weeks.  The capacitive touch screen is easily as responsive as the big competitors out there (Apple iPhone, BlackBerry Storm) and the Android operating system is very intuitive and easy to use.  The lag which you may have seen reported has long since been fixed by an update from HTC, and this is easily one of the best smartphones I have ever reviewed.  I do a lot of training for iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android, Blackberry and Symbian smartphone operating systems, so when I say HTC hit a home run with this phone it carries a little bit of weight.  Unfortunately for Americans your only options are to purchase on Sprint (and I would heartily recommend this over a Palm Pre), or buy the unlocked international version which will work on the slower Edge speeds for AT&T; and T-Mobile.  Honestly, most people probably wouldn't notice the difference between Edge and 3G for web browsing and checking your email.  In any case, I loved testing this phone out and am hopeful we'll see a GSM version for AT&T; or T-Mobile in the future.
Played around with this phone for a bit now. Its a decent phone overall but yes it is little laggy. Be very carefully and aware of the fact that this handset does not work on the 3G networks. It is 3G compatible and a world phone, but GSM US carriers like T Mobile or ATT use a different frequency for data which is the GSM 1700 mhz band I think. Whatever the Freq, its not compatible for 3G data in US. Europe and Asia it will work fine on 3G but not in the US. Otherwise overall very well equiped, but not worth 600 dollars when the iPhone with 16GB unlocked can be got for about 400-500 and 32 GB for 500-600 unlocked.Many apps are available for the phone, great interface, very user friendly, shoots good pics and decent video, can use mp3s as ringtones which is fantastic. Visual voicemail if supported by carrier, g sensors, GPS is accurate, search engine features are great too. Finds anything in the neighborhood, coffee shops, hotels, restaurants etc.All in all decent phone but not at [...]
I just found out that some shops actually sell this phone as well as the Samsung i7500.  This means you should be able to try before you buy ;-).  I found this out at a coffee shop when the girl in front of me had a Hero in here hand.  She told me that the smaller phone vendors carry the international versions of Hero and Galaxy at a around 550.  No shipping or waiting.  Walk in...Negotiate...go home and play with your phone LOL.  So go to your local neighborhood phone center and ask.  I'm not talking about the company branded stores either ;-).
This company along with Amazon make it impossable to cancel an order after they tell you they will not ship for weeks and after they sell you something they don't have. Buyer beware. This is the 2nd time in a month Amazon has tried to sell something they don't have. What a scam
Has anybody else read the reviews on the Hero?  Granted, they called it the best android phone yet, but they also called it laggy, and it's multimedia capabilities aren't ranked so great either.  It looks like i'll be waiting for some real world reviews by some of you early adopters..Share your views at [...] would love to heard what you think.
I am using this device via an Executive trial courtesy of Verizon Wireless. First things first, it is 3G using a VzW SIM card. Not sure how available the SIM cards are, I am just reporting what I see when I looked under the "hood". It came with a local (for me) phone number which makes the SIM card all the more impressive. This is a US based demo unit hopefully, signs of things to come for VzW. On to the hardware.Windows Mobile is often found to be lacking when compared to the iPhone. Is this an iPhone killer? Yes, if you are a Win Mobile devotee. Things that have been a struggle in the past, the virtual keyboard are finally done right. Letter selection is confirmed with a gentle vibration while the selected letter zooms out. When using the browser or addressing email the virtual keyboard adds a .com button to save a you few keystrokes. Not convinced that a virtual keyboard is the best way to type, use the QWERTY keyboard that slides, and yes tilts on the device. Want to watch your favorite You-Tube video, the 3G speed coupled with the super high resolution screen offer a winning combination for doing just that.  Email, texting  no worries, the HTC Touch Flo interface offers elegant ways for you to read and send messages on the device. Want to take pictures? No worries as this device comes with an adequate 3.2 Megapixel camera. Do you want your contact book to be linked to Facebook? The software on the device provides this integration.Other nice touches abound on the device. Web browsing for example is provided by either Opera or Pocket IE. The Opera browser stands head and shoulders above Pocket Explorer. The browser is easy to use and while you can't zoom by "pinching" the screen, you can zoom by rolling your finger across the bottom of the screen. The phone itself presents a minimum number of buttons on the device, making it easy for one handed operation. The device is most intuitive to use proven by the fact that my demo came without a user guide or prerequisite install CD. Despite this missing documentation I was able to get up and running in no time.A perfect Smartphone, no but then neither are any of the other 20 or so that I have used in the past 2 years. For example, it is certainly a bit beefy. In fact when compared to the Omnia Touch that I currently use, this phone is easily twice the weight and thickness. Would I buy it to use as my everyday phone...a resounding yes. Win Mobile is the OS I need to use based upon software requirements at my job. Of the Win Mobile devices I have used in the past this one is hands down the best.Now if I could only figure out how to keep this device after the demo period...
I apologize for the wall of text, but it'd be great if VZW's review form took carriage returns.If you had been holding out for an iPhone on VZW, then it's time to give up the ghost and get this phone or it's keyboard-less twin the Imagio (out on Oct. 6th). HTC really made a great phone here in the TP2. It's easy to use, functional and gives all the bells and whistles you'd imagine out of a smart phone. Here's the important points. It should be noted I am a power user who does not use this phone for business needs.Design - The phone is pretty big, but it needs to be to accommodate the large screen and keyboard. Likely one of the heavier phones out there, so if you're looking for a small phone, this isn't it. However, it's not so big that it won't fit comfortably in your pocket. The only negative here is the button placement, specifically having Delete where Enter should be and the Sleep button in an all-too-easily pressed location when the keyboard is open.Screen: Big wow factor here. The screen is bigger than the iPhone (!). Extremely high mobile resolution (800x480) too. The touch part of it is good, but a capacitive screen would have better. However, it's not something that will ever interfere with your daily use. I have never used and never had a need for the stylus after one week of use. The zoom slider under the screen is also a pretty neat addition.Call Quality: No complaints. Calls sound clear and no dropped calls (which is why you stay on VZW and don't leave - ever). The phone has some nice features - put the phone face down on a call and the speakerphone turns on; pull it away from your ear and the screen turns back on. Clever. I can't tell you how many times I'd adjust the volume on my Voyager just to get the screen back on.Connectivity: EV-DO is zippy and the Wi-Fi links up to your wireless without a hitch. Bluetooth is solid, tested with stereo headphones, it has gone off without a hitch. It's also nice that this is a GSM worldphone too. Just be sure to set it to CDMA only as soon as you get it, to save battery life.Battery Life: It's typical smartphone - charge a day. Highly recommended to turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not using it. I get a 24 hours a charge and make it a nightly ritual to plug it in. If you can't get used to this, then this phone isn't for you.Interface: I hear a lot of gripes about WinMo 6.1. The good thing is, I can't say that I've experienced them due to the included Touch Flo 3D shell. It's great. Really increases ease of use exponentially.  It's a good way to have WinMo's awesome customizability while still having a slick interface. Also, Office Mobile is standard and really nice to have.Web Browsing: Opera is sick. I love it. Never open IE Mobile. NEVER! Stick to Opera and you will basically have your PC on your phone. I may download Skyfire, as it has flash/ajax support when Opera doesn't, but for now, I'm content with Opera. The phone never chugs with browsing, even on image heavy sites. Definitely a big plus.Audio/Video: The music player is so trying to be the iPhone and it does a good job of replicating it. No complaints here (also nice to be able to listen to music and do anything else with next to no lag!). The video player is WMP by default, but it's too short sighted to be useful. DivX Mobile works great in its place.Price: Right now, the deal VZW is offering, plus the rebate, make this phone a steal. With NE2, the promo discount and the rebate, you'll pay <$[...] for this phone. Insane.Other: GPS IS UNLOCKED! Shockingly, VZW let this happen and now you can ditch Navigator and get Google Maps. The GPS does need some tweaking to get working right, but when it does, it's pretty spot on.In the end, this phone has everything I wanted and it does it well. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to jump into smartphones as a non-business casual or power user.
I've been looking for a windows mobile phone for a while.When I first read about this HTC I've decided to wait for it, and it was worth the time. It is in my opinion, simply the best PDA phone available. The versatility is unbeatable. The screen is awesome. You can do anything you want with it. Installing programs is easy and they work perfectly. The basic content shipped is fine for normal use. Touch Flo 3D works perfectly without lags and is very finger friendly. Just be carefull with the languages you want and 3G frequencies available. For anyone looking for a PDA that has Internet 3G and even makes phone calls, I highly recommend it.
I am very happy with this product.The sound quality is really clear.The windows mobile has been very stable.The screen is very responsive and the touch feature works perfectly.The software support is of course tremendous although that is to be expected with windows.Would buy again.
Pros: HTC has done a great job on this phone with the following:-Beautiful Screen.-Good Touch.-Great Speakers.-Tilt.-Great Keyboard Buttons. (See Cons though)-Phone stands pretty stable upright. (Space saving?)-Universal USB Charging.-Face sensing.-Face down during call activates speaker and back mike.-Sprint Added the 3.5mm Stereo Jack.-Good Overall feeling.-The rest is whatever you like from Windows Mobile 6.1.Cons:-No control key!(Drives me nuts especially the way HTC Touch Flo makes it two extra steps for copying and pasting. Really annoying. Hopefully sprint will let you download a tweak for that)-The power button is at a very bad spot. (almost impossible to not press it a million times in your pocket while walking or any motion, unless you buy an upright pouch)-Sprint back design is not only bad but is destructive how after two months those pores in the back fill up with dirt. (I can't imagine they actually pay someone to design this crap)-HTC should have given it a scroll wheel. AND the scroll wheel should have doubled as shutter button in camera mode. Grrr (HTC and Sprint should hire me)-When the pro2 sits on my desk, I can't press the screen without toppling the unit.-The resistive screen accumulates moisture giving me an aura like effect looking at the screen sideways. (At least my phone)Suggestion: You should still get this phone. Although I think its time for HTC and Sprint to hire a guy like me who actually uses these phones already 7 Years, to help them design and test.
I purchased this phone when my Motorola Q started to show its age.  My Q, at just over 4 ounces, seemed quite svelte compared to this thick, heavy phone.  When I unboxed it (it was online only, so I didn't get a chance to hold it in the store), I thought that might take some getting used to, but if it was a great phone it would be well worth it.I used it for over four weeks and still had issues.  I hadn't dropped it yet, but I dreaded that day (it will come) since it was so heavy that I knew bad things would happen if dropped on a hard surface.The good - nice screen, great syncing with my PC and a easy bluetooth pairing (at least compared to my now-dated Moto Q).  I also like the "favorites" section of the contacts, where you keep your top 10 friends.  The RSS Hub was also pretty slick.  As was adding photos to contacts.  The slide out keyboard is large, but I made a lot of mistakes using it (much more than on my Q).  Call quality was good, but I was never able to voice-dial through my bluetooth headset.  It may have been the headset (which still works well with my Q).The bad - large (thick), heavy, WinMo 6.1, not very intuitive.  I never got Media Player to play correctly.  I also downloaded the software to enable the FM radio included, but I never got the radio to work.  That would have come in handy at the health club, where the TV audio is broadcast on FM.  And there isn't a quick way to turn the phone to silent mode (at least compared to my Q).I ended up returning the phone after 31 days of use.  After 4+ weeks, I was still struggling to complete tasks that should have been second nature by that time.  I didn't see enough benefit to justify the heaviness of the phone.  When I took it back, it was the first time the Verizon rep handled the phone.  He seemed genuinely surprised at how heavy it was.
I really love most of the features of this phone. The screen is incredibly nice. Internet surfing with 3G is great. Youtube application built in is fabulous. Drawback is the camera. It takes really pretty poor pictures. If it took pictures like other camera phones I would give this phone 5 stars. I had replaced my HTC T-mobile Wing with this phone. Even though the wing was only a 2 megapixel, and this phone is a 3 megapixel the performance is really poor. The ISO and brightness adjustments simply do not function at all. I have had a bunch of emails to HTC and they say the changes are subtle. They are not subtle, they do nothing. I had taken some sunset photos with my Wing and the colors were vibrant. With the Touch Pro 2 they are all washed out, no matter how I adjust the settings. I love taking photos and know a bit about photography. The camera performance is just heart-breaking on this phone. As far as I can figure, the camera makes no adjustments for exposure at all. I think it could be fixed in software, but HTC customer service just says the phone operates as designed and they won't even report the problem.If a camera in a phone is important to you buy something else. Probably anything else would be better
Ok, so I couldn't wait to have the phone, so I jumped the gun and got the Euro/Singapore version. Well much to my shock, the phone does NOT work on 3G ATT network only on the EDGE network. So, if you are a data speed junkie like myself, then WAIT for the ATT Fortress. The antenna is physically different. I don't know if conversion is possible, but I wouldn't chance it... don't make the mistake I did...WAIT...
i brought through t-mobile without contract for 549.00,is a ok phone but no comparsion to the iphone screen,the + and - bar is usless,sometimes work sometimes no and sometimes another page will pop out.The browser is sucks,slow,slow,slow and hang.Only good thing is mindow base and faster than old window phones.
I love this phone. However, I live in Sweden so beware that some features may not be exactly the same. UPDATE: I have now had this phone for about a month and have these comments (see UPDATE notes).First, this is a great phone. Hands down...and I live in Sweden where there are more cellphones per capita than anywhere else. As for the other reviewer...I don't know why someone complains about the virtual keyboard and no physical keypad. Buy a phone with a keyboard, silly, if you don't like tapping the screen. I for one used to have a Nokia E61 with a real keyboard. Great. But, I really like this onscreen keyboard. It's fast, easy to use, and even though it suggests words for you (and gets smarter with time) you can suggest the word you want from four suggestions (iPhone has only two). This phone is obviously trying to get you to shy away from the iPhone...and you should. It's that good.Pros:Flexibility - I can configure the homescreens any way I want. UPDATE: This is just great. Really. I can change the phone as I learn what I need and don't need. Lot's of hype in the cellphone world, but few useful tools. This really helps me stay connected and it is easy and quick to make a direct call, take a picture, check my google map position, send an email, etc.Fast - this phone is really fast and does multitasking very well. I can surf the web while listening to a tune while using the GPS...and it doesn't bog down! UPDATE: Yep, this really works. Just went hiking in the woods of Sweden...where the logging road ends. Did perfectly. Used my GPS while I listened to my radiostation on LastFM through the phone...in the woods! The iPhone bogs down.Form - it's fits really nicely in my pocket. Not too heavy, not too big. UPDATE: The screen doesn't scratch badly at all, and if you want additional scratch protection go to [...].Battery - stellar battery life. UPDATE: Go easy on the app downloads from the Market/app store. Some apps drain the battery. Again, the iPhone drains your battery badly.Market - ok, so it's not the Apple store, but it has a lot of useful programs. UPDATE: I have a great email program (K-9), push SMS (SMS popup), instant access to wifi/GPS/bluetooth etc (Useful switches).Google syncing - works perfectly to sync my web calender with my phone with my sidebar at home. UPDATE: Really love this one. Type in a new calender event and your google calender and your google toolbar are updated within the minute. Sweet.Cons:Really, so far I haven't found any...except to figure out how to get the same timezone on all three calenders...UPDATE: I did.UPDATE: Actually, the calender is subpar...so far until the Market provides a new one. You really can't adjust it very well. I would like different colors for different events; start the week on a Monday; Week number.However, buy this phone and you won't be disappointed!
I would up my rating from 3 to 4+ stars now, but Amazon doesn't allow a change.  I am warming to this phone after trying it for 1 month.I discovered the keyboard setting to turn off automatically replacing what I typed with its own highlighted word. Click Home, Menu, Settings, Locale & text, Android keyboad ->> turn off Auto-comple and Quick fixes.  This fixes my biggest gripe with the virtual keyboard that replaced what I typed with it's own(wrong)gusses. I could not find the setting before.I was able to load a lot of photos using the included mini USB cable to the included 2 GB miniSD card. (These accessories may not be included if you bought the HTC phone.) Photos copied to DCIM folder displayed quickly. Thumbnail viewing and finger-flick scrolling was very nice. The included Gallery app recognized folder structure and showed folders using thumbnails.The steps for mounting the phone as a USB drive were not obvious, but works well when following the instructions on Android Developer's site ([...]  Steps: (1) Install free Eclipse SDK on your computer (I installed C++ version for Windows XP, but JAVA is recommended). (2) Install ADT (Android Development Tools) Plugin to Eclipse. and (3) Turn on USB debugging. From your phone, click Home, Menu, Setting, Applications, Development ->> then turn on USB debugging. When you plug-in the USB cable, your phone will ask if you want to mount the USB drive. From the windows computer, the USB drive was automatically assigned the next drive letter and I was able to use Windows Explorer to drag-n-drop content. This is more involved than usual for mounting a USB drive (most are automatically recognized). But I found myself intrigued by the nice Eclipse SDK.  I am tempted to try out the Hello World sample code on the developer's site and try writing a very simple app for myself even though I am TOTALLY NOT a developer. I can see how this will suck in other phone app developers.I discovered that my AT&T;/Cingular 3G SIM card from my Treo680 worked seamlessly on the Google Ion. I have an unlimited data and limited voice plan for about $50/month. It plugged in and booted up and I was able to make a call and download web content right away.  My phone number from Treo was recognized by Ion. I haven't tested it, but I should be able to use the Android as a tether for my laptop to connect to the internet. Bluetooth tethering is included in my Treo's data contract, and 3rd party software (ex. PDANet) allows a work-around for phones that are prevented from tethering by service providers.I have enjoyed playing with the many apps availabe from Android Market. There are a few TASK and Note apps that I would LOVE to use if the Ion had a thumb keyboard.  My remaining gripe is the keyboard, but I can see a 3rd party thumbpad accessory that plugs into the miniUSB jack at the bottom becoming available very soon. So, I have been pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of Ion I've discovered as I learned to use it.-------- My earlier initial review follows. --------------------Summary: Best for viewing/editing video/photo, web surfing at high speeds, and REALLY GREAT for app developers.  Totally unlocked and access to root level. Complete access to app Market. Lots of free apps to play with for consumers.  Good phone sound and connection. Battery lasts 5 hours on continuous hard use, can easily go all day with normal use (added after one month trial: usually lasts me 3 days on normal use).Pros:* Best aspect is a high-res screen coupled with a fast internet connection.  Great for viewing YouTube in high-res.  Fast WiFi connection.  3G a bit slower but still very usable.  Hi-Res video stalls when using 3G, works great on WiFi. A bad is there is no support for viewing Flash video.  Most videos from websites other than YouTube does not play either. (I expect these to be resolved with software updates)* Love being able to record high-res video built-in. Quality was very good. Easy to upload to PC via USB cable or email/YouTube.* Photo viewing from gallery is also great at the high-res.* Voice calling and Voice search works very well!  Remarkably accuarate recognition of English words. Setup your contacts and "my location" to help these tools work well.* Google provides an easy to use development environment for writing apps and do not block anyone from uploading their apps to the Market.  Apple plays gatekeeper and sometimes unreasonably block apps. Palm Pre's market hasn't even started.  Developer tools not ready.  I am a consumer, and expect to benefit from this.  There are a lot of free apps to try out, and I expect a lot more to come (maybe surpass Apple in the distant future?).OK:* Pretty good bowser experience. Swiping up/down or left/right works well. Although, hard to type in web address. Try to use bookmarks and links as much as possible. Can also copy & paste. Can't pinch like the iPhone, but does rotate screen.* Good integration with Google Maps, but not usable as a GPS naviation tool. Can usually find "my current location" but accuratcy is often miles off.  GPS is useless (locks up) when car is moving, so not a usable navigation device, but can still be used just for the map function.* Playing music - sound sucks from speaker and headphone, but software is nice and easy to navigate. Does not play Audible.com books, but expect this to change.* Syncing with Microsoft Outlook: It's doable, but not free of errors. First sync Outlook 2-way with Google Calendar online. Then sync Google Calendar with phone. Contacts do not sync, but can be exported from Outlook as CSV file and imported into Google Calendar. Phone number field does not accept any extra text other than 10 digits. No 1 in front either. Email addresses were added to note field, and had to be manually corrected. If your main PIM is already Google Calendar, your integration may be trouble free.* Games: surprisingly, this is only OK for game because of the dull screen sensitivity.  Hard for quick response games. Scroll wheel is hard to move accuartely, but a smart use of this clickable wheel might be the best answer for game developers.(A stylus was extremely good for playing space invaders on my old Pocket PC 2002).Cons:* Really hate the virtual keyboard. (I currently use Treo with a small thumpad and really love typing out emails and task notes.) A lot of people say it's an improvement over G1's physical keyboard, but I don't know how that can be possible.  It maddeningly substitutes words I've typed with a higher frequency word it hightlights at the bottom.  So if I am typing a name or an acronym, there is no way to disable the keyboard from substituting what I typed with what it "thinks" is the right word.* Screen is not as sensitive to touch as the iPhone.  Seems to really need pressure, especially space and dot (last row).  Sometimes interprets strong pressure as a double tap.* Can't use a stylus. This is same as the iPhone, but more of an issue with the less sensitive screen.* No support for Bluetooth external keyboard, such as Stowaway. This SUCKS!  Google's support forum says HID (Human Interface Device) bluetooth stack support is way down on their priority.  Since I hate the virtual keyboard, this eliminates the Ion from being functional as a PDA as well as an entertainment device.  Now it's great only as an entertainment device.* To view Word email attachments or edit Word docs, need to buy $20 app from Documents-to-go.* No good Task app found: Does not sync with Outlook Tasks without due dates. Tried Astrid and ToDo, but I don't like these as well as Outlook Tasks or even apps that were available for my old PPC 2002 (TreNotes, HandiNote). Maybe some fully-fleshed paid apps might be developed in the future.
This phone is good for basic calls. The screen is great, and it has large buttons on the keypad. However, some of the features may not work in the U.S. The Google browser would not work. This is a 3G phone, but it's 3G will not work in the U.S. This phone was made for the Asian market, but it will work with T-Mobile sim cards. You can get downloads (LG PC Suite), but you may have to go to LG's Asian sites. Games, wallpaper, etc., can be found at [...]. As I said, this is a very good phone as long as you accept it's limitations for use in the U.S.
I make frequent purchases from Amazon and admittedly this is by far the worse purchasing decision I have ever made.  For starters, I expected a new phone since that is what I was told I was purchasing.  Instead I recieved a battered looking "re-conditioned" Vodaphone.  Secondly, though I have had it for over a month, I still don't know whether it even works, as the battery pack that came with it is useless/dead...and I certainly hope, that is the only problem and not the phone itself.It certainly wasn't worth the $159 paid.  I will never make another purchase from Tiger Mart...its also unfortunately that I had the phone shipped to Jamaica and thus am having a challenge making a return.  I hope I am still in the warranty period, as I will be in the US in a matter of weeks when I will be able to return and get back my hard earned cash.
I bought this about a week ago from Amazon, excellent cellphone is all I can say. I considered the Z550a I was using before a masterpiece, but the W508a is even better. The phone has a slick design and it's very lightweight and low profile. The Z550a was slightly bulky in comparison.I get no signal problems and battery lasts for about 5 days with normal use. I have a Sony Ericsson HBHDS980 Stereo Bluetooth Headset that goes with it. With music heavy streaming I can use it for a whole day before it needs recharge.The headset is feature rich and I have mostly explored the music features and they all work really well. The SensMe feature is just awesome because I don't always feel like selecting 30 to 40 music tracks to listen, with SensMe the player does it for me according to my mood. The phone has superb voice quality and can ring loudly.The only complain is the external display doesn't show the clock permanently like the Z550 did. I wish I didn't had to open it to look at the clock. Perhaps a feature coming with a new firmware. Another minor complaint is that the vibration is rather weak, again compared to the Z550a. But I can still feel the phone ringing, I'll have to see if I can feel the phone ringing on my pocket when in a loud place.
Before you read this keep in mind i've never spent more than $30 for a phone before.I've had previous experience with both ATT go-phones and Virgin Mobile.  I bought this phone to finally replace my home phone line since the Boost service offers unlimited everything for $50.oo a month, which is a pretty awesome price for a pre-paid phone.The service:  L-o-v-e it!  I mean, the talking & texting is just like any other phone, nothing special, but I like not having to keep track of minutes or texts or kilobytes in my head when i'm trying to talk to someone or do something on my phone.  I stick to main roads and downtown areas mostly so I don't have many problems with dead zones, though as i watch the bars traveling around i can see how some people might.The phone:  Little disappointed for my first phone that i paid enough for so that i be concerned if the screen got scratched or it fell in the toilet.  Other than the camera, which is webcam quality at best, it seems to look, feel, and act like any other cheezy phone i've ever had.  The only difference is that its got a keyboard (which is a given positive for texters).  Oddly enough though (and it kind of annoys me), you know how most phones have an alarm clock and a calander built into the phone's software?  Well, with this phone, its a pre-installed java app.  On the up-side though, the speakerphone is rediculously loud, clear, and easy to acivate, to the point where i find myself using it for most of my calls.Side notes:  One main thing i bought this phone for was to replace my dial-up internet (netzero) because i had to shut off the phone line and the internet service in order to pay the $50 bucks a month for the boost service.  Well, this review is proof that its possible (and rather simple) to do that because i'm using the phone's internet from my computer right now to write this.  Just buy the cable off amazon.com for a buck (of course theres an eight dollar shipping charge), download MotoConnect from [...](freeware), and when the cable arrives you might have to reshape the plastic part around the connecter with a pocket knife so it will stop popping out of the phone, but it works.  Don't know what the exact speed is, but it loads webpages at a similar speed compared to 56k dialup and downloads files at about 2.5KBps.  The computer will recognize the phone as an "iDen" modem and you set up a new dialup connection with the phone number "S=#777".  The username and password don't matter and BAM! your online, no extra ISP (like aol or netzero) necessary.  Whats really cool is it connects in like 8 seconds.  This feature is also supposed to be possible without the cable if you have a bluetooth-enabled laptop or one of the little USB bluetooth adapters available at amazon for like 5 bucks with shipping.  I know one thing that your all probably going to be interested in is the GPS service from boost.  Well, sadly, it doesn't come with the $50 a month unlimited plan.  its another java app, that cost $2 a day or $10 a month to subscribe to.  However, the phone has a built-in software that will tell you your geo-graphic quadinates, just no map.All-in-all, i'd recommend the service, but the only thing that is going to make the phone worth its price is the keyboard & bluetooth compatability.  Whether or not its worth the extra 80 bucks is up to you.
Boost Mobile stinks compared to other services that is a fact.  The Clutch phone is not Motorola's best work.  Yet it is all to lower cell costs to the consumer.  For what you save it is well worth it.  Other companies charge way to much for their services, thus they can offer the fancy phones, yet you need to sign your rights away for 2 to 3 years.  I hope Boost will catch on so the other companies will have to drop their prices and contracts in fear of losing customers.  I would love to go back to AT&T;, they were the best, but $50.00 with them didn't get me much.  Unlike other services, cell phone costs should be getting cheaper as their networks are paid for.  All cell phones in my book should have a fee like Boost or like any land line phone company like Verizon.The Clutch offers web service, it works and you can get on-line and check mail, its not a G1 or 3 network but its online unlimited for 1 cost of $50.00 a month.  Texting is the same as rest, the keyboard feature is nice on this phone.  The only thing with the service is you get in dead zones, but its weird once your connected I have never had a dropped call with it, even going through a dead zone.  The phone is a little difficult to navigate and the manual doesn't really help, with time and use you learn all the features.  There are a lot of small features the phone does not have that you just expect it to.For the money you save it is well worth it.  No its not a great phone but it works and its cheap and you can cancel whenever you want, or pay as little a 10 a month.  I have one and I get by fine.  Use it for 6 months and it pays for itself.
i have had this phone for 2 weeks and it is terrible. battery life is short, no service alot of the time, keypad is small, i think i will go with att go phone a177 samsung phone signal is strong where boost is not and the phone is quadband not dual band
this phone is ok for the money it has one of the best speaker phones ever the service is better then cricket and i have not missed a call yet what do you expect for 50 a month for every thing gold  well you get silver and that is good enough for me
I needed a new phone so I updated to this pone. I should have stayed with my old phone. It drops calls and loses the signal all the time even if i am standing in the same spot.
Ive owned the Nokia n95 and n97, but this phone is definitely my favorite out of the three.  The camera takes amazing pictures while the overall feel of the phone screams quality.  The phone is extremely responsive even with several applications open.  The features are very plentiful and even though this phone is not a touch screen I would pick it hands down over the n97.
I love it.  The screen is great (OLED beats LCD hands down), the CPU is actually fast enough for S60 to feel snappy, and the camera is fantastic.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it's missing a few obvious improvements: image stabilization, a better browser, and a better email client.The Nokia browser is pretty good, but it doesn't have the sensible reflow abilities of Opera Mobile (which resize the main column of an article to fit my screen, so I don't have to scroll horizontally).  On the other hand, Opera Mobile's form input can't use predictive text unless you tell it to pop up a separate dialog, which gets kind of tiresome when I want to type in comments.  It also doesn't have the ability to send pages by email or MMS.The email client is the worst part: it doesn't work for me at all.  It can't log in to either of my IMAP-over-SSL accounts--worse, it doesn't tell me why not; it just tells me, "Unable to log in.  Try again.".  Since the client on my N75 could handle both these accounts, this is clearly a downgrade.One concrete problem: the N-Gage system comes with an activation code for one free game, but entering the code as written keeps giving an "Invalid code" error.  Googling found the answer: the first character of the code is a zero, not the letter O.  (This is particularly exasperating because *all* the other characters are letters.) Also, you might have to omit the spaces--either that, or I had a typo the first time I tried.Mostly, though, I'm extremely satisfied.  The Ovi Store is a huge improvement over Googling for Symbian apps; being able to write apps for my phone in HTML+JavaScript is really nice; and HSPA is an order of magnitude faster than UMTS.
I bought this phone here in the Middle East and all i can say is WOW. This definitely exceeds my expectation. I was choosing between an Iphone 3G, Blackberry Bold, Nokia N97 and the new Jet. All features of the 3 competitors have distinct features which are all included in the new Samsung Jet. The price is being offered is not cheap and not to expensive too. Great and photos being taken even at night time. Have a bright flash and hd quality sounds and video.See technical specs for more details.Wi-fiBluetooth5MP Camera (dual)800Mhz ProcessorEdge, HDSPA, GPRS3.1 WVGA AMOLED displayMPEG 4 & Divx video (no need to convert2GB built in (till 16GB micro SD)Music PlayerFM RadioGreat GamesThickness is same as the Ipod Touch 2nd Gensmaller than IphoneExchange ServerEmailMMSVideo call[...]EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN A PHONE IS HERE !!!
My verizon wireless contract expired in april of 2009 so I have been searching all over the web for a new phone. I've been wanting to try a touch screen phone for the longest time. I was tempted to buy the iphone several times but the iphone always seemed so overrated for me. I also almost bought the Samsung Memoir from tmobile but I did not like how thick it was. So, I waited a couple more months to see if any of the companies would release more touchscreen phones that would meet my wants and needs. Finally I found the Samsung Jet.I decided to go with an unlocked phone because I do not want to be contracted into a mandatory 30 dollars a month data plan for 2 years. If I got a decent plan (around 50 bucks a month) plus the 30 dollar data plan, it would cost me around 2000 bucks(720for data plan and 1200regular bill) in 2 years just on cell phone bills!!! I do not live in an area that requires me to occupy/entertain myself while I'm out and about. I'm either at home or work, which has computers, driving or out with friends. None of my daily activities require me to surf the internet on my cell phone. Thats what computers are for!Anywho, I bought this phone from a reputable dealer that I found online. I called them to make sure that the phone would work in the US with a sim card from AT&T; or TMOBILE.I've had this phone for about a week now and everything is working great. The amoled screen is amazingly bright and clear. The haptic feedback feature is amazing too. Every time I use my screen, it vibrates back meaning that its recognizing my touch. Great simple applications in the phone also. Speakers work great, the FM radio works great, sound quality is great, the Photos are great and also has a good video recording function.This is NOT A SMART PHONE, but anybody who wants a touchscreen phone with all the great functions and qualities like me will love and enjoy the Samsung Jet.
Overall, this phone is quite responsive and pocketable. The interface reacts quickly despite being a resistive type touch screen. Also is a great video and mp3 player. However, on the software side it falls short. The pc software does not recognize the phone when you try to back it up, and the firmware cannot be updated as well-also, when you watch a video and turn the phone to its side for landscape viewing it is okay, but when turn it to its other landscape side the video is displayed upside down. I found that the browser also has trouble rendering some popular websites correctly. Finally, the phone can only record video and voice using the amr codec which results in very disappointing low quality sound recordings. Worldwide, this phone sells for about 450-500usd as of 7/09.
The phone looks and feels romantic. It's ok for an xpress music. The sound quality is good too. The picture quality is manageable compared to the price.Pros:-Good and unique feel-good sound quality-good price-scratch resistant skinCons:-not good for watching 3GP videos-not 3G phone-plastic and fragile music buttons on the side instead of where other xpress phone buttons are...as in, near the screen. The music buttons are on the side n u need to turn the phone to its side to access themAside these, it's a sweet phone and perfect for a romantic gift to a deserving girl!
Being a former blackberry owner, I was looking for something a bit different. I came across this phone and loved it. Well, two months later I still like it but I am definitely buying me another blackberry. The biggest reasons are that this phone does dial numbers while in the pocket(unlike the iphone where you slide the bar to unlock, there is only a button to push and if you push it twice it will automatically dial last number called or received), it is definitely not a music player because the search function sucks, and it takes awhile to read the memory card. All in all if you are not using it for multimedia and you like to carry your phone on your waist this phone would be perfect!
I bought one of these for a Spanish speaking friend and it came with English and a few obscure Asian language interfaces so I could not give the gift because she can not read English. You would think any S5233 international version should have Spanish as an option
I've had this Motorola Trac Fone for about 6 months and have been very pleased. It has excellent reception and sound quality.  The built in speaker phone is also very good. The camera is just so-so, but that's not why I bought the phone.I like buying my minutes only as I need them and you just have to purchase more within 90 days.  When you purchase more, it just adds them to your current balance. If you don't purchase within the 90 day limit (a countdown is always visible on the screen) the phone shuts off and you lose whatever minutes you had.  You can reactivate just by purchasing more minutes but you don't regain any you lost by not purchasing within the 90 day limit. You can purchase minutes on line at Tracfone or set up your phone to purchase.  Your minute balance is also always on the screen. Mine came with 15 minutes to get me started. You can activate at the Tracfone web site and set up an account to buy more minutes. You can also call from the phone to activate and set up an account to purchase minutes that way.Good things:-Inexpensive to purchase (less than $30)-Reasonable rates. I'm paying about 10 cents per minute-Automatically doubles minutes for life of phone (buy 60 get 120)-If you lose it, buy another, call Tracfone operator to transfer your number and minutes-Bright clear screen-Good sound quality-Good reception-Good number of ring tones and images to select from-AC Charger is included-FM radio included (earphone not included and it takes a micro plug, not a mini)-Basic games included-Internet access (but slow)-Periodic email offers from Tracfone for discounted minutes (which double)-Monthly plans if you want them-Good battery life (I do not use the phone often so 1 charge will last several days)-Minutes never expire as long as you renew within 90 days-No contracts or agreements. Tired of it?  Toss it.-Sim chip, you can move to another phone and keep your address book-Settings for indoor/outdoor ringBad things:-No holster/case (buy one at Target)-Somewhat larger in size and a little heavier than most cells-Ring tones downloaded only from Tracfone site-Cannot connect to PC/laptop (port is only for charging)-Buttons take some getting used to, like the menus-You pay for everything, no free or unlimited (3 text messages = 1 minute)-You will receive free advertising from Tracfone but occasional advertising from others, if you accept the message, you get charged for it. (charge is about 1 text message)-Charging port and earphone port (opposite sides of the phone) are difficult to open. I can't quite get my fingernail under it so I have to use a small pen knifeI'm very pleased with the phone and service.  I dropped my other service and have been happy not to be billed every month for minutes I didn't use.  I'm not a strong user of cell phones so it fits my life style. I have service wherever I travel, including remote areas. Your carrier will depend on your part of the country.  We have AT&T; here.I may buy another for my wife who doesn't like cell phones but I'll feel better knowing she can call if she needs to. I can buy 60 minutes (120) for $20 and she's good for 90 days. When it gets close I'll just order the minimum again.
I had this phone in my swimming suit pocket and jumped into a pool, swam rigorously for several minutes before I realized what a bonehead I was. Getting dunked is one thing, but subjecting it to this kind of treatment, I thought for sure it was a goner. I let it dry for several days, but then it wouldn't turn on. I plugged it in to charge it, and it still didn't work. However, when I swapped the battery out with my wife's (who has same phone), it worked perfectly. It was the battery that got fried, not the phone. I just ordered a new BQ50 battery for $10, and I will be back in business. BTW - tracfone is great. My family of 4 saves over $100 per month from what we had with verizon.
I have this phone and cannot say enough nice things about its audio and graphics - SHARP!  The wife has another name brand phone which was more expensive - no contest!  I rated this phone 4 stars instead of 5 for one reason only - its keyboard is kinda' funky.  It's one of those one piece plastic deals with the numbers separated by dividers rather than a physical space. For normal everyday phoning you'd have to work to beat this one.  TracPhone is the way to go, folks!  I was with Verizon ($70/mo) and I now spend less than $20/mo and have more features and matching coverage.
I have owned this phone for a year and a half. It is a very good phone. I have dropped it many times, it is durable.Nice looking as well. I have an 'issue' with texting and having to do upper case manipulations which is necessary. Needs to be charged every day. Decent sound though I tend to like using the speaker. The keys are a bit small..overall a good phone/PDA>
This is a nice phone. If it had wifi I'd give it 5 stars.The camera is nice too.
I am a beginning runner who lives in the country. For safety, I always carry my cellphone and identification when I run, and I bought this holder to circumvent the fact that most running shorts don't have pockets.This cellphone holder is sturdy and well-constructed, but flexible enough to allow me to slide my ID/health information cards behind the phone. The band, which fits easily around the arm or lower leg, is slightly stretchy for comfort. I prefer to wear this holder around my ankle, where it seems least likely to interfere with normal circulation.While I haven't experienced this, I suppose it's possible that the heavier stitching on the back of the case may cause chafing if the holder is worn over exposed skin, although I'm inclined to doubt that this would be a problem.In conclusion, this is an excellent product for a fair price. It would be useful not only for runners, but for anyone who'd like the hold their cellphone, ID, and maybe a house key without pockets. (This product was, in fact, originally designed for horseback riders.) I am highly satisfied with this product, and would not hesitate to recommend it.
I love to go horseback riding out on the trail, and I always carry a cellphone in case of emergency. This cellphone holder can be worn on the arm or leg for secure, quick and easy access. The item description doesn't mention the adjustable velcro band is also elasticized to help keep it in place. I have worn the holder on my arm, over a slippery nylon jacket, and the holder didn't slide around as might be expected. I purchased the holder in yellow; it's a bright, bumblebee yellow, with black trim, not the soft, buttery yellow shown in the picture. Not a complaint, since it could be just the way my monitor shows it. Whatever color you might choose, I think you will find this cellphone holder a helpful item. Highly recommended!
I received 2 of these today and I first thought they were going to be too small for my Blackberry Curve 8310. However, the entire case is made of a quite stretchy but sturdy material and it expanded enough to fit my phone. The quality of the case is quite good and will not easily rip apart. As the other reviewer mentioned, the strap is elasticised and adjustable and long enough to fit around your leg but can still fit securely around your arm without having any excess stick out. It's perfect for keeping your phone on you regardless of what you're doing.
I did not purchase my Samsung T101G tracfone on Amazon but at the local Dollar General store.  It came with a packaged deal which included a belt clip carry case, phone car charger cord, ear phone piece and the free unlimited double minute plan.  All that for $10 (which is dam good considering if all these items were purchased separately would come to $65 total).  At that price I could not pass it up.  That being said, I am a first time user of cell phones and the Samsung T101G is what I am beginning with.  It is a great phone for first time ever cell phone users and is perfect for those who want a simple cell phone without all the fancy bells and whistles of the more expensive models.  I was looking for a phone to have for emergency purposes and for general contact with the outside world when I traveled and this particular model phone is perfected for that.  Reception has been decent in most areas and I have had no problems so far with making and receiving calls.  The phone has many other features like web browsing and text messaging with which I am still experimenting with, so I can't give you an honest review yet on those features.  But if your looking for a simple, inexpensive cell phone that does what a phone should do (make and receive calls) without all the fancy bells and whistles, the Samsung T101G is a excellent choice.
The product is ok, I did not have any issues on it other than the battery does not last more than 1 or 2 days, but the phones are refurbished even though it did not state that on the product description.
I haven't had this phone very long, but so far, I absolutely love it.  I ordered it as "unlocked" because it is a "T-Mobile" phone, but it works perfectly with my AT&T; network.  I opted for this phone because I wear dual hearing aids and use a streamer for blue tooth connectivity; this phone offers stereo blue tooth capability, with music, so I'm able to listen to my music wirelessly.  It's great!
Received this phone from JR and it came without a box and it was not working. I am still waiting for an exchange or refund after 1 MONTH. What a service!!!!
I will want express my disappointment over JR electronics that I bought from. They just sent aa phone with out the manual. Instead I was given a wrong manual. the accessories as listed are not in the package delivered. Please kindly send the manual to the address or I will return the phone
I was quite satisfied with the phone. It worked well for a couple of hours.when I tried to make a call later the keypad refused to work! No buttons was working. This had put me in a terrible position because I was in so much inconvenience! I was very disappointed in the phone and also the company that sold the item.
I bought from the OEM for Cheap Store in Amazon a Blackberry 8310 GSM-unlocked cell phone. Before buying it the store confirmed me in written (email) that the phone was new (not refurbished) and unlocked and would come with all the items showed in the picture. The headsets never arrived with the unit although it arrived on time as promised to my residence in the US. This phone was to be used by my wife overseas.When she went to the local phone company we discovered that the phone was not new but used and probably refurbished and that the phone was assigned to a person in a service provider named Centennial (US) with an user name they provided and an unknown password and therefore no email service was possible with this phone.After several email correspondences, at last I got an answer apologizing indicating that their technical personnel would fix the problem in a couple of days and they could do it from the US without returning the phone. After that, it was not possible to make further contacts with them by email, always an automatic response and once a response indicating to call to a telephone that was never answered (two trials in different days). The problem was never solved.No doubt that this was a scam done through Amazon. I never had a previous problem with Amazon and always got what was promised but now I am suspicious of the type of merchants they are currently dealing with.Otherwise, until now this "new" product is operating OK as a cell phone but you don't need a Blackberry for this. I recommend people to keep far away from this OEM for Cheat Store.
I bought this phone for use in Venezuela and only after 15 days of use it stopped to work. I sent it to a repair center and they inform the software was borned and it can not be repaired.I  lost my money...
I bought this item and I brought it to Venezuela. The Blackberry as a whole is unlocked but the blackberry's pin is still attached to T-mobile, so it's locked and I can't use it until I unlock the pin. My operator's company told I need to comunicate with T-mobile so they can unlock it, but I don't know how to do it! If you know any way to help me i would appriciate it!
i wanted a blackberry new and unlocked, as they offered. it came used and locked. i returned it and the second one the sent didn't even turn on. so i returned back. and asked for my money back. so i could buy a phone from a serious store.
WOW! THIS PHONE HAS ALL THE FEATURES THAT YOU NEED AND IT'S UNLOCKED. I BOUGHT IT TO USE IN VENEZUELA. IT WORKS PERFECTLY WITH ALL THE FEATURESCAMERAEMAILBROWSERVOICE DIALINGBLACKBERRY MESSANGERMEMORY CARDS SLOTVIDEO PLAYERVERY EASY TO USE. GREAT QUALITY. I AM VERY HAPPY
This product is not really ready for release: the phone shuts off without warning. I've had the device for two weeks, and it has shut down ten or more times. The software appears to still be in the beta stage. This is intolerable for a business phone. Moreover, the device was shipped with an installed memory card that contained a number of applications and 4 of the 6 installed themes. What manufacturer installs themes and applications on the memory card? This is just careless and sloppy. Additionally, the battery is so tightly placed that one can't remove it with a fingernail. One has to tap it hard upon the palm the get it out. Things like this just show that this is not yet a properly developed business phone.UPDATE: May 15, 2012:Shortly after the review given above, I shoved this phone into a drawer and moved on. Periodically, however, I would remove it, update the software that Nokia continued to provide, find that the phone was still unstable, then put it back into the drawer. About six month ago I took it out and found that there was another update: amazing, since this phone came out around mid 2009. After that update, the phone finally became stable, and I started to use it. A few days ago, another update came (Version 091.033.c00.01). My God, Nokia is still updating after almost three years. I now use the phone as one of my daily devices (the other is the inimitable N9). The E52 is fantastic. Granted, it is not for avid video watching: the screen is small. However, it is fast, has free navigation with text-to-speech voice navigation, voip support, Skype from Nokia Store, Gravity, et al. I notice that it is now only available as a used device. Too bad. It took Nokia more than two years to finally get it right - perhaps that is why they have struggled of late, yet if you need a solid, small, light-weight business phone, get this device!
I am a late adapter when it comes to cell phones. So refrained from Iphones and vu/touch phones as one was mostly tied to a provider data plan or had to pay a premium for the phone itself.If you dont care about 3g (read data plan 29.99 a month) or GPS there cannot be a better phone at this price range. Solidly built, some reviews complained about back cover. I do see an issue there as it get on the phone with little notches on all sides. But how may times you open that. Specially when SIM/SDHC is accessible from outside. The only time you need to open the back cover is when you install a battery.What I love about this phone in order of preference.Form Factor (It looks like a phone and not a PDA)Not tied to a provider or unlocked so you dont have to be geeky searching for unlocking/jail breaking articles.Wifi 54G (email is good on the run)Quad Band GSM World PhoneMedia/Music playback is excellent.Can go upto 16GB Micro SDHC (plenty of music or videos) comes with 4Gig.Speaker phone and in general call quality for me increasd 3-5 times. (I used Razr before).Clear brilliant screenTouch pad responsive enoughPicture quality @3.2MP is good in daylight and flash comes in handy for pictures in lowlight (subject @2-4 ft).What I will look for in future revisions.USB Charging capabilityA little thinner (Not that is fat right now) but it would make it sweeter.Total Alloy body including back cover for a more solid feel.Maybe a more rugged look/feel (non piano black or non shiny finish for e.g Zune kind of finish or finish with more friction), I always get a feeling I am going to drop it.
After carefully reading reviews on similar unlocked phones like the Cookie and even higher end Nokia models like the N97, I ultimately decided to go with the 5530 Xpressmusic. I was definitely in need of a new phone as I had basically a dinosaur for a cell phone. I wanted a few things from my new phone which were:1. a modern, sleek touchscreen design2. an unlocked phone compatible with my SIM3. a phone that works when it should and is easy to learn to useThe Nokia 5530 xpressmusic was all of this and so much more. I find it to be very functional - I have not had a dropped call or any problems with the interface itself. The touchscreen is very easy and fun to use. Once you get used to it, you will be able to navigate the phone very easily. I find the screen to be very responsive, although sometimes I do like to use the stylus. However, I must say it is important to follow the user guide - I have done that and the phone has been so much fun! It does not have GPS or 3G compatibility - however, I was not looking for these things. I can live with 2G and actually a recent firmware update has made the phone run even faster, even online. It comes with a 4GB memory card which can be upgraded to 16GB - so plenty of room to store things. The absolute best part of this phone, as the name suggests, is the music player. The quality of the sound is absolutely incredible and the phone was designed for music lovers in mind. In fact, one of pre-loaded videos even refers to the device as a "music player that is also a phone!". Music on this phone sounds better than many higher end models that my friends have. They are quite jealous! A set of headphones also come with the phone that I have found to be of average/slightly above average quality. The camera and video are also pretty impressive, not amazing, but still pretty good quality for this phone.The only reason I knocked a star off is the battery. Battery life seems to get depleted quickly , sometimes way too quickly, so the phone must be charged each night or you risk having a dead battery by noon the next day. I have tried all of the optimization tricks to get more life out of the battery and still it is rather short.So if you are looking for an affordable alternative touchscreen phone with some interesting features and easy interface, this phone has been a joy and is the way to go. An iphone killer? I wouldn't go that far at all, but with many similar features and similar touchscreen feel, it is a great choice for anyone who doesn't want to pay $400 for a phone.
Been playing with the phone for several days and I absolutely love it for the $199 I paid.  Of the features I was interested in, here are my opinions on them:0) very easy to setup this unlocked phone -- I took a SIM card from a Tmobile prepaid phone and inserted into this nokia and it self-configured everything for me (a relief for me as this was my first time buying an unlocked phone).  Now that I know the cell coverage is good in my brick-walled condo, I'll swap this SIM card for a cheap $30 Tmobile monthly plan SIM card, and fully expect this to be a quick swap1) perfect size -- fits in a shirt or pants pocket easily, is lightweight, and easy enough for my stubby fingers to hold and operate.  hard to operate this with gloves on though (e.g., on a ski slope)2) music player and FM player are *very high* fidelity, especially compared to other players out there.  A couple of caveats though -- the earphones that come with it are only average for sound quality, and I get much higher fidelity sound using my other set of compact Sony headphones.  Also, from what I can tell, the FM radio only works with headphones on -- you can't use the built-in speakers for radio.  The built-in speakers are a lot better in fidelity than other phones/players I've tried, but obviously this device is too small to accurately replicate bass using its built-in speakers.  Bass is fine with good headphones though.3) WLAN capability is fantastic.  With free WLAN everywhere, it's by far the cheapest way to access the net through the phone without a data plan (recall I'm doing this with a prepaid SIM card).  Note that the phone supports 2G (and not 3G), but with WLAN being much quicker downloads (e.g., 2-3 sec delay to start playing youtube videos) and usually free, I'm not interested in 3G.  video quality was surprisingly good for such a small device.  Reading email on yahoo was pretty easy, but required a few too many clicks too navigate within yahoo -- I wouldn't want to go through 40 email with this, but it's fine to scan my daily email and reply to just a few email.  I had been planning on buying a nettop and WLAN scanner as well, but this phone already does both of those functions well enough for me so I won't be buying either anymore.4) instruction guide that came with it could really use some work.  if you're new to Nokia (like me), it was tougher to figure out than other cell phones I've used (sony ericsson, motorola, and panasonic).  the back cover is annoyingly badly designed as others have remarked, and the instructions were nearly useless for getting that cover off and back on again.  i'll probably seek out google searches for this device before i use the instruction guide in the future.5) comes with 4G memory card, but the slot is in a bit of an odd place.  my other phones usually kept it in the back with the SIM card and battery, but this places it in the side.  it's really an odd design, but since I don't plan to swap memory cards all too often, not a huge issue for me.6) battery life is average.  my previous sony ericsson gave me a 10 hour talk time, and this phone probably gives about half that, and even less if you go crazy with WLAN, etc.  so i'll probably end up buying a second charger so I can keep one at work and home (I listen to music all day at work with it)7) phone lacks AM radio and GPS.  sports broadcasts are often on AM -- would have liked if they added that in.  GPS would have been nice, but alas, all these things would have probably raised the price toooverall, i'm really happy with this phone given its price -- it gives me all the features I really need without forcing me in to expensive cell phone data plans with the wireless companies.  its music player capabilities beat out even the $400 phones/players, and if you're willing to live without a few features, this is a great phone for the price -- plus you won't feel as bad if you damage it
This cellphone is just great...the cheapest nokia smartphone ever, lot of applications, love the touchscreen, love it!!
Since i have been using it, it has a software failure which locks its display (keyboard) and it is impossible to make it run. I already tried to update the software and to hard reset it, and it doesn't work yet.I don't recommend to buy this cell phone ever.I'm very dissapointed with nokia.
Excellent phone from nokia.Please dont compare with iphone. Some apps work well from the ovi store.Wi-fi works well, Youtube app comes loaded in the phone.Hangs up ocassionally. Battery life of 2 days with average usage. Headphones are nice, could have been better.Touch screen works well. The green key on the bottom left hand side, is less sensitive, needs to be pressed hard sometimes.
it is very good for my budget and also very flexible with wi-fi.. i recommend to others..easy to take photos with 3 MP...
I have been using this phone for over a month now.  Overall, it works great but it has reset itself 3 times.  Fortunately, none of my information was lost after the reset.
The product was great. The package had all the necessary contents and the delivery was quick! I'm satisfied BUT, there was something that i didn't like at all. The package was damaged! And i don't mean that it was corrupted, the colour of the nokia package was at some places off. I gave it for present and it didn't look good at all.... The price was low compared to other online stores but if the quality is not good then i will consider twice to buy phone from here.......
At first I opened the box and was dismayed at how small the screen was.  I previously had an LG EnV touch, which had a 3.0 inch screen but was drastically larger than the 2.9 inch screen of the 5530 XM.  What can I say, I like big screens.  But once you get used to it, u realize a small screen can be an advantage when you only have one hand available.  It is highly customizable, the screen is vibrant and rich, camera is great for a phone, the wifi is easy to configure and connect.  Music on this phone is simply AMAZING.  The words are so crisp and clear I have now made it my primary music listening device over my ipod, seriously.  The phone aspect of this phone is 4/5. I feel the antenna is not as powerful, as there is a no service bar constantly when I am in the university library.  But I do not know 100% if this due to my carrier or the.  Anyway, best deal around for an unlocked phone under $200.
The Nokia 5530 XpressMusic phone is absolutely beautiful when you have it in front of you. I bought this phone for my fiancee and I had the urge to keep it! The phone is not one for the super tech-savvy individuals so I don't know what the purpose is of comparing it to the high-end, high-tech phones. What you have with this XpressMusic phone is looks + what I consider the new-basics of cellular use. The "new-basics" include: Great Call-clarity, Music-playing capabilities, excellent sounding speakerphone, memory card storage, a vibrant touch-screen, sturdy phone casing, and smartphone enhanced features like social networking, etc.If you are looking for a phone that will provide you with a lot of features, at a moderate price, with beautiful looks, then this is the ONE!
I kept the phone about 20 days - but ultimately decided to send it back.1) The Symbian OS - it's dead, Nokia is switching to Maemo Linux and I fear that does not bode well for future app development, as it is - the selection of quality applications for SymbianS60v5Touch is pretty thin (though most of the basics are there)2) Buggy OS - would frequently get "unknown error" when trying to use the camera - I don't want to reboot my phone and wait 2 minutes+ to take a picture - this is likely to be addressed in a hopefully forthcoming OS update but I don't want to take that gamble3) Most of the OS is touch optimized, but like Windows Mobile (and perhaps exacerbated by my fat fingers and the phone's small screen size - sometimes you just MUST use the stylus.4) I HATE where the stylus is - I'm right handed - I hold the phone in my left. To get to the stylus I had to hold it in my right hand, pull part of the case off and work the stylus out from the phones lower left corner with my fingernail. The stylus doesn't "auto home" it's flatish not round, so unlike a palm, it won't rotate into place as you push it in - it needs to be oriented correctly then pushed in.5) the case back feels cheap, flimsy and prone to breakage - it's not a big deal - but is potentially an indicator that corners were cut in the industrial design - the phone was built to a price. If you keep it in a skin case - you'll never notice. Without a case - it creaks like cheap plastic when you grip the phone.6) the touchscreen is better than what was average a few years back - but it's still a resistive touchscreen - once you use a capacitive touchscreen, you'll realize how much resistive sucks as a technology. Often launched someones info card when trying to swipe across carousel.7) General OS weirdness - some installed apps cannot be removed to save space. The more you load onto main memory - even if the applications aren't running - the more the phone slows down, it went from feeling new and lithe to old an bloated within a week. As I deleted apps to prep it for sending back, it got more and more responsive again8) Leaves all your personal data on it when you "reset to factory configuration" Bad Form Nokia. Bad Form!9) USB charging - See "designed to a price" above - I hate that it came with a fiddly hard plastic latch over the USB port and with only a 4" sync cable - but most of all that it won't charge over USB - in fact it drains power when hooked up to the USB but not the charger - so much so that it will be dead if you leave it hooked up overnight.10) Fiddly media player - sometimes you rip a movie and it plays - sometimes not with the exact same settings - too unpredictable11) Motion sensors are brain dead - you tilt your hand a bit and the screen rotates for no apparent reason.12) Nokia's OVI store - I won't get into specifics - but it sucks.My criticisms seem petty, I know. But it's the little things day in and day out that will eventually get on your nerves.Plusses:1) Fast USB2 implementation - songs and videos load really quick from computer2) surprisingly good headphones3) surprisingly good music player for a non iPod/Phone4) small - reasonably sturdy build construction5) Wi-Fi - though the implementation for selecting a base station is kinda suckky6) Camera is decent and the LED Flash is a nice touch[...] it's actually a pretty solid deal compared to the crap replacement phones T-Mobile and AT&T; will offer you if/when your's breaks. It has a lot of flaws that eventually rendered it a no-go for me, but it might well suit your purposes if you can live with those flaws.
Bought this phone locally. Physically, it appears to be nice; right size, great features, etc, and looks good on paper...for the price. After a day, it froze on me while I was listening to an audio file. I had to remove/insert the battery to get it back up. Next day, froze again while I was in the middle of a phone call, and phone did not respond on any key I press. Again, removed and re-inserted battery. Next day, froze while I was playing a video file. Same solution...remove/reinsert battery.I thought I bought a lemon, so went back to the store for an exchange. After 2 days, froze again while I was tinkering in the menu. And it routinely froze on me for the next 3 days.Looked at discussion forums, and found that this "freezing" thing is an inherent design problem of the phone. At least, I was not alone. Decided to take it back for a refund.I suggest you spend your money wisely, and buy other brand/model phones...BUT NEVER BUY THIS PHONE. This is a Nokia half-baked product, and you're lucky if you get a fix from them within 6 months.My 2 cents. If, after reading this, you still decide to get this phone, Good Luck.
I bought it during the thinksgiving, I expected that it is a great phone.But I felt disapponited.Even though it plays music very well and FM is clear, but it is not a good smart phone. There are some issues: the battery is really very fast to run out;the screen is easy to freeze and you have to open the back cover to reset the battery; the battery is too small to fit the phone, you can feel that battery shaking when you shake the phone. What can I do is that I insert a piece of paper inside to resolve this problem. Finally, under sunlight, the screen is not visible. Mang Cons here, I am asking me, " should I return it?"
Had it for 2 days and had to return it back. The phone is a total disaster - it restarts once or twice a day. Sometimes it even powers down on its own. Home screen buttons lock up for no reason and phone freezes up. Sometimes even restart would help... To make the things worse, it was a birthday present for my wife. Shame on you Nokia!!!
I somewhat researched this phone and overall it had mixed reviews.  However I had read many that said the phone's software had alot of problems, but I decided to give it a try anyways. It was fairly easy to use and I loved all the features it came with. The wifi was also very good and i enjoyed the fm radio and the headphones it came with.  Email setup was also really easy.  Unfortunately I soon found out that the software problems talked about on the discussions were not limited to a few phones as i'd hoped.Some things that bothered me were relatively insignificant like finding no way of adding my contacts from my sim card to the contacts bar unless i created a new contact, the build of the phone seemed a bit cheap, and the qwerty keyboard i found to be a bit too small for me even though i have skinny fingers.  Call quality was also not so great.  But what made it a dealbreaker for me was the several crashes, self reboots, and screen freezes it had...and that was only a week of fairly moderate to light usage.  At first i thought this might be due to a type of information overload thing as in maybe it only crashed while surfing the net or listening to music but not even, it crashed and restarted when i was doing something so basic as writing a text.  Specifically, going through Nokias Ovi store had a maximum of maybe 5 minutes if i was lucky, since it always crashed not too long after i entered the site. Not only did it crash and reboot several times, but the software was also really bug-y, for example when i went through my texts one by one the bar on the bottom would flicker every time i switched to the next, and the home screen would sometimes go a little nuts and have black lines or the name of the app i just exited floating in the middle? Probably more annoying than anything was the game of peekaboo i played every time a message notification popped up...since it popped up, then hid, then popped up again, then hid...it was only after a few of these that i could actually be able to hit the message notification and read my message. The phone sometimes lagged quite a bit, specifically the accelerometer when switching from portrait to landscape modes and the three keys on the bottom (call, home, end) had to be pressed especially hard.I decided to go into the Nokia discussion boards to possibly find a solution to the phones not so great software.  What i found was an overwhelming number of people with the same problems (crashes, freezes, restarting), who have been waiting for a software update that would fix the bugs on the phone since it was released...and that was around 6+ months ago...after reading this i decided i was definitely not going to be a sitting duck and wait for Nokia to maybe decide to fix what someone described as a "half-baked" product and i agree. I am not a tech-y person at all, in fact this was my first 'smartphone' and my first time using a touchscreen and it was so disappointing.  If i'm paying money for something i expect it to work properly and not have to deal with something that was sloppily put together. I only had it for a week...i cant imagine it lasting more than a month.  Im currently awaiting on my refund.In conclusion, it really is sad because had the phone been properly manufactured or the bugs been fixed, it would've been an awesome phone.UPDATE 1/17/10:i got my refund promptly and i then ordered the Nokia e63...in my opinion its been everything the 5530 could have been had it been fixed minus the touchscreen...have had it for a few weeks now and its been great...would definitely recommend the e63 to anyone who was as disappointed with the 5530 as i was.
Let me start out by saying that despite the problems with the phone, I do not plan on returning it.  I think that the pros, including the price, outweigh the problems.Pros (for me):NO data plan required!  I really wanted a new touchscreen phone with smartphone capabilities, but everybody REQUIRES you to add one of their $25-$30 data plans on top of your calling plan.  I could not justify paying $300+ a year just to surf the net on my phone.  My $5.99 Tzones package works just fine for checking my email and getting on the internet when I absolutely need to (because it is pretty slow).Touchscreen.  It has one.  That's about all I can say because I don't care for it too much (looks great but don't like the feel of it).WIFI.  Great being able to access the internet from WIFI connections at home, work, and some restaurants.Loud Ringer, vivid screen, sounds good, able to watch movies and listen to music.Price - It was only $[...] after the current rebate ($[...]).  Couldn't find anything that comes close for that price with the features this has (without signing a contract)CONS:Feels kind of cheap (thinner plastic, loose back cover or battery moving around inside).The touchscreen is soft and nowhere near as responsive as my Itouch.It drops my Bluetooth calls after a few minutes.  Not sure what this is all about but it is becoming a BIG problem, especially with work calls.  Hopefully there will be a firmware update out soon for the phone or my handsfree device!Like I said, overall I am pleased and will keep the phone, at least until the data plans on the Iphones come down some.
everything went very well after i have used for 1 day and then sth. wrong was happened that on the screen was freeze, i couldnt do anything, i had to take the battery off that i thought it would be help but it was not at all.this made me so unhappy. i contacted amazon and they replaced a new one for me.before i placed the order this item, i have asked so many friends that they are expert about cell phone.they said nokia 5530 is pretty good if we compare w/ nokia 5800, they confirmed that 5530 is better, so i made a decision to get 5530 but after i received the 2nd replacement. there was sth. happened again. everything was stop, only light shew on but could not do anything. i did the same thing to take the battery off. this time was help.i thought there is sth.wrong, then i contacted amazon to resend 5530 but they won't.it was so sad because i really like this item.
Excellent product , feel really good when I am using it.Smart touch phone. Really good for music lovers..Easy to download everything like music, video, photo & all.Looks great & Easy to use.Its really good that I got most of the material free, like data cable, headphone, memory card (4GB).Found minor problem, as back cover is not good enough to fix properly, most of the time sim card ask to send msg (having bug in the software), Sometimes Sim card not be able to read the contact number & hence not be able to display the contact detail on the phone screen.Very light & delicate body case. Front screen is too soft to touch, its not like i-phone who has hard body in front & back too.Very Short Data Cable..keep my cell phone very much near or on the laptop to connect it.
I love this phone! I was going for the 5800 however, I didn't see the need for all of those features that I'm not going to use. So This phone is great value for the money and it's Nokia, it will last!
I already bought this product for since last week. I cannot tell everything about this phone right now because at this time, the phone still in the post office place. I don't know why Amazon choose USPS for carrying that shipping. 5 days for Amazon to fullfill the shipment, then 3-4 days for shipping to my house. That is so ridiculous. Tracking is also bad at always, go to USPS and it didn't show anything, go to Amazon and it said Arrival some where I don't know. Hopefully tomorrow I can get that phone and post another review.
I gave it a four because when I first got it, it took me time to see and get used to the keys because they are kind-of small. If you want bigger buttons get 8330, my sister has one, wish I could switch with hers, but mine is newer and no tracking ball, which I really like to.. about this phone. Its sleek and easy to navigate..Before I had this one I had the 8120, ah--big difference the charge on 8520 last longer and takes a little time to charge up, but its worth it. Also, the keys I wished lighted up a bit brighter, BUT like I said once you have it after a few days you get used to it. My one problem with as I am thinking off the top of my head ..is there are not enough apps to go with or themes made for this model.I am a geek for that, but as of now I have been able to download a few off my blackberry 8120 to my 8520.Also, checking around i was able to get a few more themes, that are just awesome. The 2gb memory card that comes with it I took out and put in my 4gb from my 8120 in it. I read somewhere it can go to 16gb and pretty soon it will go 34gb...its in the works now.I will say the quality in web browsing is GREAT and I have had no problems with dropped calls, lost signal, or getting frustrated with where are the keys for texting; all the numbers are on the left side..feels weird but after a day or so, it works better than my other blkberry which was the 8120.Also there's a dictionary to while your texting, a firewall..it is just way better than I expected. If I go all over, I apologize, I am giving you want I can tell you about this product as I'm writing I'm having a flashback...lol.Now if your a geek like me with apps, there aren't that many games for this Rim..I am waiting for new apps to become more available for my phone for some reason, 8320 has the most..kind-of peeves me at times, wen I am looking around as to adding to my phone but..this phone is pretty easy compared to my 8120. If you want to know anything else, ask..I will answer.
Very good cell phone. It is a real Unlocked International Version, I recommend it. It should be a way to have a warranty or may be we cuold have a certification that this product have been tested and it works OK. The resolution of the screen is excelent.It is not too expensive and is easy to handle.
Great Buy! all expected was sucessful, delivery shipping, customer service quality, new box, all accesories. The phone works Excelent! battery, software, everything...even when is used in other country (Venezuela), remember is UNLOCKED! Go ahead and enjoy your experience in new generation Blackberry trakpad and OS UPDATED!
This phone seems to be a "Lite" version of a BlackBerry, if you can call it that.  It lacks some of the power that other BlackBerries have - namely, it couldn't work with my job's BES server.  Which is not good.  But in terms of being able to surf the web, and text, and all that good stuff - it's a pretty good phone.This happens to be the first BlackBerry to get the new trackpad, which, I must say, is an excellent replacement for the trackball.  I like its sensitivity - if you don't, you can change it in the General Settings of the phone.I would probably recommend this phone for people who are new to the BlackBerry world - it's a good way to get used to the BlackBerry interface, and develop skills on the platform before getting to the A++ BlackBerry phones (read: Bold and Bold 2, as well as the Storm 2).
I bought this phone for my mother and girlfriend and i can say for sure that is a great device, easy to use, great display, great keyboard and the track pad what can i say, just smooth, i don't know about the durability of the track pad but it seems that is going to last longer that the track ball. i would recommend this phone for starters in this world of smart-phones, it very easy to use and to understand the phone.
its cheaper than the Javelin, and the camera is not great, but replacing the trackball with a mousepad was a terrific idea from the people of Blackberry, im sticking to this cell phone. In my last two BB i replaced the trackballs at least 6 times.............
excelent blackberry, most of my friends on the university are planning to change their blackberrys to this one.the only thing that i didn't like, was that it didn't bring the leather case neither the memory card.but, beside that, i'm happy.
the product is quite interesting deveria only have a higher resolution camera, however the photos are quite acceptable
An excellent phone... there are two things missing in it, a GPS and a camara flash.
Well as i say in the tittle of the review. This is a very good product, it works in excellents condition and until this moment it haven't present any problem! hope you guys continuo sellying this caind of products...!!greetings from venezuela!!26/11/2009
Mi opinión personal sobre este equipo es que es sencillamente Genial. Vengo de un Curve 8330 (CDMA) y la velocidad de procesamiento es un choque entre ambos equipos. En el 8330 su fuerte es la estabilidad de la RED EVDO pero en el Gemini es su procesador que lo convierte en una de las mejores opciones. Ademas, el trackpad que es estupendo.
Todo bien pero lo unico malo no me llego la funda no se si se la robarian en la aduana o es que esta version no la trae
Blackberry Gemini 8520 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi International Version with No Warranty (Black)
Well, mi cel phone is here with me!! it¨s was a very nice purchase!! thank you so much!!
I am a beginning runner who lives in the country. For safety, I always carry my cellphone and identification when I run, and I bought this holder to circumvent the fact that most running shorts don't have pockets.This cellphone holder is sturdy and well-constructed, but flexible enough to allow me to slide my ID/health information cards behind the phone. The band, which fits easily around the arm or lower leg, is slightly stretchy for comfort. I prefer to wear this holder around my ankle, where it seems least likely to interfere with normal circulation.While I haven't experienced this, I suppose it's possible that the heavier stitching on the back of the case may cause chafing if the holder is worn over exposed skin, although I'm inclined to doubt that this would be a problem.In conclusion, this is an excellent product for a fair price. It would be useful not only for runners, but for anyone who'd like the hold their cellphone, ID, and maybe a house key without pockets. (This product was, in fact, originally designed for horseback riders.) I am highly satisfied with this product, and would not hesitate to recommend it.
I love to go horseback riding out on the trail, and I always carry a cellphone in case of emergency. This cellphone holder can be worn on the arm or leg for secure, quick and easy access. The item description doesn't mention the adjustable velcro band is also elasticized to help keep it in place. I have worn the holder on my arm, over a slippery nylon jacket, and the holder didn't slide around as might be expected. I purchased the holder in yellow; it's a bright, bumblebee yellow, with black trim, not the soft, buttery yellow shown in the picture. Not a complaint, since it could be just the way my monitor shows it. Whatever color you might choose, I think you will find this cellphone holder a helpful item. Highly recommended!
I received 2 of these today and I first thought they were going to be too small for my Blackberry Curve 8310. However, the entire case is made of a quite stretchy but sturdy material and it expanded enough to fit my phone. The quality of the case is quite good and will not easily rip apart. As the other reviewer mentioned, the strap is elasticised and adjustable and long enough to fit around your leg but can still fit securely around your arm without having any excess stick out. It's perfect for keeping your phone on you regardless of what you're doing.
After suffering for ten months with AT&T;'s lousy service and rude support staff, I terminated my contract early and jumped on the pre-paid bandwagon.  I was accustomed to having a feature-rich phone (an HTC Fuze with unlimited data) so I began preparing myself for the humble amenities of a no-contract plan.  Much to my surprise, I have found the LG Rumor2 is a quite capable phone.  The QWERTY keyboard is responsive, laid out very well, and easy to use.  If you're going to text often, this phone is built for the task.  Call quality is decent, though I've only tested it through the handset speaker and not on a headset.  I was even mildly impressed by the Rumor2's camera (1.3 megapixel) which took some e-mail quality shots.  LG has constructed a lightweight but sturdy phone which won't rip a hole in your pocket.Above all that, however, this phone has several applications which have impressive capabilities.  The built-in Opera Mini browser delivers a respectable mobile web browsing experience.  Despite the Rumor2's small screen, you can still see what you need to see on most websites.  Google Maps is also included and is highly functional on this unit.  There's even the option to purchase a GPS navigation program (runs $9.95 per month) that further expands its versatility.  Along with all those features, you can insert a microSD card and listen to mp3s with the Rumor's on-board media player.  If that's not enough functionality, the free Mail+IM app is incredibly useful for staying connected.  As a user who stubbornly clung to Windows Mobile for over three years, I'm quickly learning that you don't need a $600 SmartPhone and $40 data plan to communicate.Virgin Mobile's plans are highly configurable to whatever types of services you use most.  I'm getting a basic voice plan, 1000 messages, and a generous data bundle all for $40 per month.  I was paying $80 per month for similar services from AT&T; on my contract phone.My only real complaint is the small screen.  The Rumor2 has a sharp, bright display but there's just not enough of it.  That said, you'll have few problems texting, emailing, Facebooking, web-surfing, or playing games on the tiny LCD.  This phone really does everything you'd need a cell phone to do.
"I'm 17 and I've found this phone is perfect for me. I was using Tracfone prepaid service before and was tired with the limited service options. With virgin mobile I could still use prepaid cards and have many service options, including the "texters delight" ulimited messaging for $20 a month which I chose. This is an incredible deal and includes unlimited sms, mms picture messaging, email, and IM's.This phone is perfect for texting and I have found the slide out keyboard to work extremely efficiently. I hardly ever find myself editing my keystrokes. And the built in features of the phone are worth the money. I highly reccommend this phone.*****Also, when activating be sure to use Kickbacks Code 9LuL90pw to earn 60 free minutes*****"
I got this phone as a gift for my son for Christmas.  I tried to activate it online without success.  Then I called to activate it.  I had to use an automated system and give all my personal and phone information again.  The activation failed again.  I was then put through to a human.  I had to give all my personal and phone information AGAIN.  The activation failed AGAIN.  Without another word I was transferred again to another person.  I had to give all my personal and phone information AGAIN!  Activation failed again due to multiple attempts to activate.  They said the phone should be activated in 24 hours and I will be notified by e-mail when it is and then assigned a phone number.  I asked to speak with a supervisor.  I was put on hold for about 15 minutes and then I was disconnected.  There was no return call.  So, I still have no idea how the phone works or what kind of call quality the phone will have.  But, I can tell you that the customer service at Virgin Mobile is awful and I will never purchase another phone from them again.
I have been a Virgin Mobile customer since they first started as a prepaid cell phone provider. I have been quite pleased with their service and variety of pricing plans. Unfortunately Virgin Mobile phones have never been the greatest, the only good thing is that if you buy a cheap phone, you don't feel to badly when it dies,gets lost, or broken. When my VM Slash phone finally gave up the ghost a few weeks ago I decided it was time for another upgrade. After doing a lot of research on the internet I decided to go with the Mantra. I like being back to a flip phone so you don't have to worry about locking the keyboard so you don't pocket dial. The phone it'self is still pretty basic, it comes with the nifty tip calculator which lets you divide the cost between the number of parties at your table. Call clarity is good. Reception is the typical Virgin Mobile, works in most places when I need it, but spotty sometimes in the more rural areas. The ring tones that come with the phone are typical Virgin Mobile, obnoxious...you will want to download some better ones which you can only do from the VM site. The games on the phone are all demos, but they look good on the screen so it might be nice to have a full version of Tetris which you can download from VM.It is Bluetooth enabled which is a nice feature to have on a phone. The battery seems to hold a good charge for daily use, I can go 3 to 4 days without charging, but that is in standby mode, I am not sure how long it would last if you were a heavy user. The phone is very well behaved, I say this because my Slash would beep once a minute to let me know it was working (I guess that's why), anytime I had the ringer turned on. I never did figure out how to turn off the signal beep on it. The Mantra doesn't beep and also on the Mantra you can turn off the obnoxious start up and shut down sounds that VM deems necessary to put on all of their low end phones. The directory will support up to 500 entries and you can add up to 5 phone numbers per entry along with 2 email addresses and a URL address.The camera is useable, not great but much better pictures than the Slash took. Basically I use it only to create new wallpapers for the phone and send an occasional pic to TwitpicSo far I am very pleased with the new Mantra, it's a good basic phone, not a lot of bells and whistles, but enough to make it very user friendly. Nice calendar and appointment scheduling, cool countdown timers so you can tell how many days till your anniversary, birthday, Christmas or any other date you might want to countdown to.Watch for it on sale, Amazon had it listed for $59 same as the VM site... I bought it on sale at Best Buy for $49, and on Black Friday picked up a second one for my wife at Radio Shack for $29.I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a nice basic user friendly phone with picture and texting capabilities. It will browse the web also by the way, but you need to pay for a "data pack" at VM to use it. That I haven't tried.
I had purchase this phone for usage on AT&T; after watching a video review detailing some of the features of the HTC Hero. I had recently lost my Samsung Blackjack II, and was in need of a new smartphone.PROS: Android operating system is fantastic, world's better than Windows Mobile is currently or may ever be. One thing that surprised me was that my contacts sync up with Facebook (and flicker if I had an account), something that only the Palm Pre is supposed to do. The new Sense feature is incredible, although I never owned an android phone before, so I really can't tell the difference. Apparantly it allows me to fully customize the screen anyway I want too, which is very nice so that the phone can be exactly how I want it, nothing more, nothing less.Predictive keyboard. The phone's QWERTY keyboard is on screen, and sports a nice predictive keyboard that learns what you want to say, to make texting or e-mailing that much easier.5 MP camera. The camera on this phone is the best I've seen, and working at a retail store, its equivalent to only one other phone that we carry.WiFi turned out to be a very nice feature because of a con you will read momentarily. You can connect to any wifi (as long as you have the security code for the blocked wifi centers) and use that as your phones internet, allowing you faster speeds than any cellphone carrier's 3G service.CONS: This phone was never slated to be available on any American phone network. While the Hero supports certain 3G bands worldwide, unfortunately it does not support the 3G band for AT&T.; The phone STILL WORKS with AT&T;, but you are stuck with Edge data service.No button keyboard. This may not matter as much as I originally thought it would. I always preferred actual buttons to touch screen but the predictive keyboard is a certainly nice feature that I may get used too.OTHER:At the time I purchased the phone, there is a weird bug that if you do not sign in or create a google account when you are doing the first time startup wizard, the phone will not let you set up the Google account unless you do a factory reset. I am sure Google and HTC are working on a fix for that, and its only a minor annoyance, thankfully I hadn't installed anything important before I came to that realization.OVERALL: This phone is something I would recommend to anyone willing to pay for it, as it is certainly the best phone I have ever owned.
I received my "Hero" phone, Brown, [the unlocked international verison] about two weeks ago, and have been hard-pressed to put it down. After some conflicting information by a couple of [well-meaning] but under-knowledged tech-support staffer from T-mobile, I had the patience to hang-in-there and finally got some one who really knew how to troubleshoot. She got me up and running on the "EDGE" network in a flash [which was the only thing I had trouble configuring]. Everything else loaded flawlessly. Moreover, She was a real professional, and I could not thank her enough for her help.The first thing I didn't noticed, or witness [what many were complaining about] was its, so-called, "noticable Lag". No "lag" here, the andriod plateform worked as promised with speeds comparable to home networks or better. The UI Sense screen [though very sensitive] can be tailored to accommodate large finger and for those not use to "touch" typing. It is light-weight and comfortable in the hand, and has a good feel when carried inside a suit jacket or pants pocket. Naviagating through the various screens and apps took some getting use too, but was fairly simple once you got the hang of it. The Andriod Market Place is filled with free Apps that are easily downloaded and installed. No radio with the Hero- not a problem, there's an App for that. Want some really good games- there's an App for that, too. Not only was the Android Market Place filled with Apps, the online store is filled with them as well. So don't be fooled by App mania, or lack-thereof.The WiFi was a breeze to configure, whether home or away, and the 5 pixel camera takes some stunning pictures. Its style is futuristic and cleverly constructed, [chin design and flat profile] gives it that eye-catching look that people notice. "That's not, The iPhone"? Yeah, I know, will be your response with a broad grin. The sound quality is clear with very little background noise, and when the 3.5 mm, ear-buds are in, you don't need a lot of volume. Also, the Bluetooth discovery/marriage to my Car's sound system was a snap to setup. It's the knid of phone where you wouldn't want an ear-piece Bluetooth because its so hand-friendly and stylish, you'd want to hold it. Can't say that about many hand-held devices. One other cool thing, I found the phones lockout feature especially nice. Forget about trying to remember the lockout code. What we have here is basically a finger design sweep where you trace an outline on the screen to gain access. Now how clever is that. Try cracking that, hackers. There are so many good feature associated with this phone, it would take far too much time trying to list them all individually. Basically, its a dream to operate.Yes, it is a little pricey, no doubt about it. But, if you want a superior phone on a plateform suited to today's needs, with enough umph to get the job done, then the Hero should be looked into and taken seriously. There are many phones to choose from, with some awesome capabilities, but dollar for dollar, unlocked, and without the commitments you couldn't do better. I recommend it wholdheartedly.
Tempted by a 5 megapixel camera, a touch screen and google operational system, I thought: that's it! here I have an iphone without the life bonds imposed by this brand, a pretty good camera for a mobile, and google-like neatness for doing complex tasks in simple ways. However, I was disappointed in all fronts.The ergonomics of the device is overly poor - certainly well below iphone's. The main proof is its own manual of instructions which, with more than two hundred pages, is unfortunately needed for users to be able to use many basic commands that cannot be accessed intuitively. So the simplicity of use and intuitiveness that is such a great part of Google success sadly were not translated into this operational system (e.g.: I tried to switch to another gmail account in this device and for now I gave up, as I couldn't find how to do it)Another example is the physical keys (it has several ones), which need a considerable force to be pressed (resulting for instance that the mobile is not comfortable to operate with one hand only). But in contrast to the toughness of dealing with the mechanical buttons, the interaction with the touchscreen is hyper-sensitive to the finger touch, so you often end up activating commands you don't want to - like calling to phone numbers when in fact all you wanted was to navigate in the agenda, or opening applications (or even sending then to the trash bin) when all you wanted was to browse among the screen (actually that can happen even when the mobile is left alone in your pocket)Small details can be annoying too: the horizontal mode of the screen does not allow you to finish the task you started (so you cannot send the text you wrote without going back to the vertical mode). When you want to see your files, there is no the option of just plugging the mobile into the USB port of your computer. You have first to "mount" (process not intuitive - again you need to have read the manual) and after that, "unmount" the mobile.And finally, the camera is sincerely bad. Forget the idea of having it as a substitute for a digital camera (as I used to do with my old mobile Nokia N95) mainly when it comes to take pictures when flash is needed, as the camera has no flash.overall - and also taking into account the high price of the unlocked version- a bad deal.
Played around with this phone for a bit now. Its a decent phone overall but yes it is little laggy. Be very carefully and aware of the fact that this handset does not work on the 3G networks. It is 3G compatible and a world phone, but GSM US carriers like T Mobile or ATT use a different frequency for data which is the GSM 1700 mhz band I think. Whatever the Freq, its not compatible for 3G data in US. Europe and Asia it will work fine on 3G but not in the US. Otherwise overall very well equiped, but not worth [...] dollars when the iPhone with 16GB unlocked can be got for about 400-500 and 32 GB for 500-600 unlocked.Many apps are available for the phone, great interface, very user friendly, shoots good pics and decent video, can use mp3s as ringtones which is fantastic. Visual voicemail if supported by carrier, g sensors, GPS is accurate, search engine features are great too. Finds anything in the neighborhood, coffee shops, hotels, restaurants etc.All in all decent phone but not at [...] bucks
I can't really offer a full proper review of this phone because I am using it on a substandard network (Roshan in Afghanistan).  But I can say that the features that I am able to access are awesome.  The touchscreen interface is really good and the menu set up is intuitive.  The music player is easy to navigate and just as simple to use as an iPod.  The camera/camcorder are clear.  The touch keyboard is responsive and doesn't require a hard press to get the letter up.  Conversation style texting is an added bonus.  Audio clarity is excellent.  All in all this is the best phone that I have ever owned.  I will update this with a more detailed review when I get to really explore everything on the phone when I get to use it on a better network, Four Stars until then (I don't want to give it the highest mark until i get the full experience).
Although I've an iPhone 3G I bought this telephone during a recent trip to Asia. I wanted to test Android.The experience was better than expected. First of all this phone has 2 to 3 times the battery life of my iPhone (for my type of use). I can start early in the morning and keep going all day without issues and if I stay out for dinner I still have juice left by midnight.Second it is faster than my iPhone. Less hesitant. The user interface is snappy.I was surprised also with the number of applications available in the store (almost all of them free). It is HUGE. I still have to find something that I've on the iPhone without an equivalent here (often the very same application)Radio: The telephone part is excellent. Much better than the iPhone. I do live in the bay area, working on one side of the bay, living on the opposite. With the iPhone I always lose the signal crossing the bridge during the handover between the two cells on the opposite sides of the bridge. Also I live on the hills. Strong signals but too many  cells and far from me. With the iPhone I can't walk around the house or I lose the signal due to the bad handover. The blackjack was even worse. This one is rock solid:Negatives:1) So far I didn't have any problem but it's pretty absurd to have the application loaded in the main flash memory that is indeed too small. I will soon run out of memory. This phone let you use SD cards (nice feature) but the apps must stay on the main flash limiting the # of applications installed. Hopefully it will be fixed in a SW release2) EDGE only in the US. This is because these phones weren't built for the US. When they will be distributed by AT&T; they will have it. This can be an advantage for travelers, when you go out of the country you have bigger 3G coverage since this phone is indeed an international 3G. So as a second phone for travelers it is fine3) Coolness. It is pricey even if you consider the absence of subsidy from the phone company but it look like a cheap phone. It is not cheaply built but the iPhone looks better in my opinion. Also, I don't like the banana shape and I don't know why they didn't make a flat phoneConclusions:A nice phone that I suggest to the power users. If your provider offer it definitely go for it, if you are a geek , buy it. It is easy to use, well thought out and the telephone parts is the best I ever tested in a smartphone, Android is great too. A winner. Even with the minor issues I still give 5 stars
I took me ages reviewing both this phone and the IPhone. I'm a software engineer nad have access to quite a few IT friends and colleagues whom I can turn to when I need some advice. Quite a lot have IPhones and quite a lot of them regret buying into what they say is a designed to keep you locked into an Apple money making scheme. They also seem to have quite a lot of problems with all the models of the IPhone including the recent version which over-heats and has terrible battery life! All say they should have gone with an Android phone.The Hero has been voted the best phone of 2009 and I would agree! It does exactly what it says it will do and more without any problems. What a fantastic piece of kit that makes my life so much easier.
I am not an expert, just a regular guy who buys a new phone every year because I like toys.This phone has all of the important features I need on a phone. I have had other Nokia phones and this combines all of the great features and adds some that were not present. For example:1. 3.5mm Headphone jack. No more need for an adaptor for a 2.5mm.2. Bigger screen. I guess 2.6 is not comparable to other phones like the iPhone's 3.5, but this does not have a touchscreen interface. I can still text without looking using the keypad.3. The AMOLED display is rediculously clear and vibrant. My wife is using my Nokia E51 and the difference is stunning.4. 8 gb of storage plus microSD. This is more memory than I could fill up right now.5. This phone is also much faster than my E51. it takes less than 1/2 second to access any application once selected.6. Scratch resistant screen.7. The phone is well built, feels solid, a little heavy, but strong.8. The battery life is exceptional. I have used the camera for three days taking pictures, video, listening to music while I run etc. and still have 2 bars left.9. The speakerphone is LOUD. I can have my windows down on the BQE commuting to work and still here the callers over the traffic noise.10. Font sizes are adjustable and can be made noticably larger. I hate phones with tiny fonts.I can go on and on.My only concern is the camera. The video capability is great but I have been experimenting with the image quality and I don't think it is as good as Nokia will have you believe. The 8MP camera takes 8MP pictures, but they come out dark indoors even at close range with the flash. Outdoors they are as good as you would expect from an 8MP camera , and hopefully they will release the firmware update enabling face detection that has been rumored.Also, the notification light for missed calls, messages, and emails is kind of weak. My E51 would scream with vibrancy lighting up my bedroom at night, where the N86 is more of a whisper.I would reccomend this phone for many reasons.
Well I just got mine today. Build quality is excellent, slider is solid, feels great in hand. Buttons are great, glass and metal/plastic case is top notch. OLED screen is also a winner, love the always on power saver clock. Overall, much improved over the N85. Phone feels snappy especially the camera, nokia messaging works well. Call quality is excellent. Pictures leave a bit to be desired, however I am used to this on early Nokia firmware. Shutter button is much improved over the horrible one on the N85. The flash is surprisingly good. The gallery and also photo viewer are still painfully slow to load the thumbnails, they stay blurry far to long, I don't understand this as my N95 had no problems here. FM transmitter is not as good as the N85, but still a nice feature.  Cell and GPS reception are excellent, compass I am sure will prove useful eventually. Overall hardware wise the phone is near perfect!  As I predicted this phone is the ultimate interpretation of the dual slider N series design. The firmware is surprisingly good for an early one. I think this phone will get a following with the N95 faithful and as a result will end up with an excellent firmware within the next year. I wish I never had to use the N85 for the short while that I did. If I had been going from the N95 to the N86 I would be overjoyed. As it is going from the N95 to N85 then to N86, I just feel as though Nokia cheated me on the N85.I feel this is the true successor to the N95, I cant wait for the v30 or v31 firmware, when the software is perfect.If you are looking for a powerful feature packed smart phone with an excellent camera, like typing without looking, one handed and don't mind that its not a flashy touch phone. The N86 is for you. Not to mention, you are free to multitask, don't have to pay for an overpriced data plan and it is a pocket camera/iPod replacement.
Definitely worth every penny and I recommend this to everyone! GREAT PHONE and is loaded with features, great camera and performance!
Well what can I say, after owning a Samsung, a Siemens, two or three Sony-ericssons and two nokias previous to this one I finally came into the Symbian world.I must say given the OS and navigation I have always considered myself a SE fanboy, however I took some solid 6 months to review and read about all kinds of phones in order to retire my trusty C702.It came down to the new LG chocolate BL-40 or something (the one that looks like a widescreen on your palm) and the nokia N86.Given that I have always thought that phones should be operated using one hand if necessary, the N86 won over the sheer sexyness of the LG. (And besides I loathe touch screens!)I had my doubts as I've always own bar form phones, the less parts that move the better, I still went with the N86.After two weeks with it I have seen enough to communicate my opinion.Over all this is a solid phone feels heavy in a good way in your hands, the front is quite a fingerprint magnet but the scratch resistant glass is still flawless as day one.The dual slider mechanism has an adequate resistance in either way so it is not too hard nor to soft, it is not going to snap in your pocket nor you will break it trying to slide it.The slider mechanism feels tight so there is next to no twiching or shaking from the phone components when slided either way or closed.I have huge hands and the number keys are reachable reasonably spaced and sized, however it is another issue with the secondary keys (the ones that control the games and the media player) They are far too small and too close to the edge of the screen so it is quite a pain to use them and the D-pad is not as responsive or comfortable as I would have hoped for in video game action.The camera itself is just plain outstanding! Awesome pics, in part due to the good lens it has. The low light pictures are amongs the best if not THE best I have ever seen on a cell phone. The dual LED flash is also outstanding. The AMOLED screen is gorgeous and it has a decent readability in sunlight.I feel nokia over did it with the dual speakers as they really distort the music when played at more than 50% of the volume.Memory-wise you get 8GB in theory but given all the stuff the phone packs I think I remember seeing 6GB reported on the phone when I started it the first time around, but being able to handle a 16GB micro SD memory card should be able to fix this problem in case you feel 6GB are not enough.The phone itself is fast and responsive, I could ramble on about a lot of things but I'll instead try to just highlight my final opinions on it.PROS:Awesome cameraSturdy and well built, does not feel cheap at all.Great hardware overall with the sole flaw of the secondary slider keys design (too little space for big hands)AMOLED screen, WiFi, 16GB extendable memoryCONS:It might be me but I HATE the navigation in symbian, it makes no sense, where is the file manager, why is it so hard to install software made by smaller companies? (torch software, disable shutter sound)Missing functionality, no way to turn off the shutter sound and no torch light function, (although you can install it read previous complain) NOKIA COME ON !So far I would rate this phone 4.5 stars (Given I grow into the whole Symbian navigation) awesome phone highly recommendable.Cheers !
Quality photos, both indoor and out (best I've seen on a phone).  Firmware still quite immature, so not a good every dayphone yet.  Heavier than it needs to be.  S60 OS is aged, but highly functional (when stable).  Keys are hard to press and smaller than needed, so not very friendly for any type of text entry.
Not much else to say.  This is a fantastic phone.  Great photos, great video (for a phone -- almost as good a dedicated point and shoot).  It still has Symbian S60, which needs some work, but it is the latest version (Series 3, Feature Pack 2) and does more than most phones.  Great all around smart phone if you want both work email, home email, photo and video all in one device.
It is great, great pictures, video at night with constant flash light has amazing quality for a camera phone, lot of space to store any kind of media, nokia maps is a nice feature. The sound quality is great, pleanty of symbian apps to install, gps with garmin xt rocks! Browser speed much more faster than other nokias,[...]Very good and entertaining games with n*gage platform.Battery life is also very good.I would definetly recommend you to buy this phone.
Last phone used was a N82.I really like this phone much more,..the screen stay shinny most of the time.Every works,..phone run a lot faster then the N82. Also like you can set your default phonebook as SIM. Nokia finally done it!Only Con is,..phone is slick and feeling like you going drop it or so.
This cel  has everything you would want in a mobile phone.  I enjoy it even more than the iPhone I used to have. My only comolaint-  weak speaker.
Estoy sorprendida de como han calificado este celular, he leido que la camara no es buena pero menos mal no les hice caso la camara es espectacular, toma muy buenas fotos, la recomiendo, ademas es super bueno, lo unico malo que puedo decir es que la bateria no dura sino 2 dias entre tomado fotos y oyendo musica, pero de resto es fenomenal, asi que gracias nokia por este telefono
Buyer beware!  This phone looks cool, feels rugged, and heck it even keeps out a little water.  But oh does the software suck!!!  The functions are useless and out-dated by 5 years!  I've never been so disappointed in a phone that costs so much but delivered so little.  My phone has crashed once a week.  It is super buggy, and now the charging port is faulty. And I've only owned it for two months!  Battery life is greatly exaggerated.  Screen is suseptable to pocket change. Buttons feel cheap.  And at this moment the phone died, with no sign of recovery.  Save your money, headaches and time.  Dont buy it.
UPDATE:I have had the phone about two and a half years and it still looks like it did when I bought it.  The sound quality issues are still the same.  I don't use the internet functions on it because I just use this as a work phone now.  The internet still works and I still pay for it, just in case I need it.  Using the internet on this phone is not much fun anyhow.  It is a really durable phone though.  It looks brand new.One issue where it is not durable is the slot for the micro SD card.  The gate came loose and now it won't hold the SD card in place, so you can't use it.  I was able to tape it into place for a while, but now it won't work at all.If I were to spend this much on a phone again my wish list would include having a better sd card slot, better sound quality for the people on the other end, better internet access and a bigger screen.  The gaming part on this phone is weak too but I'm not real into that.  This is one tough phone though.Original review:The Sonim XP3 Quest is a solid phone.  It will probably stand up to some abuse.  I haven't tried to destroy mine like the people in the ads do, but it feels like a well built phone.  The sound on the calls isn't very good.  On my end there is buzzing and static.  I have T-Mobile service and have never had that before.  People on the other end are always asking me to repeat myself now and that is new.  They tell me they are having a hard time hearing me.This phone was fairly difficult to program to go to the internet.  It shouldn't be that hard.  I contacted customer support 4 times by e-mail.  I received a response to one e-mail.  The first was a question about using it as an unlocked phone and if it would work with T-Mobile in Colorado.  No response.  My second was about getting on the internet, as was my third.  Again, no responses.  My fourth e-mail (I don't give up easily) was a question about why the calender said it was full when I had only put in 20 appointments.  They did respond saying that was all the calender could schedule.  I was not amused.  I did eventually get the internet up and running, but it is difficult to navigate.  You also have to keep switching between numeric characters and alpha.  The phone doesn't do it for you.  The calender is not user friendly either.  To look at appointments (ones you did get to schedule) you have to open that date in order to be able to see what the appointment is.  The week starts with Monday and runs through Sunday instead of the Sunday through Saturday format, so you have to really look at the small print on the days to make sure you enter or look at the right date.  I have a hard time seeing the small characters on this phone too.  I wasn't at all impressed with their customer service department.I have tried to program assigned ringtones/images on this phone and still have been unable to do it.  I've always been able to do it on other phones no problem, and yeah, I even read all the directions on all the stuff I've tried with this phone.  It says it will do it, but I'm still trying to figure this one out.The phone comes with Amaze loaded on it for GPS navigation.  It works well.  It has Opera Mini for the internet browsing and I don't like it.  I haven't tried playing any games on it yet.  I'm not real big into gaming on a phone anyhow.  I don't like the text messaging set up.  You have to open the messages in order to read all of it, and some have to be sent as two separate messages to go through if they are a medium length message.I have tried using the earbuds and mike that came with the phone.  The people on the other end said they couldn't hear me.  I have a system in my truck that allows me to play the phone over the car speakers.  It doesn't work with this phone either.  The Mobile Phone PC Tools program that comes with the phone isn't much of a program either.  It took several tries before I could get the phone to even connect.  The program doesn't do much once you do get in.  I've seen a lot better ones.  Finding your Sandisk card in the My Files is an adventure too.  Once you finally locate it, it is easier to just drag and drop stuff you want loaded on it than it is to go through the PC Tools program.  You will need to format the card before you can use it. You can set the date format in the phone for whatever you are used to.  Only problem is that it doesn't set it that way for all the features on the phone.The camera on the phone is pretty good.  It has a flash on the phone too.  The flash works as a pretty decent flashlight too.  The screen is pretty hard and should be scratch resistant.  The colors, etc on the images displayed are fine.  Battery life is good.  It ran down after two days use without a charge, with the GPS on the whole time.If you don't mind a phone that isn't user friendly, don't plan to contact customer service, don't mind poor call audio, but want a pretty solid phone that will (probably) stand up to some abuse, then this might be the phone for you.  I work hard and play hard, so I need a phone like this.  It is the best ruggedized phone I have ever seen.  I'll give up some of the quality on other programs if the phone is indestructible.  The sound quality is tolerable on my end most of the time.  Hopefully future versions will work out some of the problems.  All in all, I do like the phone.
I've had various "tough" phones from nextel and the lastest from Samsun (A657) all meet a timely dimise eventually.  Thats why i got this, the warranty.  And used it just the 2nd day I had it to more or less test the abuse and warranty.  Warranty is awesome, about a week turn around from destruction to replacement.The call quality is pretty good (AT&T;) the speaker gets a bit muffled if you dunk it then make a call but otherwise the ringer is LOUD!!! Vibrate is worthless.  Battery life is about 6 or 7 days for me (texting all day and constant flashlight useage).  I don't have the net so can't comment on it but for use as a phone and camera it works great.The software that comes with it is worthless, just plug it in and use it as a USB storage device to transfer your photos.  It also has no built in photo editing options.Hands down the most durable phone I have ever had and when the 3 years is up, i will trash it to get a new one, then when it dies out of warranty i will buy another!!!! I'll never buy a regular phone again.Did I mention it's water proof??  Ever get a call while you are in the shower?  Just take it with you now.  It's the easiest way to clean grit and grease off too i use my hand/nail brush to scrub it clean once a week while i'm in there.
Review Updated June 1, 2010=======================Design & Hardware=======================[CONSTRUCTION]: The surface of the N900 is a smooth black matte finish. The build material is aluminum, steel and rubber/plastic. The N900 easily fits in a pocket, being smaller than the N810 but noticeably thicker than most phones. The four front components are the status light, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and VGA camera. There is a consumer infrared port (universal remote), wrist strap option, stylus and kickstand. The removable back contains the main camera, SIM, battery and microSDHC slot. Removal requires some strength but it's reassuring knowing it won't fall off.[KEYBOARD]: The keyboard is side-sliding with a smooth, springless mechanism providing a solid feel. The keyboard is three-row, localized and backlit with rubberized key surfaces. The keys are more difficult to use than devices with rounded keys but are still easier than virtual keyboards. While reaching speeds of 35-40 WPM is realistic, extended use is rather tiring. It is possible connect a USB or Bluetooth keyboard, gamepad, mouse and even a Wii Remote.[TV-OUT]: There is 480i resolution TV-out which uses an included 3.5mm jack with 4 rings. These are ground, audio left and right, and composite video. Useful for watching movies, playing games or doing work that requires a big screen.[SCREEN]: The 16 million color, 800x480 pixel display is incredible. It is pressure-sensitive, 15:9 aspect and transflective, making the screen easier to see in direct light. It uses a surprisingly responsive resistive touch screen allowing use with gloves, fingernails or a stylus. The ambient light sensor adjusts the brightness automatically. Lack of multi-touch means cumbersome "swirling" gestures in some software but is generally not a huge issue.[CAMERAS]: The main camera is a 5MP Carl Zeiss, the same as the Nokia N97. It comes with a sliding shutter to protect the recessed lens. There is also a front-facing 640x480 webcam. The camera interface is the same as the S60. The image quality is sharp, skin tones are vivid and there is very little, if any, chromatic aberration at the edges. The camera uses the accelerometer when photographing so the photo viewer can show the picture "up" however the N900 is held. Take a portrait picture and view it landscape and it'll be small. Turn the device and it'll fill the screen. There are the following modes: Automatic, Macro, Portrait, Landscape, Action, and Auto video. The camera can take 848×480 resolution video at 25 fps. The video quality is crisp, recording at an impressive 3000 kb/s but the framerate usually drops to 20fps and the audio has a noticeable metallic tone. The camera also works with Adobe Flash.[CPU]: The CPU is an ARM-based TI OMAP 3430 600MHz clocked at 500MHz but can be overclocked. Some users of the Maemo forums have managed to push it up to 1.2GHz. This allows improved performance with high resolution media, gaming/emulators and web browsing among many others. Overclocking requires downloading a modified kernel with the desired speed. They are generally made available in 50Mhz steps such as 800MHz and 850MHz. Then simply run fiasco-image-update on the download. While overclocking would normally reduce battery life, most kernels also provide underclocks for idle which allows the N900 to use significantly less power when not in use, the net result often being EXTENDED battery life. According to Nokia, overclocking does void the warranty. Since the N900 does not have any active cooling the heat created by overclocking could significantly shorten the N900's life if pushed too much. N900 units are unique, each will overclock differently. So far though the series does seem to overclock extremely well.[BATTERY]: The battery is a 1320mAh Nokia BL-5J, 22% smaller than the BP-4L. A full battery with unoptimized settings allows about 5-9 hours of continuous talk time, 5 hours of music or a few hours of 3G. 3G/3.5G drains the battery faster than Wi-Fi. Lowering brightness, removing desktop widgets and disabling GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 3G easily triples battery life. Charging is through microUSB which takes about 4-5 hours for an empty battery. An issue with the USB port breaking off has been acknowledged by Nokia as a design oversight, they advise care should be taken while plugging/unplugging devices to mitigate this problem. The "complete cycle" method some people use is for calibrating multicell laptop batteries, but the N900 only has a single cell battery so it's pointless and marginally harmful to do complete discharge cycles as there's nothing to calibrate.[INTERNAL MEMORY]: The N900 has two memory chips. The first is a 32GB eMMC: 768MB of 'virtual memory' (swap), 2GB for settings and software (ext3 /home), the last ~26GB (MyDocs) is for your files only (software not allowed). The second chip is 256MB of NAND memory (RAM) used for bootloader, kernel and rootfs, twice that of the N810. Optionally, several gigabytes are used for the localized offline Ovi Maps, useful in areas without data coverage.[EXPANDABLE MEMORY]: The N900 has a hot-swappable microSDHC slot under the rear panel. It supports microSDHC cards up to 32GB of any class. The included cable can connect the N900 to a computer for easy transfer of files by allowing the N900 to act as a hard drive, though only "MyDocs" is accessible.[GPS & MAPS]: The GPS is a real GPS and has the addition of assisted GPS. The cold fix time with data is about 10-40 seconds with accuracy as good as the Nokia N97. Pre-loaded Ovi Maps are available so a data connection is not required. GPS usually works fine offline, if slow, but due to a bug can fail as the map engine may ask for a connection even when the maptiles are loaded. Ovi Maps uses the GPS to show local weather information. Navigation and mapping with Ovi Maps is free but there is no turn-by-turn voice navigation. The low 1.0 version is due to it being the first Maemo release of Ovi maps explaining the lack of features it has compared to the 3.0 version available on Symbian. Some omissions being the inability to save routes, and inability to look up a contact's address.[FM TRANSMITTER]: The integrated FM transmitter puts audio from the device into radio frequency so you can tune a radio to that frequency and play N900 media wirelessly. It works as advertised but must be very close to the receiving radio.[RADIOS]: The signal strength of the N900's 3G radio is weak. It is possible to turn off the cellular radio without disabling Wi-Fi/Bluetooth by going into offline mode and then manually enabling either. The N900 can use another phone as a 3G modem over Bluetooth but setup is complicated. Bluetooth DUN and PAN modes are supported via community software. Advanced WLAN security, like different kinds of EAP (EAP-PEAP, EAP-MSCHAPv2, etc.), different ciphers (RSA, 3DES, SHA, etc.) and "authority certificates" (algorithms like X.509, SHA1RSA) are all supported. With Bluetooth DUN, tethering is supported.[AUDIO]: The built-in stereo speakers are loud but lacking in bass. They make an acceptable portable radio. Bluetooth headphones work great. The audio quality of the 3.5mm jack is loud and slightly more "forward" sounding than the more "laid back" or "polite" sound of other smartphones but without the response peaks, valleys or ripples that so often mar the critical 1,000 Hz. region. Audio sounds more "present" than with similar devices. The included earphones have a somewhat dirty signal. Higher frequencies hiss, losing details and the brightness and dynamic volume are shallow, lacking weight and depth. The earphone wires feel like they will become loose over time.========================Application Software========================[SCREEN ORIENTATION]: Most software and the main N900 interface only work in landscape mode. The only time it can be switched to portrait mode is when making or receive a phone call. Rotating the phone into portrait mode opens the keypad automatically after a delay. As of PR 1.2, portrait mode is available for the web browser by default. Emails, Contacts, App and File mangers and PDF reader now all support portrait mode but you must press Ctrl+Shift+R every time to enable it. Third party software orientation is at the discretion of the software developer.[WEB BROWSER]: The overall web experience is amazing, perhaps the best available in a device this size. The web browser is MicroB and supports full Adobe Flash, video and applets providing a very fast, full web experience. Tapping zooms and centers where tapped. Making a circular motion zooms gradually. Moving a finger off the left of the screen produces a mouse arrow for websites requiring this operation. The Flash version is 9.4. Flash 10.1 was originally planned for Q1 2010 but the Head of Maemo Operations, Mountain View has stated that it is never coming to the N900, only to future MeeGo devices. Many Flash games play fine but the keyboard can be iffy. Unfortunately some Flash applets still run after closing the browser and drain the battery. The simplest fix is to reboot. MicroB is based on Firefox which uses Gecko, Webkit browsers are also freely available.[COPY AND PASTE]: Copy and pasting text is allowed in all menus and textboxes.[SOCIAL NETWORKING]: The N900 comes with utilities for using Twitter and Facebook. Social presence is a global service, once connected, the contact list is updated realtime, there's no need to launch 'Contacts'. IM support for MSN, ICQ, AIM, Yahoo, IRC and more is also available through Pidgin. Video calls can be made over IP using Google Talk. Email supports Mail for Exchange (including 2003) and IMAP/POP3. Nokia/Ovi Messaging provides PUSH email for up to 10 simultaneous accounts, including webmail and keeps the accounts separate. Skype calls can be made using 3G.[PRODUCTIVITY]: Included is Documents To Go, a suite of apps for opening MS Office documents. There's a free version that only opens Office files and a pay version for creating and editing Office files. Full versions of AbiWord and OpenOffice are freely available as well.[MEDIA PLAYER]: The media player works but can be picky. Included are some 720p trailers showing the N900's speed and amazing screen. Codec support is unclear and experimenting with "mostly supported" media can be a stuttering mess. The media player is okay for music but could use some polishing, the lack of an equalizer was a surprising omission for example. There are also free, community media players like VLC available.[PHONE]: As a phone the N900 has some significant shortcomings. By default there are only two modifiable profiles, however new profiles may be created with a free tool called Tweakr. The rotational start of the phone interface takes several moments. There's no way to filter or organize the call log and call duration is not recorded. There's no speed dial functionality and it's not possible to send an SMS or access device settings from the phone screen. The poor proximity sensor opens random screens while in your pocket and there's no per-contact ringtone support. On the positive side, the call quality and signal strength are excellent. MMS is not officially supported but community software fMMS allows its functionality.========================Operating System========================[INTERFACE]: The OS interface is polished and fluid. You can sweep 360 degrees through four desktops filled with your choice of widgets, shortcuts and wallpaper, easily zooming in and out of open applications. The interface is usually quick and responsive but can stutter. When a dialog opens, the application behind it blurs like frosted glass. All context menus are pop-ups dismissed by pressing outside the menu.[MULTITASKING]: Multitasking is phenomenal. You can run every application with no sign of slowing. Taskswitching is thumbnailed showing what each program is. The active program's window shrinks so all open programs are visible at once. Then any window may be closed using the X in the corner in any order.[TECHNICAL]: The default N900 OS is Maemo 5. Maemo was started in 2005 by Nokia being based on Debian. Future Maemo releases will be merged with Intel's Moblin OS creating MeeGo. Nokia originally planned to support the N900 with MeeGo but since has stated that only a Community Supported release will be available for the N900. Maemo supports over-the-air updates and all software is available freely through user defined software repositories. Apt-get also works great. With Maemo there is no app approval process. The platform is open and free, promoting a strong Maemo community and developer network. The current amount of Maemo software is quite limited compared to other platforms, but growing, especially due to the Ovi store offering commercial software. Maemo 5 has some backwards compatibility with Maemo 4.1 software, but it is fairly limited. As of June 2010 there are about 330 Maemo applications available, although judging the total amount of Maemo software is difficult as it does not have a single distribution channel.[ALTERNATIVES]: The N900 does not require signed kernels which means alternative systems may be installed like Mer, Nitdroid, MeeGo and Debian. Images may be booted on a card or flash memory, like multi-booting on a desktop.[SHELL]: Out of box there is a true linux shell with root access. You can install sshfs and mount shares from a server or even insert a kernel module. Characters missing from the keyboard are accessed with Fn+Ctrl. BusyBox with nano and vi are bundled by default.[DEVELOPMENT]: Maemo offers a POSIX environment allowing use as a UNIX system with native software. Useful for *NIX developers since it opens a lot of possibilities. There are a number of different languages available, and more to come. GUI development is done using standard Linux toolkits GTK and Qt. Python is also available. The N900's implementation of Python is not dumbed down, GUIs can be created with popular toolkits like PyGTK and PyQt. Important since there are many developers that already know how to write N900 applications, even if they don't realize it yet.========================Drawbacks & Issues========================No official MMS support. Doesn't work on AT&T;'s 3G network. No magnetometer (digital compass). No 802.11n. No handwriting recognition. No USB-OTG. No voice dialing. No global kinetic scrolling. Lack of multi-touch. Lack of portrait mode software. Scrolling can be jerky. Kickstand is wobbly with only one position. Mail for Exchange doesn't support Google's Active Sync. Lack of software, especially commercial due to the new OS. Various minor GUI issues that need refining. Various other issues not directly related to the device like spotty Ovi/Nokia support, Nokia launch issues and quality control issues.========================Conclusion========================People are saying the N900 is not a Nokia Internet Tablet anymore and it's just a smartphone but when you use it, you really feel like you're using a device that is more than a smartphone. If you understand the limitations, as mentioned above, can deal with the growing pains as software matures, and value the advantages the N900 offers, you'll be really happy with the N900.
I received my n900 just a few days ago from Nokia USA. For the purposes of this review, I will compare it to my previous phone, the HTC G1. My opinions are solely based on the user experiences in the past days with the n900, and since I've never owned an iphone, I will not compare it to such.Physical layout:*The N900 is a pretty beefy phone, and rightfully so. While having some heft to it, the n900 is solid and well-built. The black metal rim is a nice touch without being too gaudy. The slide is not spring-assisted but gives a nice click upon opening and closing. I have not noticed any creaks or wobbles from the screen. Few have complained about the back being hard to open. Although true, I rather have that with the peace of mind that the battery won't pop out if I dropped it (God forbid)! the n900 is of comparable size to the G1, albeit being slightly thicker, and not a problem for me.*I don't really understand all the fuss about resistive and capacitive screens. The n900's screen is gorgeous and is incredibly brilliant. There is a little 'give' to the screen, but I've yet to have problems with it. The screen is quite responsive and supports kinetic scrolling. I did have some difficulty clicking on small links in the browser, but that's because your index finger isn't exactly the most accurate pointing device. This was easily solved by zooming in (more on that later).*The keyboard is pretty good. It is a different experience coming from the G1 (as you have to type with the 'chin' in the way on your right hand) so naturally, it felt better. The keys have a grippy rubberized texture feel to them, and although the buttons are smooshed next to each other, (like a real keyboard) they have good response. I do miss the 5-row keyboard on the G1, and I don't understand why the n900's screen doesn't open up a bit more. For those with large hands, it might be a little uncomfortable. However, one plus for the n900 is that my thumbs don't have to travel as far to type.*I love that the placement of the speakers are on the sides of the phone, as opposed to the back on the G1. I do a lot of talking on speakerphone, and so I'm not forced to flip it upside down during a call. Sound quality is good and the speakers are decent.Maemo 5/ Software*This is the ultimate customization OS. When they meant open source, they really meant it. The 4 desktops make things a lot easier to navigate. For example, one page is devoted to my common phone contacts, another utility apps, the third has bookmarks to frequent sites (the homepages of those links are previewed on the desktop, fyi), and so forth.*The way Maemo multitasks is ingenious. The "overview" page where you see all your actively running programs makes navigating between windows and programs very easy and efficient. One thing to note is that you have the ability to close out any of those windows upon your choosing, as opposed to the G1 where the 6 app limit neither allowed to you open more nor shut them down, making it very sluggish, especially during critical times (ie texting someone directions while running gps).*SMS (called conversations in Maemo) is pretty similar to the G1, but has one added step - conversations either in text or IM by the same person are displayed in the same window. The ability to have the other person's contact image in the text box (that is if you set one up for that person) is a nice touch. I personally don't care about MMS, so no gripes there.*The email client is pretty decent, I set up my gmail account with a few simple steps, but it isn't nearly as accessible as the gmail app on the G1. For example, I haven't found a way to delete an incoming email when it first comes in. I have to leave the letter, go into the inbox, back into the email, then delete it.*Browsing experience is comparable to the pc, and is nothing short of awesome. Full flash means I can access full youtube pages, and among others. I think the "swirling zoom" gesture is pretty neat, and helps me to click on the smaller links. I figured out that using your index to swirl zoom produces the best results. Alternatively, you can double click the screen or use the volume rocker. Going to previous pages not only allows you to go to the last page, but scroll through the entire history of that window. Neat.*Applications-wise, there are not many out there, but I'm certain many will be out soon. You can also access the Maemo repositories for more (google it) but be careful as many of them are still in development and are potentially dangerous to your phone. Noteworthy apps include Hermes (connects your social sites, like facebook to your contacts so you get contact phones, birthdates, etc) and Qik (live streaming recording).Hardware:*Fast, fast, fast. Need I say more?*No hang ups yet, since I can close apps at my own will.*The camera is good, that is for a 5mp phone camera. It will never compare to a dedicated camera, but is more than effective for quick shots to upload on facebook.*The FM transmitter is a great add-on. Now I can share songs without having to look for an aux cable.*Battery life seems to last a little over a day with some text and internet. Wifi is on all the time when I'm at home. My G1 would be down to around 70% by noon.Of course, no phone/mobile device is perfect. Here are some things that came to my attention:*The volume rocker is on the right side (in portrait), meaning it is nearly impossible to use as a zoom when the screen is up. Same goes for the lock switch, which is on the bottom (in landscape). Would have been much better on the sides, as it would be easier to lock after a phone call, for example.*Copy and paste is kinda sporadic. While you can copy all you want on webpages, I couldn't copy a phone number from one contact to another in the phonebook.*The stand is nice, but it swings out way too deep and feels a bit too weak. I'm afraid I'll break it someday.*Little portrait support as of now, but I think it'll be fixed soon.So there you have it. My impressions of the n900. There is still a lot of exploration to be done, but I can honestly say this is the best phone/mobile device I've ever owned. In spite of a few shortcomings, its an amazing piece of technology. A lot of things I didn't mention probably will be fixed within a firmware or two so that isn't a problem. I hope this helps anyone who is on a fence on buying one, good luck!
I pre-ordered my N900 the moment I found out about it, back in September. And I patiently waited, and waited, while watching every demo, preview, and review I could find. With each passing day, I knew I was closer to mobile bliss. And one day, my N900 arrived.Sadly, it didn't really deliver.Having (briefly) owned an N97, I was incredibly disappointed to discover that Nokia has tried their hardest to port elements of Symbian phones to the Maemo platform. Once you're past the (admittedly awesome) desktop effects, the N900 feels disturbingly similar to the N97 in terms of use."Mail Not Responding. Quit?"If you use e-mail, you're going to see this message. Using the included Mail application for Exchange and an IMAP account is painful, to say the least. If you're coming from another Symbian phone, you'll discover that the Mail application is every bit as slow and constrained as your old phone, but does a (marginally) better job of rendering HTML messages. If you're coming from something like an iPhone or BlackBerry, forget about it. Having an iPhone 3G and BlackBerry Bold as well, the messaging on the N900 is infuriating.The screen is gorgeous, in terms of resolution. It's trash in terms of accuracy, if you aren't using the included stylus. I don't have huge fingers, and yet, nearly every tap is either interpreted wrong, or not registered at all. Using kinetic scrolling will inevitably open something you didn't intend to open, or do nothing at all. You'll find yourself asking "Did I tap once or twice?".Web browsing? Brilliant. Seriously. The included web browser is every bit as good as everyone says. Pages render properly, Flash works, zooming in and out is excellent. If you just wanted a handheld web browser and nothing else, I'd recommend this ten times out of ten."But it runs Linux! Linux, Linux, Linux!"Sure. I consider myself to be fairly platform agnostic when it comes to phones, and frankly, the "open" nature of Maemo is something of a red herring. Yes, getting applications on the N900 that aren't blessed by Nokia is relatively easy. Yes, you can compile OpenOffice to work on the N900. The question really is: "Will you?". In a lot of ways, I can see how the N900 would be an excellent tool if I was a Unix / Linux admin who wanted the flexibility to work anywhere without a laptop or netbook. And, there's a certain geek credibility that comes with doing something for the sake of doing it, especially when you have such a portable platform. The N900 is great for those things. And keep in mind, that's largely the audience that Nokia is targeting with the N900.For well over a decade, Nokia's been known for rock-solid performance on signal and voice quality. With the N900, again, they've come short. 3G call quality is decent. If you're outside of a 3G area (which is likely, if you use this with T-Mobile, and a certainty if you're on AT&T;), the N900 has a very difficult time maintaining a decent GPRS/EDGE signal, and dropped calls are frequent. Admittedly, the phone functionality is something of an afterthought from Nokia on this specific model -- but it really shows.As for carrying it around, the N900 isn't quite the "brick" some have claimed it to be. It's definitely substantial, compared to other phones available, though not unreasonable to carry in a pocket. The multimedia functionality is above average, capable of playing just about every type of music and movie format I could throw at it. The camera, while decent, is not substantially better than what you'd find in most midrange to high-end phones in terms of picture quality.Overall, the N900 is a huge series of tradeoffs. For many "it doesn't do..." there are workarounds, or will be workarounds, or might be workarounds. And that's really the crux of my rating. The hardware, in and of itself, is not very special for a phone that costs this much. And the shortcomings may well be addressed, but you have to question how much time and effort you're willing to put in to this device just to bring it at par with similarly priced alternatives. At the same time, there's a lot of wishful thinking, if you aren't prepared to roll up your sleeves and do some development work. "Maybe Nokia will address this in a firmware update..." or "Maybe someone will write a script or program that does this..." will be your mantras if you don't do the work yourself.***January 2010 Update***I'm now on my third N900 -- the previous two were defective.I had considered completely re-writing this review, but too many aspects continue to hold true.What's different:The newer N900 is much more stable, and doesn't crash nearly as often as I had described previously. That's not to say that it doesn't crash, but with the newer hardware and firmware, it no longer crashes if you look at it the wrong way.The developer community is reasonably active on the Maemo platform, and it didn't take very long for some great apps to come out. Installing them doesn't hold a candle to what you'd find on an Android phone or iPhone, but if you're familiar with CVS/SVN or can follow simple instructions, getting some repositories going is a snap, as is finding interesting software. I've been particularly happy with seeing open source projects like Pidgin and Keepass ported over so fast.What's the same:Mail is still pretty terrible, especially if you have a large inbox. Getting the number of messages down will help to make the application more responsive, however, it still is a far cry from what you'd see in competing smartphones on every major platform. It also inexplicably stops updating (yes, fanboys, even when it's not set for off-peak hours), and the "Last Updated" timestamp rarely correlates to reality.The OS still needs refinement. Case in point: It simply doesn't do a good job of telling you that it's busy. Sure, nobody wants to build an hourglass (or spinning beachball) in to their OS, but there are times when the OS is just bogged down when you're positive the screen isn't registering taps.All things being equal, I'm still going to hold to my original conclusion that the N900 isn't for the general consumer looking to out iPhone the iPhone. But for someone not afraid of rolling up their sleeves, the N900 can be an amazing device for Unix aficionados and hard-core gadget geeks.Oh... and a quick tip: This car charger works perfectly with the N900, and is dirt cheap: Motorola P513 Vehicle Power Adapter MicroUSB Rapid Rate Charger
It's simple. I love this phone. Now a day I'm not easily excited or impressed by a phone. Couple of years back, you had a game changing new model every four to six months. But now, I bought the Xperia X1 last Dec and I don't find any drastic improvements in the last year or so.And to start with N900 wasn't even on my radar a couple of months back. I was too busy drooling over the HD2 and X10. Since both are about 6 months away (at least states side). I turned my attention to N900 and I'm so impressed. I feel how I did 4-5 years back having a smartphone which could browse web and check mails.One word of advice though, actually a couple. Don't approach this phone as a phone. Think of it as an internet tablet with phone capability. Next, don't think it would replace your iPhone or an Android mobile feature for feature.Put it this way,1. You are never going to get 10,000 or so apps on this.2. You don't get the eye candy or the capacitive touch screen3. Nothing is laid out to you. No entering your gmail id and see the phone set it itself4. It's no iPod. Not a multimedia device per sayBut,1. The resistive touch screen is not bad. In fact its one of the best I have used. Take my word for it, this wont be a deal breaker. Just don't expect iPhoneish response2. I love the display. One of the few with 16M colors and it shows. It has a 480x800 display and it has 4 'desktops'. Love making the 480x3200 wallpaper.3. Love the Skype and IM integration. First time the phone rang, it took me 5 mins to realize it's through Skype.4. The browser and the legendary flash support. It's good, it's amazing. But be aware its not v10, its still v95. The keyboard is good and feels good too. But need time to get used to the right aligned space bar6. Its not iPhone. Thank God for it.7. Phone looks solid and built quality is top notch.8. Has 32GB and a micro sd slot.Few other things to know, <Edit 01/21/2010>1. Cam is not all that impressive2. BT is almost unusable. The phone shuts off the speakers (this incl calls and alarm) while connected to the headset. You have to wear the head set all the time or expect to miss calls and meetings.~~ This has been fixed in the recent software update  2a. The phone frequently disconnects the headset after a call and need to restart the headset to connect again.~~ This is also fixed.3. Setting up the exchange server is pain in all the wrong places  3a. Google exchange is not supported  3b. Works fine with Nuevasync but wont sync mail more than 2 weeks. Get an server not responding message if you set to anything more than 2 weeks.~~ Now it supports MFX 2003 too. I haven't tried google but there is not off word yet that its supported. But Nuevasync works fine4. Full fledge Skype app is still not ready5. Ovi store for N900 is not ready ~~ Ovi store is now open6. N900 is not added to the Ovi services (like contacts, calendar and others)~~ Still not supported.7. Not very impressed by the Ovi map~~ The Ovi map got a little improvement but the newly announced free Turn by turn nav support is not coming to N900 as of now.8. Nokia messaging is nice but I would prefer a native idle IMAP support (to get push mail from IMAP servers)~~ The idle IMAP support is still missingg  8a. Nokia messaging is very slow. When you open it only the local folder show up. Even the already downloaded mail don't show up instantly. It take a about 5 secs to get everything going.~~They have fixed this. Now its pretty bearable. take about 1-2 sec for a new msg to open.9. Do not use the facebook widget, it drains the battery like there is no tomorrow. Actually like there in no today evening10. Though the app list would grow; its still has only about 50 or so apps.11. No native google voice support11. Phone can't be used in portrait mode. Except for the dialer. For me this is no issue. In fact I love it can work only in landscape.Conclusion:This phone has great potential, but a lot of quirks. These are both software and hardware. Example, why no capacitive screen? why no bigger battery, why no IDLE support? Why can't it sync mails through google's exchange server? why is the Nokia messaging so slow? why can't I sync more than 2 weeks of mails from nuevasync?These might be answered in a software update and the next models (they have already announced that 2010 will see an upgrade) will be much more refined.I have a feeling this phone is not for the masses but if you are a gadget junky and need a new fix now and again, you can't do nothing wrong with this phone. Get it with eyes closed.Folks looking for an iPhone replacement, please keep searching. This one is not for you.PS: I lost my N900 this week, for a sec I thought about the Nexus 1 but still decided to get this.Links to the points above:BT Issue:[...]Exchange Issue:[...]Nokia messaging issue:[...].
Nokia is right when they refer to this device as a Mobile computer.  I've been using it for almost a week and it surpasses all my expectations, and bear in mind that Nokia will be pushing updates to the OS to make it even better.The web browsing experience can only be matched by a computer, no smartphone even the iphone (I own a 3G iphone for over a year) come close.Skype integration is outstanding, 5mpixel camera is great, gps and compass work great with ovi maps, screen resolution and size are perfect!All features work under 3G, no hacking necessary.Corvette=IphoneLamborghini=N900In a few words, if you like to excel this is your phone!
I just got the phone yesterday and let me tell you it is amazing.  I am coming from a iphone 2g so it does take a little while to get used to the touch screen but once you do it is way better then the iphone.  The screen is the best I have seen almost looks like a AMOLED screen.  The Camera is very good takes amazing pictures, and video.  The keyboard is very good and easy to get use to.  The phone has a 2.1 speaker system that sounds amazing for a phone, very clear and amazing quality.  I had a issue with hearing or feeling my iphone ring or vibrate and this phone is far better I can hear and feel when I receive a call or a text 10 times better then the iphone.  I really enjoy the widgets I just cant wait until more are made for the device.  The phone is very smooth in transitions, and does not get laggy while listening to music and web browsing at the same time at all for me.  The internet is by far the best on a phone I have seen.  My T-mobile service is far better then what I had on a iphone there is no comparison at all.  I cant say anything but good things about this phone if you get one you will never regret it this phone is well worth the wait to get one.  Nokia did a amazing job on this phone all they need to do is have someone develop new widgets and come out with the ovi app store and the phone will be unstoppable.
I currently use an iPhone 2G with T-mobile that I bought unlocked on eBay and as much as I would like a 3G iPhone, it wont work on Tmobile network so my next alternative was to look at this incredible phone/computer Nokia N900. I will keep this review simple and easy.Pros:- Incredible software - Maemo- Multi tasking at its best!- FM Transmitter is just incredible- Bluetooth is not stunted like that of iPhone!- Sync software is one of the best and you can sync the phone via Bluetooth !!!!!!- Very easy to navigate and very intuitive settings- Easy to set up emails.. but (see the continuation of this under 'cons')- Camera is 5MP with Carl Zeiss lens and is probably the best I have seen on any phone yet- Video shoots at DVD Quality - Drop your camcorder, camera if you have this phone !!- GPS - what can I say!!! It took about 8-10 seconds to get the location fix and is incredibly accurate- FM Radio - finally can listen to web/radio FM songs- Powerful WiFi antenna- Flash support for browsers - Finally a phone with real world computer like browsing experience- Interface is fast and superlative- Screen has a Haptic feedback which helps tremendously!!- Skype Integration - OMG This is the best feature ever !!!- Python !!! - N900 apps will be made using the simplest language after Basic - Python!! So hold your horses for an explosion of apps very soon..Cons:- It has a resistive screen and not capacitive so the responsiveness is not as much as the iPhone but hey, I can use a stylus... and not have to take my gloves off in COLD WINTERY DAYS!- Email client is iffy, Does not support Exchange 2003 yet but only Exchange 2007 - (an update is in the process to fix this)- Yahoo push email service is missing - I could not get folders to show up but just the inbox was able to load- Except the phone (which works in both portrait and landscape modes) everything else works only in landscape modes and again a Nokia update supposedly before the end of the year is going to fix this !- Very limited apps at this point- Weight and size - but again don't compare this to the iPhone which is stunted in features but only good on Apps that are free and mostly games!!!- No 3G for ATT .. Did not affect me since I am on Tmobile!Overall, this is one of the most promising phones that I have ever seen with so much packed into this device, I can only foresee Nokia getting a N910, 920 without the physical keyboard and cutting the weight and size of this beast which will then be the iPhone killer!!!This phone needs some getting used to and getting accustomed to. There is a certain learning curve associated with the phone, but once you cross that, the sky is the limit to what you can do with this phone!Go get it, you won't be disappointed one bit but remember that this is not for everyone so choose wisely :)..
i just got this phone... and as of now.. im not having big problem on itim writing this review using the phone itself...lets begin with the speed...speed is great... i never encounter lagging yet... changing from one apps to another is fast and smooth... it can also handle lots of apps in the same time as it can do multi tasking....touch screen is very nice... good resolution.. with resistive touchscreen.. u cant even tell if its if really resistive.. the responsiveness of the screen is good..apps... well its a open source os.. and when you setup the download section of the phone.. u have hundreds and going to thuosand free apps... very nice phone.. i tried to down load irreco for n900.. and ur phone can be a UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL  on tv.. and other appliances...web browser is the best feature... there's nothing i can say with it.. very useful for me.. coz i can even do my homework online using this.. or even making document files and presentation...camera and video.. not very impressed with the camera... for me n97 has better camera quality than this.. but its almost the same..maemo os.. well if your new on it.. u'll find it hard to set up some stuffs... but it will give you a real computer experience... with the panorama desktop.. it a nice place to put all ur apps...tv out is nice feature of this while ur surfing the internet or watching a movie.. it shows a nice picture resolution on a 50 inch hdtv... very clear...there are some issue with os.. but i have no worries on that because with just an update it will bw fixed... when ur using the browser the use of the volume button is zoom in and out.. so u need to go on the desktop and adjust the volume... on some items.. that need to be tapped twice to openn.. with just one tap its opening... theres only two prfile and its general and silent...keyboard is very nice.. its easy to type on it.. well i dont want to waste time typing here if it is not... stylus is long enough....i used t own an iphone and still having my n97.. well this a better phone than both.. but still there are some feature that this phone behind on the two.. so if ur planning to buy this phone... i recommend this to all of you... and just clear things up.. this is not a phone, smartphone, this is a internet tablet that just happen to make call and sms.. but for me its not a internet tablet either.. its a pocket size computer...
[Edit - Jan 24, 2010 Update:Two firmware updates a couple weeks ago so after testing, time for an update: If you NEED bluetooth like I do and don't plan to carry two phones/devices to have bluetooth available, read on.So little progress has been made and I have seen far too many bugs/enhancements closed as WONTFIX that I am dropping this to 1-star based on current state, 2 updates and price to value in comparison with other devices that have launched/will launch in the next month or so. I'll change the rating depending on next update - length of wait will be factored in. I see a lot of bashing for people who give low reviews so I expect I'll hear about this.I'll start by quoting Nokia from bug 6766 regarding bluetooth problems on the phone. This came after the major PR1.1 update:"As far as making all issues go away, I don't think that's physically possible since Bluetooth and WLAN share the same antenna in the N900. Some WLAN operations, such as searching for access points, take over the antenna almost completely."All the bluetooth bugs still exist, some are made worse by PR1.1.Note: regardless of what people say, there is NO way, zero, none, nada, to turn off the wifi radio via graphical interface. You can probably do so via CLI if you are very advanced with Linux and not worried about re-flashing, but that's not practical. You can take several steps to make it "less active", but it is still running - easiest to see is choose "Internet Connections" from the status area and it will show all wifi APs even though you think it is disabled. Nokia closed an enhancement request to allow customers to fully disable the wifi radio as WONTFIX.The major update of the two, known as PR1.1, was eagerly awaited and expected to fix a lot of problems including the well known, very active, bluetooth bugs. Nothing I listed has been addressed and the firmware addressed a few minor things overall-nothing major. Important to note that the manifest list posted for PR1.1 lists A LOT of bugs as fixed that were actually fixed before the phone was released. I have noticed a lot of people's tones have changed since the disappointing update.PR1.1:Bluetooth: The PR1.1 update did help some who had a lot of issues with 'stuttering' on bluetooth (music and calls). For most of us, it didn't. One person who initially seemed happy and said he'd live with it came back a day or two later and said it's not fixed. Long story short, read bug 6766 on maemo's bug site. For me and others, PR1.1 has increased disconnections to a point that I don't bother trying to use BT now. It essentially disconnects immediately. When I was testing PR1.1, a couple times the connection lasted several minutes, but the majority is instant disconnect. If you need bluetooth, I would hold off.Portrait mode: They are working towards it, that's good. The browser has a partial implementation now (it's nice for one handed reading, good formatting, but not complete). Tip: you have to hit a combination of shift+ctrl+O to activate it; it works with keyboard slider in only. To disable, shift+ctrl+O again. However, I have 'remnants' of the future with my desktop sticking in portrait randomly requiring a restart. Not a huge deal unless you are in a hurry to make a call.USSD codes: The *#nnn#nnnnnn# to do many controls on your phone like say, enable full forwarding since it is not available in the interface or check prepaid balance, etc. etc. They fixed a couple codes: show your IMEI and show the software version (both available in settings | 'about phone' right next to each other). They closed this bug as fixed - a lot of very unhappy people on this one. I think Nokia (well, probably Maemo since they don't know phones yet) really underestimated how important this is - it is clear from the huge bug thread that a lot of the codes people need are surprising to them.Maps: It starts up a little quicker. A few minor tweaks that aren't worth mentioning. I was hoping I could at least do routing to an address. You can, but open your browser and go to google maps.Anything else I don't mention, there is nothing to mention. It was an underwhelming update that decreased battery life further, addressed several small issues. Some had ZERO votes and only 1 person involved with the ticket and it was very small - e.g. RDS name in the FM transmitter???. Clearly poor prioritization.Other stuff: The battery charges much faster now, but it also drains much faster. There are some great apps starting to show in the pipeline. A lot of hard work from the community going on and new things are showing up daily in devels and testing repositories. They just aren't hitting extras (production) fast enough.BTW - my review is not meant to be 'negative' - I am simply stating known issues that a potential buyer may not know. I just haven't repeated the positive or taken the speculative position of hoping to see the potential realized. My intent is very simple: provide a different view that isn't one of infatuation that simply repeats the specs on the Nokia site. Provide information that would have had me think twice before purchasing. I know what you might be thinking: would I repurchase it now? No. Not then and not now.End update]---------------------------I've had the N900 over a month so I'm familiar enough with the N900 now to write comfortably.I had high expectations and loved the N900 for the first 2-days. Every day since I've grown more disappointed. I should have sent it back for a refund w/in the first couple weeks (pre-ordered from Nokia). But, I was optimistic on the potential, which has withered as I've watched Nokia/Maemo do not-so-amazing things on [...]. The N900 is not complete - not even close. They've left out a lot of what we have grown to love and expect with other current smartphones (this really doesn't qualify as a tablet). Time on[...] has me very discouraged. They are very focused on Maemo 6 and it's obvious they consider Maemo 5 primarily in maintenance mode.I am still amazed that they released the N900 as is. Bugs, I expect, but I didn't expect it to be missing some very basic features that are now standard. I also didn't expect them to turn actual bugs into low priority enhancements or completely dismiss them as "WONTFIX".---------------------------------------Some quotes from Maemo/Nokia on [...]:If the reporter expects the feature to be officially supported then it is a WONTFIX [common comment]I think I can resolve this as WONTFIX entirely, since the feature can be perfectly covered by the community. [This is to create a function to disable/enable wifi]Isn't "Settings -> About" a more user-friendly way to look up the same? [This is about the lack of support of using USSD codes - simply weird]---------------------------------------One review mentioned it's built with steel, aluminum, rubber and plastic. Wish I could find more than plastic. It is very 'plasticky', feels fat, heavy and it looks cheap - nothing like the picture. It looks & feels like a digital camera you might have purchased 5-years ago. How did DROID get essentially the same internals into such a thin form factor and Nokia managed to make it look 10-years old?There are many positives about the N900 (and it does have strong *potential*). Many were written about. I won't re-write them. However, I will note many 'gotchas' that you would not expect from a 'flagship' phone from any manufacturer. The aggregate of the gotchas add up to borderline unusable (in my opinion). I'm not going to list everything, but will put down what would have me think twice about buying. I should have waited for an update or two. I can't say it looks promising though.Below are known issues. One is not confirmed by Maemo/Nokia, but the majority are WONTFIX or being left to the "community" (i.e. not Maemo/Nokia) - with a couple pushed for *consideration* for Maemo 6 (Harmattan). Bluetooth they "think" may be fixed in a future update. USSD codes they seem to be looking at (but haven't seen a confirmation of fix).I have noticed Nokia leaves it for the community to implement many basic features. Why would they bother with basic features for one of the most expensive phones out there? Even if you want an open platform and are familiar with Maemo, you wouldn't (least I don't) expect them to push so much to be done by the community. Android doesn't take things that far - sure, it's 'mostly' open, but they package the basics with the Android builds.- OS: It appears Fremantle (Maemo 5 that comes on the N900) is essentially in maintenance mode already. I've spent weeks on[...] and watched as they apply "WONTFIX" to many basic features that were reported as missing, marked true bugs as enhancements and low priority (e.g. doesn't allow you to use USSD codes - *#...#), sent enhancement requests to their "brainstorming" site, and many requests they accept are assigned to *possible* Harmattan (Maemo 6) inclusion.What does this mean? It's possibly outdated already.- LINUX: Better know Linux. Due to the lack of settings and missing granularity in those that exist, you'll need to know Linux to make many changes/check certain settings. If you do, it's just a pain to make changes via the terminal rather than using a GUI.- SETTINGS: There are very few settings. The settings that exist have very little granularity. No easy wifi on/off, only two profiles (general and silent) with very little available to configure. Click 3-4 times just to change the display brightness. No way to set a 'home' desktop that you and I are used to -nor is there a way to get to a particular desktop easily besides using both hands and swiping. Plenty more.- BLUETOOTH: Nearly unusable. There are two major, known issues: 1) it uses the same antennae as WiFi so if you have wifi on (takes 7-steps to disable it fully), bluetooth headsets are unusable: too much static heard on both ends, A2DP music has static and pauses, file transfers run around 20kbps and disconnect often. 2) Constantly disconnects. Live in a state/country where you must use hands-free while driving? Don't like holding the phone to your ear for long calls? Want to type while on the phone? Want mobility while you talk? You can't. It disconnects anywhere from instantly to several minutes. Upon disconnection, the sound doesn't transfer to the handset. It normally takes a power cycle to get things reoriented.- WIFI: Looking for an easy way to disable wifi when not using it? Sorry, we're not talking 1-2 steps for Android or 3 for iPhone, it takes 7-steps to disable (you have to assume it's disabled - no way to tell if the radio is off and maemo/Nokia haven't said for sure) and re-enable. Reported as a bug on [...] - they consider it an enhancement, pushed it off to Harmanttle as possible inclusion and said they'll let the community write something for Maemo 5 (nothing in the pipeline as of this writing). Hope you don't need to disable/enable wifi often.- BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD: Sorry. Several other smartphones support, but the N900 doesn't. I have an N810 and many of us expected the N900 to take its place as a tablet, but with a phone. Nokia/Maemo's official response? Not supported it and it won't be. They've marked several submitted bugs on this as WONTFIX. There is a way to get a BT keyboard to pair (if you know Linux), but don't bother, it doesn't support typical PC-105 layout and only some letters will work.- LANDSCAPE: I didn't think landscape would be that bad. It supports portrait in phone (if you can get it to move to portrait), but that's it. It is a BIG pain, especially if you want to use the device with one hand. Just entering a 5-digit PIN to unlock with one hand is very difficult. It might be livable, but the implementation is very poor.- MAIL FOR EXCHANGE (MfE): Far too many bugs to mention here. Barely usable - supports HTML now, but a few steps backward everywhere else. I'll hit a few: Doesn't properly map fields (both contacts and calendar), doesn't synchronize updates properly, doesn't seem to properly support the EAS protocol in general, won't properly synch with Google's EAS implementation (they said this isn't supported), etc.- MAPS: Can't use maps without a network connection. If you download map files - still no go. Also, Ovi Maps 1.0 takes ~10-minutes (sometimes longer) to locate your position. GPS is on, but Maps shows it's not active much of the time. I've found no way to route to an address; only two options: point to it on a map or type in a city/state/country in a search dialog - can't search for an address. Very slow.  Pretty much useless unless you want to know you are sitting on the right couch. No clue what Nokia was thinking with this.- GPS/CAMERA: If you want proper geo-tagging, you'll need to buy another device. GPS on, but photo is not tagged. It will tag sometimes if you have network positioning on.- BASICS: Are you looking for standard/basic functionality that your other phones you've had over the last few years have? The N900 is missing a lot. Far too many to list, but in addition to what's already been mentioned a few are: word suggestion is poor with no auto-correct (even a standalone "i" is not capitalized and it doesn't work in some areas), can't use USSD codes, no unconditional call forwarding, can't select different ring tone for contacts, can't mark contacts to automatically go to VM, can't change amount of ring time before going to VM, etc.- EMAIL CLIENT: Tinymail-based (not bad). Very poor implementation and the email client is very limited. Can't highlight text and copy, doesn't synch any folder but inbox and sent (you can view other IMAP folders, but if you delete an item - it's gone for good - no synch and no trash on N900, drafts stay on phone, etc.). Maemo/Nokia are on record saying this will never happen because "it's too complex" (common saying[...]), but look for it in Harmattan - maybe. Doesn't auto-fill/suggest as you type a name in TO/CC/BCC. No choice to return to inbox after deleting a message - you can only view the next message.- EMAIL CLIENT: Have to confirm each and every delete. There is no option to remove confirmation. If you deal with a high volume of email, it's a big irritant. It's been submitted as an enhancement request with Nokia's current response as "It would be interesting to how popular such request is" :-/ Weird that such basic functionality in every email client (mobile or not) that I can think of isn't on the N900 or its roadmap.Very poor email client - worst I've seen on a mobile device in years.This doesn't include all issues, but the review is long enough. Hopefully it helps with a bit of a different perspective by someone who has gotten over the infatuation and spent a lot of time working with Nokia/Maemo.
I just received my phone today from Dell, and all I have to say is I'm amazed how beautiful this phone is. My N97 will be going on Ebay tonight for sure:)Here is my review about this phone so far:It is the first of its kind internet tablet offered by the biggest name in the Mobile industry, Nokia. This phone runs on the powerful Linux based operating system, Nokia's Maemo version 5.0. This significant alteration in the operating system makes it different from the rest of Nokia's phones based on Symbian OS. This handset comes with the complete package of Maemo internet browser. You can easily access Mozilla browser engine at any time and any place. The Nokia N900 also features Adobe Flash 9.4. The striking advantage of this cell phone is its provision to drag and drop numerous desktop widgets. You can further build multiple desktop set up templates with the help of this cell phone.This cell phone is equipped with one of the most exciting features. TAP! Yes, if you tap for a longer period, you can gain access to windows, documents, call logs and other tab based functions. It is loaded with an animated menu interface. This makes your navigation task joyful. Further, its intuitive interface allows you to multi-task within a brim of few seconds. You would find most of the web based utilities pre-installed in this cell phone. Some of the utilities are Twitter, Facebook, OVI etc. It has an inbuilt Web 2.0 network, Webmail Inbox. Let's just say, this phone is loaded with all the essential features required to make it a good replacement for your notepad.What's more? This cell phone has a sliding QWERTY keyboard which opens on the side. It offers you a resistive touch screen with a high resolution of 800X480 pixels. This device also features a camera of 5 megapixels. The camera is further upgraded with an add-on feature of F2.8 lens. These features allow you to click crystal clear and vibrant pictures. This cell phone comes with micro SD card slot. This slot has the storage capacity of 32 GB. The total memory space of this power packed cell phone is 64 GB.This cell phone has an excellent display resolution of 800 X480 pixels. It features a wide screen of 3.5 inches to make your video and picture viewing experience par excellence. It is loaded with PowerVR SGX in a combination with OpenGL ES 2.0 3D accelerator engine. This feature works wonder at rendering high end graphics and graphical presentations. This cell phone is loaded with a plethora of features to enhance its connectivity. Some of these features include High speed 3G, WLAN, HSDPA and Wi-Fi. In addition it is loaded with varied features to enable a prompt internet connection. Features like Regular WCDMA, GPRS, EDGE and WAP ensure powerful internet connection in this cell phone. The inbuilt GPS system is integrated with OVI Maps technology. Further, it also offers you Geo tagging features that help you enable a better understanding of near and remote areas. It sports a wide range of entertainment features like Stereo based FM, stereo loudspeaker, music player, video player, Mp4 player etc. This handset supports the majority of media files like Flash, Mp3, MPEG, Mp4, FLV, RM, etc.Anyways, If you are not sure about this phone yet. I will say buy it, you will not be disappointed!
Absolutely amazing...its a computer frankly, not a phone.(1) Most sensitive resistive screen I have used, with the advantage of the accuracy of a resistive (opposed to the lack of accuracy with capacitive)(2) amazingly easy to be in touch, everything just 'works'Just remember the phone functions compared to other phones are in their infancy, and they are speedily working on updates. GIven that, this is definitely the right direction!
The package did not come with any air bags not even a box....which suprised me a lot. Luckily the phone was fine.As for the product, I think it's more about Nokia instead of Amazon. The product is really an unfinished product but definitely the product I'd like to taste the fresh.Pros:Smooth touch screen. Excellent quality of music. Friendly experience of web browsing.Cons:The camera regularlly says something like 'unexpected error' (sorry guys I forget the exact words) which makes you unable to take any pictures unless you restart it. The front camera quality is a disaster.Other thoughts: By the way I tried i-touch which maybe more or less like the experience of iphone. To be honest, I think nokia did better job at making touch screen.Overall: You should buy it considering it's less than $600 and UNLOCKED!Argument:Some people may think if the product available in US does not neccessary have to include Chinese input. I agree. But I tell yo what, as a MID plus phone fuction product which is the Nokia N900, I do not see any reason they put this aside. I heard someone saying 'well, it's US, English is native language'. I have to say 'man,even English is not native language in China, we still like to have English input in our every device'. does that make sense? Please forgive me if this argument offense someone.
ADDED after having it for 3 weeks and a trip abroad:1) Main camera is really good, no matter what some people say. I made night and low light landscape pictures, no flash, from hand, and the quality is damn good for a phone camera. Flash is good enough to take night pictures of an object about 3 yards away. Daylight pictures - of amazing quality, especially landscapes.2) Built-in maps work off-line, which means, I don't need an internet connection to navigate. Download the maps of the area where you are going to beforehand, while you have a wi-fi or a cheap data plan, and then if you happen to not have an internet access when you are out there, you still will have the maps of the area. You'll have your GPS position on the map and still will be able to use the routing features. It's not perfect, since search of places by name will not work (search depends on internet access), but you can chose locations by pointing at them on the map. Network positioning will not work, of course, you'll have to rely on GPS only.3) I had to restart my phone just once in over 3 weeks, which I think is pretty good.4) Battery life never was a problem at all. With all the picture taking I had to recharge the phone only once in 2 days. I don't keep the GPS on all the time, only activate it as needed, which probably does the trick. I must admit that I don't text or browse uncontrollably, so probably I can be classified as a light user.5) The absence of MMS was disapponting. Normally, you always have email so you can live without it. But while travelling I found myself in a situation when I had no cheap and easy internet access for a while. So I had no email and no MMS, hence no way to share those beautiful pictures with anyone! As far as I can see, there already are some applications allowing to send MMS from N900, but I haven't tried them yet.Original review:I have my Nokia N900 for 3 days now, and I honestly don't understand complaints that the interface is not simple enough. For example, many reviews say that it's not so intuitive how to switch to a phone call mode, and that you need to use both hands to do it. Actually, it's very easy: select an option which launches the phone application each time the  phone is turned into a portrait mode - and voila! - the phone launches itself with the wave of your hand. If that is not easy enough, then I don't know. I didn't have any problems with the interface at all. From my point of view, it's very intuitive. I must admit though that I am a professional programmer, and it kind of helps.Other than that, I guess I agree with the majority of reviewers.Pros: all hardware is just excellent. I didn't see specs like that for any other phone. As far as I could see, all the hardware really works as expected. Interface very nice and completely customizable. I like the way the Contacts are organized and managed. VoIP is integrated, contacts from Skype are imported into the regular phone book - very convenient. Nice main camera. Browsing perfect. Email perfect. Unlocked, which means that I can buy a local SIM card when I travel abroad, and save on roaming. Again unlocked, which means that I can switch providers if my T-Mobile stops being the best choice for this device. Plus I generally like Nokia products, they are very robust.Cons: Built-in maps have a very rudimentary interface, and no upgrade available. There is no problem with routing itself, but I didn't find any way to save my waypoints or select my waypoints from the contact list. That should be annoying if you have to use it more than once in a while. Built-in Skype doesn't allow video calls, even though there is a front camera just for these purposes. Lack of applications - personally for me it is not a big problem, I am too busy to worry about having games and specifically wanted just an Internet tablet. But for a person who needs to kill time playing games it might be a deal-breaker.Applications: funny, but even though there only 80+ available, so far I've found all I really needed, except good maps. Maybe I will need much more very soon - appetite comes as you eat - but so far this thing does all that I needed it to do. I can view documents, I can read email, I can browse internet. I can get weather on my desktop. I can get directions when I need them once in a while. I can call my relatives overseas for free via Skype-to-Skype calls. I can track my outdoor activities. I can take notes and make hand-writen notes to pdf files, almost as I would do while reading paper documents.Bottom line: all the cons that I see are on the software side, that is they should be fixable with a software upgrade or new applications. The hardware part is just excellent, so let's hope we'll see more excellent applications for n900 in the near future.
i received this phone last week and since then i have been playing at my max capacity with it, this phone is absolutely outstanding! is a beast! the nokia n900 is not comparable with other phone in the market. I'm a heavy mobile phone user and i had fully tested and owned for several weeks the palm pre, the iphone 3gs, and the motorola droid and none of those mobiles are comparable to the nokia n900.now depending what you are looking for this is my recommendation:a) if you want free for life GPS turn by turn you should buy an android phone or a motorola droid, android phones have a cool user interface but is very limited and have a lot of constraints.b) if your thing is to download useful and a lot of junk apps you should buy an iphone. the multi touch in this phone is awesome, and the responsiveness of the screen is superb and the phone is very fast.c) if you want to have a nice user interface in your phone and have a slick design in your pocket you should buy the palm pre the web os is very nice and the responsiveness and speed is equal as the iphone.d) if you want to have the top notch web browser ever, want everything slick, multitasking, have full flash in your web pages and all the above mentioned you should buy  the n900. the speed, the storage capacity, the screen resolution, the physical keyboard is Fu..ing Great!, the screen is resistive and feels like you are touching a capacitive like the iphone, is absolutely awesome.also the 5 mega pixel camera is very cool, the contacts management is by far the greatest i ever seen in a device, you can manage to do anything with your contact AT THE SAME TIME, i mean, you can Google chat with him, Skype call, normal call, email him at the same time.so far 90% of the user interface works only in landscape mode, and for me is better that way, also that is why the palm pre have the biggest flaw, because only works in portrait mode except for the web browser.All the new top devices are switching from portrait to landscape, like the motorola droid, HTC, the latest Samsung and LG devices, the sonny Ericsson xperias and even the iphone had to switch for the keyboard landscape and lots of applications. portrait mode is in the pasts and only works well in contacts or dialing a number.The tv interaction with the n900 is gorgeous, you can search on youtube.com so can see what is like.so far for me this is the best device with huge potential and excellent web browsing experience i ever seen. it is way better than anything in the market right now.
i got my device today and was very afraid to open it because of the nightmares i read here like dead pixels, mic problems, buggy, pitch black screen, etc.. fortunately, i haven't found any serious problems on my n900. the only issue i found is that it crashed for no apparent reason during the first hour of using it and it crashed again when i turned it on (charger plugged) after it ran out of power when things started to get sluggish and somewhat unresponsive. but after that, it's working smoothly now...after 4 years of not using a nokia phone (whatever series), it took me a while to learn again how things work w/ nokia's interface (looks and usage still feels symbian-ish even it's a different os). i grew up with only using nokia phones since the monochromatic screen days of 5110i till the cutesy 6230 so i can say that i'm kinda familiar with nokia phones. in my opinion, this isn't a device for everyone like the iphone. people may not like it as it's too complicated for their brains and just want to be spoon fed as easy as ABC. it's a computer for crying out loud and not a fashion gimmicky phone like what everybody is expecting for all devices to be. if the os and the processor is stronger than your brain, then this isn't for you...during the years that i haven't been using a nokia device, i had a love and hate relationship with windows mobile 5, 6, 6.1 and a very short time with android's g1. android back then is still an infant and although a stable os, i had the feeling that it's open source-ness isn't really open so i immediately backed off of using it further and i was right. windows 5 and 6 is great as it's like a windows pc version except it's mobile so using it isn't a problem. 6.1 is a nightmare that i don't want to narrate anymore...i must say too that i think a have a fetish with devices with hardware keyboards as my previous devices (htc wizard, kaiser, dream) all has it. it's weird because i don't really use it often and rely on just poking the screen and using the virtual keyboard as much as possible. maybe a subconscious taste for having that feature regardless if weight will be sacrificed...now, i'm using a new os for me as i have no background of using a linux in my entire life. this is my first time so i had doubts before pre ordering it. luckily, it passed my techie taste and hopes that it will have a good future and will be pushed to it's limit before maemo 6 comes out halfway or late next year to kill maemo 5 w/c the n900 is using...nokia is already great for making quality devices. the built is great, sturdy slide-out keyboard, location of things (lock, volume, stylus, usb slot, etc.) is tolerable although allocating it equally on all sides is much better rather than cramping too much beneath and the right side of the device in a portrait mode description. it also wouldn't hurt if they just placed the memory card slot at sim card slot at the back of the screen for easier accessibility like the htc kaiser...pros:* programs open really fast* screen is sharp and bright* virtual keyboard is very finger friendly* built is great* great os and very promising* built in microB browser and firefox beta 5 for maemo eats all those gimmicky browsers out there alive* 1700 mhz 3g (yehey for me!!! XD)* resistive screen is way better for this than capacitive. it gives more accurate inputs w/c is ideal for a computer (that's what nokia is labeling the n900)* not really that thick as some reviews say. it's a bit thinner than htc kaiser and possibly as equal as htc touch pro 2* not as heavy as htc kaisercons:* somewhat a half baked device (hopefully, ovi gives us more app especially fm tuner to activate the feature. maemo org. helps at some point but it's better if nokia supports it too like they do on symbian)* definitely needs a firmware upgrade to support some if not all programs in portrait mode* camera is so-so* a 3g device with a front camera but can't do video call as of now (i know t-mo doesn't have the video call service but european and asian networks that uses the 2100mhz 3g are supported as well as the video call service)* the device stand is really thin and flimsy. it's scary to think that it will break sooner or later* 3 row keyboard and small buttons (htc wizard and kaiser have 4 rows and way bigger buttons. if htc can do it, why can't nokia?)
I really like it, everything is really good..except the phone I got it from Amazon.com was unopened item..and I was the first user but when i use the phone, it keeps rebooting randomly without a reason so I keep losing what i write and i have to rewrite, which I didn't install any software or did anything in a phone..and when i contacted Nokia costumer service, they asked me to return it.and it was so disappointed because they didn't try even to fix it.and i found online that I wasn't the only one who has this problem.and no one can find a solution for it.just most of them are waiting for update software..over all, I think i will return it because i can't stand it this problem.
Where to begin...this phone is awesome!  I had a few issues right out of the box ( Just got it yesterday ), but both resolved over night after I let it fully charge and the following morning after redoing the tasks they were fine.I got a unit from the second batch and so far the second batch seems like Nokia fixed the kinks from the first one.  If you want a phone that does everything from SSH, DNS, Apache, to Xvid, Divx videos, then this phone is truly the King of phones.  I'm typing this review as we speak from my N900 via the Mozilla browser and I can tell you iPhone owners be scared...be very scared of this thing!The browser itself is getting updated at the end of Dec with the newest FULL ( Yes I said full ) Adobe Flash so it should be able to play sites like Hulu more smoothly ( although I didn't have a problem with watching standard videos via the browser on Hulu ) since the Flash that comes with the browser straight out of the box is the old 9.6 version.  Just having full Adobe Flash not that Flashpoint crap solidified my decision on pre-order and getting this device.Oh and today I setup a remote DNS with Apache on the phone and have already had two friends test it out and OMG, is it great--what other phone can do that?? NONE!To address the critics:You'll hear people say, oh well it doesn't have allot of apps so that's why it sucks, well neither did Apple or Android when they first came out.  It take's time when a new OS is released but their are already a bunch of apps that are available.  You'll also hear people say well Android multi tasks and it's also a Linux platform...the only thing Linux about Android is the Kernel and Android is not an open platform, whereas Maemo is almost full Linux but in the mobile version and you have full access to all coding within Maemo and customization as much as you want unlike Google or Apple who go after people who customize the OS.MMS as well as full portrait mode control ( portrait is already available but you have to do a little trick with opening and closing programs while you have the phone in portrait ) is coming in the Dec update.  This is one of the main thing's critics use to dissuade potential N900 buyers.Yes it has a resistive touchscreen but you don't notice it, the responsiveness of the screen is comparable to that of the iPhone of any Android touch screen capacitive device ( Yes I had an iPhone so I know the screen ).  Resistive is also great for selecting small objects ( Ever try selecting something small on the iPhone it's a pain ) with the stylus or using the handwriting program so you can actually write notes on the screen ( can't do that with iPhone or Android ) with your own handwriting.Physical keyboard is small but you don't feel squished when needing to use it to type ( virtual keyboard can also be used via the screen ).Turn by turn, voice navigation is coming via Sygic in about a week so no more "Oh the phone doesn't have voice navigation" crap.Everything Else:The processor itself is capable of 1GHZ ( so technically just as fast as the snapdragon ) but is capped at 680MHZ to preserve battery and reduce heat, but the processor itself with 1GB of ram means this baby is fast and damn do I mean fast!I bought a Class 6 16GB micro sdhc a while back so I bumped the storage in this thing to 48 GB ( ofc not 48GB total because of OS storage just like any other smartphone ) more than any iPhone or Android user...  :PThis is THE phone for geeks and nerds and the only phone that's Linux, open, and in all actuality a computer first, phone second but it's also a phone that will appeal to the normal user because of it's accessibility and user friendly interface.What other phone can run full HTML Google Voice and Wave via the browser and not having any slow issues...nothing, except the N900!  Oh and iPhone people, you can actually switch out the battery on this thing, which means extra power.People pay more for the iPhone and they get way less, and people will actually defend Apple's decision for basically making a dumbed down phone, whereas Nokia you get everything that is expected in a phone and the newest and best technology to back it up.  Having everything in a phone is what people want--a great 5 mp camera, dual led flash, camcorder, front camera for video calling, massive storage, full Adobe Flash, full Mozilla browser, massive storage for music and video...This phone after the Dec update when we get portrait and MMS will be THE iPhone killer and seriously ahead of Android on all fronts.New owners should join us at [...] where we have forums to discuss everything Maemo, and if you have issues or questions just go there as everyone is great and we are more than willing to help any person out with N900 questions or issues.Tips and Tricks for the N900:[...]Improving Battery Life:[...]^^ Using that I have so far been using the phone ( After all day recharging yesterday ) with internet radio and browsing usage as well as GPS and email for close to eight hours already and my battery still show's full.  The power conservation on this thing is astounding and is a 100 times better then iPhone or Android.This is the phone of phones, and believe me when you're around people with this phone they'll instantly recognize it and you'll be the envy.  Everywhere I go I always get at least one or two people in astonishment that I have an N900 and how cool it is.Get the phone you won't be disappointed.
Iv'e had the nokia n900 for about 3 days now and from watching videos online and reading reviews both positive and negative. I have to say this device is great. Its well made it functions as advertised its fast and multitasks beautifully. Not having the phone in portrait mode has not been to much of  a problem for me as i usually hold my phone in landscape mode anyway. I never had an Iphone b4 but iv'e been able to play around with one. The interface just wasen't for me and the fact that its very restrictive. I bought this phone comming from an HTC Tilt, which i was very pleased with and used for over a year. I wanted a phone with better internet capabilities than the HTC tilt and the n900 delivered. Its very easy for me to navigate through to different webpages and do many things at one time which is great. The double tap feature is good and i also really like the circular zoom as i find my self using that alot when there are small boxes to check or links to press. Its easy to dl media pics progs using the n900, functions much like a computer. I also dont consider myself a geek and i dnt know anything about programming. Surprisingly ive found my self using my computer alot less often since i've had the n900 going on face book and checking statuses is cake along with being able to check my messages and hotmail email acount. There are some downsides to the messaging and phone apps but its very minimal and when the new maemo versions come out im sure will be fixed. As for the apps ive been able to dl a bunch of basic apps which is all i really need. I got a couple basic games, emulators, weather, news. Its a little dissapointing there is no program to buy music but i can just dl my music form my computer. The touch screen is great very responsive you do need to add a little presure but it's not to bad. Overall i am impressed with the device as ive used it i seee Huge potential. It does function as is and does what its suppose to do. It never crashed yet and has always preformed quickly and easily. I thought it would be difficult to set up widegets and desktops (of which there are 4) but it was easy and I was able to dl wallpapers and position everything the way i wanted. ive used the camera at night in my room it didnt take to bad of a picture with minimal lighting, but takes great pictures with suficient light. I also love that the camera has a slide lense because i had broken the lense on my tilt. O another thing i was able to stream radio broadcats of my favorite shows easily using edge network 2.5 from att. If you have good att service in your area i would recommend getting the phone. The flash isnt as quick but webpages load very fast probably faster or equal to how long it took on my htc tilt 3g. Dls take a bit of time but who cares you can minimize the screen and do somehting different. Overall im impressed and might not even switch carriers the edge network works just fine for me.
Here is the bottom line- Nokia should have thought about the possibility that people who can afford $600 internet tablets probably have jobs that require them to make calls and write emails frequently.I have had this phone for a few weeks now. Instead of a long winded review here is my short take on itIt is visually gorgeous. Finally a color scheme and animations that outdoes the iphone in my opinion. (I have used an iphone for a year)It is extremely powerful, and multitasking, and transitions are top notch. Its really that good.I have used an iphone and G1 over the past 18 months- both with capacitive screens. I can assure you that the responsiveness of the resistive screen on this phone is quite comparable. Its nothing like the horrible resistive screens on the n97 and 5530 nokia phones. The touch sensitivity has not been an issue for me at all.The keyboard is quite useable. I am currently deciding between this and the blackberry bold 9700 that I got as an upgrade from tmobile, and the keyboard would not be the dealbreaker.So what really makes me angry about this phone will i stare at its gorgeous screen?Its the antiquated phone and email apps.EMAILS:  Its frustrating how Exchange 2003 is not supported. It is also frustrating how you have to go through multiple clicks to read emails.This is what I found extremely weird: Suppose you were last checking your hotmail account and then decided to do some browsing. Now, while you are browsing, you get a notification that there is a new email in your gmail account. you tap on the  notification icon. Guess where it takes you- to your hotmail account (since that was where you left your email program last)!!!!! After that you have to navigate back back back to the main email interface and then tap on the gmail account and then on the inbox and then on the new email....!!!Another quirky feature- suppose you have only account setup under Nokia messaging services. Well, you first need to click on email, then on Nokia messaging, then on that one account and then you will finally be able to access the folders of that account. PHONES: There is no quickdial option for making phone calls (you can create icons on the home screen for individual contacts but unlike an android phone you cant create an icon for a specific number associated with a specific contact- i.e. you cannot have quickdial icons.) Unlike the iphone you also cannot have default phone numbers associated with a contact.Finally the battery life is horrible. I keep the phone on Edge, no wifi, bluetooth and GPS turned off as well. Brightness turned down to 3 out of 5. And i still cant get through 8 hours of basic browsing and calling. On the Blackberry bold, I am perpetually on 3G or Wifi and I do the same amount of calling and browsing , and the battery does not get over in 2 days.So why have i not dumped the phone yet- potential.You see the email and the phone issues are software issues that can be solved with a software update.Final closing thoughts- Most smartphones out there have hardwares that cant keep up with software demands. Well this is probably the only phone that is the opposite. The hardware clearly is more than equipped to handle the current state of software.
The N900 is not a particularly great phone. Hardware-wise its critical limitations are the lack of a USB host port, weak GPS chipset, and no multi-touch. I know reviewers have dragged on and on about the "lack" of a capacitive screen, but they are wrong. There are resistive screen technologies that do implement multi-touch. The resistive touch screen on the N900 allows me and another person to play a game of chess using a coffee stirrer straw-as-stylus - not possible to do on a capacitive screen! Software-wise the Maemo OS has at least the absolute minimum to make this hardware usable. Sadly enough, the forward facing webcam has an incomplete Maemo OS driver which results in a grainy off balance image. The one fact of using the device I did not find immediately obvious was tapping the upper right corner to close the current context... any visual cue of this necessity is blurred by a screen effect. Otherwise there is a lot of potential (and actual probable updates to come) for the software to catch up with the market-leading hardware. Very impressive is the stock integration of Skype, SMS, and IM messaging. Conversations are threaded based on your phone's address book of contacts. What other phone does that? The N900 is a computer communications terminal with a phone built in for cellular connectivity. No regrets dropping $530usd (before $50 gift card rebate) on what has easily become a mobile web browsing laptop - in a much smaller footprint.
Phone was great for the 2 days I had it, and I had just read an article about T-Mo rolling out their 7Mb and 21Mb networks in Philly, when I went to charge the 900 for the second time.  It turned out that the metal part of the micro-USB receptacle had come apart in the seam, and eventually came off of the circuit board completely.  I wound up taking it apart to see if I could re-solder, but one side was obstructed by chipset/housing.  No part of the casing or phone's internals to help support the USB port and its only held in by (4) very small soldering points and (2) slightly larger "epoxy?" points. Phone being RMA'd (luckily) by vendor.  This after 2 years of no issues with microUSB, and bulky miniUSB-to-microUSB adapter, on my Moto Q.That said, I like this phone for many of the reasons already stated.  One other feature which may not have been mentioned, is that you can dial back the power consumption of the WiFi radio.  I just came from the "DROID" and posted my thoughts here:[...]As mentioned, the calendar was limited in options for setting up "recurring events" however I was able to sync my Outlook calendar from my PC, which manages my Comcast POP3 account, via the Nokia PC sync software.  Phone seemed really stable, but again, not very many apps available to mess it up (a la the DROID).  I'm not sure why someone said there are no "Notifications", there are multi-colored LEDs and "pop-ups" for the respective notifications...though it would be nice to have something persistent in the "status" bar by the "clock".Having "highlight-to-copy-and-paste" is really easy (just press and hold), along with a mouse pointer, are great features.  Its also great to have Flash support, and I though I'd finally be able to listen to XM Radio via my online account.  While the web pages render quickly and properly, the media player itself is not compatible, and the only thing which does not render properly.  I'm not sure if there is a workaround for that, and wonder if it will be a recurring issue on other sites.  I just wish there was a search app comparable to that of Windows' "Live Search"...didn't have time to search for alternatives, or if "Live Search" would run on 900.Overall, having the N900 feels like having a Ferrari F430 Competition, but they only installed 1st gear.  "For me", all the basics are handled, and handled fairly well, but given the lack of apps (specifically Sling or Hava Player, and LED flashlight) and my inability go get Vonage account working with the native SIP client, I'm in the waiting game like many others.  Outside of that, I just wish call volume were at least 50% higher for both earpiece and speaker.  My Moto Q is much higher in both respects  vs. the 900.  Although my fellow co-worker, also a VoIP engineer, stated that Nokia has native noice cancelling which raises volume on an "as needed basis", to compensate for surroundings.  I also thought the resistive screen would be a deal breaker, but again, compared to the DROID, its much more accurate, and more forgiving in that it doesn't open what's not intended.  I'm eagerly awaiting my replacement.
The phone holds lot of promises. Thats the bottomline. The software is not anywhere near production grade.The phone has crashed twice while using the "Mail for Exchange".Blue Tooth as explained in other reviews basically puts your phone on silent mode. And the integration with the headset is rudimentary. I could only use it answer call, the smart keys on the headset didnt open up the contact app.Basic contact management is missing - I cant select a phone number from email and add it as a contact ( something that device's of much lower caliber has managed to achieve ).Copy paste doesnt work always - and there no easy way to select anything from a web page.Contextual menus could have been made more usable.Gmail integration works for me - but its just the mail.Keyboard is a little to small - try doing Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V frequentlySingle hand operation is almost impossible - making a phone call holding a cup of coffee and walking to work is just not happening.The device holds potential but unless there is big software update, this device is only for the gadget junkies.
I don;t call myself a tech freak but yes I can say so about phones. I keep my updated for everything and anything that is upcoming in mobile technology. Nokia 900 is worth the wait!! I had been waiting for it for 3 months and my interest weaned but you know what..I am glad I bought it.Why is this so good..1. Best Resistive Touch Screen I have ever used. My wife has an IPhone and so I compared with it. It is not capacitative but yes certainly it impresses and I had no problems with touchscreen although I have big fingers.2. Fast and Furious. No lag and no hang ups.3. Screen Resolution is fantastic.Everybody I have shown the phone instantly compliments it.4. Turning Mode..You turn the phone and phone screen displays.5. FM Transmitter...I like this too much. Just play your media and transmit it your car stereo..No wire needed6. Applications- Some applications in Maemo Store (not too many right now but I guess it will increase) are nice..Like the OM Weather. Uses GPS to determine the location.7. Keypad is OK.8. Desktop..You can actually watch everything right on 4 different desktops and add and remove widgets.9. Web Browsing is just plainly awesome..It feels you are browsing on laptop..These are some of the Pros. I don't say that it doesn't have cons especially the lack of 3G for AT&T; but then no body is perfect. It is a nice phone, pocket able, little heavy though but one of the best nokia has produced. Keep it up.Yes, The Amazon Customer service is really nice.Thanks
This NOKIA N900 replaced my 3yrs old SE W810i; At the same time, I switched from AT&T; to T-mo plan.I have the N900 for about 2 weeks now and still learning its new gagets  everyday.On this review, I only give some specific comments of what I'm concerned about, those are: BLUETOOTH: I don't have any problem of "disconnect" with my Jawbone2. However, I do have problem with my car Hand Free Link System. My Lexus ES350 and SE W810i used to work great together  everytime while I'm driving. The SE W810i is automatically drop my Jawbone2 bluetooth and connect with my car's bluetooth system automatically. Now with the N900, I have to reconnect it everytime.Update: I have to turn off the Jawbone2 bluetooth in order for the N900 to connect automatically with my car Hand Free Link system. Problem solve.CAMERA:  During the day, picture look good, color is accurate but the "pin hole" lens  is no where close to my 7yrs old Canon G2 (4MP). I would not depend this camera for my vacation trip, but rather for emergency cases where camera is always there when needed. The flash is nice to have when shooting a close up object in the dark, but don't count on it when take a group of people. About video: I haven't try video yet.LAYOUT DESIGN:  This is my strongest point of interest. The N900 looks... REALLY SEXY! It is not as thick like I though. Beside, I would carry it on my belt so thickness won't be an issue to me. I like the Horizontal design with the option of Portrait when making a phone call. This Horizon design will make the N900 toward more of computer style than cellphone itself.  The NO button(s) on the face make the screen look smoother and cleaner, plus the physical slice out keyboard...  Two thumbs up!TOUCHSCREEN: I know some of you prefer Capacitive touchscreen because of its accurate and a smooth  "scroll up/down" with your finger sweep. Well, you won't miss it with N900 Resistive screen. The bonus is you can do it with your glove on. Multi-touch? I really don't miss it much. For enlarging or reducing function, the "finger rotary" effect  work great each time, and I couldn't ask for more.INTERNET:  As many other reviews have said, I'm not going to repeat it.QUALITY BUILT:  I don't know some review complain about cheap made and plasticky look but to me, it's an excellent quality buit to me,  just  open the slice out keyboard halfway and twist the LCD screen lightly, then do it the same on the Adroid phone... you will know what I mean.This phone is exceed my expectation, worth of waiting. While I found some problems or bugs on this phone, I still rate it 5 starts due to its sexy look, features and cost. I hope NOKIA will release some firmwares update soon and so Maeo5 applications.(Sorry for my English)
It is hard to think of this thing as a phone...as a matter of fact NOKIA has managed to strike a fine balance between an internet tablet and a phone- yes it is a phone and it is a pretty little complex computer.I am still new to this and exploring every day, but what stands out the time I have owned this is the power of this phone. There are 4 desktops (yes, multi-tasking at it's best!) and you can add contacts, favorites, shortcuts and apps on these to access whenever you need.Also, you can keep the apps you access open, no need to close one to get to another. This is really handy when you are on the phone and you have to browse the web for some information. So far I have kept 12 apps open at the same time (all heavy hitters like IM, Phone, You tube, Maps) with no significant hit to the performance...ohh this is just like surfing my own desktop :)3 G speed is fast (I use T-Mobile by the way). You could change to wifi when in proximity.There are different calling options- like Skype and GTALK so that means you can save some $$$ on the phone minutes if you don't have one of those unlimited minute plans. Actually, when you call or receive a call the phone gives you an option to select the type of call you want it to be (VOIP or network)Another neat feature is the FM transmitter- I hook it up with my car stereo to listen to media--no more auxiliary cables needed!You could watch the your tube videos on your big screen TV with the AV out cablesFor enthusiasts out there, X-Terminal is inbuilt :) I just turned this phone into remote system administration tool!Finally, no phone can be perfect- there are very obvious bugs that I hope will be fixed via updates soon-phone is on the chubby side, almost 200 grams--but that is the cost of having a 5MP camera, dual flashes, IR PORT-- however this is the best thing out there is you want the functions of a phone and a internet computer rolled into one device--but don't buy this if you are looking at some thing like an Iphone. There is simply no comparison. As I see it, Iphone means restrictions, and being limited in what you can do (believe me I owned one for a month), whereas an N900 is freedom to do what you want. The initial price is heavy, but it will save you money in the long term as there are no long term contacts to be tied down to. It is open source, and you have the root access to play around.One more thing- I was very dissapointed with the Amazon.com customer service. This phone was delivered to me about 5 days late than promised--and worst part was that they kept on telling me it was on time until the last minute- then out of the blue some one went in and changed my shipping method to 2day delivery...I would recommend Dell for a much better order handling and service.
Guys this is a super phone , with great hardware, but I am still waiting on the Apps! Waiting for Nokia to come out with firmware updates, ovi store and developers to create more applications for this phone. For now I am very happy to have this phone which has the best browser in the world. everything else I believe can be fixed in the future.1000 times better than the damn Iphone, since I do not play like a kid with those millions apps that are ready for play for Iphone Users! T-mobile 3-G rocks!One year on, here is the review and reality...The charging USB socket is poorly built and broke, on a trip to Asia I fixed the socket and it broke again, I missed my N-900 so much that I have ordered the phone again, no other phone in the market comes close to N900...Why real power of Multi-tasking....No 32 GB in built memory in any of the Android or Iphones and latest NEXUS S has 16 gb memory but does not have a SD/MMC or MicroSD slot, how dumb of samsung to build this phone ?For my basic use of Email, web browsing, listing to Music and Internet Radio, this is the best available phone there is.....
Don't buy this device if you are looking for a convenient Personal Information Manager. The features of the calendar, contacts and phone manager are at least 5 years behind state of the art user interface.Contacts:1. All entries are in essentially one directory, making it difficult to use if you have hundreds of contacts.Suggestions: Nokia should allow user defined contact groupings.Calendar:1. Repeating events are non-functional. There's no way to set up a repeating meeting on the 4th Saturday of every month for example. If you select a repeating monthly meeting on March 25th, it will occur every 25th. If March 25th was Friday, the next event will occur on April 25th which may be a Wednesday. Whoever wrote the specs for the calendar capability has never used a PIM before.2. User interface is too slow. Too many screen touches are required just to enter the date and time. You must scroll for each date/time parameter. Month - scroll; Day - scroll; Year - scroll; Done: Now enter time: Hour - scroll; Minute - scroll; am/pm - scroll; Done. I'm already exhausted.3. When scheduling a new event, there's no way to see which day of the week it will be on unless you peek at the calendar before starting to enter a new event.Suggestions: My old Blackberry 8700c UI is much better for PIM use. Nokia should study it.Phone Manager:1. No call logs/ call timers / missed calls / No message waiting indicator.2. UI layout poor. Reject and Answer touch areas are adjacent - easy to hit the wrong area by mistake.3. UI too slow. Press answer - the screen takes at least a second or two to show that you are connected. Meanwhile if you believe you didn't hit answer, your keytouch may reject the call.Suggestions: Change the layout and make it faster.Buy this device if you want to have the latest Linux gadget. I have N900 root access, can ssh/sftp/scp to my N900 from my Ubuntu Latop. Very nice. I can VNC to my media server to set streaming video to my HDTV right from the N900. Cool. But, I can do that from my T61 as well with a much bigger screen. In a pinch, you can make the small screen work.Skype phone calls - awesome. But, it should have Skype video capability. I suspect the front(user) facing camera quality is not good enough under indoor lighting conditions to be acceptable for most video calls.GPS/OVI maps - give it up. Crude interface.Summary: There are some very good innovative features on this device. However, if you are a heavy PIM user, this device will slow you down a lot. If you need to ssh into your server from anywhere in the world, this is the device for you.
I took my SIM card and MicroSDC card out of my E71 and back into the Nokia N900.I wrote a review on an N900 that I ordered a while ago. The unit I received then, rebooted constantly until it just would not boot at all. Come to find out, a lot of units had this problem. I guess this was my punishment for getting a first round batch. Luckily, the unit I have now has restored my faith in open-source hybrids (computer/phone).Why did I purchase another unit after getting a 3rd degree (burned)? I'm hardheaded. I wanted it to be a good handset. I was not let down. No reboots, not one. I have installed a lot of the available applications (I don't like saying Apps). Setup numerous email accounts, Skype still runs great. Although WiFi connections caused a worse delay in the conversation (latency) in Skype, but would be nice to have video chats.I took this unit to the job and a couple of co-workers thought it was a cool little device. One of our network administrators, thought about getting one, just by checking out the ssh into a router.Only negatives I can think of is the fact that LEAP/PEAP settings need tweaking. The screen is a little small, even though anything larger than 4" may cause more radiation going into your brain. The next release, N90X should have a 4" screen with a QWERTY keyboard. That would great. I am not a Linux guru (not Nokia's fault) so I can't develop my own applications yet.I am glad I stayed with Nokia on this one. If I would have gotten another lemon, I would have probalbly gotten a Nexus One. Thank goodness I am hardheaded.
My anxiously awaited N900 lasted for 4 days before completely crapping out.  I have to say that the Linux based OS was great (though puzzling why they would include XTerminal as a standard app), and the phone itself, while bulky, was fine.  Camera was impressive too.  Thee general usage of the phone could stand some redevelopment (try swiping to access other parts of the panoramic desktop), and the phone is underpowered in terms of its RAM.I recommend waiting until the next iteration of this phone...
The Nokia N900 is a device that can not be compared with any other cellular equipment out to date.  The quality of the hardware is rich, The Maemo OS is silky smooth,  The capabilities are beyond belief.  To truly appreciate a game changing unit such as the Nokia N900, I had to own one.As a T-Mobile customer I have only a select few devices to choose from, which are equally unique and user friendly as the next; but the N900 stood out from the very second I was able to see the previews that elevated in September.  Before it was released the specs alone where enough to make me drop my G1, Iphone 3G, and Preorder ASAP.  The 32 gb of storage with 1 gb dedicated for applications, 600 MHZ Cortex processor (Smooth 3D Graphics), and FM Transmitter where enough to validate investing $[...](after rebate) on a Mobile Computer.  Though there was a delayed release date, I still held out on my purchase to research more finished product reviews.  I found some great reviews and some mediocre reviews.  Most of the Top 4-5 star rating were from editors that I trust; and I know are actually knowledgeable of technology and the product.  So I ordered my N900 and after anxiously awaiting its arrival due to the back orders and popularity; Fed Ex came knocking on my door.  I have dove head first into it for over 12 hours and now that I have used the N900 first hand I can safely say that not only is there raw power under the hood like a BMW Z8 but the quality of the components are up to par with a Bentley Coupe.  Even the USB cables to the included VGA cables are Top of the line.Not only are the Headphones elegant but the Linux based Maemo OS (Linux based same as Google Android OS) is as smooth as butter.  Everything from the vibration of every touch to the to the onboard Flash 9, add to the experience of browsing the web.  The one noticeable issue which seems to be standard on most every phone I have owened is the lack of a proper notification icon.  Even on early Nokia's the tiny square shaped letter signifies the arrival of an sms text.  The HTC G1 has a notification bar at the top which informs me that I have received an email no matter what app is open.  On the N900 the only way to notice if I have a message is to either hear the tone, check the notification light (Which blinks the color of my choosing) Or exiting out of the app I am currently in and navigate to the Task Menu.  It is not something that would make me send the Tablet back for a refund, but it probably will take some getting used to.  Fortunately there is an update that will hopefully not only alter the notification methods, but also enable users to run the device in portrait mode the majority of the time; rather than only in the Blocks game & using the Phone.  The ability to download a 300mb file, listen to internet radio, as well as surf the web seamlessly with out lag is the icing on the cake and outweighs any negatives the N900 possess.A deal breaker for some is that it is bulky and cumbersome, but this Nseries was surprisingly sleek and lighter than I assumed.  Although it is thicker than most devices that attempt to be in its class, it does not have so much weight to it that it would be a nuisance to hold to my ear.  As a developer I plan on using all of the features and with "theunlockr" it truly shines.  With everything that The Nokia N900 has to offer the ((M)SRP) of $[...] is a steal.  I do not regret ordering my unit and I am grateful that the wait is over. I now own A unique device that is far better than what I have grown to expect from a Smartphone or Pocket Pc; It is a true mobile computer.
I had this phone/minicomputer for about a week and I've tested most of its functions-not a single problem so far.First of all, I have to say that this phone is very fast and responsive right out of the box-maybe due to the fast CPU. Both pictures and videos are very clear and sharp. The video is a bit grainy in very low light but that's expected.Of course, the most attractive part of the phone is its high resolution screen-video and maybe movies look great on the screen-then add the extra animation like effect when closing any app/window-great extra.And both  music and video players are well designed and fast-better than the n97- and the speakers sound is great and have clear sound without excessive base.Since, it's Linux based, I hope somebody sometime int he future writes an app to have a virtual desktop-like Windows maybe?Overall, the N900 is a pretty well advanced/very fast phone/mini computer, has great video/photo capability and it's highly customizable.N900 Pros and ConsPros:1. Bright and sharp screen resolution.2. Better video resolution than most phones: 800x4803. Very responsive to touch and very fast to open/close apps.4. Virtual keyboard is best I've seen on any phone-including Iphone.5. Slide out keyboard has a computer-like feeling and functionality.6. Ability to customize menus/apps/windows.Cons:1. Video has no light-like the N97.2. Camera has less functions than the N97-No sequence taking-3. No hand-writing? Maybe it's no needed.4. A bit bulkier than the N97
The Nokia N900 is not for everyone. If all you want to do is make calls and send texts go somewhere else. Maemo 5 is an amazing OS and a breath of fresh air from Symbian. The things this phone can do are simply outstanding. Given it still needs some work but by next year 1st quarter this should be perfected. Its not as heavy as people claim but it is a bit bulky and you will know if its missing from your pocket. This phone so far was worth every penny and Nokia should really put more attention into making this their feature device for the future.
Let me answer that question in a way you will never forget. BEST PHONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!!!Here is why,1. Running application on your desktop like a real computer.2. Freedom! to do whatever you want with any file3. Battery Life is great compare to many smart phone out there.4. Ever heard the commercial for Verizon Droid. " Whatever iDon't, DROID DOES, But N900 DOES BETTER!Let me tell you again, the "best phone in the whole world."
If you want a phone that runs Linux (real linux, it is almost debian) and comes with xterm, this is it. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING an iphone more than a little bit, THEN DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE, and if you do, don't complain that it isn't like iphone. I don't like the iphone, or to be exact I don't like the stranglehold that Apple has on it and its developers. I looked into Android and I wasn't impressed at the internals of the OS. I've owned a 770 and an n810, the OS has greatly improved since then, both in appearance and in snappiness. I'm using this on AT&T;, so I am stuck on EDGE, but it is still usable for most things when I am away from wifi (which is not that often). The GPS is very fast to lock. The e-mail works well but there is no search, and you cannot choose which folders are checked for new messages, only the inbox is. (I am using two IMAP accounts, one of which is gmail.) The phone features are unpolished, in particular the voicemail notification comes up as a virtual call from "_@", which is probably the most unpolished thing in the whole device. I'm willing to tolerate some of these bugs until the next firmware upgrade.
This is a great machine, the interface, the browser, the podcast client, the rest of applications and the possibilites are just great, 32 Gb of my documents and music, that's why I give a five star review.I agree with other customers that as a phone it stills lack some functionallity, actully I don't know what :S, but you get that feeling while using it. It really doesn't matter to me, as the browser and the communications are great, I mean, selecting a contact, and being able from the same interface to talk by gmail, skype, msn, phone, skype call, sms, email is great. I have had it for about 10 days and already save some money on phone calls by using other communication types.
Amazing device. I had the N97 which is crap compared to the N900. As soon as I knew the n900 was in stock I returned my ex n97. It is faster and very responsive. The screen is much better than the n97 eventhough they are resistive. On the n97 there were a lot of dots on the screen (because it is resistive and Ive seen it on other devices) and I dont know why but in the n900 there arent any, those dots would get on the way some other time. Nice feedback on the keyboard and despite its size and weight it feels very good an the hand. The bad... fm radio app needs development, can't use the LED light for video, provided headphones are  REALLY CHEAP with bad to average sound quality and doesnt have music controls on it, but that is not too big of a deal. I love this phone and can't wait for the next n920 or whatever it wil be call.
I had this phone for all of 5 hours before it bricked. Upon searching the Nokia forums it seems about 10% of these phones are lemons and will not work properly without re-programming. Prior to bricking, it rebooted randomly while I was texting & web browsing (which is all I managed to do before it went kaput).This is a shame, as it's a wonderful piece of technology (with a few quirks and upgrades needed, yes). Unfortunately, a little too expensive to tolerate troubles quite so soon. Had it worked fine, it would have been a 4 or 5 star purchase. Hope others have better luck with this.
the n900 lacks:1 description for tasks2 lacks category field ( map to Outlook)3 a search for notes tasks and calendar and other contact info.camera is great, LED flash leaves a lot to be desired.
First of all, I am a long-time Nokia user. I started with the 3650, and then moved to the N90, which I liked a lot.I have to say, however, that Nokia did not do itself proud with the N900. I would give it zero (0) stars if I could. The battery does not last even a full working day. (The N90, in contrast, lasted a couple of days.) That was without exercising the phone hardly at all: a dozen phone calls, two pictures, no Internet access of any kind. That's essentially just on standby. There is no Internet access over GPRS, which is puzzling. I had a T-Mobile plan for the N90, and I just moved the SIM card from that phone to N900, using the same plan. On the N90, T-zones appeared as a choice for Internet and I could use it; that choice doesn't even appear on the N900. The user interface is not great; it seems to be a bit touchy (yes, that's a pun). Sometimes tapping an icon several times has no effect whatsoever. The N900 doesn't work with all features of OVI Suite and it doesn't work with all features of PC Suite (image transfer). So I have to use both for different things. OVI Suite will sync the N900 calendar with the Outlook calendar on my PC, but it seems to be confused about dates and times -- bad for calendar functionality. Yesterday it popped up an alarm for an event at the right hour, but the wrong day; today it just popped up an alarm for an event with an alarm set for 15 minutes in advance of the event, but the alarm went off an hour and 15 minutes in advance of the event. (Testers, where are you?) The Bluetooth functionality is abysmal. My car has a Bluetooth connection for the phone -- essentially the audio system in the car is the Bluetooth headset. The Bluetooth functionality with the N90 worked perfectly from the get-go. The N900 loses its connection after hanging up, sometimes it won't answer, sometimes it will appear to call but there is no audio, neither speaker nor microphone. For the camera, the geotagging functionality appears not to work, even when it is configured: After I take a picture, the screen shows a message indicating that it is geotagging the picture. When I examine the metadata in the photo in Photoshop, there is no geo information included. Perhaps I need to sign up for some additional service for that, but the manual isn't clear on that. And on the manual, the Nokia folks certainly took to heart the minimalist mantra that's circulating among documentation professionals -- if the manual were any more minimal, it would be invisible. I am returning this phone. I'll hope that Nokia releases a better model sometime in the future.
Just what I need. 1gb of RAM provides fluent multitasking.I owned Iphone first generation for more than 2 years. Iphone is good but it cannot be compared to this phone.*Edited*After using and testing it for 2 weeks, I can just say that it is really powerful machine. I just found that we also have built in FM Transmitter. I paid 60 dollar for Iphone FM transmitter.The only cons is that Ovi suite does not support the Nokia n900 yet and you cannot get 3g speed from at&t.; But overall the phone is impressive. The linux based OS(maemo) never crashed on me
one thing surprised me is that it is made in KOREAone of my friends got one set which is made in FINLAND
I have been waiting for Nokia n900 for a long time. Since this mobile has flash support, it will help to open the websites like last.fm and others which will allow us to listen to latest songs online. And the features are also better than iPhone and others since Nokia supports multitasking. I hope the horizontal mode for most of the applications will not be limited with the firmware upgrade in future.
Nokia had a potential good opportunity with this device but overall screwed it up big time.The screen is very frustrating for previous iPhone users and I would say anybody that is used to a capacitive screen. The size said to be 3.5'' is actually quite smaller than the iPhone one. Maybe inches in Finland are not the same as in US. The colors are also just so so. Last but not least the touch behavior is very erroneous: just try to swipe in a list of items (like emails for example) and you will see that you accidentally click without doing it. Soooo frustrating.The Login screen is just a bad joke compared to the n770 and n800 that I own already. Quite ugly and difficult to key in the code. Wooow such a strong regression compared to the previous models.Then Gmail integration is just screwed up: this device and OS version is NOT able to handle my inbox with something like 16K messages. That's a bad joke indeed. The mail application is just freezing without any reason (jezz, I am on a Wifi connection with a BIG bandwidth).There are no apps or so little like a couple dozen. That's a joke too. No twitter app, no facebook app just widgets that are plain useless.The browser could have been nice but the very small size of the screen makes the browsing experience a pain. I am missing big time here the screen estate from my n800. And its time for rendering complex pages is just so so.The keyboard is so cramped. I have medium size fingers and they do not fit correctly. Keying is such a pain indeed and of course there is no autocompletion into the text fields for helping you. Nice job Nokia.The GPS takes time to synchronize and the map is just not attractive and not very readable. Yes Nokia, you cannot compete with Google Maps and you should have done a partnership with them to provide the user a better experience.The phone by itself is just ok and not appealing. It forces you to change from landscape mode to portrait mode and accessing the phone is not really easy when you are dealing with other apps. Woow, even the phone features have been screwed up. Unbelievable.As a sum up, my 2 hours experience was very bad and I decided to return it without regret.Nokia has done a very bad job here and it is such a shame for them as I was sold to have such a device. They should better listen to users and more take care of user experience...
-Camera quality simply sucks+Processor is really fast-Landscape screen is somehow inconvenient+The size of the phone is pretty small-The Apps...I don't know, not so user-friendly as Symbian+The pen is just cute :))-It's hard to open the back or to take out the battery+Love the box =))
I bought this phone from Target after I inadvertently cracked the LCD screen on my LG 300. This phone has some very nice features: Bluetooth, Digital Camera (1.3 Megapixels), microSD Card Slot, MP3 Player, and FM Radio. It also has a Browser, but you can only access the Net10 site with it; access to all other sites are restricted.I'll briefly touch on each of these and other features:- BluetoothThe bluetooth works surprisingly well. I can connect the phone to my iPAQ 111 Pocket PC using bluetooth for transferring files between the units. I also have no trouble connecting the phone to my Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS unit and my Plantronics Headset. Once my Nuvi is connected to the phone, I can use the Nuvi as a speaker phone. I can also use the Nuvi to dial and receive phone calls. SWEEeeet!- Digital CameraThe quality of the picture taken with the 1.3-megapixel camera is pretty good. Each JPEG file is typically less than 100 Kb.- microSD Card SlotThe microSD slot will only read a microSD card (2 GB or less), not a microSDHC (microSD, High Capacity - 4 GB or more). If you insert a microSDHC card, you will get the message: Please remove card and insert again.- MP3 PlayerThe sound quality through my Sony earphones is decent enough. The MP3 player, unfortunately, doesn't have an equalizer.- FM RadioThe FM Radio reception is as good as any portable radio. Since your earphones function as an antenna, the FM Radio won't work unless you have your earphones plugged in.- BrowserInternet access is restricted to only the Net10 Web site. (Interestingly, some people reportedly have full (unrestricted) Internet access on the browser.) I tried a few URL's (e.g. google) but each time I got the error message: HTTP error - forbidden.The Net10 Web site has links for Sports, Weather, and News. The page loads are excruciatingly slow! It can take a few minutes for a page to load, if at all. Sometimes, the page just hangs. You would have to be pretty desperate to want to use the browser!- e-mailI tried to e-mail an attachment a couple of times but had no success with it. 3.5 minutes (1 minute standard rate + 2.5 minutes e-mailing rate) were deducted from my account on _each_ attempt, even though the e-mail failed to get through! The error message: Sending failed: Connection error.o  Miscellaneous FeaturesThe phone has all the "standard" features that come with most cell phones: polyphonic ring tones, games (e.g. Need For Speed - Carbon), and tools (e.g. calculator and alarm clock).o  UsabilityService: The standby battery life is about 2 to 3 days. Cell phone reception from the Net10 service is decent enough (Net10 actually uses the AT&T; network). It comes with 300 minutes of free airtime (a 30-d0llar value).Volume Control: I really like the volume control buttons on the left side of the phone. You can quickly set the phone to Silent, Vibrate, or one of seven volume levels without having to wade through the menus.Form: The phone is very compact. It is the same size as the LG 300.---The biggest gripe I have about the phone is the crippled browser. Other than that, I don't really have very much else to complain about it. For me, an absolute must-have on a phone is bluetooth - and this feature works flawlessly on the EM 326g. Overall, I'm quite happy with it. For the price, it's really not a bad deal. If you're looking for a prepaid phone, this one's definitely worth consideration.
I bought this phone to test out Net 10's local system.  The main reason is that I will be giving it to my 82 year old father to use as an emergency phone.  I have really enjoyed using it.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros:Small compact size that fits in a shirt or pants pocket.Really good reception, even in the middle of a department store.Easy to use interface with very adequate size dialing pad.Crisp and clear sound quality.Cons:Can't disable the browser access button.  Would like to swap it out for maybe the contacts access.  It's cost me 60 cents just because I hit Exit one too many times when backing out of the menu screen, which then activates the browser on the phone.  10 cents per minute... why would they let me change it out??? That would cost them revenue!One note here about Net 10.  They've got good coverage here in West Michigan, a very easy to understand low cost plan, albeit prepaid, but their South American customer service call center leaves a lot to be desired.  Customer service agents don't understand English, and are constantly entering key words into a computer and waiting for a canned answer to pop up on their screen.  It's a shame that a company that only operates in the US has to farm out all their customer service access to a foreign country.  Typical of what's happening all over the US.
The previous reviews have pretty much covered all of the main features on this phone so I won't repeat it all and just go over a few points for the plus and minus of this phone based on my experiences with it under the Net10 network:CAMERA:  For a pre-paid phone, the 1.3MP camera is actually pretty good, and has many features in it like white balance and exposure controls that you would normally not even find in many contract phones, much less a pre-paid model.  Using a memory card (or if your computer has it, bluetooth) will make transfering the photos convenient.  While this doesn't come close to comparing to a real digital camera (and has no flash), the pics are more than adequate enough for nice sized web pics and even "decent" 4x6 prints.  Just take the time to learn the camera adjustments to get the best out of your photos.TEXTING:  I don't like Motorola's predictive-type style of texting.  Not easy to figure out and there are delays.  I'm not a heavy texter so it's not an issue for me as much as others.  Using pre-type canned messages also involves too many steps and is not intuitive to use, either.  In other words, the Motorola menu system in general could be A LOT more intuitive, and it's not as user friendly as the LG300G (also from Net10).ANSWERING CALLS:  It would be nice if the microphone had been designed so you didn't have to slide the phone open to answer incoming calls.  You of course have to slide it open to make calls and dial/text, but with a few tweaks, it could have been made to handle incoming calls without having to slide it open.RECEPTION:  The old and cheap LG300G got multiple bars throughout my home in a suburb of Atlanta.  The Motorola's reception isn't nearly as good as the LG.  I've held the phones side-by-side in interior rooms and while the LG will get 4 bars, the Motorola will only get 1 bar, and in a couple of spots, none.  I never dropped a call with the LG - I have dropped a couple with the Motorola.  The LG's ear speaker did make callers sound a bit like you had a cloth in-between your ear and their voice (muffled), and while the Motorola is clearer, it has somewhat of a digital "tinny" noise to it that's to me, not very pleasant.  Using a good bluetooth headset will help.  My understanding is that Net10 piggybacks their signals on AT&T; *OR* Verizon, depending on the area, but may even use other services as well in other areas, so I'm not sure which one they use in mine, though Verizon gets excellent covereage in Atlanta.CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Now, with all of this being said, I HAVE to add, that the Net10 customer service is among the WORST I've ever experienced. You will on 100% of your calls be dealing with reps in India.  Reps who speak little English, and those who do, do so poorly and with heavy accents.  Many are under-trained and reading from scripts, and will give you inconstant information.  If you are switching or "porting" a phone number from an old phone of theirs or another phone via a different service, expect a long call with a series of codes and number to be given to the rep, then what can amount to an extremely long wait for it to be transferred, if, it works at all (prompting another call to try to get it fixed, etc etc etc).  If there is one thing that is almost worth the high price of contract carriers (AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile), it's that the customer service for them as much as we complain, is actually WORLDS better than from Tracfone/Net10.  So to sum up, these phones are great for certain uses as very basic and sometimes very reliable phones.  But if customer service is as important to you as the phone service price, avoid this service.If this is a secondary phone you're using for whatever reason (business, selling on ebay, etc) then I'd say I'd recommend it so long as you realize it does not compare to a good contract phone.  If you are the type of person who RARELY uses a cell phone but wants one to carry in case of an emergency, likewise, I'd say go ahead and get this one as well.  I would not though, recommend the Motorola as a full-time phone.  The slight reception and call quality issues would drive me nuts if I had to fully rely on this phone full time.  As a backup phone, I can deal with it.
No flash support for Web browser and No video streaming over Wi-Fi (such as the mobile YouTube) besides being not too comfortable due to the extra long form factor and with the Piano black surface a fingerprint nightmare that I have read in reviews makes it not being able to pay that much for such a beautiful and unique phone. Anyway, if you can live with it flaws go ahead...
Although this is phone does indeed come unlocked (It works with any sim card you insert) It is not the international version as described. It is in fact the South-East Asian version of the cell phone which means the following:- In the phone's settings the user's 'locale' can only be set to two values: Vietnam (English) and Malaysia (English)- The phone does not have the android market application pre-installed. In stead there is a clone market place installed called 'slide' but this one only has a very few applications compared to the market. This also means that there is no means of updating the existing (google) applications whenever new versions are released.Even though I haven't tried this myself yet but apparently there is a way for a user with a bit of technical knowledge to install the true international firmware on the phone. So consider yourself warned: if you want to full HTC Tattoo experience, you'll need to do some hacking.
This phone is the ultimate user friendly device.This phone has a  beautiful pearlized finish on the face and the back is a gorgeous, rich, white, leather-like surface.The face also has a gold iridescent finish when tilted in certain lighting.Beautiful!I've had several phones and this one is leaps and bounds above any of the others.I highly recommend this device,especially for women.The pearlized finish on the face gives it a slightly female look IMHO.Very rich,elegant,expensive look that's definitely worth the asking price.
I upgraded from a Nokia E71 (which was an unbelievable upgrade from my previous experiences with Blackberry), and for some reason I was expecting that same leap from the E71 to E72. However, I soon realized, after using my E72 for the past couple days, that the E71 did in fact spoil me. The E72 is still no doubt an amazing phone -- along with the E71 and other top Nokias, it's still in its own little league above the Blackberries and other smartphones -- but I'll admit I was slightly let down.If you are looking to buy a Nokia (or any phone) I'd definitely recommend the E72. If you are a huge Nokia fan, then fine, upgrade. If you're happy with your E71....then I'd really think about it (or at least get your hands on one in person). The E72 is much faster, the camera's awesome, and it's still a beautiful phone. BUT you should know a couple things:-The construction is not quite as top-notch as the E71. It's a little lighter, with some metal replaced for a sort of heavy, hardened plastic. I've heard of the battery panel being loose, but I haven't run into the problem. Mine was made in China, while my E71 was made in Finland, although it seems there can always be problems no matter where it's made.-The optical pad is a nice touch (it takes some getting used to) and, occasionally, it can misinterpret your choice to click to the side for a sliding movement. But overall I'm getting used to it (and if you really don't like it you can always switch it off).-I do notice the slightest high pitched buzz when the volume is turned up and the sound coming from the other end of the call is on the loud side. The E71 never had this problem. I take it the speakers were either downgraded or because of the extra plastic there's some sort of vibration (could just be my model). UPDATE: Seems the speaker just needed some "breaking in" (strange, I know). This problem is no longer present. However, still not the best volume in speakerphone mode.***Overall, I'd say if you're looking at the E72 compared to any top smartphone, this is an excellent choice***IF you're looking at the E72 and E71 side by side, it is THEN that you start to notice the little details that I mentioned above. True, there are a few more plastic pieces than the E71, but when I think about the Blackberries and iPhones, you're never going to get the same quality you got with the E71, and the E72 is just a notch below that.E72 is a 4.5 star phone. E71 will always be the best phone I've ever owned.
With one word: NO.After owning and E71 for over a year, which for me was by far the best phone that I have ever used, I was really excited about getting the new E72 since it featured a 600Mhz CPU which seemed to be my main and only issue with the E71. However the CPU was the only upgrade in this unit and almost everything else seemed to be in fact a downgrade. As mentioned by another reviewer this phone has serious stability issues. The FP2 OS is extremely buggy and crashes, reboots and freezes several times a day. Nokia really needs to work on a new firmware to correct this. Below is every quality of the phone that I could think of as compared to the E71.HARDWARE-----------------------------BUILD QUALITY: Definitely not as solid of a feeling compared to the mostly metal E71. The D-pad feels like cheap plastic and it has some free play. The back cover tends to move occasionally when you are holding the phone to your ear.SPEAKERPHONE: Very poor quality compared to the E71. There is very noticeable buzzing near the maximum volume, even with high quality music files. Calls on speakerphone at max volume are plain annoying due to the buzzing. On top of that the speaker is not as loud as the one on the E71.CALL QUALITY: Excellent call quality except at the maximum volume where the call speaker also becomes distorted.KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard feels slightly better than the one on the E71. The buttons seem to give out somewhat of a better feedback. However the E72 is slightly wider than the E71 which makes it a little harder to type on with one hand. The new track pad navigation provides a very inconsistent performance and it is not even close to the one on the newer blackberries. Scrolling up and down is perfectly fine but scrolling sideways becomes an exercise. The good news is that the original directional pad like on the E71 is still there so you can just disable the touchpad if you hate it just as much as I did after a week of usage.CAMERA: It is still a cell phone camera so keep your expectations low. It takes decent pictures and the quality is about the same as the E71 but with 5 megapixel images and slightly wider lens. The camera application now has built-in panorama mode. Video at 640x480 is plain horrible. The flash on this phone is actually pretty decent. One thing that was very annoying to me is that it uses a very bright focus light(AKA The flash) which makes focusing at macro impossible if you are trying to take a picture of something with brighter colors that reflect more light. There is no way to disable the focus light either, not even in macro mode. Nokia should think about this as well.BATTERY LIFE: There is simply nothing like it. Except the E71. The battery life on the E72 is also exceptional. I am able to get 2 to 3 days of very heavy usage on it, including 2 to 3 hours of talking, 2 hours of browsing and some text messaging. I have not seen any other phone in this category which gets even close to these stats.GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within 5 seconds. It seems a little faster than the E71. The E72 also has a compass.SOFTWARE-------------------------This is the bad part.FP2: Aside from unifying various internet connections I really did not see much if any of an improvement in this version of the Symbian OS. In fact it features some ugly menu transitions and it has a lot of stability issues. You would get out of memory error with a subsequent freezing at least a couple of times in a day and reboots and total freezes which require battery removal are not uncommon either.APPLICATION UNLOCK: Yes, the phone is hackable with HelloOX 2 and up.WEB BROWSER: The browser is definitely improved from the E71 afar as rendering and navigation goes. However I was never able to complete even ONE single browsing session without this thing crashing and just exiting in the middle of something. It would have been great if it did not crash.E-MAIL: About as bad as the client available on my first T-Mobile Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 2002. Although that one was a little better than what Nokia has provided. It is almost 2010 and Nokia still does not have an e-mail client which supports in-line HTML. The Nokia messaging software and service is plain horrible. After 3 days of usage I just cancelled my account and went to using webmail. It is really that bad and this is unacceptable for a supposed "business" device. As an alternative, I would recommend Emoze. Their software even partially supports in-line HTML. If you have Hotmail, you can download Windows Live for Symbian. It works really well.PODCASTING & INTERNET RADIO: Missing!!!???! Very disappointing.SIP CLIENT: Missing!!! The SIP settings are there, but there is no client. So forget about gizmo or any similar service unless you are using a third party client like Nimbuzz or Fring.OFFICE APPLICATIONS: This is one positive category. Quickoffice features a free upgrade to open and edit Office 2007 documents. Nokia has also added Wpresenter, Multiscanner and Font Magnifier as standard applications.--------------------Overall the E72 is a mixed bag for me. It delivers on speed and the browser is well improved but the stability issues, missing software and some other quirks make this device seem like a downgrade. If I was aware of these issues it is likely that I would have stayed with the E71. So if you are in doubt, my advice would be save your money or at least wait for a firmware update which fixes the stability issues. I hope this was helpful.
I was waiting for this phone since last 6 month after it was announced in Singapore. I had E51 and wanted to upgrade to a QUERTY business phone. I liked E71 and when i was about to buy e71 I found the news of E72.I was one the first few to purchase this for  almost 450$, But i am very happy with it till now. The features i liked most are1. The digital compass. This is the most essential hardware/software you require if you really want to use GPS.2. The Optical nav pad, This makes the scrolling really easy and enjoyable.3. The latest 600 Mhz processor which makes it the best performing mobile.4. The camera, finally Nokia's cameras are going to be useful. (I never liked Nokia's camera quality).5. The accelerometer which can be used in step counter software.6. The host of all the E series features.
I don't know what other people are talking about. But I just got my E72 in the mail yesterday, and set it all up, and finally got all the settings how I like it. And boy does this phone outperform ANY phone I have had. I installed iSMS for texting, the amazing new you tube application from the ovi store (looks better than any mobile you tube I've seen, even the iPhone), agile messenger and nimbuzz for IM, google maps, tweets60, JoikuSpot for tethering through WiFi!, S60Bible with ESV, DivX Player, FreeUnRAR, SIC! FTP, Calcium (Better Calculator), and of course Opera Mini for those times you just need it. I'm loving this phone, and best of all, it has a SUPER good quality Camera, it takes wonderful pictures with it's built-in auto focus! I was using the E75 for awhile and when I went to the E71... I was VERY disappointed, so I'm definitely glad to get a awesome camera back!Don't hesitate, buy today!Sign Free iSMS at OPDA.CN-------N. Maniscalco states that the browser doesn't do multiple pages, but it does, you can do up to different pages at a time.He also states that you can't select multiple messages to delete... well all you have to do is hold down the "shift button" the button that makes a letter capital, and then push up or down on the D-Pad, once you select a bunch you can stop skip one if need and then continue. VERY easy.Don't listen to people who don't KNOW symbian OS. Until you learn all the ins and outs, you'll never see how good a phone is. There are no ins and outs of other phones too simple like the iPhone, it's just too basic.
I suspect that guys giving 5 stars are getting paid money which should have gone into development and testing instead.I have had E65, E71 before this and like others here have been waiting for this half a year.I was not expecting much .. just a bit faster version of E71.Sp far I am amazed that they allow this to to pass quality testingHere are main issues:1) Psiloc World Traveler - if you are new owner don't touch it !! Once you configure it there is no getting rid of it. Since it is preinstalled you can't even uninstall it. So it keeps bugging me to connect to internet even when I am roaming.2) Truphone does not work with E72. This was my favorite VOIP application which I was able to use worldwide from any hotspot and call to my contacts directly. Entire VOIP integration is screwed up and you have to download it separately.3) No Podcasts. I was so used to download my favorite radio programms and listen to them on plane. So now I struggle with Escarpod.4) Browser is marginally better at rendering pages but crashes every session.Good stuff:1) Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail connections seem to be more stable. On E71 they were getting stuck at times2) Camera is better3) Google Maps work4) Fring works5) Call quality is good
This is a review of a Nokia E72.Disappointed.  Would not recommend.Stability -- Terrible.  Applications crash or lock up frequently.  My max uptime is less than one day.  It is trivial to crash this phone.  This is with the latest available firmware (as of 20099-12-13) and stock applications.  Sometimes the crash is limit to just one app, other times it's the whole phone.  Sometimes it locks up hard and the only way to recover is to remove the battery.  I've had to pull the battery three times in five days.Sound quality -- The sound quality during calls is excellent.  Plenty loud enough.Battery -- Battery life is excellent.  I can go two days on a full charge compared with one day on my iphone.  I'm impressed by the battery life.Web browser -- The built-in browser does not support tabs or multiple pages of any kind so you may spend a lot of time using the back button.  The only real alternative to the built-in browse is Opera Mobile 10, which is in beta and has some significant bugs on the E72 (e.g. the "u" key types an asterisk, "*").Mail -- I use the phone with both an IMAP sever and an Exchange server.  Both work well.  I've encountered two flaws.  One is with IMAP support.  You have no control over where copies of sent message are stored.  Unlike most IMAP clients you cannot choose the folder.  The other flaw is mass delete.  If you have many messages you wish to delete there are three options.  Mark all messages in the folder and delete (deletes *all* messages in the folder), delete and confirm each message individually (two clicks per message), or mark each message you wish to delete and delete (requires *five* clicks per message).Tethering -- I'm impressed how easy it was to tether via USB.  Works great with NetworkManager on Linux.  No extra drivers needed.  When phone asks, choose "PC Suite" mode.Overall -- It's a good phone when it works.  However, it is so unreliable that I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Is there hope in a newer firmware (when one is released)?  Maybe.  Unfortunately, the more I read and ask around, the more I heard that Nokia phones are not known for stability.  I'm doubtful.  It's pretty clear that Nokia is done with S60 and has moved on to the Maemo platform.  Going forward I don't expect them to put much effort into the S60 software.
after having motorola, palm, sony ericsson and other nokia i just have to say this phone is amazing , all its features are the result of years of R&D; from nokia.Highly recommened, you wont stop texting and using it all day long.Buy!
Could have been the perfect phone, the reason for me to finally ditch the iphone and get off the expensive data plan.OH WELL NOKIA, guess you should have made the plug in compatible with Snow Leopard.  I'm very very disappointed, after having waited months for this.  It almost became my next greatest phone after the E90.  I would still use it except the E90 doesn't work on AT&T;'s 3G freq.LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I called Nokia customer service and the tech support said to install isync on my E72.  The guy doesn't even know what isync is.  He said that he will transfer me to level 2 support, and they will call me back within 24-48 business hours.  BUSINESS HOURS???  I forgot to ask whether it was USA time zone or Philippines time zone.
I've bought a E71 in the past and was happy about it.  Great battery life, reasonable price, good keyboard and good quality.Now with E72 we have the same good features and some improved ones (like the resolution of the camera and screen size).I'd recommend for anyone that is looking for a reasonable priced, yet powerful smartphone.
Aside from the new exterior design of the E72, the problem I've been having is with the Mail for Exchange feature. I purposely bought this for work, but there seems to be a widespread firmware issue. Just go to Nokia Europe -> Discussions and do a search for: E72, MfE & Exchange 2003.
I bought this phone based on reviews on E71 and my old confidence on Nokia. But Nokia did an excellent job to mess up this phone. I couldn't believe they released this phone with so many software bugs. I was frustrated to set up the email, it was ok at the begining, but after my yahoo email is up and running, I was trying to set up the gmail, and found that all yahoo email configuration got into the gmail account. Then the nightmare started, oh.. my...Nokia should be a cell phone manufacture, they shouldn't get into smart phone unless they are sure they got some smart people.
Nokia's E72 is an amazing phone. I'm sure a lot of people will find this handset to be worth every cent. Compared with other full-qwerty phones, this E72 rates very highly.However, the Nokia E71 was a major selling phone globally, but got very little media coverage.Nokia, the dominant player in the global mobile market, gained mind share in the late 90s the old fashion way...delivering good phones to customers. There was relatively very little talk about Nokia in the press, but a lot of viral word of mouth.I'm very skeptical of the large media coverage of Apple iPhone, RIM Blackberry and Google Android. I can partly understand RIM's success in that they consistently targeted business users with push email. I've seen people use the iPhone in such a way to make sure that people around notice they're using something that's the current media talking point. I know of a few guys who buy iPhones only to give it to their wife, who use the iPhone for a while and then change to a more robust Nokia phone.I find that Nokia have a wide range of handset designs that are suited to a larger spectrum of users (teens, moms, young adults, professionals, seniors).However, some of the good phones seem to lack just "one thing" to attract full blown media blitz...not enough RAM, or lower res camera or keypad size or screen size.Nokia need to come up with a "cool and complete" phone every once in a while and commit more towards promoting that "cool and complete" model in the media.Nokia seem to be content to let the sales volumes speak up for some of their popular models (eg N95, E71), but supporting the sales volume with some marketing campaign may help to capture back some of the mindshare and the media space.Nokia's marketing certainly need to get their act together and put across a conherent message for each phone or range of phones.
Initially I was looking to buy a smartphone from cellphone service providers. Now a days pretty much of them are making dataplan as mandatory. Then I found this unlocked phone in Amazon, price seems to be acceptable compared of other websites. I never had problem with any of the Amazon site products. So I ordered one.BBPearl is very stylish phone, has all the necessary features, I liked the keypad size, feature to connect Wifi and display. It requires extra care since even small scratch will spoil the look of it. Especially if you are person like me who doesn't like wrapping cell phone with protection covers.When I received the package, cell phone package was littlebit dusty but inside all the items were wrapped in covers, everything was clean and working fine. Note that phone has a cellphone service provider logo on it and also hands free ear buds are bigger is size.
I've been using this phone for four days and those four days have been very blissful for me.I came from a Samsung Star touch screen phone and this Nokia 5800 Nav. edition blew it away. The Samsung star was good but it lacks wifi and GPS.With this phone you can pretty much do anything on the go. Wifi internet? let's go. Youtube viewing? No problem. Got lost while driving/walking? It will be your savior.PROS:Battery life is decent if you do heavy websurfing and GPS navigating.Battery life is super if you don't do the above too much.Build quality is good: it has a silver metal lining around the phone and it is pretty heavy compared to my Samsung Star.Free lifetime GPS: You get free map updates forever.Integrated GPS, not A(Assisted)-GPS like the original 5800 xpressMusic.I have a Garmin 255w GPS and the GPS on this phone almost keeps up with it in accuracy. The voice on this GPS sounds more human than the robotic voice on my Garmin. Hey, this is a phone, don't get your GPS expectation up too high.Quad band unlocked: take the phone anywhere, put in any simcard and you're good to go. Yes I am talking about AT&T; and T-mobile, too.Simcard and microSD card slots are on the side of the phone - unlike many other phones where you have to open the battery to put them in(though you have to open the battery to get the simcard out).Phone has two cameras: The main one in the back and a self portrait camera in the front for all you narcissists. =)Comes with a lot of accessories and cables.(Car mount for Navigation is very durable)The stylus comes in handy for handwriting on the phone.Speaker is typical for a Nokia: good. Music plays loud and clear, even got some bass.Charging time is quick for a high capacity battery.Good screen resolution (I think iPhone is lower at 480x320)Convenient phone lock/unlock button on the side for your thumbRadioCONS:The Main camera picture quality is average and doesn't look like it is 3.2MPDoesn't come with a screen protector (I had to buy one)Dialer keypad doesn't have letters when you dial numbers. Might be a problem if you want to dial in a number disguised in letters. Hopefully they will fix this.GPS on this phone takes a minute or two to lock in signal. Sometimes a few minutes if you're not in an opened place.Why can't I think of anything else?SYMBIAN OS VERSION 5:This is my first time using this OS and it has been good to me.Everything is very responsive and installing apps is a breeze.You can open a free OVI store account on your phone to download free apps, games and other stuff.If you want to use an all in one instant messenger to compliment your WiFi, I suggest downloading an app called Nimbuzz in the Ovi store and ditch the default IM app on your phone.Surfing the web is decent, but the screen may be a bit small for prolonged surfing.OVI store has lots of free apps(some you have to pay)Youtube videos play well, but don't expect to watch them in HD like you would on your PC.[...]All in all, this phone is worth every penny and if you wanna be different and not have an iPhone, this is the one to get.UPDATE: This phone version has the updated firmware of V30 with increased CPU power. (Open your dialer and Press in *#0000# to see your firmware version)UPDATE #2: I have been playing around more with the GPS and came to a conclusion that the text to speech on this phone gives me more instructions than my Garmin 255w. Though it doesn't speak street names(just "turn right" "turn left", "stay right" "stay left"...etc), it gives more instructions than the Garmin. For example, when I enter a freeway, it tells me to follow the freeway, and when I go over the speed limit, it tells me to watch my speed.LATEST UPDATE: It has been roughly five months of owning this baby and I can't live without it now. There is a new firmware update that added the support of kinetic scrolling and many other additions. Please update to firmware v40 if you have not yet done so. It is much more stable. You can update from your phone. (Open your dialer and Press in *#0000# - then go to options and check for updates.)
I will start by saying that Amazon's shipping was lightening fast. I received the phone in 2 days with free shipping.Unboxing the phone is a treat as there are tons of accessories included. The car mount is top notch quality. Phone booted up very quickly and setup was very smooth. 3G signal is very strong and never switches to Edge like my BB Bold and Iphone 3g did. You can't ask for more connectivity options, and data speeds have been very impressive. There is a ton of 3rd party software available both online and in the Ovi store. Not iPhone quality app store, but still nice. I found that most of the apps on my previous iPhone were largely unused anyway.I think the touch screen is very responsive. Remember, this is a resistive screen and not capacitive. It works with a stylus or fingers....even with gloves on;)Call quality is very good IMO. Music and video are simply fantastic on this device. The stereo speakers do a great job, or you can use the supplied ear buds or bluetooth stereo headset. GPS lock was very fast and held on well. It even gave the exact street addresses as I passed homes on a residential side street. Voice prompts are loud and clear and you get your choice of voices and language. So far I can't say anything bad about this phone. If I come across any issues I will update them here.For an unlocked phone without contract it's quite a bargain right now.****EDIT****Well after a couple of weeks the screen will not go past the white Nokia welcome screen. It's soon to be on it's way back to Amazon, unfortunately. I really like the phone, but I think I'm going back to HTC.
I was a bit hesitant about moving from a Nokia E71 to this phone because of the touchscreen. I like tactile feedback and the satisfaction of physically feeling a button being pressed. Yet at the same time I wanted something new. So far I am very satisfied with this phone. It has an excellent display and it is very snappy software Symbian s60v5 that makes my "old" e71 feel dated. The construction is solid and doesn't feel cheap at all. The e71 felt more "elegant" when I first bought it, but the 5800 doesn't feel as fragile as the e71 does. Its taken me about an hour to get all my usual apps on it, but it was easy to bluetooth direct connect and transfer everything from my old phone to this one. Apparently this phone is hovering around 7 million units sold worldwide, so it must be doing well. Unfortunately a lot of us in the USA need to be spoon fed iPhones. Which this phones does and then some. it has 100s of apps and themes and all that out there. Overall I'd go for 4.5 stars cause I wish it was maybe a quarter of its width thinner, but then again I think I was just used to the thin e71. Great phone.
Since my contract with T-Mobile had expired in July, I was looking around as to what to do next. I really like the plan I have and the customer service with T-Mobile. Only problem is that they really don't have a great selection of phones for renewal at a decent price. I also didn't want to switch to AT&T; just to get a free phone since I would get half the minutes and texts for the same price I'm paying with T-Mobile! Verizon and Sprint were a no-go for me.A friend told me about unlocked phones, so I was lucky this information came right around Black Friday weekend, when the Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition was on sale.GPSEDIT: To ensure you only use the integrated GPS and never carrier service:settings -> phone -> app. settings -> positioning -> positioning methods and turn off all but 'Integrated GPS'.First off, you DON'T need a data plan to use the GPS, but there are some things you cannot access on the road without it. These include: expanded POI's, traffic, weather, satellite and terrain backgrounds, etc. However, you can at least see what they are like by using wifi. You will need to edit some of the settings so you don't use A-GPS, which is carrier assisted (it's set to it by default). It does take longer to lock onto the satellites this way, but it's not painfully slow. Also, since you have lifetime drive and walk navigation and map updates, you can just use wifi to update everything. You can also download numerous voices. My other GPS has more computerised sounding voices, but these are crystal clear and realistic. In addition, you get weather, traffic, etc. for two years. It's also great to have the car mount and car charger included. You can view the maps in 2D or 3D and the 3D version has building models for downtown areas, etc. It's nice to see the actual buildings you are passing. Also, it shows clouds during the day and stars at night along the top of the screen, which is a nice touch. The included mini-CD lets you install Nokia's OVI Suite software so you can use the phone with your PC. They also have a map updater and loader you can download.MUSIC AND VIDEOThe 8GB microSD card comes with some music and videos on it that can obviously be deleted, but it's nice to get some freebies. It was already in the phone when I got mine. There are some good videos on how to use the device for different things, and a few music videos too! I like the XpressMusic Shortcut - very handy to access the pictures, photos, videos, etc. The camera is pretty decent for both photos and video, much better than my previous phone, so no complaints really there. It's nice there is a secondary camera too for video calls or self-pictures.The FM radio is a nice addition, although you have to have headphones in order to use it.One thing I really like is the two built-in speakers. They are loud and don't sound tinny at all.The phone has a lot of ringtones to choose from. At first I couldn't find them, but then I realised they were within the different profiles you can edit. They are all mp3-style ringtones with real music, etc.PHONECall quality is great and I actually get better reception with this phone than my previous one. Dialing is easy and texting can be done via a few different keyboards or handwriting with the stylus. I also like the voice-dialing - much easier to use than my last phone. Actually, when a call comes in it will also pronounce the name of the person calling (although in a very computerised voice).You can set up the home screen to show four applications or contacts. Also a search bar is below that which enables you to search the contents of your phone and the internet. Optionally, you can also set up your email and that shortcut is displayed below the search bar.The phone feels solidly built and sturdy. It's a nice size, maybe a tad more thick than I'd like, but overall it's a nice quality. Screen resolution is fantastic. I like the slight vibration when you touch an item to confirm you touched it. The volume, unlock and camera buttons are on the right side, while the sim card and microSD slots are on the left side. It's nice to have these external, but they still recommend you turn off the phone and remove the battery to add or remove the sim or microsd card. On the top of the phone are the power button, headphone jack and micro USB port.Battery life is also excellent. My first charge lasted 3 days with heavy use of everything, including the GPS. I expect with light use, it will last much longer.Some of the applications included are dictionary, converter, recorder, file manager and real player. The two games (Bounce and Global Race) are also pretty good.There are a lot of settings that you can fiddle around with to get it just the way you like it.Overall, this is a great alternative for those not wanting to have a contract, but wanting a great phone with all the features. The GPS features alone honestly makes it worth the cost.
This phone is definitely value for money. I was looking for a wifi enabled quad band phone that I could use while traveling. This phone fit right in, plus it has a GPS to boot. I use a t-mobile prepaid account so I dont use its 3G features, but use of regular WiFi where I can find it (home, work, public places, airports etc) it does the job pretty well ... and I have yet to explore its full potential.here's what I see as its advantages:1. WiFi enabled smart phone: Saves settings of multiple security enabled connections and connects automatically when it recognizes one is available. Allows you to disable use of 3G/provider based internet connection. Useful if you use a pre-paid ac.2. Nokia GPS3. Nokia Maps (over wifi/3G) - as in WiFi you can configure it to prompt before it goes online if wifi is not available.4. Memory expandable upto 16GB (8 GB micro SD is included with phone)5. Good Nokia / Ovi pc utilities to manage Phone book (nice), software updates, download/upload photo's, music, video's6. Interfaces with Windows Media Player7. SIP phone capability using the free NimBuzz download from the ovi site. I configured my voip home phone - ViaTalk.com - to work on this phone, works like a charm minus some issues that I have on my home phone which I think is a viatalk issue - it basically disables my home phone - if you can live with that its great. I have to re-boot/power off my phone router to make it work. I'll figure a way out :)8. Free apps on ovi.com: facebook, messenger, IM, weather etc.9. Email capability - havnt configured mine since I'm on a pc 10/24 anyway!10. Calendar & Phone Book - can be configured to sync with outlook or manage this purely using the pc based nokia utilities11. IM capability: I'm using NimBuzz which allows you to setup Skype, Yahoo, MSN etc all in one!!!12. Music player - Well! this phone was/is sold as a wma/mp3 player primarily... till now. - nice clear sound. Only downside is you need to carry a tiny adapter which also functions a a remote control for volume,next/prev etc. but other than this .. awesome sound.13. Handwriting capability: Pretty handy - I use this more & more every day!14. Large/small keyboard for typing. responsive and easy to use - needs getting used to .. as are all things new!15. Good sound quality (call volume) and no complaints about me being heard either16. Very good reception - better than most phones I've used so far17. No bugs - problems so far - no random rebooting - had this phone for a month now, updates etc have been solid!18. Nice clear screen even in the out doors!19. I nearly forgot to mention the great 3MP camera/video cam which takes pretty good pics. I also found a free app that allows the LED flash to be used as a flashlight.20. Additional self facing camera for video calls21. Size: I prefer this phone size to the iPhone, its compact and fits my pocket w/o being too heavy/bulky.Cons:1. On board memory could have been bigger!2. No real cons yet!!! hey wait .. battery life could be better. With heavy use (music, GPS you'll need to charge it every day!!! this sucks ... but I guess you pay for what you use. otherwise I charge once in 2/3/4 days depending on use.GPS Pros:1. Driving, Walking directions2. POI, places of interest.3. Clean/Clear maps 2D & 3D4. Create and download places/favs from the ovi site (better than my regular GPS can do!!!)5. 3 different routing options - turn by turn gives you distance to next turn6. Crisp/Clear human voice guidance (million times better than my regular GPS)GPS Cons1. POI's cannot be searched for by name except from the contact list. You must have the address???? It does allow you to search by category and lists several.  It finds most locations easily but doesn't include many POI's. for e.g. I was looking for the farmers market in my area ... I finally looked it up online and used the address to map it. so there is a workaround!!!2. The only reason I give it 4.5 stars is becoz the accuracy of the GPS in pin pointing its location leaves a bit to be desired, this can send you in the wrong direction but it does immediately recalculate the route.3. Directions do not include street names (as regular GPS do).4. Indoor reception is poor (like most GPS's I've seen though)For a GPS enabled all in one smart phone this definitely does the job and I'd recommend buying it.
Let me start by saying that I had the first generation of this phone, meaning the original 5800XpressMusic.  It was the first time I questioned the quality of the new Nokia phones as I had the Nokia 5610XM previously.  This newest version of the phone, however, is very high in quality.  No squeaks or anything coming from the body at all.  The buttons have much better tactical feedback and the black chrome and matte body looks 100x better than the original.The lifetime GPS software is easily the best feature of this phone.  While some reviewers may say that the GPS algorithms are pretty basic, this phone has the ability to "learn" the routes you take.  That was an impressive feature I discovered recently.  You get traffic reports, maps, and 3D imaging for free unlike the XM model.  Based on previous costs of the Nokia Maps GPS software, you are essentially buying a nice GPS device that doubles as a phone.  The mount is relatively easy to figure out how to put together.  Afterall, how hard can 2 screws and 2 holes fit together?  Needless to say, it makes an impressive fight against standalone GPS devices.  Also, even if you do not like Nokia Maps, Garmin has made their own GPS software that works just as well, if not better, than Nokia's version.Now for the music, while the basic player has some things to wish for, there is a nice program approved by Nokia in the OVI Suite that makes the music much better.  The phone is quite impressive for the small speakers on the side.  While you'll have a hard time hearing the bass on its own, with headphones, it is no problem at all!Now for the games and applications.  While the phone is no iPhone-killer, it makes a respectable alternative due to its features.  Games are now relatively plentiful as are the apps.  Even if some applications require the use of a directional pad, the 5800NavigationEdition puts up a digital pad for these applications or games.  The software support for this phone is improving overtime and its in a positive direction.For the business community, adding and checking emails are a breeze.  Its simple to the point where you don't have to read the directions at all.  Also a plus is the integration of Office Suite, which puts "MS Word/Excel" on your phone so you can open, read, and edit documents.  This is highly useful as an alternative to the netbooks that college students are currently using.  Paired with an optional bluetooth keyboard, this easily replaces my laptop and my paper notebook for notes in class.  Afterall, who would want to carry a heavy computing device just for notes and internet since the 5800NE can do both easily?  In fact, even AIM/Skype/MSN are perfectly incorporated when you download them for free (use FRING).  Overall, this is a great phone for people on the go.Battery life for this phone is generally something that could be improved but doesn't have to be.  After 3 hours of taking notes using my bluetooth keyboard, a unknown sum of text messages, and quite the number of phone calls, my battery is almost dead at the end of the day.  Thankfully this version of the 5800 includes a car charger.  You WILL need it if you need to rely on the GPS for more than an hour, but thats to be expected.The camera is something that also can be improved but it works well for most things.  Just be wary in times of darkness, thats all I can say.  Otherwise, its pretty decent.-----------------------------Based on my experience, I'd buy another if I had the chance (which I did afterall).  Its a great phone for the money.  It may take a small while to get used to but after that, its worth it.  This will definitely hold me off on purchasing another phone for a while, at least until the next XpressMusic or NavigationEdition Nokia model comes out.
The first few days I tested the 5800 with no SIM card ... wanted to see what it could do on its own (without using any cellular service).Music & Video Player:  Superb audio & video quality ... nice having the 2 built in stereo speakers.  Includes 8 gig of memory & is upgradable.GPS:  No data plan (or even phone service) is required.  Outstanding & full featured GPS.  Signal strength is excellent (as a standalone GPS) ... Full maps, POI's, directions, etc can be used with the built-in map data. If wifi or cellular service is available, you get added features (weather, traffic, more POI's, satellite images, and faster positioning). Worldwide maps are available for free from Nokia.Navigation version of the 5800 includes car adapter and mounting kit.Internet:  Can use wifi alone (without any cell service), bluetooth, or optionally, a cell phone data plan ... your choice.PDA features:  Usual functions ... work very well.  Additional software applications are available to download for even more features.Camera:  outdoor pics look good - indoor, not as good.Build quality: solid feel, clean design, & removable battery.Finally, as a phone it works well; clarity, features, battery life & overall usability are all excellent.Summary:While there are many other devices available, the Nokia 5800 is unique in that it can do so many things on its own, with or without a specific cellular carrier or a specific service plan.The 5800 is a very versatile and feature-packed device at a great price.  So muchmore than a phone:  a large high-res touch screen, full featured GPS, Audio/Video player, camera, WIFI, internet browser, bluetooth, etc ... all nicely integrated.  It should prove to be very useful at home, in the car, and while traveling.
I bought Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition 1 month back and this is the best phone i can have in that price range.It is build on Nokia 5800 Express Music well know as TUBE, with GPS also in place.What else you need a phone:Complete media player,GPS System,Internet Browsing,Touch Screen,Camera and Video Recording.And above all this is a phone.Touch Screen seems to be nice for me and to make it more effective you can use stylus.GPS works in Outdoor without any network connection required for the same.Music is excellent.You can download maps and upgrade your mobile applications with the Nokia Suite provided.Complete car kit when you use the phone as GPSThe only thing which was not upto the mark is the Camera Quality, I thought 3.2 mega pixel will do wonders, but any how i wont be using this as cameraI downloaded full movies in this phone and it is really working great.Preloaded with 8GB memory which is good enough to store maps, music and movies and you can extend it anytime.If somebody is looking for a smartphone at smart price nokia 5800 navigation edition is the answer to it.
Pros.- Nice size.- Good resolution- Can remove battery- GPS world maps require no data plan. I downloaded the world map (5.6Gb), but not all countries show detailed street maps like Japan and South Korea. Hope that is addressed in future downloads. Not many dedicated gps devices give you a world map for free and for life!- Camera photo quality is acceptable in day light, (but grainy in low light.)- LED flash a nice plus and can be used as a flash light/torch with torch app, but it has a low yellowish color. Bright white would be nice.- Video camera and a separate front video for conference a nice plus! Video camera has a light mode where LED light can be turn on during video recording.Cons:- Internal memory only came with 60Mb free space. Upgrading system apps can be difficult in the future, like future versions of Ovi map apps (not map data) which only install on system memory.- Only 4 shortcuts on the homepage- Symbian OS is not very user friendly. Need to simplify the user interface. Doesn't have the ability to scroll with one touch. Instead you have to click and drag a very thin scroll bar to scroll through apps. To exit from most apps you have to select "Options", scroll down to "Exit" (which is at the bottom). However there is the red phone button used to end calls and can exit from apps. But there should be a simple way on the touch screen.- The default browser overall isn't user friendly. But it does support flash such as Youtube videos. Opera mobile is nice but does not seem to support flash.- GPS navigation lacks. Can not pan map in navigation mode.- GPS signal can take up to 5 minutes to lock in even in open spaces (if you load gps from a different location and w/o A-GPS).- You have to go through multi step process to connect to the internet each time, even if using another app at the same time. This is probably for security, but a quick simple process would be nice.Other useful apps for this device: Opera Mobile, Google Maps Mobile, Torch app (turns phone into a flashlight/torch), world dictionary.Nokia is coming out with a new Symbian OS release for 2010 that should improve user interface.  Also a new release for Ovi Maps app is in the works.
The phone has what I wanted it: unlocked, wi-fi connection, good reception and loud.The GPS signal shows up in 1 to 5 minutes - I don't have any data plan. The routing seems not as good as stand-alone GPS. The GPS stopped at 3 occation without any reason - the phone was still functional and operational, but the current location just did not move as I drove.My biggest complain is that there is no way to view the route detail on text before start to drive.Overall, it works great as a phone, and it comes with a free GPS and a 3.2m flash lighted camera.Don't expect the GPS is as good as Garmin or TomTom, and don't expect the camera work as good as a 10 mega pixal camera. After all, it is just a nice phone with cool toys.
I have been using N95 8GB for a while, it doesn't have qwerty keyboard, only T9(so to press letter 'L', I need to press number '5' three times). That is why I upgraded to this one. 5800 is great, its touch screen is a great improvement over N95. GPS is very good too, although not tested enough yet. The GPS on N95 will cost about $10 a month, if I remember correctly, so this 5800 is a great free GPS.I noticed the phone has word 'Express Music' on it, so I believe the hardware is the same as the 5800 Express Music plus the life time GPS. That's why it is called 'Navigation Edition'. I am not sure if other software is different or not since I never used the Express Music. So I guess you can look at the reviews for Express Music, they may also apply.In my N95, I used the Nokia Internet Radio(not FM radio) quite a lot(with AT&T;'s 3G, I can listen to internet radios on the road), but somehow it can not be installed on the 5800, so I think the OS version is maybe somehow different(newer?), but applications like Internet Radio will catch up in the future. So I am not too worried. I know 5800 Express Music has been on the market for half a year in the US(not official count).The hardware on 5800 feels cheaper than N95, its camera is 3MP compared to N95's 5MP.But I will keep my 5800 for sure, it is way better just for the qwerty and GPS.Good luck finding your best phone!
Both my husband and I got this phone a couple weeks ago, and so far it has been a great experience. We did get the phones when they were on sale, and that was defintely an added bonus, but even without the sales, it's a great price for a phone.PROS:*Opening the box is exciting!*Setup of the phone is easy. I am not a techy person like my husband, and I had my phone all set up and ready to go before he even got home from work.*The phone looks nice and is good quality (my husband has already dropped it twice and all is well).*Battery life is good- I am not a heavy internet/GPS user, so I can usually go a couple days without recharging the phone. My husband, on the other hand, has the wi-fi/mobile network on 24/7- he usually plugs it in when he goes to bed at night.*Stylus- LOVE IT!*Two cameras- one in front and one on the back.*Radio access- awesome!*The GPS is easy to use. Just like any GPS device, it takes a little getting used to how to input directions.*Aps- Plenty of great applications available for downloading onto the phone. It's easy and painless, too.*KeyGuard- the lock on the side is fantastic and easy to use.*Music quality is great. With headphones or just letting it play for all to hear, I am impressed with the quality of the sound.The CONS:*Picture quality is disappointing. It's rather grainy.*The flash is painfully bright. Blindingly bright. It makes for a great flashlight when you happen to have your phone on you in the dark. :)*3G network doesn't really work for T-Mobile users. The slightly slower network and wi-fi do work just fine.*GPS can be a little slow.Really, that's all I can think of. I was hesitant to move to a smartphone, now that I have this UNLOCKED phone, it would be hard to go back to something simpler.
As my subject indicates, this phone was my very first touchscreen/smartphone--I have no regrets with this purchase.  See below details for my pros and cons.Cons:resason i'm writing cons first is b/c for most of us, all the wrongs come flowing first!*It's definitely a resistive touch.  Called such b/c there is a small vibration effect/feel after each touch.  Personally, I was annoyed at this feature first, but soon grew to love it b/c it's like feedback from your phone to your fingers (^_^) I consider this a con b/c many people may get annoyed initially like myself and not like it.*Slight lag when accessing home page and main menu.  When restarting phone, the homescreen contacts visibly load, meaning you can see them load one by one (up to four homescreen contacts)this is annoying.*although geared towards younger generation, the text feature does not include emoticons.  After brief research, I found there is no turn around for this.  I downloaded and installed "avatar sms," a chinese third party software which really worked well, but kept getting an annoying message "this application only works for phones puchased in CHina, Taiwan, Hong Kong..etc" after seeing that message pop-up constantly, i uninstalled it and use faces like :) :D ;-P etc*This phone is not an iphone.  For those of you apple/iphone haters (such as myself) please do not make the mistake of assuming this is an iphone killer, it's not.  However, it has amazing features and hardware that trump the iphone.  reason it's not an iphone killer is very simple, the Symbian OS is garbage--terribly lag, no emoticons, lack of support, etc*many things are double touch, where some things are simple touch.  This is a smally annoyance b/c you get used to it fast and learn quickly.*GPS for me has not worked it.  I am very frustrated at this since it's called the "navigation edition" I emailed nokia support and am awaiting assitance, I really want it to work (^_^)Now for the Pros:*Very beautiful looking phone, great aesthetics.  There is a silver metal band around the phone, looks very elegant in my opinion.  Your friends will def want to see it!*despite the lag, the phone is a joy to use and learn it's ample features.*Call/sound quality are superb.  Music sounds fantastic on the phone, ring tones are super loud and fully customizable; you can set ringtone for specific contacts.*GPS would be a good feature if it really worked...it's good having it there just to see the map of your location; comes in handy.I've been using the phone for little more than a week now, and overall I say it's def well priced at amazon and worth buying! Goodluck to all the potential consumers.
Very satisfied with the 5800 navi ed. It is super sleek. Great as a phone - speakerphone is good. I now have to carry only this phone - instead of my phone, camera, video camera, gps, mp3 player, netbook.I have had it for two weeks, trying out its different features. I have not found any flaws yet. It has replaced my netbook as the browsing machine at home. Opera Mobile is great for it  - nokia's own browser is good also. It's amazing how such a small device (compared to it the iphone and other smartphones are BULKY) is good for browsing. Nimbuzz works great on it for IM's.  Camera is ok for me. Gps is excellent.. takes a couple of minutes to get a fix first time, but after that its as good as my Garmin. Touchscreen is very receptive.The form factor of the phone gets me every time.. it's barely bigger than my Nokia classic - which means I don't need a carrycase for it..can slip it into my shirt or pant pockets and not even feel it.. a couple of times, I even thought I had lost it because I couldn't feel it ..I bought it so I don't have to be tied to my carrier. I'm using it with T-mobile, so not using the 3G on the phone (t-mo has its own  weird frequency for 3G which this phone does not support), but since I don't plan on using the phone with a data plan, its fine. I'm around wifi all the time, so this does not limit me.Get it and you will be pleasantly surprised - VERY.Update after 6 months use: Best voice quality on any cell phone I've had.. Amazing.
I've had this phone about a week. Having never owned a Nokia phone before, I didn't find it quite as intuitive to set up as my old Blackberry; but with WiFi and lifetime GPS? It was totally worth a few days of getting used to! I'm still trying to get the GPS to work right, though I'm pretty sure it's my lack of knowledge rather than the phone's capabilities in that area. Screen resolution is beautiful, and screen size for internet surfing is great if you turn it horizontally and go full screen. True, it doesn't have a ton of apps like the iPhone, but I haven't missed the other 9,900 so far. . . (It has enough.) The BEST part? ATT gave me $10 a month unlimited internet because this is not classified as a smart phone. My Blackberry? $30. iPhone? $30. This phone? $10, and no new 2-year contract. That makes it almost perfect!
Indeed, very nice phone.Wanted to buy a phone to work with in Europe. It means no subsidized phones and no iPhone at all. (it's crazy to buy a $700 iPhone and then unlock it).Took 5800 NE during Black Friday... wanted it anyway + price was too sweet. :)Don't regret it yet. :)Pros:- Nice touchscreen. Don't have to use stylus even with mini-QWERTY.- Always wanted a phone with a WiFi.- Good quality of music.- Remote control on a hands-free.- Jack plug for hands-free! (After SonyEricsson's plugs it's so great!)- Lived almost 4 days on a single charging with ~4-5 total hours of music + a bit of GPS and different explorations of a new toy. :) I think it's a Pros.- Lots of stuff in box.- Great price (at least it was 2 weeks ago :)).Cons:- No Euro 3G. (no big deal in fact, coz by the time we have good and cheap 3G in Moscow, I'll be buying the next phone :)) But even for U.S. - too little choice of carriers.- Takes too long to find a satellite (plain GPS). But probably situation will change away from U.S. or I'll just use A-GPS.- Don't know if it's possible to add songs to a playlist by folders, instead of one-by-one adding. Inconvenient.- Too sensitive accelerometer. Sometimes rotates the screen when it shouldn't.- SIM-card placement is very odd.- No screen protector in box. They cost a little, why just not include one?
This cell phone was a real bargain. Not only I got Nokia's first touch phone, I also got a lot of extras (lifetime Navigation license, car windshield mount, car charger 8gb mini SDHC memory card to name the highlights). Navigation license and the 8gb card are pre-installed and ready to go out of the box. I find Nokia Maps 3.0 is on par with TomTom and Garming offerings. The small size of the unit makes it very comfortable to use one handed. The screen resolution is great and is also very responsive, though not as an iPhone. Pictures and video look crisp. I only looked at the included Dark Knight trailer, I never liked watching movies on such a small screen though. The best past is that I got it sale for [...], this for an unlocked handset. The next best Nokia would be the N97 which sells for about twice as much. 3G locks on quickly (on At&T;) and is strong here in Tampa, FL. Wifi is also included, and works very well too. Call clarity is on par with previous Nokias I have had. Nokia's new email client is very cool and a snap to set up. You can get your emails from Gmail, Hotmail, etc. Web browsing is great with the included browser. The OS needs a little getting used to, but you can customize the screen to some extent so you don't need many clicks to do something. Being an XpressMusic handset, the music player sounds great. Song transfer was also quick, mind you I only loaded about 700 songs to it. There are many free apps to download on Nokia's Ovi store. There many other app outlets where you can buy Symbian apps which can easily be installed, [...] come to mind. And these outfits existed way before the Apple App store. I usually do it via Bluetooth.The item description says it has 900/1900 Mhz 3G frequencies, but the box says 850/1900 Mhz 3G, so it works with AT&T; 3G.To summarize. If you want the freedom of an unlocked handset, want many features and apps, and a great price, this one's for you.
I have been using this phone for two days now and I like it very much. Amazon did a commendable job in shipping (Free). Given below are the set of Pros and Cons that I found in my limited use till now:PROS:1. Good responsive and vibrant touchscreen: though sometimes i find it difficult to scroll with fingers when browsing. There is a neat feature of calibrating the touchscreen according to the amount of pressure you would like to apply for smooth response. You may surely want to try this before judging the touchscreen.2. Excellent battery backup. Charging time of the battery is surprisingly low. It clocked 2.5 hrs for me to charge completely. The battery do drains fast when using the WiFi.3. Decent WiFi Speed for a phone. YouTube seems to have some problem. The phone cannot play the video while buffering. So you have to wait for sometime till it buffers fully. I think its OK for a phone, though :)4. Doesn't look cheap at all. Rather feels solid in hand. The only two things that lower the classiness are a) the back battery cover, which has to be literally "ripped apart" for opening the battery compartment and b) the lock/unlock switch which is at a very inconvenient position. Nokia could have placed the switch on the top left side of the phone.5. Loud and clear music quality.CONS:1. I am very disappointed at the quality of the main camera. It is definitely far short of a 3.2 MP one. I have seen Nokia phones with 1.3 MP camera taking better pictures.2. The software portion for organizing music seems to be really stupid. It doesn't allow you to maintain your folders as you copy them on to the memory stick. It arranges the music files according to albums, genres, composers, etc, which is annoying. This should be fixed in future versions of the s/w.I haven't got the opportunity test the GPS till now. In fact I am yet to find out on how to use the GPS offline without having to incur any carrier-data cost. Can anyone help me in this regard?Overall this phone is worth every penny.
Prior to owning this phone I had a Nokia E71x that I got from at&t.; I enjoyed the phone, but saw the potential it could have if it were not for at&t; locking it down.Here is my review of the phone after using it for 30 days.What I liked:Podcasting App - automatically downloads podcasts from the internet. Unfortunately about 2 weeks into owning it, this app stopped working. I haven't been able to find a resolution in the Nokia Forums.Nokia/Ovi Maps - Comparable to a Garmin GPS, the interface isn't as friendly but it'll get you where you're going. This phone also comes with lifetime updates and turn-by-turn navigation which is really nice and works well. Using the Ovi maps website, it is nice to create routes and destinations that can be sync'd to your phone over the internet. A subset application, Nokia Sports Tracker, will allow you to track your movements using the built in GPS.Ovi.com - Nokia's answer to the itunes app store. You can set up an Ovi email account, sync calender/contacts to your phone, upload pictures and files, and download applications.Nokia/Ovi Suite - Nice way to interact your cell phone with your computer. Here you can create backups of your phone, download updates and apps, send text messages from your phone, sync music to it, and allows you to use your phone as a connection to the internet over the data network.It's not a PDA phone - at&t; doesnt have a classification for it, therefore you only have to pay the $15 monthly fee for unlimited data that you can remove at any time (as opposed to the $30 monthly fee at&t; makes you pay if you have a PDA phone that you cannot take off your account). I use it to listen to internet radio using the mobbler and wikitunes apps. Another app, Joiku spot allows you to use your phones data connection as a wireless router.Camera - it takes pretty good pictures for a camera phone and the photo viewer allows you to upload pictures to flickr or the ovi.com website.3rd Party apps - This is a mixed blessing. Not all apps available for nokia phones in general have to come from ovi.com, Nokia, or Nokia Beta labs. Just do an internet search for s60 apps. Some are pretty slick, others just bog down your phone. For example the app Mobbler isnt an approved app, but lets me listen to last.fm. There is a google voice app (not from google) out there that just bogged down my phone.The speakers - for a small quiet setting, the speakers on this can produce some really good music.What I don't like/needs improvement:Ovi store - Not alot of apps or free games. There are some good ones there but not the plethora found in the itunes apps store. Also, your phone will determine which apps you can use. On my E71x, I had an app called Nokia Internet Radio that allowed me to listen to some local radio stations on the web, but this is missing in the 5800.The power cord - Why do i need a separate power cord and data cord? My old Motorola Razr could charge from my pc while i was connected to it.Slow - When switching between apps, it sometimes hangs up and takes a second to catchup or when altering orientation, the screen will go blank for a second.Windows media player - I tried sync'ing my music using wmp, but only the first 15 seconds of each song was transfered. Do i really have to use the ovi music player to sync my music?Music PLayer - I dont like having to do an "update music" after downloading music/podcasts from my mac.FM radio - No real complaint here, just sometimes it gets great reception, other times it doesnt.VOIP - Maybe I am missing something here, but there should be no reason why i shouldnt be able to use VOIP on this phoen. I know fring will work but it has a significant delay on it and skype isnt available for this phone yet.Other:The basic phone functions seem to work well, no real problems with dropped calls or poor reception (except when in the boonies).I would give this phone  4 stars but I am currently working through a couple issues with the phone. One where the phone will lock up on the "Nokia" screen when starting. To work around this I pull the battery out, eject the micro-sd card, put the battery back in and then power it on hoping it will work. As of today I am having a problem with some of the internet applications crashing after they connect to the internet. I tried doing a "Reset to Factory Settings", but after restarting several times (see first issue) the phoen finally booted up, only to have the shortcuts missing. after trying to work through the problem I contacted Nokia, where the lady gave me instructions on how to send it in for repair.This is a really great phone, I am just disappointed that it is crapping out on me only after a month.****Update****I was able to do a factory reset (press red, green and camera buttons at the same time on start up), which solved all my problems (but erased all files including music, phone numbers, and downloaded apps).I purchased the phone with a $50 mail in rebate. I received a letter from Nokia stating that my phone was ineligible for the promotion and that i had not registered with the ovi store or maps. After a few phone calls with different departments in Nokia, I am told to resubmit my information with a copy of the UPC. Unfortunately, the original UPC was sent with the original rebate form and I did not retain a copy. For this reason, I am giving this phone 1 star. The phone itself has some unique issues but is a good phone for the reasons stated above. I am unhappy with the rebate responses and run-around I have received from Nokia.
I still can't believe that this phone does everything that it says it does. I would have paid half as much for just he navigation system. the phone has great reception and other than it is smaller than my old phone ( Motorola V9 felt like a phone but not cool.)Yes this phone uses power but it is powerful. Blue tooth is easy to turn on and off. Controls did not take long at all to get used toMy only peeve is that the box did not have a bar code and that may affect the $50 rebate, but to be honest my price was so right that I almost can't complain. I know, I just did but :-)
I just can say this cell phone is great. Nice touch screen, fast internet and very nice browser, I expanded to 16GB... Nice resolution. The 3G sinal is very strong. Sound is awesome and the design is simply beautiful. I totally recomend this phone. I had the 5800 XpressMusic and when this version came out I sold it to buy this upgrade and I can't tell with words how satisfied I am with this purchase. The GPS and the free maps are just outstanding and worth the extra money. Nokia has the best call reception and all the features needed even if you're a business person (send and receive e-mail, documents, internet, etc.) or just for fun (music, photos and videos) like me. 5 Star! You won't regret!
I use it as:- a FM radio- a MP3 player- GPS (in multiple languages)- USB driveand also a phone !!
This is my first week with the Nokia 5800 Xpressmusic Nav Ed. The most impressive aspect of the phone is that it is a very good phone and then a lot more. The sound quality on the phone, the speakerphone as well as a bluetooth headset is excellent. The display is responsive, but do not expect Iphone type performance. For a resistive display it is pretty darn good.Started to evaluate the phone against the specifications on the [...] website [...]# Talk time (maximum):- GSM 8.8 h- WCDMA 5 hThe phone with GSM on ATT network and bluetooth ON the phone ran for 3 hours and 45 minutes from full battery to zero. The GSM display read GSM 3.5 instead of GSM 3. This was with the network set to Dual mode and NOT GSM only. Thus without the bluetooth the life would have been about 4 hours and 15min or so. Which is really good considering the rated life is 5hours. The information on forums suggests that with GSM only operation one should be able to get twice as much life out of the phone battery.Used the GPS on the phone, even the first lock with the phone was relatively fast <30seconds or so. While driving the directions were appropriate as well as on time. The beta version of Ovi maps is more useful than the one preloaded on the phone. So feel free to explore. Used the GPS continuously for about an hour or so without the battery losing a single bar. Thus the GPS should be able to give about 4 hours or so of operation solely on the battery. Have not put this specification to full test. Will update when I have more information.I will keep adding to the review as I explore each feature of the phone in its entirety.
For all that this phone does, it is definitely worth the money.Things that work well for this phone:GPS does work without a data plan as I have tried it. It seems to work well too.Music and video playing is clear and max volume can be loud which is a good thingRadio is also a plusThings that this phone is ok at:The camera is so-so but I guess for a phone it's decent.Wifi works great but the browser does close from time to time.Web browsing also isn't as user friendly as an iphoneNot nearly as many apps as iphoneThe touch screen is not as responsive as iphone but still works good.Battery life is ok I seem to have to charge it every other day and I mostly use it for listening to music and watch some videos. I would say light-moderate use.All in all I have this phone for a week now and I love it. For an unlocked smart phone this is a jack of all trades type of phone. It does many things. It is certainly not as cool as an Iphone but considering it's true ownership cost is probably 1/20 of any other smart phone that requires 2yrs contract with a data plan, I think this phone is definitely worth the price.
This is my third Nokia phone, but my first one in years after several Sony Ericsson phones.The phone has a top-notch screen and great media features.  That maps of all of the US is built into the phone is great.  This means that the GPS works great even if you do not have cell phone coverage. The maps only take up about 1gb of the included 8gb memory card.The camera is quite good, even if it was a step down from my previous Sony Ericsson phone that had a 5.0 mp and Xenon flash. Now if I could use the second 3G camera to make video calls in the US.The built in Wi-Fi is great and works wonders if you do not want to spend money on a data plan.The phone is solid across the board like most Nokia products are.I use my phone with T-Mobile.If I could afford any phone I would buy a Nokia N97 or Sony Ericsson Satio.  For a great touch screen phone that is miles cheaper than the iPhone, this is a great option.  It has a better camera than the iPhone and the built in maps and video calling are better features than the iPhone offers. I also like the built in stylus which makes Internet browsing a breeze.
I got this phone so that I could replace my GPS, and the Ovi Maps 2.0 that comes with this phone is not very good. Even Ovi Maps 3.0 does not live up to expectations. There is no Text to Speech and the POI search only brings up the closest match. If you take a call in between, you'll need to start your navigation again. It once asked me to go over the divider and take a oneway in the wrong direction which pushed me over to seek an alternative. So I got Garmin Mobile XT installed on this. Mobile XT makes this on par with Garmin's dedicated PNDs and is very good. Only shortcoming is that XT also does not support Text to Speech. So you will still need to take your eyes of the road to look at the directions. Then I found out about the Ovi Map's Beta ([...]) which supports TTS and is much better than 3.0. So now I just choose between Mobile XT and Ovi Maps Beta depending on the features I need at that point.The touch screen is not multi touch or does not take gestures like the iPhone. But I wanted a phone that does not lock me in to a contract of an extra $30/mo. This phone lets me access the Web from hot spots. When I'm not near a hot spot, I can still get my Emails through [...] . So it works out great for me.
You can find many detailed reviews about this phone. In a nutshell, the user interface is not as good as iphone but the hardware is definitely comparable. By spending some time and finding better (and free) softwares online, you can enjoy using this phone.
Nokia 5800 is my first touch phone.The phone and features are ok (not too good or too bad)As I never used the touch phone before, I find it very difficult (more distracting) to even dial speed dial numbers when driving.The GPS works perfect even without a data plan. The only catch is the manual says to go online when connecting GPS, but do not do that. It seems that it will access data over the wireless network.The phone I got started to give very less talktime < 2hrs as opposed the spec says > 8hrs.The features are great if compared with other touch phones. The touch screen does not seem to be responsive (may be I should not compare with iphone :-) )
Basically, what you are giving up with this phone by not getting the iphone is the iphone apps.  If you must have those, then you need the iphone.  However, here's what you're gaining by getting the 5800:The 5800 is an unlocked phone!!!  No contract!!!  With iphone you are stuck for 2 years with a locked phone on AT&T; in addition to whatever they charge you for the GPS service, which is free with the 5800.  iphone charges something like $30 per month for this priveledge, plus around $200 up front, so in total I have to pay close to $1,000 for an iphone?  Forget it!Better screen resolution, 5800 has 640x360 vs. iphone 480x320.  It really is crisp, you need to see it.5800 has a camera on the front for video calling.  iphone: nope.5800 has a removable battery and memory, iphone not so much.iphone has two finger zoom... ummmm... golly!  Who cares!  This is a gimmic and requires two hands, it's super easy for me to press the zoom in and out icons on the screen of my 5800.5800 is a little slimmer (horizontal) and a little shorter, but a little thicker (depth) than the iphone.  It's about the same size as my old KRZR.  I prefer this to the wider iphone.Honestly, with a phone like the 5800, the joke is on the people walking around with their overpriced iphones!
This is my first touch screen phone. I was looking for something small with all features. iPhone is big and does not have FM and more over its very costly. This is a great phone for the price. Configuration was vrey easy. Will surely recommend this. The delivery was very fast.
Wow! This phone is awesome! It has everything somebody could need. I had the 5800 Express Music and when this new version came out I decided to upgrade. This phone worth the extra money. GPS, free maps, awesome music player, I also bought a 16GB Nokia memory and... Wow! This great! I have more than 1,200 and 20 videos. There's a lot of apps for this phone. You can find them at the Ovi Store (The Ovi Store is already pre-installed. I wish I could give more than 5 stars to this phone.
Pros:- Free maps and navigation.- Free email client.- Battery lasts up to 2 days.- Fast internet browser.- Good call quality.- Secondary camera.- Nokia's Ovi Store constantly updated.Cons:- No music equalizer, just presets, and poor playlist manager.- No FM transmitter (Amazon, fix that description).- Cannot be charged through the USB port.
just one black point: ovi maps for Costa Rica are very very bad... ... seriously... are badthe cellphone is really awesome... I love itCompré el celular para ser utilizado en Costa Rica... la señal con el ICE está muy bien (mejoró con 3g) capta bien los satelites.en verdad un muy buen celular... no me gustan los mapas de ovi... pero se le puede instalar garmin tx mobile... perfecto
What it has that regular 5800XM doesn't is a lifetime GPS licenses, like a regular GPS (you know what im talk about?). This phone has everything i ever wanted in a single solution. works very well.Pros:1.phone,mp3,mp4,camera,GPS,PDA,6 in 1.2.cheap for what it does.Cons:1.weird touch screen. a very soft lcd pannel that looks flat but my finger tells otherwise. the center goes in(concaved) and giving me a unlevel feeling when i drag map around.2.mulitple softwares need to be installed, complicat3.4.Still dont like the touch screen very much, but the other problems i was having before, i had them streighten out thanx to V.Phan.like i said in title, this phone is a super star.
I am still working on understanding all the features of this phone. It is so cool.
Calls, messaging, gps, WiFi, all work well. I haven't tested Blue Tooth yet. Strange tapping (sometimes once, other times twice) is something I am still getting used to but no big deal. Touch screen is responsive.
Its a nice phone. I have always been a Nokia fan. But after I had it for 4 days, it froze on me. After I switched it off and then back on, it froze on the White screen with Nokia Logo in Blue. After that I tried everything, nothing worked. Contacted Nokia Support, they also couldn't figure out the problem. So they suggested that I return it to Amazon.First I thought I'll return it for the money refund, but then I thought, while it was working it was good phone for the price, loaded with a lot of features. So I called Amazon for replacement, and shipped me the replacement same day. I have it for 1 week now, and its working fine so far. As for the defective one, I later figured out the problem on my own. When I removed the memory card from the phone and switched it on, BINGO, it worked, then I put the memory card back in. Switched off and on it worked. But later in the day I tried it again and it froze again. Same trick again worked to switch on. But the problem kept coming back. I shipped back the defective one today after transferring the data to the replacement piece.Ovi Store is cool, you can get a lot of fun games and applications like on iPhone or iPod touch.3.5 out of 5 (cut half marks for the trouble i had)
I am having a terrible time with this phone. I basically wanted a quad-band phone I could use internationally, and I can't get a new Iphone until February (I lost mine a few months ago.) This phone is so annoying after you've had one of the premium smartphones.Four MAJOR issues:OS - it's really difficult to customize the 5800 to where it's effective. You can only have 4 shortcuts on the homescreen when there's no reason you couldn't have more. I don't expect an OS on the level of the iphone or google, but Nokia really needs to hire better programmers if they expect to compete in the future. Making a call to a contact can either be a simple process, but if you do what's intuitive, ie tap the name of the person twice, you will have to select the number to call, then decide whether to call or text, then decide if you want to do a video call or a regular call.GPS - I really wanted this thing for the GPS, but I can't get this thing to track my location in the offline capacity. IT'S CALLED THE NAVIGATION EDITION FOR GOD'S SAKE! I've tried it EVERYWHERE (and I live in Socal and have to drive around a lot). I assume to get it to work you should have to buy a data plan, but I didn't want to and the advertisements on the product description lead you to believe that you don't need it. Really disappointed for this. I mean REALLY DISAPPOINTED.Texting - horrible horrible horrible interface. It's probably good in that I will never even try texting and driving because I will cause a 12 car pileup just trying on this phone! The small QWERTY requires using the stylus (unless you like your texts giving you the spelling ability of an illiterate, clients sure love that!) but usage of the keyboard isn't linked to the accelerometer (doesn't switch to landscape when you turn it, stays TINY). Why why why.Screen doesn't work in sunlight - What the hell is this phone, a Twilight vampire? Good god if it's even adjacent to sunlight, you can't read a single thing on the phone. Driving during the day? Hope it's not sunny outside.Random other annoyances:1.Battery life is so-so, good for a smart-phone, but nowhere near what the tests say.2.Call clarity - people I talk to keep complaining about being able to hear me3.Car kit - TOTAL PAIN TO USE, I feel like I have to pry my phone from its iron claws4.No FM transmitter - I could have SWORN it was supposed to come with one. I think I read some wrong review here that said it had one. GRRRRRR5.Internet browser totally sucksI'll throw in the pluses:1.Great speaker for music - it's almost like a mini boombox! Speaker isn't great for calls though2.External storage 8GBincl - pretty cool that it has microSD3.Nice screen (when you're in the dark)4.Convenient hard buttons (the lock, volume, cam, on/off, and 3 call/menu/cancel buttons work well)CONCLUSION: get the fricken contract and get a good phone. This one's not it. Nokia makes a great phone physically, but the OS is not even 2nd rate. Hire the software design people and get it right, Nokia.
sad to say i got a lemon product, it worked at the beginning, after i turn it off, it just died on me, i have sent it to to Nokia for repair, i will follow up later to review their warranty service, and more on the phone.
This review is based only on a quick once-over of the device, between getting it from the mail guy and putting it under the Christmas tree :)- Form factor is acceptable for a jeans pocket, though a tad too thick.- Looks and feels cheap. First smartphone I ever saw that didn't have a latch on the battery compartment -- you just force the lid off.- Screen is bright and clear, lots of pixels, just as advertised.- The touch sensor works very well with stylus, not so with bare finger. In fact, stylus is definitely required.- Surprisingly, the UI controls are mostly finger-sized. Even the smallish QWERTY pad is not much harder to use than iPhone's (isn't that damning with faint praise though? :-) )- The whole new Symbian UI is confused -- feels like nobody actually thought it through. iPhone it ain't :( Many selections require double-tap for no particular reason, the logic of scrolling is incomprehensible. Some text boxes do not bring up the keyboard automatically -- need to double-tap them. And why is the wretched 12-key pad the default keyboard layout in most places?- Web browser feels more responsive than in my E71 (faster CPU?) but still not responsive enough. iPhone-ish weirdness with variable page scale without iPhone's pinch gesture is positively irritating. I would much prefer to have pages laid out to screen width by default, the way they are on E71.- Ovi maps look nice on big screen, but the performance of built-in GPS is weak: slow to get a fix, often loses signal. Can't really use this as a driving aid, windshield mount notwithstanding. Assisted positioning works well but is, of course, imprecise.Overall: it is well worth $200 (AR) I paid for it. It is not, and never will be, an iPhone. Other vendors have touchscreen phones with better look and feel too but not for $200 unlocked w/o a service plan :) What I've seen of recent Palm devices did not impress me, but some of them do sell for less.PS. Nokia, your N900 better be heads and shoulders above this level!
I just bought a new Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition.I lost my simple Motorola Razer, and needed a new mobile phone. Based upon my needs, I wanted the following:1. Mobile telephone2. Unlocked3. Four Band International Use4. Email5. MP3 Player6. GPSThe 5800 includes all of these features, but I had no idea what I got myself into, buying this model. I used to equate Nokia with quality and simplicity. Made in China, this has got to be the most clumsy cell phone made. The limited users guide reads like it was translated from a different language, and only provides minimal help. Registering as a Nokia user allowed me to search their website. I was able to download a more extensive manual. Both manuals refer to some selections in "options" that are not present on the 5800.The navigation edition comes with a CR-103 telephone cradle, in four parts, with two screws, and no instructions on how to put the pieces together. An hour on the Nokia website and only mention of the CR-103. I sent an email asking for instructions, more wait time.With the lack of a decent users manual the owner is left to intuition. That won't help much here either. The telephone desktop is extremely misleading. Clicking on a compass icon should allow me to access the GPS features right? From there I should be able to find my location on a map, enter an address to navigate to? Wrong. After a couple of hours of working with it, and reading the extended users guide, I find you have to click on "Accessories" icon, followed by a click on the "Location" icon, followed by a click in the upper right hand corner of the screen to display the choices.No intuition to help you in making the first telephone call. A quick read in the users guide shows you what icon to select, it brings up a screen that looks like a telephone pad, and from there you can make a simple telephone call.There is an email wizard to help you set up email. Following the wizard I was able to enter all relevant data. The first test email came back with a non-specific message that indicated my setup didn't work, but no additional information as to why. Nothing in the users guide to help either. This one requires an hour long trip to my service providers office, wait in line, and get some teckie there to help figure it out. He had to delete the email settings and start over.There hasn't been enough time in the three days I've had it to try to load MP3 music or photographs.On the good side there is a website for Nokia users to join. Once your 5800 is working you can register it on the website [...] and use features there to set up contacts and schedules, load mp3 and photos, and so on.In summary, my need for mobile telephone got in the way of doing the research I should have done. I should have gone to the service providers office and actually tried to use one of these, and then bought the unlocked model on Amazon.com.
Great FeaturesUnlocked, GPS, wifi, 3G etc  all the box saysGreat Value Package Contains 8 GB card, car mount, car charger, head phones, etc  Again all that listed on boxIt feels like you get all the accessories that you need.( or is it that  all chinese junk from a dollar shop packed together( Surprisingly car mount is made in germany)Lets talk about features in detailGPS :  Good : Works without data plan.  Not so good : No text to speech, not so intutive. Not comparable to a dedicated unit in ease of use or features .Wifi : GoodTouch screen : good.Music : Good : oh god it plays music too. and radio and video - oh crap every phone does that now. Not so good : Speakers not so great. Whatever Nokia fans say.Camera and Flash Good : it has camera and some lights Not so good : No good pictures and you can not use lights alone with out downloading some third party app.Battery. Good: having a battery Not so good : having to charge more oftenLets come to the main function as a phoneThe phone has lots of features but none of them are customizable.1. 4 shortcuts only on a screen that can accomodate more ? Shame on U nokia2. 4 contacts only in the conatcts bar  that can accomodate more ? Shame on U nokia3. Non customizable soft-touch feature in top-right corner4. Non customizable buttons5. Not so great bluettoh management6. Lot of things or many taps away from home screen because of above limitations. tap, tap ,tap  and tap and finally  ahh...rga...sm .Ex 1. there is no way to disable auto redialing from blue tooth. ( Nokia fans - help here)Ex 2. if I have to turn off a blue tooth or swith to another blue tooth 1. tap on top corner  ( or  -> menu -> settings -> bluetooth ) 2. tap on bluetooth 3. tap on paired devices 4. tap on desired device 5. tap on options 6. tap on connect or disconectNokia fans - please let me know if there is a less than 3taps way to switch between bluetooths or headset/speaker etcAanother annoyance - no going back to previous applicationEx 3 : I am playing a video. in between I wanted to check out my calendar.once I finish calendar activity after several taps away- it goes to home screen and stay there.to go back to video again I have to do more tap dancing.Another annoyance : asking for things repeatedlyEx 4 : I have no data plan. So when I want to go online -I have to select one of the 3 options that include my wifi.There is no way to set it at system level so it doesn't ask me every time I go online.Ex 5: One touch dialing -  once you get to one touch dialing after a click or more depending on what you have on your short cuts, and finally press the number to quick dial it will ask for another confirmation.Symbian imbicles : The purpose of buying an advanced phone is todo some kind of personalization and customization.  This is phone is useless in this regard.Comparing with other phones.Nokia 5800  looks and weighs like a decent size phone.Iphone feels and weighs like a travel size iron.Some other phones looks like electronic type writersIphone is not owned by you - you use it the way they tell .Its like renting a wom..n.  All the exotic things and thats all.Nokia 5800 supposed to become yours as per specs. but it doesn't - it become poor man's iphone.I request Nokia and Symbian pioneers to reply with helpful hints so we can improve the rating.For now one star is good since we cant have ZERO stars.All the crap in the box still not worth more than 2 digit price tag.
My 5800's touch screen doesn`t work well. It's too slow and stupid. I have to touch it many many times, and it doesn't work. I just recrived it this afternoon.I don't know why,only my cell phone have this problem?
3G does not work with T-mobile's network! So, that leaves only one big network - AT and T.How different is this from a AT&T; branded phone then?
This phone looks great and the system works fine but the touch screen is horrible. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. I try using it for a couple of days and I got really annoyed using it. The phone feels cheap and the "unlock button" is in a very inconvenience spot and every time you want to unlock it you have to slide it down, which by the way it also feels really cheap. For the price I don't think this phone is worth it.
I have been a Amazon customer for many years and this is the first time that I have had any problem - probably because this product was purchased from Tiger Direct through Amazon. I ordered a new 8120 Blackberry phone as a gift for my daughter. I received a damaged phone (the back would not close ), without any documentation or software. I emailed for an return authorization number packing the phone in the original box that I received it in. After several emails over the next few weeks inquiring about the status of the returned item I finally received the SAME PHONE BACK with Tiger Direct claiming that I had sent in the wrong phone. This is the only Blackberry I have ever purchased so I had no other phone to substitute it for. They claim that the packing has no UAPC code which is true -- BUT IT IS THE SAME BOX IT CAME IN! Long story short Tiger Direct via Amazon send me a defective phone that is the wrong model without any documentation or software. When I send it back they claim it's the wrong phone and cannot accept it. IT IS THE WRONG PHONE YOU IDIOTS  - YOU SENT IT TO ME! DO NOT BUY A PHONE FROM TIGER DIRECT - IT IS A RIP OFF!Joe Ferrari
The TwitterPeek is a handheld, dedicated Twitter device recently released by Peek, a company which also makes a similar device for email, the Peek Pronto. The TwitterPeek runs on a wireless network and allows you to Twitter from anywhere in the U.S. where you can get a T-Mobile signal. No wi-fi signal is needed. It sells for $99.99, which gives you six months of free service. After that it'll cost you $7.95 a month. Or you can buy a TwitterPeek for $199.99, which gives you free service for the lifetime of the unit, no monthly fees ever.I was very excited about the TwitterPeek when news of it surfaced. I was initially put off by the cost of the device, but my lust for the TwitterPeek got the better of me, and I also rethought my position somewhat. The unit itself costs $52.29 if you subtract the six months of service from the $99.99 price tag. Or for $199 you get potentially years' worth of always-on connection to Twitter. Go the latter route and it becomes very cost-effective over time if you're a big Twitter user.Given my excitement about the release of the TwitterPeek, I was very interested in following its reception in the Twittersphere. So I was really shocked to read that early impressions of the product were extremely negative. I shouldn't say impressions of the product, I guess, because most of the people who were Twittering and blogging about the device early on had never seen or used one. There were two main objections to the device raised: (1) it only does Twitter, and multi-function devices are superior; single-use devices should be avoided; and (2) smartphones already do Twitter, so there's no need for a dedicated Twitter device. These objections, worth raising, were, however, often accompanied by a surprising amount of vitriol. For some reason, a lot of people don't want such a device to exist: they see no use for it themselves, and don't want other people to see a use for it either.Regarding the two objections above, the point is, it really depends on your needs. If you have a smartphone that's already giving you always-on Twitter, then there's absolutely no need for you to buy a TwitterPeek. But not everyone wants to cough up the monthly fees required for smartphones. I myself hate using the phone, landline or cell. I have a basic Tracfone that cost me $20 to buy and costs me $20 every THREE MONTHS to keep going. I hardly ever use it, but it's good to have for emergencies. I have an iPod Touch that gives me virtually all the benefits of an iPhone, but without a camera (which I don't need) and without the cell phone (which I don't need or want). But I'm tethered to wi-fi with it. So what am I missing? The ability to Twitter when I'm away from a wi-fi signal. That's what TwitterPeek provides.Some people may object as well that one doesn't NEED to Twitter at all times, and of course that's true. But it's a good way to stay in touch with friends and family, and it's a legitimate a mode of communication. If you don't like Twitter or use it enough to want to use it on the go, then again, the TwitterPeek isn't for you.There have also been, let's say, more rational reviews of the TwitterPeek that have criticized its features, which is fine. I just object to the crazed bashing that has occurred over the very existence of the device.After a lot of obsessive TwitterPeek watching I finally bought myself one, and I've been using it pretty intensively for the last 24 hours. It's a mix of good and bad; some things could be improved. But on the whole, I like it, and I'm not sorry to have spent the money. In more detail:SET-UPThe set-up of the device is simple--you pretty much just input your existing Twitter credentials. But it wasn't immediately obvious from the documentation that you have to activate your device online first. Once you do that, it only takes a couple minutes to be up and running.NAVIGATION: SCROLL WHEEL AND KEYBOARDThe TwitterPeek comes with a full QWERTY keyboard, which is really nice. The keys are stiff but not too stiff, with the exception of the space bar, which is a little too stiff for my comfort. On my second day of ownership I gave myself a typing test to see how many characters I could type in one minute on the TwitterPeek vs. the iPod Touch (which I've owned for close to a year). The results:  * iPod Touch: 206 characters with 5 mistakes  * TwitterPeek: 173 characters with 0 mistakesAs other reviewers have noticed, navigating the TwitterPeek's menus and viewing tweets using the scroll wheel is much too awkward. Happily, most actions can be performed with keyboard shortcuts. These work very nicely. My favorite detail is that you can hold down a letter or number key and it will become either a capital or the associated symbol. (One shortcut I discovered but didn't see in the documentation: shift-S for settings menu.)Still, there are some things that you have to use the scroll bar for, which is unfortunate. Ideally, I would like to have every action performable from the keyboard. That means, I'd like to somehow see directional keys on the keyboard. The Kindle's four-way toggle comes to mind as a possiblity. (To move left or right within a tweet you're writing you have to press shift and use the scroll wheel.) When you're in a menu, or a tweet for that matter, you have to back out using the back button on the side of the device. To me it seems unnatural to use buttons on the side when you're otherwise focused on the keyboard--it's disruptive, like reaching for a mouse when you're typing. So I'd like to have a back button on the keyboard. I'd also like to have a quicker way to get to the home screen than backing out two or three times if you're inside the menus (shift-H?).The keyboard, by the way, is lockable in case you're worried about accidental keystrokes. Though I think the keys are stiff enough that that's not a likely problem.ABILITY TO FAVORITE A TWEET NEEDEDYou can follow links that are included in tweets received, but you'll only get a text copy of the web page. In some cases this is fine, but it's obviously not always going to be enough. This doesn't bother me, because I'm happy to wait until I get to my computer to view interesting links. However, to this end I'd like to be able to favorite a tweet as a sort of bookmark so I can go back to it easily (for example, shift-F would work nicely). This isn't possible currently. Instead, I've been reduced to direct messaging myself the tweet as a reminder, which is an annoying work-around.NOTIFICATIONSYou can be notified of new tweets either by a sound (there's are five choices, but I prefer the chirp) or by vibration or both. You can be notified either of all tweets or only @messages and dm's, or you can turn notifications off. In addition, when new tweets come in the little envelope in the upper left of the device blinks. I rather like hearing my TwitterPeek chirp throughout the day, I must say. I would suggest two improvements to notifications:  1. Make it possible to receive different alerts for @messages and dm's vs. other new tweets. For example, one might want to hear chirps for stuff that's directed at you, but a different sound or only vibration for regular tweets.  2. There is an airplane mode on the device, which I gather shuts down the wireless connectivity temporarily. (I'm not sure why that's preferable to turning it off.) But I would like to have a temporary mute button. Sure, you can go into the menus to turn the alerts off when you want to, but it would be easier to be able to, say, shift-M them away for the length of a movie.ABILITY TO MARK TWEETS AS READ NEEDEDPeople have complained that the TwitterPeek makes reading your tweets difficult because it only lists the first lines of the tweets on your home screen. You see part of the Twitter id of the person sending the message then a snippet of the tweet and then the time it was sent. In real use I haven't found this problematic. Most often I go into a tweet and then jump to the next one or the previous one using the N and P keyboard shortcuts. Also, if the full tweets were displayed then you would only be able to see two or three at a time, which would increase the amount of scrolling you have to do, which would be bad.I do dislike very much, however, the fact that the TwitterPeek does not mark as read tweets that you have entered to read. I hate to guess where I've left off reading in the Twitter stream. (Though it does keep your last place highlighted as new tweets come in.)SPEEDSitting with my TwitterPeek in front of my Mac with Tweetie open on the desktop, the reception of tweets by the two devices is roughly the same. Sometimes a tweet will come in first on Tweetie, sometimes on TwitterPeek. There's been no noticeable difference. (Where the TwitterPeek does lag slightly is when performing functions like discarding an unfinished tweet. But it's not a huge lag.)APPEARANCEThe device itself is pretty attractive, I think. It has a solid feel. The keyboard is nicely laid out. I particularly appreciate that so much information is relayed in a tiny, attractive strip at the top of the color screen:You have the Twitter logo, then a signal strength indicator, battery indicator, time and date, and the Twitter bird (which flies when it's communicating with the network), and finally  the name of the screen you're on (home, settings, etc.). A lot of information in an attractively designed space.As for the font of the tweets, it's not as attractive as what one sees on the iPod Touch/iPhone--I'm thinking here of Tweetie 2 (a great app). Somehow the TwitterPeek font looks like it's not smooth.The appearance of the tweets would also be improved by the inclusion of avatars. These do not currently appear with the tweets.DIRECT MESSAGESI actually haven't quite figured this out yet. But it seems that direct messages that I send out appear on my home page as messages in. (I've confirmed and they are sent as dm's, however.) This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's confusing.ONE ACCOUNT AT A TIMEYou can only have one Twitter account associated with your TwitterPeek at a time. That is, if you want, you can switch between accounts by resetting your information, but there's no easy way to move from one account to another. Obviously, it would be better if you could do that.SEARCHYou can search the messages that are on your device, but you cannot search the Twitterstream as a whole. The more I use Twitter, the more I think that search is an enormously important aspect of it. So it would be nice to be able to follow keyword searches on the TwitterPeek on the go. Then again, I can catch up once I'm back at my computer, so it's not a huge negative for me.-- Debra Hamel
i really like my twitterpeek  i could almost go as far as say it is essential to take with me all the time, but that is reserved for my peek. remember this is targeted to folks who don't want to have a smartphone with a 40 dollar a month data plan along with the really expensive phone. a lot of people really like to bash this thing on the internet, but to be honest it is very functional and practical to use.you may not get a web browser but you do get to see twitpics and text versions of news sites like techcrunch. i find it doesn't really need anything else. i found almost no lag when using the device, i can always tell when i have a tweet waiting for me, and the keyboard is absolutely awesome. i have relatively large hands and am still able to type on the small keyboard. if you don't have/want a smartphone and you want to tweet on the go then twitterpeek is definitely for you!
FIRST OFF: Unlike at least one reviewer, I actually OWN THIS THING. I urge you to ignore people reviewing it based on the concept alone.VERDICT: Great device for anyone who likes Twitter even a little bit, because within a week you'll love it even more. It's not very expensive, and it's addictive. It may not be worth it if you always want the brand new Twitter features, or if you already have a smartphone, but if you want *just* solid Twittering and won't pay for a smartphone and data, this thing is great. It's far more elegant than Twitter-by-SMS and a good competitor for other Twitter clients.FULL REVIEW:First thing I noticed was, if I don't have a Twitter account, I'm directed to [...]. This is inefficient for a device that should be able to help me register on its own, without the net.Next, I had a validation error and had to call Peek. They were very nice, but said I had to wait until Monday. I gave them all the info they needed and then, time to wait.Once I got the thing going, I noticed that it took a minute to get my list loaded and ready. Some things were a bit confusing, coming from the Peek Pronto, such as keyboard shortcuts. I kept trying to use 'T' to scroll to the top, and on TwitterPeek this opens a new tweet. The shortcuts are there, they're just different.Once loaded and going, I liked the layout. It looks like an email inbox, honestly, but it works well, I think. It seems a bit slow - when I'm at my computer and get an email, by Pronto alerts me almost as fast as I see it on Gmail, but when a new Twitter post happens, TwitterPeek seems kind of behind. For example, it's 2:23pm as I write this and the thing just whistled for a 2:19 post. At first I thought it was actually having some delay. As it turns out I think it's polling about every 5 minutes. So, you'll get your average Twitter post after 2 and a half minutes, worst case 5 minutes (best case instant). Of course, this is my rough estimate based on my experience.One thing I wasn't relying on was this: It's addictive. It's really a great device. I use Twitter tons more with it than I did with my cell phone or my Pronto and an email-to-Twitter bridge program. It's convenient. I love replying without typing the full username out. Sure, I can on the web, but not on-the-go, at least not without a smartphone I can't afford.It also gets much better battery life than Pronto, and far less glitches seem to happen. I love Pronto, but it has bugs (server and client side). TwitterPeek seems to get less. There is currently a bug where users on your Following and Followers list are repeating, but they're fixing this server side and it's the first I've seen since I got activated.Battery life is great, I get several days of use on a charge.You can only have one account on the device at a time, but I never saw a reason to have more than one Twitter account anyway.The biggest downside is this: the client-side software is firm, and we likely won't see updates more than once per quarter. This means the software is extensively tested, but it means we don't get the new features the minds behind something as dynamic as Twitter implement until much later. Examples include things as trivial as the rewording of "what are you doing?" to "what's happening" as well as things as exciting as officially-sanctioned API-based retweets. API retweets don't even show up, and there's no way to retweet from the device (except the old-style RT, which works great).
If you Tweet a lot and that is all you want to do then get one of these. My tweets with it were almost instant. Coverage area is great if you live in the city, pretty good everywhere else. Has a clean interface, a character count right on top and makes it super easy to tweet and re-tweet. Are there better devices, NOT if you JUST want to tweet. I would say if you want to do more like email, facebook, tweet etc. Then you can pick up a Peek Pronto and use several email to services apps with it. I will post about those in the Peek Pronto page. Overall it did exactly what it said it would. TWEET Oh and the screen and keyboard are fine for me. No problems. Who needs a high definition screen to tweet?? The only thing that kept this device from 5 stars was not making the new tweets received BOLD. If all you want to do is TWEET, then pick this up. Want to do more.. Check out a Peek Pronto.

I don't know if it's entirely pointless.  I don't want my kids to have a cellphone yet, and not just because of cost, though cost is a factor.  Texts don't leave a good record for parental monitoring.  Tweets might.  Plus $0/month is kind of attractive...
I am a current Peek customer and have had a regular Peek for a long time. About a week ago I got my TwitterPeek and I love it! TwitterPeek is the only device in thw World made just for Twitter. Here is what I like about the TwitterPeek Device:1) Made with quality and the keys and scroll wheel are easy to use.2) The battery life seems to be 4 to 5 days depending on the amount of use. Battery indicator lets you know when to charge the device. Fast battery charging!3) I have been everywhere and never lost my signal.4) Device can be set to vibrate and has several alert tones.5) Easy set-up; just turn it own and follow instructions on activation. Enter you Twitter info. and your Tweeting instantly!As far as Twitter use with device:1) Uploading followers and followed is as easy as a click of a button. Super fast download of new tweets.2) New tweets can be entered instantly.3) Send direct messages is just as easy as a new tweet.4) You can view your new tweets and view the links as well.5) You can Retweet and reply to TweetsMy Dislikes:Honestly I don't have any yet! I love the device; it's everything Twitter! Thanks Peek for selling such an amazing product. [...]
This device serves no purpose other than to fill up our landfills with electronic waste.Totally a one trick pony. Why would Peek make this ?The screen is too small and too low resolutionIt looks like a toy calculatorThe keyboard feels like a toy calculatorRequires too many clicks to do anythingSlow and unresponsiveTweets take a long time to show upI do not recommend it at all. Avoid !
..then you should shoot yourself because you are dumb. If you wanna spend $200 buy an Iphone. Twitter rocks, but it doesn't need a standalone $200 computer to use it.
I have had my Peek classic for a while now and use it everyday. For the price it does everything I need. I just heard about the TwitterPeek in todays NYTimes and decided to look it up. At first I was interested. Because the Peek already has unlimited E-mail and texting, adding in Twitter would only sweeten the pot, right? I was apparently wrong. This device only does twitter? WTF. Like I am going to carry around 2 Peeks. Not to mention Twitter is getting bigger and biggger, has no revenue and could disappear at anytime. Not to mention Peek is always bragging about how green they are, such as upgrading your Peek Classic to Peek Pronto for free (eliminating the waste other comments were complaining about) and even including a case with it made from recycled plastic. If they want to keep expanding, they better come up with an all-in-one device.
I cannot believe that someone would waste their money on this single use device.Twitter may be useful to many people but in my opinion I think this is going too far. As for the device.. the product description from the manufacturer talks more about how useful Twitter is and how everyone uses it in their daily life. They make it sound like it's the greatest thing. However I do not waste my time using it. Finally when you scroll down the page and get to the Product Description... again it talks a lot about the use of Twitter and little about the device.People of America... the choice is yours. For $99.95 you can own one of the worlds first Twitter Mobile Device.

As a disclaimer, I do not own this equipment.  However, I don't need to own it to realize this is the most ridiculous object I've ever heard of.  An electronic device whose sole purpose is to access Twitter?!?
A person cannot have an environmental conscience and buy this single-use piece of gadgetry. We all have cellphones these days, and last I checked, they were pretty good for texting. This has got to be the dumbest product to come out this year.Hundreds of tons of electronic gadgets make their way through the waste-stream each year, we don't need more of this kind of stuff. If you love twitter so much that you need a special device to carry around with you along with your phone just for twittering...you need a life.
I find this phone to have all needed in a cell phone with a lot of ease in use!
What a scam!!!!, I purchase this phone because of the price of course but also because they were advertising with Amazon.com. The phone came with a BIg Ship that scractched my hand the metal is sticking out. No software to install, no media card no even the smallest available. My family has bought Blackberries from Amazon and they have got the media card, software , NO ME!!!!I very MAD about the whole experience..
I have this phone and just Love it for its small size yet designed with only three rows of letter keys,for easier texting for someone with large hands.It has wonderful reception for calling too!
Before you read this keep in mind i've never spent more than $30 for a phone before.I've had previous experience with both ATT go-phones and Virgin Mobile.  I bought this phone to finally replace my home phone line since the Boost service offers unlimited everything for $50.oo a month, which is a pretty awesome price for a pre-paid phone.The service:  L-o-v-e it!  I mean, the talking & texting is just like any other phone, nothing special, but I like not having to keep track of minutes or texts or kilobytes in my head when i'm trying to talk to someone or do something on my phone.  I stick to main roads and downtown areas mostly so I don't have many problems with dead zones, though as i watch the bars traveling around i can see how some people might.The phone:  Little disappointed for my first phone that i paid enough for so that i be concerned if the screen got scratched or it fell in the toilet.  Other than the camera, which is webcam quality at best, it seems to look, feel, and act like any other cheezy phone i've ever had.  The only difference is that its got a keyboard (which is a given positive for texters).  Oddly enough though (and it kind of annoys me), you know how most phones have an alarm clock and a calander built into the phone's software?  Well, with this phone, its a pre-installed java app.  On the up-side though, the speakerphone is rediculously loud, clear, and easy to acivate, to the point where i find myself using it for most of my calls.Side notes:  One main thing i bought this phone for was to replace my dial-up internet (netzero) because i had to shut off the phone line and the internet service in order to pay the $50 bucks a month for the boost service.  Well, this review is proof that its possible (and rather simple) to do that because i'm using the phone's internet from my computer right now to write this.  Just buy the cable off amazon.com for a buck (of course theres an eight dollar shipping charge), download MotoConnect from [...](freeware), and when the cable arrives you might have to reshape the plastic part around the connecter with a pocket knife so it will stop popping out of the phone, but it works.  Don't know what the exact speed is, but it loads webpages at a similar speed compared to 56k dialup and downloads files at about 2.5KBps.  The computer will recognize the phone as an "iDen" modem and you set up a new dialup connection with the phone number "S=#777".  The username and password don't matter and BAM! your online, no extra ISP (like aol or netzero) necessary.  Whats really cool is it connects in like 8 seconds.  This feature is also supposed to be possible without the cable if you have a bluetooth-enabled laptop or one of the little USB bluetooth adapters available at amazon for like 5 bucks with shipping.  I know one thing that your all probably going to be interested in is the GPS service from boost.  Well, sadly, it doesn't come with the $50 a month unlimited plan.  its another java app, that cost $2 a day or $10 a month to subscribe to.  However, the phone has a built-in software that will tell you your geo-graphic quadinates, just no map.All-in-all, i'd recommend the service, but the only thing that is going to make the phone worth its price is the keyboard & bluetooth compatability.  Whether or not its worth the extra 80 bucks is up to you.
Boost Mobile stinks compared to other services that is a fact.  The Clutch phone is not Motorola's best work.  Yet it is all to lower cell costs to the consumer.  For what you save it is well worth it.  Other companies charge way to much for their services, thus they can offer the fancy phones, yet you need to sign your rights away for 2 to 3 years.  I hope Boost will catch on so the other companies will have to drop their prices and contracts in fear of losing customers.  I would love to go back to AT&T;, they were the best, but $50.00 with them didn't get me much.  Unlike other services, cell phone costs should be getting cheaper as their networks are paid for.  All cell phones in my book should have a fee like Boost or like any land line phone company like Verizon.The Clutch offers web service, it works and you can get on-line and check mail, its not a G1 or 3 network but its online unlimited for 1 cost of $50.00 a month.  Texting is the same as rest, the keyboard feature is nice on this phone.  The only thing with the service is you get in dead zones, but its weird once your connected I have never had a dropped call with it, even going through a dead zone.  The phone is a little difficult to navigate and the manual doesn't really help, with time and use you learn all the features.  There are a lot of small features the phone does not have that you just expect it to.For the money you save it is well worth it.  No its not a great phone but it works and its cheap and you can cancel whenever you want, or pay as little a 10 a month.  I have one and I get by fine.  Use it for 6 months and it pays for itself.
i have had this phone for 2 weeks and it is terrible. battery life is short, no service alot of the time, keypad is small, i think i will go with att go phone a177 samsung phone signal is strong where boost is not and the phone is quadband not dual band
this phone is ok for the money it has one of the best speaker phones ever the service is better then cricket and i have not missed a call yet what do you expect for 50 a month for every thing gold  well you get silver and that is good enough for me
I needed a new phone so I updated to this pone. I should have stayed with my old phone. It drops calls and loses the signal all the time even if i am standing in the same spot.
It is an excellent product with excellent and better windows 6.5 beatiful color on it. The delivering quite awful. I had already paid over $30 for shipping and it was more than 10 days. So I do not have any idea about the standar shipping system, but be careful if you are looking for fast delivering time.I am an international worker and it fix almost any international sim cards without any problem on it. Windows 6.5 has almost the same aproach of 6.1 ver. but better respond and better features on it. In general an excellent product for the money that you spend on it.Four start for the quality and nice lookingawful shipping  for such a small box.
I had to get a new phone because my Samsung Innov8 was giving up the ghost- could barely hear the other person when I got calls. I'm pretty sure one friend no longer talks to me because he thinks I'm giving him the cold shoulder, when in fact I simply cant hear him and have to hang up!Now this Satio is a real humdinger. I got the red one, or "bordeaux", as they say in SE circles. It's damn sexy, stylish, and says quality. The sliding camera lens cover/switch is smooth, and reveals the lens with neighbouring flash, lights and range and focus sensors, making this mobile phone look more like a camera which happens to have excellent phone, sms and music player capabilities all wrapped in one. The fact that it is a 12.1 megapixel camera doesnt hurt either.The touchscreen useability is not bad. Some parts are a little confusing and I dont know why there sometimes seems to be doubling up on the number of steps required, such as smsing. Nevertheless, it's a great sexy phone slash camera and I have no regrets buying it. I've had it for 2 days and already taken 50 photos and 4 short vids- great quality stuff, especially considering they were all taken at night.I've especially fallen in love with the touch focus method of taking photos. You dont have to press the shutter button. Once you set it up on the "focus" option, all you do is touch the LCD screen and the camera will focus on that part of the photo. So you can touch the far upper right corner of the screen, for example, and it will focus there and take the pic immediately after. Amazing technology.Surprisingly for Sony Ericsson, it comes with a 8gb micro SD card, which is unexpected because SE generally doesnt like to give out things like memory cards for "free", and also because they're usually a stickler for their own Sony memory stick series of memory cards. Personally I'm glad, since it meant I could simply transfer my micro SD card from my Samsung to the Satio.Also surprisingly, it did not come with those earphones which have the soft rubber earplugs which block out noise around you, giving a clearer playback from the music player, which is, of course, good, being Sony. The earpiece has a colour coordiinated listen/disconnect button where the left and right wires meet, which is attractive, but doesnt make up for the cheaper earpieces. Since it doesnt come with a 3.5mm jack, you cant use your favourite headphones without buying an adaptor.Would I recommend this phone? Yes- at least try it out. I'm pretty sure you'll like it :)March 24th 2010.I'm updating to let readers know the Satio has software glitches. The ones I saw when I first got the Satio were, I believed, simply poor user friendliness design, such as getting to the screen to type a sms. It needs two presses too many to type and send.However, there is now a very serious problem with my Satio. The t9 function is almost non functional.For example, if I press the buttons to type "Hi how are you?", I get "gh how ard zou?"or if I try to type "I'll be around", I get "I.kl af armvo?"It's as if half the dictionary has disappeared.I has done updates of the software and it has made no difference.The only reason that could possibly account for it is the removal of the micro SD card without going through the menus to click...whatever you have to click. I only saw the message after I took out the card.I'll be taking it to the service centre when time permits and hopefully get it sorted out.
This is the best cellphone ever, The interface and the built is superb! I will not trade this for any other phone in this world. I recently got the samsung highlight and it is nothing compared to this monster. Back then Noka N95 was the macdaddy of all devices now the Satio is THE macdaddy of all. I'm always gonna stick with Nokia and Sony phones. Samsung is there but not all that in my perspective. If you want attractive well rounded cellphones check out Nokia and Sony! No regrets!
I know what you're thinking... "that is A LOT of money". This is true. But if you want a REAL digital camera, phone, organizer, and music player all in one, this phone is IT. I don't want to go into all the features because some are listed above, and all are listed on the official Sony Ericcson website. But as the first person on Amazon to give this phone a review, I have to honestly say this is the best phone in the world right now... PERIOD. Not only will you be the envy of your peers & friends, but this phone is actually fun in all aspects. (One suggestion: purchase a car charger... especially if you keep Bluetooth on all the time.)
I was a bit skeptical about this phone because of the price but in the end I didn't regret it one bit!!!! The phone is excellent and the performance, camera and overall interface is superb! I'm so happy I chose this over the pixon 12. I cannot think about something bad to say about it.
The item is good... but the Interface is not as friendly as in the iPhone.... I will sell this to buy an iPhone...It is true, have a great camera but the data transfer is easier and faster with the iPhone...Also to get it sync (specially with mac) it is quite a nightmare...I go back to my iPhone
I've now come to the conclusion that everybody who wrote reviews on the phone spent about five minutes with the device. Part of me doesn't blame them. If I reviewed electronics for a living, I wouldn't want to spend several days really testing the phone. However, with a cell phone as radically different as the Storm, it is unfair to make these judgments on the keyboard, etc. in haste.Simply put, the phone is very good. It isn't as breathtaking as I wanted it to be, however it is not nearly as disappointing as many critics want you to think (**cough** New York Times, excuse me). The keyboard is getting easier and easier to use as time goes by. If RIM put a tracker ball at the bottom of the phone where it is on all the other units, then this would in fact be, an iPhone killer. When I look at the phone, there is definitely room for that magical RIM trackball...(can you say Storm2?)Starting from the top. The phone feels solidly built. It has a good weight to it and feels durable. My only fear is that my propensity for dropping phones will be disastrous for the glass click screen. I'm having bad thoughts about not being able to do anything with the phone because the click activator ceases to work or I'll scratch up that beautiful screen. Three times in the last seven years or so I've had the misfortune of waking up from a night of drinking only to find giant cracks on the LCDs of my phones (can you say insurance? iPhone people can't, and that alone will FOREVER stop me from getting one). Seriously though, I really hope this thing is bomb proof. I have a silicon condom on it, which better keep it safe at night.I was perplexed when I powered it on for the first time. The phone takes several minutes to reboot. This is a laptop, not a phone, right? Thankfully I only have to reset the phone every so often... Pretty is a good word to describe the design and graphics overall.The click screen is a trip. It is definitely takes adjustment, but I really dig it. It definitely limits the speed of your typing because you must remain in line with the speed of "The Cadence of the Clicker" (this is the name of my next album). I say that because when you are really going at it, it can create a steady beat like a metronome. This just feels like one of the drawbacks to writing novels on any mobile device. All keyboards have a handicap, but I sincerely miss being able to press to multiple buttons at the almost exact time (as we are accustomed to on a computer keyboard). This system causes you to be a little more accurate because you can't barrel through your letters, so it may be a bonus after all. I also like the SureType keyboard in portrait mode. It uses the predictive text heavily, and it is a great fast type option with one thumb. This mode suffers most from the click limiter because the surface area is far too tight for dual finger typing as tempting as it is.One of my friends voiced his displeasure with the auto correct function on the text. I find it useful. Just remember if it auto corrects something and you don't like it, immediately hit the DELETE button, and it will revert to your perverted word or innocent typo. His changed the word "f*&^ing" into "ducking." The best way around this is to add these words that you use when frustrated or talking dirty to your lover into the Dictionary. To do so, go to the HOME screen, then choose: OPTIONS-CUSTOM DICTIONARY. Now hit the BlackBerry button and select NEW.I've also heard that the VZNavigator and Visual Voicemail programs should be removed to speed up the performance of the phone. After all, who is going to pay $10 and $3/month for such frivolous features? What I was jazzed to see is that Google Maps' triangulation feature was not disabled here as it was on my i760 and Treo. This means that it will show your approximate location on the map for free. It is a nice feature to get you partially orientated at no cost (just keep in mind it is using cell towers to locate you, so you must have service for it to work, which is not the case with true GPS/VZNav).The media player is good. It is not an iPod, but it has a great search feature, and is intuitively laid out. The resolution on the screen is better than the iPhone and video looks GREAT. The included headphones sound great and the speakerphone gets extremely loud, however it is very tinny sounding and has an over modulated feel when at high volumes.The icing on the cake is that I am not utilizing the BlackBerry Corporate server, therefore, I do not have to pay for BlackBerry data access. I am now paying only $29.99 for data where I was paying $44.99 on my Samsung for the exact same unlimited data/email service. With this savings, my Storm will pay for itself in 14 months of service!The device lock is good. You can either hit the button on the top left of the phone, or you can use the "Lock" button in your home menu. I'm peeved at how the Mute/un-Mute button still functions while the device is locked. I've had the phone suddenly start playing "Rise Against" over the speakerphone (which can get pretty damn loud) at times that I wished it hadn't. I understand that it is to let you control your music without unlocking the device, however I always saw locking as the way to prevent your phone from doing strange things in the privacy of your pocket/holster without your permission. FIX: just lower your media playback volume all the way to silent.The ringer alerts are one of the best features on the phone. I can't be happier in this department. This puts every phone I've ever seen to shame (I don't know if all BBs do this, this is my first). You can select from a plethora of options including: Normal, Loud, Medium, Vibrate Only, Silent, All Alerts Off, and my personal favorite Phone Calls Only (all with the touch of a button). I'm used to an all or nothing world, or having to go into individual menus and make these decisions (time consuming/annoying? Yes). Furthermore, the alarm will sound in any mode other than All Alerts Off.Where the Storm crushes the iPhone is in the folder organization possibilities on the home page. Where the iPhone only allows you to move your applications around, the Storm lets you create folders to keep everything organized as if it were a computer desktop. I absolutely love this ability because I'm very big at keeping things `tidy.'I'm also a fan of how the screen fades down instead of cutting out when it is time to turn off. This is great because it reminds you that you have to do something to the device if you don't want the image to go away completely.Some tips:To get IMAP to work with GMAIL, follow the instructions here: [...]Don't waste your time like I did, just go directly to this website as per the forums instructions: [...]I was concerned that there was a charge to using this service (because I'm not utilizing Verizon's BlackBerry email service), but there isn't.To copy and paste, you simply hold down one finger where you want to start, and then drag along with another to where you want it to end.When entering text, if you spell something so terribly wrong that its suggestions aren't helpful, then the best thing to do is just delete the entire word. This is frustrating. It doesn't allow you to fix your mistake because when you click on a part of the word it makes you chose from the suggested list. I wish there were a way around this. Nevertheless, if you just give up, then you can move on without losing any more hair.I can't properly sync my phone with my Mac given the software they include and the USB cable. However, thanks to Google's amazing Sync application, I do all of my syncing wirelessly as often as I wish. YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THIS PROGRAM!
May 4, 2010 I have a love-hate relationship with my Verizon Blackberry Storm 1.In April 2010, I bought and returned an iPhone from AT&T; and a Sprint Google Android phone from Samsung.  I also tried out the BlackBerry Storm 2.  My story unfolds...When the antenna on my BB Storm 1 stopped working, my first instinct was to get the Storm 2 from Verizon as a replacement.  I checked it out and I was unimpressed.  Not much new there, except that it is now Wi-Fi capable.  Now, you would think that Verizon Wireless would set up a simple wireless router at their showrooms to show just how fast their phones are, but Verizon is not that smart.  Anyway, the Storm 2 is just as pathetic as the Storm 1 when it comes to internet browsing over the network.  It's so bad that the Attorneys General of the US should sue them for false advertising.  Verizon calls it high-speed internet, but it truly is the speed of dial-up.  Remember dial-up?  56K?  It takes 30 to 90 seconds to load an average web page.  At least it does in the Providence area.  And around here, the phone coverage sucks too.  At times, I have 5 bars, sometimes I have 3, sometimes no signal at all, and that's all without leaving my house.I decided to try the iPhone 3Gs and go over to the Dark Side.  I LOVED IT!  The browser is phenomenal and FAST!  Almost as fast as my home computer, whether I was using Wi-Fi or in the car.  The phone is much easier to use than the BlackBerry.  The signal was ALWAYS 5 bars... EVERYWHERE, even in the hills of Connecticut where my wife's old Verizon phone had maybe 1 bar.  Worked great in San Francisco too.  But this story does not have a happy ending.  The iPhone went back 29 days later.Although everything about the iPhone gets an A or A+, its calendar reminder system gets a big fat F!  I almost missed a class, and I was teaching the class!!  The iPhone only tells you about an appointment once.  Then you're on your own.  I need to be reminded 5 hours out, 2 hours out, 30 minutes out and then every 5 minutes after that, until I say "Dismissed".  I looked into fixes and other possibilities.  I called AT&T; and Apple support and went to the AT&T; and Apple stores.  Everyone looked at me as if to say "Dude, this is the best phone in the world, your A.D.D. is not the iPhone's problem."  One woman told me to set multiple appointments so I would be reminded adequately.  My reply was "You want me to clutter my calendar because the iPhone does a terrible job of reminding me of stuff I have to do?"  And every person I asked said "Well, I'm sure there's an app for that."  The cop-out mantra of iPhone support "There's an app for that."  No, there isn't!  Well, not unless you call getting sent emails and text messages or an entirely separate reminder app a good solution.  Beyond frustrated, I Googled and started reading the forums.  I learned that Apple did not open the SDK (the iPhone's architecture) for 3rd party developers.  No adequate fix exists for this problem, and apparently it's not even on Apple's radar.  In May 2010, they are releasing a major upgrade to the software and snoozing is not part of it.  Below I complain that the BlackBerry's task and appointment reminders can only snooze a set amount of time.  Oh ma Gah!  This is heaven compared to the iPhone.My other gripe about the iPhone was that it can only do one thing at a time... literally.  It's not multi-tasking.  If you are listening to Slacker Radio and you get a call or you go to a web page, the iPhone closes the application.  When you go back, you start over.  The upside is you don't have the nasty memory problems that the Storm used to have, but this was Apple's best idea???  Wow, big brain trust there.iPhone doesn't have a flash for the camera.  If you know anything about photography, you know the more light the better.  Pictures without a flash indoors will be dark and/or grainy, even if you edit them after the fact.Typing on the iPhone was okay, but merely okay.I have heard that AT&T; phone and data coverage is bad in major cities.  A lot of young people live in big cities and they all have iPhones, thus the systems are overloaded.So, to summarize, if you want to be entertained, take photos in broad daylight, and use social media all day long, get an iPhone.  If you have actual responsibilities or have A.D.D like me, and you need a true PDA (personal digital assistant), stick with a BlackBerry... any BlackBerry.  The iPhone grew out of the iPod -- an entertainment device -- and then they added a phone.  BlackBerries started out as business devices and have added entertainment for those rare occasions that business people don't have something else they should be doing.  God, I sound old!Oh, by the way, when people at AT&T; say "try the iPhone free for 30 days", they don't mean it.  I had to pay a $35 restocking fee AND I had to pay for almost 30 days of phone service.  The 2-year contract did not kick in though.Onto the Android.  I tried the Samsung Moment.  Its reminder feature was weak.  I mean that literally.  I didn't hear it.  And a bumble bee 10 feet away vibrates my pocket more that that phone.  And the Android cannot snooze a task or appointment either, but you can set multiple (I don't know how many) reminders in the calendar appointment, not that you'll hear or feel any of them when they go off.Oh, and you need to have Google Mail and Calendar to even try the calendar.  If I could have checked out reminders in the store, I would have known right away that the Android was not for me.  Regular Yahoo Mail accounts do not work with Android at this time.  I didn't even try my work email.The phone functionality of the Android was slow and not well thought out (long story short).  Google needs to fix that immediately.Typing on the Samsung Moment was okay, but merely okay.  I may have gotten used to its slide-out keyboard, but I didn't keep it that long.Sprint's network speed was half of what AT&T;'s is in Providence and San Francisco.  (I live in RI and traveled to San Fran while I had the phone.)  Luckily, Sprint's policy is now not to charge a dime if you bring it back within 30 days, but they would not take back the overpriced $40 phone protector.To wrap up this comparison of the 4 phones, I don't think the BlackBerry Storm 1 is perfect, but it still does most of the things I need it to do and it does those things well enough.  Oh, by some stroke of luck, my phone started working again 6 weeks later, so I'm sticking with the Storm 1 for now.  If someone knows of a good phone/PDA/push email device that works better, please email me!There's more details about the BlackBerry Storm 1 below.----------------------------A January 2010 update to the updates below.#4 Desktop Manager 5.0.1.28 works well with Outlook 2007 on Windows 7.In January 2010, I bought a new computer with Windows 7.  I got a great deal on Microsoft Office 2007, so I installed the new Office.  Well, that combination didn't work so well with my ol' reliable BlackBerry Desktop Manager 4.2.2.14.  I decided to upgrade to the latest version of BlackBerry Desktop Manager (something I said I would never do).  It all works very well together.  I was previously running Windows XP and Office 2000.----------------------------This is a Dec 2009 update to my April 2009 review of the Storm 1 (this is not a review of the Storm 2).  The numbers refer to my April 2009 criticisms (below the dotted line).summary: much better since 5.0 operating system released in Oct 2009#1 The Storm 1 was greatly improved when BlackBerry released the 5.0 operating system.  Now I'd have to give the Storm 4 out of 5 stars.#1B Those sub-second connections to internet pages that they show in the commercials... are still a big fat lie!  To call the connection "broadband" is a complete deception perpetrated by Verizon.  This is approximately dialup speed minus the wheezing and hissing of a modem.  That said, I absolutely love that I can connect to the internet almost anytime/anyplace.#2 To mitigate the fat-fingering problems I was having with the full QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode, I have been using the SureType keyboard in portrait mode.  It's a QWERTY keyboard in 3 rows x 5 columns.  What makes it quick and effective is that the Storm starts suggesting words to select after typing in a few letters of the word.  I can single-thumb or double-thumb most everything now.  To change the keyboard default to SureType, in the options (the wrench icon), choose Screen/Keyboard, then change the Portrait View Keyboard to SureType.#3 hasn't changed.  In April, I forgot to mention that in order to get turn by turn spoken directions, you have to pay Verizon a $10 ransom per month or buy software from Garmin for $100.  You can use BlackBerry Maps or Google Maps for free, but it doesn't talk to you.#4 Synchronization works well with Desktop Manager 4.2.2.14 (released April 26, 2007).  It doesn't have the niceties that the current release has, but it actually works, unlike more recent releases.  On several occasions, I spent an entire DAY upgrading to "the latest and greatest" only to have to uninstall it and then install 4.2 again.  This happened more than once on the advice of Verizon technicians who don't know nearly as much as the RIM techs.  I will be using Desktop Manager 4.2 until the day this phone dies.  Fool me once, shame on Verizon.  Fool me twice (and then a third time), shame on me.  There will be no fourth time.#5 phrase selection has been vastly improved, but still isn't great.  It would be really helpful if double-clicking would highlight a word.  And apparently BlackBerry is completely unfamiliar with the concept of "undo".  If you delete some text, well that's just too bad.  You can "discard" all the changes you've made since last saving or you can retype what you just blasted, if you can remember what it was.#6 I hope BlackBerry changed the location of the micro-SD card for the Storm 2, because its placement on the Storm 1 was just plain stupid.  You remember that board game "Operation" by Milton Bradley?  It's like that.  "Take out memory card."  Bzzzzz!#7 still a problem but they've made a half-hearted attempt of making the number pad easier to get to.  If they made the number pad smaller and put the function buttons all in one smaller row, that way everything is available on one screen, it would be truly appreciated.#8 there's only one pre-set choice for a "snooze".  Honestly RIM, this is inexcusable.  Do something about this!#9 Actually voice recognition for contacts is quite easy to use.  The button on the left of the phone is set up to do this as a default.  Speak the name and choose from a few possibilities.#10 The "can you hear me now?" geek from Verizon still has not been to my house to improve coverage at my place of residence.  I am moving soon and if the coverage sucks at that house too, I will be shelling over another $250 to Verizon to fill in the gap in their network.  Hey Verizon, can you hear this?  [I'm making a gesture.]  But in Verizon's (or "VZ" to be cool because apparently teenagers can't spell anything these days, nor be bothered to call something by its given name if it is greater than 3 letters long)... [Where was I?  Oh, yeah.]  In Verizon's defense, their network beats AT&T;'s coverage hands down;  people who have the i-Phone constantly complain that they can't make calls and calls are dropped.One more thing, I've discovered that the Storm makes a very handy flashlight.  No, I'm not joking.  If you open the Video Camera application, the LED light (the flash) on the back of the phone comes on and stays on.  It is bright!In summary, if the devil is in the details, this device is now a little mischievous.  Theoretically, this is still the best phone available, except perhaps for the Storm 2 (which I assume is better than Storm 1).  I no longer wish I still had that old, big, clunky, reliable and easy-to-use, brick-sized HP IPAQ.-------- original review from April 2009 -----------------------------If this phone worked the way it was supposed to, there would be no reason to even consider any other phone.  It has everything:  phone, PDA, 3G web browser, multi-media player, sleek look, a 16GB expansion card (comes with an 8GB card), 3.2 mega-pixel camera WITH A FLASH, voice dialing, a big hi-res screen, email that gets pushed to your Storm, so you don't have to log on to check your mail!!Then why am I already wishing I had returned it during the grace period?  I had an HP IPAQ H6315 for 4 years which was way better than this, but it didn't have all the bells and whistles, so I got the Storm.#1 it's painfully slow.  Those sub-second connections to internet pages that they show in the commercials... in your dreams!!  Even opening and closing applications makes me want to slap it upside the head to get its attention.#2 the on-screen QWERTY keypad is difficult to use for anyone with adult-size thumbs.  I am constantly fat-fingering letters.#3 Although it does have a GPS antenna built into it, it relies on the data network to show you the map and give you directions.  No reception, no map.  Again, it's painfully slow.#4 Synchronization has been a problem since I got the phone 8 weeks ago. I wrote many, many notes to myself over the weekend while at a conference.  This morning when I synchronized with my pc, they all disappeared.#5 Editing on the Storm is nearly impossible.  I still haven't figured out how to highlight words (double-click doesn't work, nor does click and drag)#6 In all their wisdom, Blackberry made the micro-SD nearly inaccessible.  Most devices that use cards have them on the side, so you can swap them in and out without a big fuss.  Oh no, not Blackberry, they put it deep inside this device.  Brilliant.#7 When you talk on the phone, your cheak will press buttons.  RIM also thought it would be a good idea to hide the number pad after the call connects.  Who wants to use the number pad during a call anyway??#8 When you get a reminder, there's only one pre-set choice for a "snooze".  If you want it to remind you an hour from now, sorry, you'll have to open the calendar item or task.  It will take you about 40 seconds to do so because of #1 and #2.#9 Forget about scrolling through your contacts or tasks.  That would take you forever.  You have to know what you're looking for and type in a few letters.  Now see #2.  Although in its defense, it does have voice recognition for contacts.  Of course I haven't had time to set this up yet (see #4).#10 And that "can you hear me now?" geek from Verizon has apparently never been to my house.  Although Verizon does have a device that essentially creates a mini cell tower in your house and then connects to Verizon through your hi-speed modem... for $250!!In summary, if the devil is in the details, this device must be evil.  From a detailed analysis of everything out there, this was the best phone available, because HP still had not put out a similar product.  I wish I had that old, big, clunky, reliable and easy-to-use, brick-sized IPAQ back.  When HP does put out an IPAQ with these features, I will absolutely buy it.(I bought this phone from Verizon, not from Amazon.)
I ordered Blackberry storm , it was shipped by OEM.The screen is very very bad. It is very lose and always shakes. looks like sumone has tampered it .the item which i received is very bad condition..dont ever order frm this site
All in all I am VERY satisfied with this phone!  I have not found it to be slow at all.  In fact in a side by side test, it loads web pages and apps much faster than my daughters iPhone.  Also, I have not had any of the syncing issues described in other reviews (although I'm using a PC, not an Apple).Some have said they don't care for the clickable screen.  I REALLY like it!  Although my fingers aren't huge they arn't tiny either and the QWERTY keyboard works for me just fine (although I'd definitly recommend landscape mode when typing).  I have noticed that the more you use the typing feature the more you get a "feel" for typing on the virtual keyboard.My only issue with this phone was getting a well built unit.  The first phone I bought had some kind of contaminant under the glass of the screen.  Phone#2 had a bad mic, Phone#3 had a problem "clicking" on one edge of the screen.  I'm on phone#4 currently and I think this one is a winner (knock wood).  I will say that Verizon switched out the phone each time, no questions asked and sincerely wanted me to be happy with my purchase.Minor complaints (not strong enough to deduct a Star):1. Music data (album name, artist, etc...) should be editable on the device, instead of just on windows before you transfer the song over.2. The data displayed while a song is playing does not appear to be configurable.3. Hoping for a 32gb SD card option although 16mb is probably fine.4. Agree with the previous review re:placement of the sd card.  It would have made more sense to put it on the outside somewhere to make it easier to swap out.Overall, I would highly recommend this phone and would advise that one just be picky to make sure your phone doesn't have any functional issues.Don
A wonderful piece of gear. Takes some getting used to; like a Rubik's cube, some will get it - some won't. A new discovery every day until you figure out all the capabilities. Much faster than Ifone, much better video - not gray and dim, but vibrant. Problems mentioned by other users, if any are easily overcome with practice. Be sure to exit out of applications and web browsing not in use, so as not to tax memory and processing power in background while doing something else. Always clean your browser and memory when done, or between aps and ops, (just a couple of button presses), again so things don't run unnecessarily in background unbeknownsed to you. Great speed. Great coverage. Great videos. Qualities and capabilities beyond Ifone, like stereo and voice navigation. Requires a little practive and familiarization, like a Rubik's cube. Finally, much better packages with Verizon Wireless, and better rebate and initial outlay. Go with the proven product, Blackberry. Many federal and military agencies and orgs use them regularly. Don't cheat yourself on screen space by opting for one with a hard keyboard. The touchscreen offers much more space, is adjustable in the setup and options areas, and is fun once mastered.
As of 5/22/09 this phone still has lot of glitches that are suppose to be fixed in a software update that was to come out months ago--which keeps getting pushed back.  The only reason I kept this phone rather than returning it for another is that I use verizon and can not get the I Phone.This phone has a screen that you first touch and then press to activate what you are touching.  I personally like that better than the I phone because I can be sure I am touching what I mean to be and then making the execution.  I also like the feel of pressing the keyboard down--especially when typing.  Some people prefer the I phone because it is faster.  One of the problems is that when you place a call and put the phone up to your cheek, you can easily press the screen changing it to speaker or mute or some unknown thing that takes awhile to reset before you can hear the call.  You can fix this by purchasing an application that locks the screen.  The storms lock feature will not lock the screen during a call so you have to purchase this after market application.  Another thing is that the keyboard is hidden when you place a call so if you need to put in your password/numbers you need to look at the phone, select the keyboard and it shows up.  It just isn't convenient or intuitive.Another extremely odd thing is that the phone turns off the signal all by itself, randomly.  If you don't look at the phone, you may not realize the signal is turned off (therefore you can't receive calls, emails, etc).  A software update is promised to fix this at some unknown time.  We purchased two Storms and both do this--a common problem according to verizon.  One of the phones does this about 1 time per day.  They other did it several times per day.  Verizon changed that storm out for a replacement storm.  So now, both phones turn themselves off only about 1 time per day.Software is glitchy when it comes to notifications.  You can turn all sound off or turn it off for each individual thing.  If you turn it off for each individual thing, sometimes it decides to make sound anyway.  According to verizon, there is no fix for this--other than a hard reboot that erases everything but doesn't guarantee a fix--and in fact, has never fixed ours.  So, if we don't want the phone to randomly decide to make noise, we have to turn all sound off.  Of course that includes the phone ring along with all the data rings.This phone is painfully slow, although I can not compare it to other blackberry's as I have not had one before.  I could not do real work on it.  Luckily, I am not a business user so there isn't anything that I can't put off until I can get to a computer.  I have tried looking at and editing word documents but have never had the patience to deal with it after waiting and waiting and waiting for them to load.  Likewise, using internet is painful.A plus to blackberry is that you can use blackberry messenger to IM any other blackberry user that you are connected to (free connection--you just both have to agree to it).  This saves money on texting because you don't have to add that feature or you can get a smaller texting package.  We use blackberry IM all the time and love it.I sync up my blackberry to my mac computer--when it agrees to do it.  Again, this seems like a random thing, although it works about 90% of the time.  There could be lots of improvements in this sync, however, I can sync my phonebook (without categories), calendar, and itunes.  I tunes is not as user friendly on this as the I Phone, however, if it isn't the main reason you have the phone, it is tolerable.  If you want to search songs and change playlists or get creative though, you won't want to do it on this phone.  The speakers on the phone have a very "tinny" sound if you try to play music through them.  It is annoying to me but I didn't buy the phone for good speakers so it isn't a big deal.The camera on the phone is fairly decent and has a flash.  Sometimes the flash washes out things too much--but again, I didn't buy this phone for the camera so it is fine for me.  Most of the pictures sync with i photo without a problem, although sometimes it says that they aren't recognizable.I love that it has a removable memory card.  It comes with 8 g but can be upgraded to 16.  Nice to only have to change a memory card rather than buying a whole new phone just to get more memory.There are not nearly as many apps for this as there are for I Phone and very few of them are free.  This may be fine for business users but it is frustrating for me.I love the look of the phone and the pre-loaded ring tones.  I also like the flexibility to move icons and put them in folders and customize the phone.This phone gets emails automatically and that is great.  No having to log in and check emails.The voice activated dialing works about 50% of the time without training.  I find myself not using this feature although there may be ways to customize it and make it work better.When the I phone comes to verizon I will replace this in a heartbeat.  Until then, I feel like this is better than nothing.  Although based on some reviews, I may be wrong--other blackberries may be better.  I am especially disappointed with how buggy this phone is and the promises of software fixes that never seem to come.  And this phone has been on the market for awhile.This is a buyer beware phone for sure.  It also falls into the category of "settling" until there is something better.UPDATE 7/26/09:  a new software update has fixed most, but not all of the problems.  The biggest problem that remains is that you can accidently click the phone while on a call which results in muting or other problems.  POCKMAC for syncing with mac remains an issue but RiM is suppose to come out with their own software in sept. and that may fix the problems.  If running facebook on your blackberry, you are more likely to encounter problems with the sync.  If you do, on your blackberry, go into options, advanced options, service book, and then delete facebook with the cical next to it and that should fix it.  However, sometimes you do have to go back and repeat the process.  I also noticed that on my new unibody macbook pro there are less issues with syncing than on my old macbook pro.  not sure why as it runs the same ox software.  but i am happy that it is finally syncing.  i do sync my itunes with my blackberry as well using pocketmac.on advantage to the blackberry over the iphone is that on the blackberry you can run multiple things at once.  so you could have your maps running directions, make a phone call, and return to maps without having to start over.  on the iphone you can't do that-at least that is what the apple store people told me.because of the improvements to the blackberry with the software upgrade, the fact that i can use it with verizon, and now pocketmac is working, i would choose the blackberry over the iphone if i had to do it over again.  if iphone comes to verizon, then i will have to make a decision.  if it still has the water vapor issue voiding the warranty, however, i will probably stay away from iphone until that is fixed.  (in case you aren't aware, the iphone can stop working just from being exposed to humidity and sweat and it is not covered under apple warranty--it is causing a lot of problems for people as of this date).UPDATE 7/27/09:  for some blackberrys, the software upgrade eventually crashes the system.  We own two blackberries, it did this to one of them.  tech support at verizon said that it needed to be replaced or it would keep crashing.  the person at tech support said that happened to hers and when she got the replacement she hasn't had a problem.  we are choosing to wait one more time to see if it crashes again (has done so twice in 1 week and you have to reboot the entire system, erasing everything on it).  verizon does replace the phone with a refurbushed one for free within the first year.  before you purchase one of these, check the replacement policy that your carrier has.
While the Blackberry Storm looks great with its bright touchscreen and "world" phone features, it is a horrible smart phone with a steep learning curve.  The touchscreen "buttons" are extremely hard to use.  You have to touch them sort of off center or you will hit an unintended button and maybe be in a window you don't want.  It can take you a long time to get out of the window you don't want.  The Storm is very, very slow.  Almost immediately, one of my "destop" icons (for one of my email accounts) disappeared.  While theoretically you can sync the Storm with Microsoft Outlook, this is extremely complicated and something I never have figured out. The Internet is full of posts from people offering tips on how you might accomplish the sync.  Needless to say, I'm returning the Storm for something with physical buttons which will actually do what I want as opposed to eat up my time unnecessarily.
I see a lot of negative responses, and I just think they didn't give the phone a fair shake.  The storm is not very intuitive, meaning it doesn't function like most phones.  I had a hard time getting used to it, but once I did nothing could stop me!! It is the best phone I have ever had.I have had it move slow from time to time, but I have found this is user error.  When it is taking a while to load a page I can look at what apps I have open and ALWAYS it is my fault for not closing other apps I was using.  Side by side with my friends iPhone my storm loads pages quicker.It syncs great with google!  I love how it got all my contacts from gmail and syncs automatically in both directions with google calendar.Music is amazing, I can transfer from my iTunes, don't even use my iPod anymore, I don't need it.  You can also use your own music as ring tones if you like.  No more purchasing ring tones.I also don't understand the complaints with the keyboard, although the keys are small, it will automatically correct misspelled words.  Maybe they have this feature turned off.It is an amazing phone, but since it is so different it takes some getting used to.  Once you learn where everything is and how to maneuver around its great!
Unfortunately I didn't receive this phone until after 30 days. It sat at the office as a replacement and I didn't get it for a month or more. I tried to return it after a couple weeks with no luck.  They refused to trade it out for anything else. I'm going in next week (8 months later) to either trade it out or take our companies phone business elsewhere.  I think they may see it more my way this time. It is a pain in the ______. You drop calls quite regularly - more so than the world edition I had for several years. The keypad will drive you crazy unless your fingers are the size of a pencil eraser. The reception is poor - you often get digitilized conversations that you can't understand. The visual voice mail doesn't down load the messages so you often don't get your messages until you go to the message center and request it to download.  In addition, people have told me they haven't been able to leave messages. The icon pad has a mind of it's own - sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Camera - very slow - it better be a still object.The best feature is the large screen - that makes emails easy to read. That may be about it - the size is good too. Do yourself a favor - don't get this phone until they have all the above worked out.
This smart phone is pretty dumb.  The chief complaint I have is that it is constantly freezing up.  Just when you need it to function most, guess what?  It doesn't.  I cant tell you how many videos I shot that are corrupted, or photos that just froze the whole phone up.  Dont get me started on the internet, because that is a crap shoot.  You may just lock up that sucker by trying to load a simple text page.  The only solution in most cases?  Pull the battery out and let it reload.  Sit there for the amount of time it takes to reload and then go about your business until the next freeze.The phone works fine, but you will have to download an app to lock the screen so your face doesnt touch the buttons and hang up on your friend.And let me tell you, the simplest feature that should work perfectly is the clock right?  WRONG!  you have to go into settings periodically and hit "UPDATE TIME" so you arent late or early.  Come on!!!!!!!!!!!  Cant wait til my contract expires, Im done with this turd.
I made the mistake of buying this phone. It crashes constantly. My service provider's answer - pull the battery for a hard shut down. I have to do this at least once or twice a month. My Blackberry rep tells me this is normal and even assured me that it was actually good for it. Other than that, it is slow to wake from lock mode. The latest issue with my phone is that it no longer recognizes the internet browser. So, my service provider is now at least willing to give me a replacement phone. Unfortunately, it is another Storm. I am stuck with this dog for another year and a half.
We've had two of these for about six months now and they've really been nothing but a disappointment.  Verizon has the best coverage in our area by far so this was the latest and greatest by Verizon at the time.  They've just never really worked reliably/consistently for any length of time.  Even the updates haven't brought these phones to where they should be as far as reliability.  When they work, it's a great piece of technology.  But I constantly see my wife and daughter struggling to get basic functionality to work at a reasonable pace.  They shut it down, they battery reboot, they upgraded-sometimes it works for a day for so and then it starts again.
aight phone was really beginning to enjoy it,that is until it fell from my sofa's armchair.Then screen blanked out didnt last me a week.was sent back to RIM to fix.If i get a new one,I'm throwing up the "for sale" right away.Not for the guy always on the move.Unlike tyler perry's movie,it's too easily broken
This phone is alright. At first I was really excited about it and then it started to get a little irritating. I've had it since a month or two after it came out.Pros:1. The calls come in clear. I've had problems before with other phones and the volume of the calls.2. The hold button works. No dialing random people in my purse.3. I really like having both of my email accounts on my phone. It updates pretty quickly and I like being able to delete emails from my phone and from my account.4. The pictures come out pretty great. I was actually surprised by it.5. The voice recognition is awesome. I tried it using my name (which is kind of difficult) and it picked it up on the first try. I also tried some names with silent letters and it also worked.Cons:1. When it freezes, you have to take the entire battery out. When the phone boots back up it takes forever.2. Sometimes it's not that responsive. I've had calls come in but it wouldn't let me answer them. (this has only happened twice)3. For some reason, new programs keep getting added to my button list. I don't like that. Right now, this bing application and Vcast videos have added themselves to my button list. I know you can hide them, but I shouldn't have to hide them4. The manual is crappy!5. I haven't been able to figure out how to add ringtones to my phone. There seems to be some key fetaures missing from my menus. The manual says that I should be able to see this and that but they aren't there. It should be easier to do this.6. I don't like that the number pad disappears when you are in a call. You can bring it back up, but I just wish it didn't disappear.7. I wish there were more useful applications on it.This phone could have been better. It has pretty much all the features I wanted but it's still lacking. I don't think I would really reccommend this version of this phone.
The phone delivered is 9530 model instead of 9500. The cell phone came without the MicroSD and the AC adapters.
After owning this phone for two weeks, and having it replaced once in that time, I took it back and exchanged it for the Tour.  In theory, the touch screen is nice, but it's hard to type on and it doesn't seem sturdy enough to last the two years until I can upgrade again.  Sometimes I had to press five or six times to make a selection.  The Tour is like the Storm but without the touch screen, and I'm totally in love with it.
Everything bad about the storm, it's pointless to discuss here cause it is completly true. The other thing is I bought an storm about 3 months ago, and now suddently the screen goes black, and BU.. I'm dealing with the vendor to repair it using my warranty.I think there is nothing more to say. I hope that RIM will do a very good testing of the products they put in the market.Thanks.Thanks.
many people were not happy with their BB storm however, with the recent updates its performance became great. But still if you are getting lots of mails and it is not nesseary for you to respond them, you are not BB guy thus, buy something else.
I always check the reviews of a product before buying it. When I first saw the reviews of the BB storm I was very disappointed. But even with such low rating I was convinced with some of the higher rated reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this phone. When I finally got it let me tell you, I was disappointed with its performance and how difficult it was to text (so in my head I was feeling as I should have followed my habit of always buying a product taking account of it's reviews). So I decided to investigate a little more about this problem and found out that you could fix almost every problem with the phone by just upgrading the OS. Let me tell you the difference is amazing. Its now really easy to text, apps work smoothly, and let me tell you.... it has become an iphone killer. The quality of audio and video (resolution) is so much better. The 3g Internet is much faster than the iphone.. So in conclusion if there are any bad reviews about this phone it was because the engineers over at rim, had not yet deciphered the right software for this phone, now that you can download the latest OS I think it'll start to get much higher opinions. It really is a great phone.
The more I use this phone the more I love it. It is a great phone with great functionality. I have owned many different cell phones in the last 10 years and this is only the second phone I have ever been happy with.
This the worst phone I have ever had.  I upgraded from the Blackberry Curve and wish I hadn't done so.  The phone is so slow it is annoying.  This is my short and simple review.
The good:- it's pretty- great innovative ideas my favorite one being visual voicemail where u get to pick what vm u want to listen to without having to listen to all others- camera takes great photos!The bad:- many applications are slooooow and sometimes it appears to freeze, but it's just "hestitating"- keyboard sucks! very hard to write with. plus, there are no arrow buttons that allow you to go back a few words or sentences to edit very frustrating especially if you're writing a very important email that has to go out NOW- poor battery power- besides the appearing to freeze part, it actually does freeze up; constantly!Can't wait to go back to palm treo or pre!
Well I have had my Storm for less than 24 hours and I have to say that I am pretty impressed so far.  I did research prior to getting it in the mail so I had everything prepared for when the man in brown showed up.  [...] has all the info you need to load t-mobile service and get email flowing.I was disappointed that my applications did not transfer from the app store but I was able to transfer from my blackberry desktop manager.  Only thing is that they are not listed in my app store so updates will not be presented.  I will have to reinstall through the app store so I can get updates.Still getting used to full touch screen but I am looking forward to it!!!!I will post an update in a week or too.Only disappointment is that it was missing the 8Gig SD card.  I double checked and it was not listed and everything else was there and new so I will not be returning it.
This looked pretty good when I tried it out in the Verizon store, but to know it is to hate it. The clickable touchscreen is harder to type on than a thumbboard, and the whole interface is clunky and poorly thought out. Worse, the software is full of bugs and tends to freeze up, redering the phone useless until you take out the battery and put it back in, initiating a cold restart that takes several minutes. This has all the marks of a device that was rushed to market without adequate testing. Maybe the Storm II will be better, but it will be a long time before I consider another RIM product.
This is the worst phone I've ever bought, when doing a call, your cheeks press the silence, or speaker icon... its full of flaws.Dont buy a mediocre phone.. please read the online reviews of this product before you buy such an expensive phone.. beware..!!
Recently purchased this phone from Wall Street Photo (WSP).  Phone that arrived was dirty/obviously used/AND NOT FUNCTIONING!! The phone was immediately returned.  WSP wrote back that they WOULD NOT exchange the phone since the serial number on the phone I sent back, did not match the phone they sent me!?There was absolutely NO fraud from my side. Since when does someone check the serial numbers on a phone that they paid for?! I just sent it back.  There must have been a switch in their shipping department.  WSP continues to avoid responding to my follow-up e-mails or suggest a solution.Buy the phone, but NOT FROM WALL STREET PHOTO.
I ordered the BB Storm ünlocked"cell phone. Paid for express delivery. The package was dumped on the front door step- anyone could have walked off with it! I was leaving a few days later for  unreachable (by computer) parts of Dom. Rep. The phone was NOT unlocked. I could not use it and upon my return to Europe had to pay 30 euros to have it unlocked here. Two other friends tried their cards alos with no luck. I would like a re-imbursement of my 30 euros by OEM- seller of this product.
This is the best phone ever! I bought and loved.... Better than all others... Blackberry ROCKS!
The Storm that was sent to me was not unlocked. I received it the day before I was leaving town.  I took it with me to Cairo, Egypt and when I arrive there, discovered it was still locked.  The advert said no warranty.  I was informed later that there was infact a 30 day warranty but they were not too forcoimng with this revelation. I had to pay to have it unlocked.  The person I dealt with was nice and tried to help, but in the end it just was not a good experience. I can not recommend them nor will I ever use them again. Additionally, it was used and even though I explained this to them they never addresse this issue.  The Storm works great and recommend without a doubt.
Este equipo es realmente espectacular, tanto esteticamente como funcional, al principi cuesta acostumbrarse pero una vez ajustado como se debe, actualizado el SO y que te acostumbras funciona de primera.
I find the touch screen feature of this cellphone to be buggy and unresponsive at times. If you want a BlackBerry this is definitely not the best choice. This device seems heavy bulky and unrefined when compare with the Iphone 3G. Functionality is not that great either. You are better off waiting for the next BlackBerry attempt on a touch screen smart phone.
This is the most disappointing phone I've ever had. Typing is difficult and editing text is nearly impossible.  Blackberry has definitely jumped on the Iphone bandwagon quickly without doing their homework.  Its hard for me to understand how some people give this phone a four or five star rating.  Its a little suspicious.Stay away unless you enjoy pulling the hair out of your head or you are very patient and forgiving person.
I love this phone. I did not purchase it from amazon however. You can check all of your emails with one touch of a button. This phone is nothing short than amazing.
Everybody knows the storm is a piece of...........t but even knowing that, people want to have it. RIM is about to launch the Crapberry Storm 2, and you know what? I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT, the second part of an useless and problematic phone? but even better? more slowly and painfully? jajajajajajaja I just can't wait to see people wasting their money on that (if you can call it) "cutting edge phone", I am thinking about buying some corn pop and sodas, just to check the reviews for the CRAPBERRY STROM "2" Too slow, too glitchy, too bad jajajajajajajajajaja. And after they'll pray (like now)for an IPHONE (the Storm's father). You people should think about buying good phones, like Nokia's or HTC's, but CRAPBERRIES? IPHONE? even MOTOROLA is the same thing than RIM products, come on think about it. Have you seen the NOKIA N900? the HTC DIAMOND 2? NOKIA has an application called OVI, it is like blackberry messenger but better... IT'S FREE... do you think blackberry service is for free? you should check your accounts, at least in my country, blackberry service, as itself, is not free.Oh, I almost forgot, I don't have a Crapberry and I wish I never will jajajajajaja but I have to admit that I've been having a lot of fun reading your reviews. Actually I have an HTC Touch vogue 6900, and I CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, I found the software upgrades, games, applications, FOR FREE... It works like a baby, as a matter of fact IT IS MY BABY. I am looking to change it for an HTC DIAMOND "2", not because of the phone, I just want to have something more advanced, GPS, and all that stuff that I'll never use but I just want to have it (***crazy face*** O_o, MY PRECIOUSSSSSS jijijijijiji).So, my advice? if you want it, BUY NOKIA or HTC, but forget it about Crapberry or Iphone... Do you really want to pay for IPHONE'S applications? jajajajajajajajajajaja HTC's applications!!!! you can find it for free, as NOKIA'S too... upgrades? FREE too... Nokia is like Toyota, have you ever seen a Toyota with the hood lifted up in the freeway? I haven't, as I have never seen a NOKIA driving someone crazy.For the HTC, well that's another history, I had a HTC 6800 before my glorious HTC 6900, and was a pain in the a.... but I just changed it and everything has been good since then.Well DON'T BUY CRAPBERRIES JUST FOR FASHION, CRAPBERRY idiot people have msn messenger too,  so don't cry, you can chat with them anyway... bye
This is a great "smartphone" choice, especially at the contract price.Pros:Nice screen with lots of customization options for the interface. The custom HTC Sense UI that it uses is an improvement over the standard Android interface, with lots of cool widgets.The sound quality is good. Some others have complained of issues with background hiss, but I haven't experienced this. Voice quality has been good in general in various locations, even with only a bar of service. Audio quality for music is OK with decent headphones, not amazing. In general, this seems to work very well as a phone which is something other smartphones seem to sometimes not be great at. Can't tell how much of that is the phone versus the Verizon network, though. I've used this out in the middle of nowhere in a basement and still been able to make/ receive calls and get 3G service.Uses a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, so no goofy adapters are required.There are lots of useful apps available through the Android market.It has 2 physical buttons (whereas some other phones don't have any) which I like.It's fairly easy to use (although see note below about documentation or lack thereof). This is fun to use!The phone is lightweight and thin with smooth edges. It's much easier to put in your pocket or hold while talking than the Motorola Droid, which is one of the reasons I bought this. This feels more like a phone. I also like the feel of the soft-touch rubberized case.Could be a Pro or a Con, depending on your outlook:When on voice calls, you can hear a little of your voice in the part you have up to your ear. I like this feature a lot, as it somewhat replicates what happens with land line phones and I find it encourages you to not talk as loudly as some people normally do on cell phones. That's a very good thing. However, it may take some getting used to.I find the battery usage is pretty good for a smartphone, but you may feel differently depending on what you are comparing to. It does better if you turn off services you are not using at the moment, such as turning off WiFi, Bluetooth, or GPS when not in use, and turning off the automatic Gmail sync (I just hit Refresh to sync when I want to rather than leaving the auto sync on). If you leave absolutely everything on, you might not get much battery life. For my typical usage (phone calls, misc web browsing, syncing with Gmail multiple times throughout the day, listening to internet radio occasionally, and watching a video or two throughout the day) it does fine. You will probably have to recharge every evening, but I have no problems having it make it through an 18 hour day and sometimes there has still been charge left after 24 hours when I forgot to charge it. The initial battery life problems that some others have complained about elsewhere were taken care of by a firmware update that happened automatically the first time I powered up the phone to set it up.Some might not like the lack of a physical keyboard. I thought I would be one of those people, but I find the on screen keyboard to work really well after a little getting used to it. And I really like the thinner profile you can have without the keyboard. I would also thing that the reliability might be better without having the slider mechanism of a physical keyboard. I did try some other phones with physical keyboards and found many of them to be pretty awful, and this soft keyboard is certainly no worse than those. This is the custom HTC soft keyboard which I understand is much improved over the standard soft keyboard that comes with other Android phones, and is supposedly one of the best. There is a calibration feature that you can use to improve how it works for you. I recommend waiting to do the calibration after you've used the keyboard for a little bit, or if you calibrate initially then re-calibrate after you've gotten more experience with it.This has a sensor to turn off the screen when you put the phone up to your head, to help prevent accidentally dialing or activating features when you are talking. While this is very handy, it can be annoying if you are calling in to an automated phone system where you have to enter in a lot of numbers and work your way through the menus because when you initially pull the phone from your ear the screen will be blank. I find it works best in these situations to quickly "flip" the phone away from your ear and move your hand so the phone is laying flat in your hand. That seems to make the screen turn on again the quickest. You can turn this feature off if you want, though.Cons:Doesn't come with a manual or any other instructions or documentation. Although this phone is relatively easy to use, to get the most benefit from the extremely customizable interface you may want to download the available PDF manual, though. It does walk you through the basic setup the first time, however, so you can get up and running without a manual.No bluetooth voice dialing, as mentioned by another reviewer. This is a limitation of the Android operating system, not of this phone, and will hopefully be fixed in a future software update. This isn't really an issue for me but might be a concern for others.Although this comes with Google Navigation, the free turn-by-turn Google directions is not yet available for this phone because of the version of Android that it uses. However, Verizon has indicated that the OS will be updated in the first quarter of 2010 and the free turn-by turn Google directions should be able to work then. In the meantime, there are other apps (both free and paid) that will get you turn-by-turn directions now if you need it.In general, the phone isn't perfect but it is very, very good. It's an excellent choice for someone who wants the smartphone features but also likes to use their phone as an actual phone.
Great phone,love the touch screen. Left AT&T; for Verizon a year ago, and was sooo happy this year when they came out with a phone comparable with the iPhone, and SOOOO disappointed when I got the phone home, that I can't VOICE DIAL through the headset!!More disappointing was that the salespeople and customer service @ Verizon weren't even aware that this feature didn't work. If they had been upfront with me, I never would have bought the phone. In most states it is against the law to drive and talk on a mobile phone unless you have a HANDS-FREE device.  Now don't get me wrong, this phone does have VOICE DIAL that you can use on speaker phone, but what is the sense, you have look at the phone to swipe the screen to unlock the unit, then touch a button to activate the voice dial, THEN you have to look and touch the screen to CONFIRM that the unit picked the correct number WTF!! Rumor says they will be addressing this issue, and I'm sure they will, but I don't like being a guinea-pig.  They did the same thing with the iPhone, and you had to BUY the next version of the iPhone to get the new feature.Shame on you Verizon.
I have a limited amount of cargo space in my bag. I seriously do not want to waste money and real estate on 15 different gadgets.Criteria:PHONE. I want to be heard and to be able to hear. Droid: Brilliantly does this. anyplace anytime, anywhere. I have not had a call dropped or lost, but I have had a little issue with face dialing.GOOGLE VOICE: Transcribes all my voice mail and sends it to my phone. from the house phone, from the cell phone, all redirects to one location. SWEET. and for the hearing impaired, I can read it and hear it at the same time. it is fairly accurate with people that articulate well, it is hit and miss for people that talk like they have a mouthful of cheerios.RINGTONES: any song I have on any album I can rip to MP3 and make it a ringtone. a FULL SONG ringtone, not just 20 seconds that repeats. very nice.CONTACT LIST: I want to manage this on my computer with a NORMAL keyboard and access to GOOGLE, FACEBOOK Photos, and other resources, DROID: Brilliantly does this.TEXTING: I have to have a NORMAL QWERTY keyboard in landscape mode to type with two thumbs. Droid does this Brilliantly. Each texting conversation is kept in a running dialog with that person. so I know what question was answered when I get a text a day or two later, without wondering what they are talking about because I forgot what I said last. this is BRILLIANT!CALENDAR:EACH family member uses google calendar and this is without a doubt the only way that we can maintain our complicated calendar with color coded blocks of time for scheduling. Cub Scouts, Business Meetings, Chess club, Dr Appointments, birthday party's, remove the day planner from my wallet and reduce the weight by a few pounds is WONDERFUL! Everything sync's automatically, instantly giving me a two in one device.DIGITAL PHOTO ALBUM: this is a squealing delight, the picture quality and size is fantastic, and I am a pro-photographer so I am pretty picky on picture quality. I am very happy to have three in one purpose device.MP3 Player: with 5 kids, I rarely have a moment alone but yes, I have had time to sneak on the ear phones and listen to a song or two and it was very nice to have my own music instead of whatever white noise is going on around me. that gives me four in one devices.GPS: when my husband got turn by turn with his blackberry a year ago I was so jealous, but the blackberry device is just vile in my opinion. He has the pearl and I despise the flaky little keyboard. I simply knew that there had to be something out there and I was so tempted to get the separate GPS but who need yet another device? GOOGLE MAPS is fantastic. voice search is sweet, the only drawback is the horrible 'digitized voice and poor pronunciation of words like creek and other simple street names in my neighborhood. overall better than the alternative. Happily I have now five in one devices.LATITUDES: this is where we add the marzipan to the cake, I NEED to know where my kids are. I am one of those parents that simply need to know. If I could put a chip in their ankles at the vet legally, I would do it. With Latitudes, I can see where they are on the map anywhere without them having to do anything. They only share with me so I know that they are not 'at risk' but when you have a young adult daughter driving 2000 miles cross country alone, it is a frantic feeling when they do not call to check in. Latitudes works locally as well, if your 10 year old takes their phone and goes into an area that is out of the zone, you get an alert. I know without being strapped down to a computer all day, I can leave the house, but not leave my peace of mind. Six in one devices enough?SHOPPING: yes, I am watching every penny. If I am shopping and it is a 'good deal' I want to know that it is really a good deal. there is a bar code reader, SERIOUSLY. a bar code reader that will search Amazon and give me a price IMMEDIATELY. and I can decide to buy there where I am or with One-Click, order it from Amazon. I have had it on my doorstep the next day after going through this process. THIS IS INVALUABLE. seven in one devices.CAMERA. ehn not even close. I am way too picky when it comes to picture quality. They definitely dropped the ball on this one. I still have my Lumix DMC-LX3 in my purse and have to painstakingly upload to a computer and then to the blog for this but eventually it will get better. the mpg white balance is way too warm and I was not at all pleased with this. they need to go back to the drawing board and actually get some good optics. Same quality as the Alias 3 megapixel - BIG MINUS on this one.BONUS:Weather channel: I have 5 kids in 4 cities, I need to know.Facebook: always connected, wheee cool. this is a fun and nice little app, not as easy to navigate as a computer, but good enough.Twitter: fun.Gmail: Oh definitely invaluable.Mozilla: reading the newspaper, this is just way way too much fun. I am starting to wonder what I need a family for with all the fun that this has.Games: Soduku, word search, chess, but seriously, who has time with all the other features like Facebook newsfeed?a negative: the fail would be no java yet. it is expected in a couple of months so many web pages in the browser do not work since we are a java based experience, I am waiting patiently.overall I love my droid more than my kids, more than my husband, more than my Nikon D300. It is my full function voice recognition turn by turn GPS, it is my full function mp3 player. it is my fantastic digital photo album, it remembers and keeps a running stream of my text's in a 'chat' format. it is my wifi anywhere I want to go browser / email / facebook / news/ weather / on demand connection. and I hear that it is a pretty nifty phone too.
Ok... I actually have the CDMA version, the Motorola+Verizon DROID, and it's an excellent smart phone. I would give this version a five star rating, assuming the GSM modem works just as well. Best Smart Phone Ever.But there's a BIG caveat for this, used in the USA: according to the spec sheet, it only supports UMTS/HSPA (3G) at 900MHz and 2100MHz... the European standard. Here in the states, T-Mobile uses 1700MHz/2100MHz, and AT&T;'s using the original 850MHz/1900MHz that's also used for Voice/2G/EDGE. So you can get EDGE speeds just dandy on this phone, but not 3G, here in the USA.
January 9 2010: I amended the review to add some details about a couple problems I've had with the phone, slowdowns which lead to lockups and twice it suffered a system crash that leads to wiping out the phone's memory. I devoted a lot of the amended review to a hassle I had with Nokia's customer service. I realize that's unfair and irrelevant to the review of the phone, so I removed it.Although it says I bought the phone from Amazon I actually bought it direct from Nokia. I canceled the Amazon order when I thought they had the wrong color. I'm sorry that happened because buying it from Amazon would have been a better experience. (another edit: since installing the new firmware, any stability issues the phone had seem to have been solved)My original review:The quality of the materials and the fit/finish & construction is the first thing I noticed, taking this out of the box. It has nice surfaces everywhere, a shiny steel bezel on the front and highlights around the bottom section, a matte black (brownish) metal finish on the bottom with a steel battery door and camera lens bezel. The battery door latches securely (and easily) unlike any phone I've ever owned. The phone feels heavy in a high quality way. It fits in your hand in a way that makes it feel much thinner than you would expect from the measurements. The flare at the bottom makes it feel more secure in your hand. The raised lens bezel makes it easy to avoid inadvertently using the camera lens as a finger grip.so many pros...-- Touchscreen is very responsive and has kinetic scrolling and it's easy to stop the screen without accidentally launching something.-- Browser is full screen and looks great. (embedded con - I'm not sure I like the controls that pop up for some basic stuff like "back" or bookmarks. I can't find an easy way to backtrack in sites without bringing up the clunky set of controls.)-- The 3-row back-lit keyboard is easy to see in dim light, and it looks awesome with the gray and orange illumination. The layout works great for me, I'm already comfortable with how it works and find it much nicer than keyboards with 5 rows of keys.-- 16 x 9 screen has excellent color and brightness, even outside. Perfect format for watching movies full screen.-- Has native support for Flash and java so Youtubes and flash based websites look like they should. (does not support Flash 10 - hopping for an update)-- When you open the keyboard the screen tilts into a good viewing angle, either for typing with your thumbs or setting it on a table. Works great for watching videos, you don't have to prop it up on something.-- Stereo speakers sound great for speaker phone. (edited to add: the speaker quality continues to impress me. They also work good for listening to the FM radio.) Music sounds outstanding through headphones, it sounds like a high-end MP3 player. Music Player has the best sorting, album art, searching, Playlist creating and ID3Tag editing I've ever seen on a phone - wow.-- Accelerometer is pretty fast and all menus and screens and all but a few third-party apps have a landscape mode. You have to turn it on, it's off by default. The keyboard forces a landscape mode.-- This is the most customizable phone I've ever had. Nothing is locked in place, put it wherever it works best for you. I've already downloaded about a dozen themes and love how much you can personalize the appearance of the menus and screens, even the icons.-- The widgitized home screen is of course just as customizable but has another feature I wasn't expecting. You can swipe your finger across it and hide all the widgets so your phone display is just the wallpaper you chose and the clock at the top. Another swipe brings them back.--  Call quality and signal strength is very good - what you would expect from Nokia. I'm replacing a Samsung Eternity and this phone is a dramatic contrast, it's so much better.-- All the phone stuff, voice dial, speed dial, endless contact list with all the fields you could ever need, excellent contact list access/search, full MP3 ringtones, etc. It's all there and implemented very well.-- It comes loaded with apps, all of which can be removed if you want. Email is available in a couple different ways, a pay push system or free mail client in the messaging bundle. POP3 or IMAP.-- App stores for Symbian S60 are plentiful and there are loads of free apps and themes as well as ones you pay for.-- GPS is fast to fix on a location and stays locked on very well. Works much better outside than it does indoors.-- WiFi was easy to set up with MAC address and WPA security on my home system. It seems a bit flakey about staying connected or the phone deciding which network to use for certain apps, GSM or WiFi. I haven't found the way to configure this yet but I'm sure it's in there somewhere. (edited: a call to nokia support took care of this. There is a way to make it ask which connection to use when launching)-- Headphone jack has video out and hands-free mic & music controller inside the single 3.5mm plug. A nice set of headphones with mic and music controls is included but no video cable.-- Camera is excellent from what I can tell, haven't tried the video recorder yet.you get the idea... I really like this phone. It does everything and does it in a mature way, the OS feels like it's no-nonsense, something made for adults.Now the cons (including a big one - oops nokia!)-- limited video codec support. No DiVX. Player is from Real Player. I'm looking for a video player app to replace it - any suggestions would be appreciated.-- photo viewer doesn't recognize folders. This means all your contacts, album art, phone photos and collections of photos are all in one list, not necessarily sorted in the order you would expect. It's a pain to do anything with photos (my old phone worked the same way). ***I see there are third--party apps that seem to address all the issues.*** <-- this is not true. I was thinking the Resco Photo Viewer took care of this problem but it doesn't. I haven't found anything that does. A Nokia update might be able to address this and also make the photo viewer usable.-- GPS has an indicator to show it's running but it doesn't show if it's connected to any satellites. (edited: some of the GPS apps have a satellite signal strength indicator on the screen, but this doesn't help when multitasking.)-- some of the menus and built-in apps like the media player have a bland retro look. A bit of skinning would have helped, smaller boxes, less 3-d shading and touches like that. Simpler would have been nicer. Maybe some different fonts.-- There's a blinking indicator for unread messages that won't stop flashing. I've marked everything I can find as read but it continues blinking. (solved: messages stored on the SIMM card caused this - thx to the comment that pointed this out)-- The screen is a little stiff to flip up, but it's spring loaded so once it gets going it flies into place. Getting a fingernail under the back part really helps pop it into place. A small indent back there would have helped.-- USB connector is uncovered (dust) and is placed on the front so it's a bit awkward using it while plugged in - also the connector is mounted upside down which is mildly irritating.-- not a con but I haven't figured out where the mic is - so I'm not sure if I'm putting my finger over it.-- Here's the big one... The bottom of the phone has the camera lens bezel on one side and a flare on the other side to make it sit flat on a flat surface. The space in front of the lens bezel is enough to make it tip when you type on that side of the keyboard. [This is only a problem if you type on the keyboard while it's sitting on a flat surface, like a desk. Most people type with their thumbs while holding the phone so for them it wouldn't be an issue. (edited to add this clarification)]The original N97, the design this phone was based on, has a lens cover in a shroud that extends to the front of the phone. Leaving the lens cover off the mini created the problem. The designers must have not thought it through (or tested their design) but it clearly is a flaw Nokia needs to correct.This phone is just too cool to give up on so I used a wooden matchstick to steady it and then realized I could just glue it to the case.I put a photo of my matchstick mod in the user photo gallery. If anyone else comes up with a solution for the tippy case I'd love to see it, I'm hoping to use the mini for at least a few years. (someone in the comments pointed out that using a case with the phone would also solve the problem.)My wife found another solution for the "foot" problem. She gave me a package of leather dots that quilters use as a thimble, stuck right on the tip of their finger. These things stick to the case really well and you can pull them off of the case without leaving any mess behind. Two of them stacked together make a perfect height for the foot.Edited - 03-05-10: I added some photos to the gallery. These are to show the ThimblePad foot in place and also the clarity of the Clarivue screen protector. Plus I added a couple of shots that are just sheer affection for the design of this phone.Edited May 16, 2010: I upgraded to the new firmware recently and my phone is more stable, the UI is faster, memory is optimized better so multitasking never hiccups and my battery life is outstanding. I'm getting three days on a single charge even with fairly heavy usage. Right now I'm at a bit more than 48 hours since I charged and my battery shows 100%. A week ago after going 72 hours the battery still showed 27% when I plugged it in for the night. I just put my rating back to five stars, I love this phone more every day.Edited - July 1: I took the "foot" off the mini and the stylus string broke so I have a naked phone again, like just out of the box. I really like it this way and I found something useful for the tippy keyboard. A quarter (US) slipped under the corner works perfectly to stabilize the case. I'll live with this solution for a while and see how it works for me. I still have plenty of the leather feet so I can always go back to that. I like the phone the way it is though. I still haven't seen any phone for AT&T;'s 3.5G that is anywhere near as functional or well built as the mini for the price.I've been carrying it unprotected in my pocket for six months and it looks as good as new (I do have a clear screen protector). No scratches and the finish is still beautiful. I find new functions all the time and have settled on about ten favorite themes. I love this phone.
I have had this phone for a little over a week now and am quite happy with the results so far. Before I begin though, I feel like a few caveats are in order. 1) If you are expecting an Apple iPhone UI experience in terms of simplicity and whistles and bells, you will be disappointed with the OS employed by this smartphone (Symbian S60 5th Edition). 2) You definitely need a data plan to get full use of this phone - preferable through AT&T; to take advantage of 3g speed. 3) This phone uses resistive touch screen technology - as such, it is not as sensitive as that used in many commercial touch screen smartphones on the market in the US. If you're coming from that background, you'll find this a little difficult to get used to. That said, if you live in a colder environment, you'll be able to use this phone while wearing gloves.With that out of the way, here are the impressions I have:1) This is a well-built phone with nice use of metals and higher quality plastics. It feels great in the hand - solid and compact. There is no creaking whatsoever (you can't even tell straight up that the phone has a keyboard) and the hinge seems durable and well designed - time will tell. On the negative side, I have noticed that there is a little light leak coming from a couple of the keys and the camera key also feels a little stiff.2) I found the keyboard to be tactile and I was able to adapt to it pretty quickly. There is enough space between the keys to make typing a relatively accurate experience. The space key is slightly offset which may throw some people.3) The overall feel of the OS is pretty zippy. Coming from a Nokia N95 8gb, I am definitely experiencing a speed increase in menu transitions and application load times.4) The out-of-the box firmware appears quite stable. I've had the phone for over a week and have not experienced a lock-up yet. My previous phone would crash at least once every couple of days so stability is a key issue for me and this phone (so far) appears to pass muster.5) The home screen is completely customizable. This is a great feature and gives you virtually one touch access to the things you use the most - be it applications, contacts, music player and a whole range of web widgets (facebook, email, weather)6) The GPS gets fast locks especially when use the assisted GPS function (allowing the phone to access data from the internet to obtain a quicker GPS fix). The phone also comes preloaded with map data for the US and Canada.  For voice navigation you'll need to purchase a license from Nokia. I find their service to be accurate and okay value for money.7) The camera takes excellent pictures for a phone and is one of the main reasons I bought this phone. I am noticing a slight improvement on the camera module from the N95 even though the specs are virtually the same. I imagine that Nokia have tweaked the camera processing software somewhat.  Worth mentioning though is that the quality is never going to be as good as even a rudimentary compact camera - especially in low light conditions. That said, always having a camera on your person for on the fly photography is awesome. It's also great to be able to upload to flickr or facebook upon capturing a photo you want to share.8) The music player does a nice job and provides rich sound. There is no FM transmitter on this model (unlike the N97 standard) so connecting it to a car stereo will have to be through Bluetooth or wired using the headphone socket (it is a standard 3.5 jack)9) Connecting to a computer is simple. Nokia provides the OVI suite which helps to sync your calendar, music, photos/videos etc. You can also download new maps and backup your phone data using this software. Unfortunately, you'll need a PC to install it. Using a Mac still allows you to access the phone in mass-memory mode so you can drop down music to the phone manually.10)  Battery life is pretty good. Ultimately of course it depends on how you use the phone as to how long it lasts. If you're using data heavy widgets and GPS, you're battery will become depleted quite quickly.  It easily lasts a full day of average use (couple of calls,  10-15 text messages, an hour of music while browsing the internet on Opera Mini, reviewing some emails from my Gmail account and taking 2 or 3 photos)11) You can get a whole range of 3rd party apps for this phone - free and paid for. I recommend downloading Opera Mini (an alternative browser), Fring, (a VOIP application which allows connection to the Skype network) and Joikuspot  (a app that turns your phone into a wireless hotspot and comes installed on this phone). Nokia's own OVI store can be used for downloading apps but I have not had great experiences with this method - I find their app store to be poorly organized and the access point is slow and klunky. There are other stores out there where apps can be downloaded which provide a better experience in my eyes.12) As it currently stands, you'll likely have to import a case and screen protector for this phone.  I'm sure this will change in the coming months.All in all, this is a great phone - it is extremely versatile and has coped well thus far with all I've thrown at it. It does lack the wow factor of the iPhone or the n900 in the user interface department but if you can get past that and want a functional, aesthetically pleasing smartphone this is a decent option.*****EDIT: I have used the phone full-time for around a month now and am in a good position to supplement my review with the following comments regarding features that I have discovered/missed in my original review and bugs that I have encountered with the firmware shipped with the device (namely v. 10.2.020).13. Voice/phone capabilities: It is testament to this phone's many other features that I neglected to mention the overall voice capabilities of the phone. They are pretty much what you come to expect with Nokia devices in general - I have owned 4 models in my life and each one has provided strong voice functionality. General reception on the phone is excellent, voice comes through nice a clear and I've had no complaints from the other end. One related negative point here though that I would like to add is that the speakers on this phone are not quite as impressive as other devices that I have owned. They just seem a lot less powerful and considerably more tinny.  As a consequence, I have limited my speakerphone use to quiet areas.14.  I got a nice case for the phone from PDAIR. It is a leather holder of sorts that houses the phone nice and securely. It doesn't add too much bulk to the phone either. I also got a screen protector from the same supplier.15. Update on the battery use: Again, I am relatively impressed with the longevity of the battery vs. my personal daily use. I do not use any data heavy widgets but I have activated the push email feature of my email client (Profimail).  I typically push my regular non-business email so it's not on the go for 12 hours a day but I receive at least 15 emails/day. This has been added to my regular usage as noted above (namely couple of calls, 10-15 text messages, an hour of music while browsing the internet on Opera Mini and taking 2 or 3 photos). I typically have around 4 bars of battery left when I plug it in to charge again overnight. If I have a day when I really intend to use it heavily, I plug it into my computer at work to give it a little extra juice. One thing I have noticed when doing this is that I am unable to access my music through the device (likely due to the computer recognizing access in mass memory mode (where my music is stored) as opposed to just charging the battery). This is a little inconvenient but maybe there is a workaround that I haven't discovered yet.16. Firmware bugs: First up, don't be put off by the following remarks: None of them are real deal breakers for me and they will likely be cleaned up in the next firmware update. Being an early adopter of devices, you come to accept that there will be some issues and you just hope that they don't impact regular use too much. This is the case here: a. I noticed that when you are receiving a call and need to activate the screen using the screen release button on the side you sometimes have to flick the switch several times to get the screen to activate. This can be irritating when you need to get the dialer application up when you are using some automated system (i.e. calling your bank etc.) b. I noticed that on occasion (and the exact situation that inspires this still undetermined) the phone does lock up for a good few minutes before resolving itself. In the past this has happened when I've had a few 3rd part apps open and then tried to access the music player. I resolve this typically by restarting the phone. Ultimately, this may be due to 3rd party app incompatibility or it may be some sort of firmware issue. If anybody has had a similar experience, I'd be interested to know what your conditions were. Again, this hasn't happened many times and in all probability, a 3rd party app was to blame. I also want to add here that I have never the type of lock up where you need to remove the battery. c. Memory management: If I could change this device in any way, I would have given it 256mb of ROM as opposed to the 128. That said, I have only encountered memory out errors twice and both were due to trying to access the photo gallery. (As a side note, the photo gallery needs to optimized somewhat, it takes a while to load the images etc. and feels sludgy overall. This is somewhat annoying as the photo taking capability of this phone is where it excels in comparison to other devices yet trying to show off some of the images you've taken and having to deal with the slow gallery interface removes some of the wow factor for users of other devices). I recently purchased a program that gives me all kinds of data regarding the phone including available ROM memory and I have noticed that the amount of ROM you start off with after restarting the phone is slowly chipped away at even if you correctly close applications that you are finished with for the day.  This is likely due to all the system process background apps that are loaded as you use the phone throughout the day and ultimately probably lends to some memory out errors. Again, I've only encountered this a couple of time and if you remain diligent in closing apps that you are finished with (you'll conserve battery this way too) and restart the phone every once in a while, you'll likely not encounter this too often. d. There is an error with the standard profile/ring tone whereby despite assigning a ringtone to a profile, the software chooses something different for certain people calling me. I can't explain this at all and have checked all the settings.My original conclusion still remains and, as the firmware becomes more mature, this phone should get better with age.
Wow! When I first bought this phone I was very happy because the ease of use, and the fact that not a lot of people have one. It is great for everything it offers. If I had to recommend this product there would be no hesitation!
phone died in 5 days. 4 and counting attempts by nokia to repair  SAME ISSUEif you find anything wrong. RETURN for REFUND immed if possible.Purhcased at NYC flagship store. I had the phone working for 1st 5 days. When the battery started to discharge, i tried charging. It didnt charge at all. Store gave me new battery saying battery was at fault. Again same issue. It wudnt even turn on with the charger connected - so clearly its not just battery problem. By the time this battery discharged , the 14 day return period was over - pretty sure they knew it.Then started the saga of sending to nokia service center - PALCO. Already sent 4 times. each time had to ship back same evening or next day. Same problem for "repaired" "replaced" and "repaired again" phone.First they claim its "repaired", then 2nd time they claim "cannot be repaired...so replaced"...why did they send it then?but the so called replaced also had same issue - how can this be co-incidence?again sent...they claim repaired....but same issue.When i call....they dont agree to send me a courtesy phone since its clearly their mistake and 4 attempts are enough to figure out im being cheated.They wont give me refund or replacement.They wont even agree to send me a email saying they take responsibility to resolve the issue.5 is not my lucky number....i have no hope it will get resolved.looks like they will continue playing ping-pong till end of 12 months.WORST set of people.Bottom line: NEVER BUY UNLOCKED PHONES- even if its nokia flagship storeNEVER BUY NOKIARETURN WHEN YOU CAN
I had my Nokia 2720 about 2 weeks before returning it and have little good to say about it other than it seemed well made, had a solid feel and a reasonable battery life.For three reasons I decided to return it.1. The phone was black and shiny, sleek and attractive as long as no one had touched it since it was cleaned. Pick it up and use it a couple of times and it looked like a scuzzy mess. I would have been embarrassed to let anyone else see it closely, much less use it.2. The phone had a one button combination navigation and select(OK) key which was actually recessed slightly, making it difficult to use. It was all too easy to hit OK when trying to scroll, which I found somewhat annoying. It might have been usable, however, by someone with long fingernails or tiny little fingers. As a male with short fingernails, I could scroll down one-handed with no problem, using my thumb on the key. To scroll up or to either side reliably I had to hold the phone in one hand and use the back (nail) of a finger or thumb on the other hand to press the key. Otherwise I kept hitting OK. If you have a low frustration point or would like to be able to use your phone one-handed, you should consider another phone.3. I could have lived with the two deficiencies above. The straw that broke the camel's back was the ear speaker. Even in a reasonably quiet room at max volume it was difficult to hear well unless the speaker opening was positioned in precisely the right spot on my ear. Unfortunately, when I placed the phone to my ear in a natural, comfortable location, as I would do when answering a call, the opening was about an inch above the "right" spot and I couldn't hear squat. The "right" spot also irritated my ear after a few minutes. If you are going to be using your phone in a noisy environment (and who doesn't), you should consider another phone.In closing, I can't recommend this phone except perhaps as a wall hanging. It's mighty pretty when all polished up.
Has all the bells and whistles you or your teenager needs in order to communicate with others.  Unable to purchase from Amazon anylonger.  Purchase at Walmart.
I think this is a great phone...just wish more was touchscreen...but even without it, its  pretty sweet. 9/10.
I love this phone has everything I need even has a touch dial to dial phone numbers !!Love my neon
Alright, let me just say off the bat that as a former Bold 9000 user, I've been looking forward to the new Bold 2 for months since pictures were leaked on the internet. Since I get my phones through my company, I've had the phone since Nov. 18, when it was released on AT&T;'s network for Premier people.  Unfortunately, my friend decided that after playing around with my phone, they wanted one, so I bought them an unlocked one.The new Bold 9700 is a sleek phone - no doubt about it. RIM apparently has decided, though, to somewhat standardize their phones' look, a direction that bothers me to a great extent. One of the things I loved about the Bold was that it was different - you saw any other phone, and then you saw the Bold - and you thought "Wow, that phone IS bold!!" Size I couldn't care less about - as long as it looked good, and worked awesomely, what else matters? And the Bold 9000 fit those well. So when I got the new 9700, and I compared it to my coworker's Tour (for Verizon), I was quite surprised at how similar they were. It's actually somewhat hard to tell them apart (the 9700 is a bit smaller, and also has the trackpad). Just an observation....Alright - to the review:Pros:Trackpad - this is definitely a most welcome upgrade. RIM outdid themselves on this part - I thought the trackball was good, this trackpad is great! The older Bold's trackball was great, as long as you kept dirt and dust out of it. Which turned out to be somewhat difficult, since there was a depression surrounding the trackball, and so if too much dust or dirt got in, the ball needed to be replaced. Also, if you used it too much, the ball would lose its grip, and become less responsive, also - once again - needing to be replaced. Both those problems are now gone with this new trackpad. For former trackball users, it may take a little use to get to know it, but once you do, trust me - you'll never go back.Speaker - the speakers on the Bold are nothing less than stunning. My friend has an IPhone, and my speakers for playing music and speakerphone blow his out of this century. Not only can they get very loud, but they also are quite clear and crisp, for the volume you can put them to. And, if that wasn't good enough, RIM includes AudioBoost - for when you hook your Bold up to your car or stereo system, which bumps the output sound even higher. Excellent....OS - the new BlackBerry 5 OS, which comes preloaded on the phone, is a major improvement over the 4.6 version in most other phones. It's snappier, and quite more responsive.Camera - RIM upgraded the camera from a 2 MP in the older Bold to a 3.2 MP in the Bold 9700. The pictures that the phone takes are quite good, even in poor light conditions. Of course, if you try to take pictures in the club with it - prepare to be somewhat disappointed. Ha. But for regular, everyday camera uses, that "quick shot", the Bold 9700 actually takes decent pictures. Nice for when you forget to bring that digital camera with you.There's a couple other pros I can think of, but they're more along the lines of business users, or based on networks (you could get 3G speeds on AT&T;'s network since the first Bold - T-Mobile just got their first 3G BlackBerry with this phone). If you're interested in them, drop me a comment, and I'll get back to you.Now, for the cons:Battery - battery life is still somewhat bad, although it definitely is an improvement over the older Bold. I normally use Pandora - an App that plays Internet Radio, trust me, this should be one of the first apps you download, it's free - the other is Google Maps, also free - anyway, back to the review, so I normally use Pandora, and I can get about 6 hours out of the battery, with small breaks in-between receiving phone calls. So, in normal use, you could probably get about a day out of the battery, which isn't terrible, but also is somewhat worse than comparable phones out there.Hardware - this is probably my biggest negative I had. Normally, when they say upgrade, you would think they would put better hardware in the thing, right?? Well, think again. With the exception of the upgraded camera and trackpad, there is NO difference in hardware between this and the older Bold.Zero.Nada.I would've liked some upgraded hardware in the phone. But again - this is just my thing. You may not care.My last negative is more hit and miss - some people have been reporting that BlackBerry Maps - the app that RIM ships with the phone for navigation, doesn't work on the 9700. Myself included. This appears to be at random, but it just irks me.  It may be dependent on the network you're on. Fortunately, there's a workaround - get Google Maps.So - overall, the phone is a nice update. It works, takes nice pictures, looks sleek, and can be used as your new boombox when you want to blast "What is Love?" by Haddaway. (Kidding on the last one) I would completely recommend this phone, even with some of its faults, since they don't really take away from the experience with the phone.I'll update this review from time to time, as I continue to use this, so if there's any questions, please feel free to ask.UPDATE:  As of today - 8/3/2010 - RIM has announced that their new BlackBerry OS - 6 - WILL be compatible with the 9700.  So if you are looking at this phone, but aren't necessarily a fan of OS 5, or weren't sure if updates would be released for it - fear no more.UPDATE 2:  Today, 1/26/2011 - RIM has still not released the OS 6 for this phone yet, which is just BS.  I included a link for those of you who are feeling dangerous and don't mind using beta software, so here you go - [...]  Remember - it is a beta, so some things might be different, but I didn't notice any less functionality.
Excellent phone.  A fusion of my old 8900 and a Bold 9000!Pros:Size (Almost as small as the 8900)Fast 3G phoneVoice qualityClassy design (a beauty!)Fast and responsive OSMore internal memory for programsBattery life is WoW!!! (incredible! best in a blackberry!)Screen is awsome!  (colors and res)Camera is excellent (although no improvement here from 8900, but big improvement from BOLD 9000)Cons:Keyboard take some time to get use to.  But once you get use to the keyboard you'll feel right at home
The Blackberry 9700 Bold is a great phone and I couldnt be happier with it. I have had the 8900 Curve which is a good phone, and before that the original Curve 8310. The new Bold is obviously a culmination of years of painstaking development by RIM to come up with such a excellent product. Cant think of one thing I dont like about the new Bold. From its beautifull exterior to the killer camera, to the OS that is very smooth and fast, 3G speed, new texting capabilities, wifi and last but by no means least, the new track pad. The track pad is phenominal, its so very responsive I tend to get carried away with it because Im still kinda use to the track ball. Excellent upgrade RIM, thanks I love this phone. Also the leather like battery door is very classy and it of course doesnt show scratches and is kinda grippy too. Gonna put a Otter Box Impact case on it to protect it tho, very nice looking addition to a great looking phone. 5 stars RIM!!
Like the tradition of the blackberrys products, the 8120 is a good option in size, ellegance and results..
I bought this and its wonderful.Particularly good battery life and if you wear it on the underside of your wrist you can make calls without a headset and it looks like you are holding thin air while making a call.The touch screen is very good as is the music player and the interfaces.I recommend using it with At&t; and Google as they have a very good email to sms and sms to email gateway and brilliant SMS notification system and sms search system respectively.There are no data services on the device, No email, no game, no apps and no browser.It is very god for voice and the speaker phone is excellent. If you must use a headset then get a jawbone to go with it as the headset it comes with is very ordinary.Beware the charging cable though, its connectors are fragile and you only get one cable with a charging clip so if you break it then you are stuck (I have a soldering iron and ended up by passing the connectors because I could not get another clip anywhere.Overall it s brilliant!
I've read on the internet an comment from an owner of this Pocket PC and she seems to be very disappointed in this miracle.Here is the link - [...]/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permBecause I cannot post comments on the other amazon.com, I just wanted to spit it out somewhere, so I guess American amazon will work.Here is the answer:You seem to be somehow frustrated by this mobile phone. You don't like almost ANY of it's features, thus it is a very functional and ergonomic device. I was laughing my a** at the part where you said about Word, Excel... Go buy yourself a netbook. Come on people, netbooks are netbooks, notebooks are other thing, PCs and Macs - another thing. This is a Smartphone/Communicator/Pocket PC, not a desktop or whatever! When you will understand that a device like this is meant to simplify your life and help you ON THE GO with most of your tasks, while on the move, or when you don't really have access to a real desktop computer? It is not supposed to make for you reports, graphs or cook a cake for God's sake, it is just a freaking cool pocket PC with a very (very) good hardware base and an very (very) appealing and beautiful interface. Peace.
This multimedia device is truly one for the books. I believe it really rivals, if not tops off the Apple i Phone 3.0G s. It has amazing features and the size and screen quality are impeccable. The built in memory (16GB) accompanied by the expandable micro SD slot is also a great feature. This phone solves the need for having a digital camera, video camera, MP3 player, cellular device,portable messenger, portable web browser and video viewing device. All those components of the device are top of the line and not lackluster as compared to many other smart phones.
Verizon just upped their ETF (early termination fee) for a list of smart phones to $350.  So you better really want this.I had one, not a bad phone but fairly crude compared to HTC's Android phones with Sense UI - browser on the droid sucks compared to HTC sense or iPhone.Can't beat the hardware specs on the Droid - UNLESS - you wait until Jan 5th 2010 or so, then there will be an avalanche of as good or better hardware out there too.Don't go with Verizon cuz of the $350 ETF, if their allowed to get away with the 200% ETF increase - nobody else is doing this yet.In fact, I have a premier sprint account and they allow an upgrade every year on the hardware for the primary phone - and monthly charges are substantially less... and their ETF is $200.
I paid the full price for this paperweight. You CANNOT get prepaid service with this. I don't do contracts so the Verison $1.99 unlimited talk and text suited me to a tee. Couldn't authorize this phone on Verizon's web site. Called their authorization center and after the nice lady went through all the steps to authorize the phone I heard her say, "Oh no. Is this a smart phone?". Then she dropped the hammer. "We can't do prepaid on smart phones. You will need a full service agreement before it can be activated."Without activation you can do NOTHING with this phone. You can't even uses the camera!By-the-by, I have a Samsumg Blackjack II (smart phone) and it works just fine with AT&T;'s prepaid plans.I'm now looking for a buyer for the DROID and will sell it at a good price.
To all Amazon customers. I truly and honestly advise you all to be careful of who is the merchant of the products you are buying from. I ordered a Blackberry Tour 9630 for my fiancee. First when I order the phone, they sent me the wrong endorsed phone. I needed a Sprint PCS phone, they send her a Verizon phone. After she mailed the phone back, by overnite, to World Wide Distributors, she had to wait 6 days to recieve the correct phone. While my fiancee has the correctly endorsed phone, she goes to the local Sprint PCS store and finds out that the phone she has CAN NOT be activated. The phone came up as LOST or STOLEN! While my fiancee called World Wide, she was trying to get ahold of customer service and the young lady hung up on her. This company should be shut down and banned from any further business with any group, company, or business alike. I hope I have helped many other customers of Amazon with this ordeal.
I really advice all to make sure the company you are going to give your money to, will be a good reliable one. My fiancee who is currently deployed to Iraq sent me a Blackberry tour 9630 as a gift. I was excited until the phone I recieved was the wrong carrier. I am with Sprint they sent a Verizon phone. Customer service rep ANITA when I contacted them let me know she would email a ups label. It has been a week I am still waiting for the email! I knew better sent the phone out to them over night. Today I recieved the correct Sprint Blackberry. To my surprise when I go to activate is they can't do it because the phone was reported LOST or STOLEN!!!!! I was irrate I called World Wide while at the store, all John could do is give me his email so I could email him!!! I called customer service aka Anita, I was upset so yes I raised my voice, and so did she!!! Can you imagine, your fiancee half a world away sends a present and not a cheap one, everything goes wrong, then you are yelled back from the people who are supposed to be serving you! Anita then proceeded to hang up on me. I called back and told her the money needed to be refunded immediately, she said once we recieve the phone we will refund the money. I know that's how things work, but they didnt wait till we had the phone to draw the funds from the account. This whole ordeal was extremely upsetting! The worse part of it all, is the helpless feeling my fiancee had, not being able to just get up and grab the phone to make it better. Please be careful who you purchase from, I would hate for anyone else to go thru this aggrevation!
The phone they are selling is not as per picture. It is a Verizon phone and I think this is misleading how the advertise this phone.
I am having serious problem with this phone, I bought the phone because I was travelling outside the Country,before I left I have to return the telephone to the seller,because my phone number is not reflected on the phone when I put my T-Mobile sim card in it. Also the same thing happened when I got to my destination. I could not load call card into this phone. Two problems either the phone was not properly unlocked or its suppose to work primarily with VERIZON SIM CARD.
Indeed!!!! There's a before and after!!!!! That's how diferent my life is now with my Blackberry Tour 9630, it fullfills my connectivity needs,It has bastly improved my response time to my clients and that's crucial in today's business world.
They really should make this clear and it's not written plainly on the phone.It's a Verizon unlocked!!!It seems to work OK though.
I love this phone. This phone works anywhere and is the most cost efficient way for me to have a cell phone. Thank you Tracphone and Motorola
The Wide Angle Fish Eye Jelly Lens is a fun attachment for your small cell phone camera or pocket video camera (i.e. Creative VADO or Flip Ultra). It does significantly increase the field of vision of the existing lens, but the distortion is also significant. This is a fairly fun effect for the first few minutes and it might let you get a reference shot that would otherwise be missed, but doesn't really lend itself to much day to day practical use.The lens is attached to your camera via a sticky ring and it can be put on and taken off very quickly without leaving any residue. It is useful to have the camera on and view the placement on the LCD to make sure the lens is properly placed and not obscuring the existing lens.This might not be for everyone but it is small and fairly inexpensive so I carry it with my small camera just in case I ever find a use for it.

I find this phone to have all needed in a cell phone with a lot of ease in use!
