Here is a warning about Toshiba's warranty.  You cannot count on them fixing anything under the warranty.  My connection between the AC adapter to the computer became faulty. They considered this issue due to customer abuse.  And their customer relations department is useless.  An HP computer had the exact same issue and it was repaired free of charge.  So buy any Toshiba computer with caution!
I got this computer as a gift approximately three years ago. I use this daily, essentially 7 days a week, and while it is not in the best condition any more it is still the workhorse for my job. It's light and very easy to carry. I get approximately 6 hours on the battery each day, and I'm still on the original battery.This is my 6th or 7th laptop in the last 15 years, so trust me when I tell you this is the toughest of all of them, and I've had one of about all the manufactors.  Because this was originally a program computer given to me I have not been sparing with the abuse I've given it, and it's taken it.  The laptop has lost its latch so it won't stay closed and the battery latch is partially broken so I have to watch to make sure I don't dislodge the battery. But despite this it still does its job three years later, and that's something none of the others could claim.Bottom line:  I never thought I'd get hooked on a tablet, but I have and I wouldn't nesitate to buy another thinkpad.
I have owned the Fujitsu 4220 for 3 years.  I also have a new Dell XT2 (long story, my IT department is on a Dell service contract, enough said).  The Fujitsu is awesome, I cannot recommend it more highly.  It is fast, bright and strong screen, has all the features (wifi, USB, PCMCIA, firewire) that you would need.  If you are looking at Fujitsu tablets and weighing the pros and cons of the 4220 and its progeny, I highly recommend you get a tablet like the 4220 with the swivel screen and built in keyboard.  You need the keyboard, and its completely hidden and out of the way when you swivel to tablet mode.  With the extra battery in the second bay, you can get up to nine hours which is great, but the Fujitsu batteries like all batteries lose charge capacity over months and years of use.  I rarely use the DVD drive and most often have the second battery inserted into the DVD bay.  This is a very tough computer, I have had to wrestle it from the hands of a theif and it hit parking lot pavement but is absolutely fine, I was very surprised the screen had no damage at all.  I bought 3 stylus thinking I would break or lose one, but the stylus are also very durable (compare to Dell) and the stylus slot right on the front of the screen makes the stylus hard to leave behind.  I would change only two things about the Fujitsu:  (1) it could be a bit more sleekly designed, its plastic case is tough and flexible which is a great benefit, but the titanium casings on some of the competitor products really look much better, (2) the chips run hot when I have a lot of processes working simultaneously, hotter than my Dell.  This causes the fan to run a lot, its variable speed and at highest speed you can hear it (not noisy, you just know its on), and when it is on your lap it can feel a bit hot (great in January but not so during other parts of the year).
the laptop was in decent condition however there was a large scratch on the screen and the batter was all but dead. I had to order a new battery a few days later.  However the computer works well and I am thoroughly enjoying having a tablet to work on my art during my long train ride to and from work.
You know, I have owned possibly the largest collection of tablet pcs in America. Every time any company releases another I am the first in line to buy it. I am extremely picky and after trying a whole slew of convertibles, I decided that the only tablet the I was going to use would be a slate. My main use of the tablet is note taking for college. Secondary uses would be web browsing and word processing.Pros:1) Amazing resolution! I actually upgraded to the newer models and was very dissapointed that they lowered the resolution on their tablets. I went back to the LE1700 primarily because of this reason.2) Extremely lightweight batteries. Spares can be easily carried around without adding much weight.3) With the SSD is runs like a modern laptop. Fast and efficient. A MAJOR upgrade from the built-in 4200rpm drive4) Lightweight5) Fingerprint reader, bluetooth6) PriceCons:1) None?Hope this helps!Mark
Before having problems with the laptop I absolutely loved it.  I consider myself one of the more fortunate owners of the tx1000 because my laptop lasted me 3 years to the day.  I guess that's quite rare.THE PROBLEM:The graphic chipset (Nvidia) overheated so much that the chipset came unsoldered from the motherboard - which is death for a laptop since the chipset cannot be removed and replaced.  The warranty had already expired, so there was nothing left to do except take a shot in the dark and try and heat the metal connectors of the chipset so they became reattached to the motherboard (there are youtube videos describing the procedure - not for the faint of heart).  It lasted a week, and came across the same problem.  Luckily this doesn't affect the hard drive, so all the information was safe.HP:Classless.  Okay, Nvidia gives you a faulty chipset and you install it into several different versions of your laptops - I'll be more merciful than anyone and overlook that, but at least have the respect for your customers to acknowledge the problem (which HP still refuses to do), and do something to keep your customers (which they wrongly assume will stick around).  I have HP stuff all over the house, but no more.  Their lack of class, honesty, and a sense of justice have been enough for me to begin looking elsewhere, and to steer people away from looking at HP products as well.I'll be selling my tx1210us for parts soon (except the hard drive), and that will bring the HP chapter to a sad close.
I experienced the same troubles with this computer as other people. First of all, this computer generates too much heat enough not to touch the back side of it. Second, WIFI went out about a year later. Third,monitor screen did malfunction a year and half later. Fourth, hard drive didn't spin. That crappy computer was finally dead when the motherboard burnt out. Total money I spent to fix the sequential problems was ~$200. I am neither spending money for it any more nor buying any product from HP now and forever. HP might earn money of $1200 from me with that crappy computer, but HP lost a costumer's confidence. HP lost buying potentials which would be more than $1200. Still HP is not admitting their fault. I abhor HP's business ethics.
I have owned this laptop for 2 years now and I have not been able to use it for more than two days in the past year. It seems that there is a defect in the design of this laptop and after awhile the overheating literally causes the motherboard to warp which causes a variety of problems in various laptops of this make. With mine, the screen goes blank as it fails to engage the hard drive. Some companies who specialize in the repair of this particular model place a copper shim (a penny) between the motherboard and ????? Well, some have claimed that this remedied the defect. I'm really happy for them. But for me, this will be the 4th attempt to get it right.If you're one of those unsuspecting owners of one of these puppies, you may want to contact PC Mania in MA. They are the ones who, for less than $100 (includes shipping both ways) guarantee they can fix it. They can be found on eBay as well. Hope this review has been helpful. Good luck and God's blessing.

This machine is the biggest waste money, It was always overheating, and even before the first year the computer completely locked up, and wouldn't turn on. I was thankfully under warranty at that time and got it fixed, after a while the wireless card stopped working, and I had to connect the laptop directly to router. In my second year my computer failed again and I wasn't so lucky with the warranty. I will never buy HP ever again, and in fact I have a beautiful Asus UL30Vt now... I might as well have burned the money I used to buy this piece of garbage from HP.
...even this horrible computer is not as bad as the HP Company itself.  I have had troubles with this computer from the very first week.  I bought it in Philadelphia and immediately took it to France where I live.  During the first month it would only turn on after 20 or 30 tries.  The tech center was little help and finally, after a month of phone calls, I got someone who walked me through a process that fixed the turn-on problem.  A month after it went out of warrenty my screen went black and only the lights came on.  I had to send it back to HP to have the motherboard replaced at a cost of over $400.  It is now a year later and the screen went black again.  HP wants me to pay another $400 dollars.  I have checked out the web to see if others have had this problem.  Everyone who owns one has.  HP will not admit it is a design fault.  They are scoundrels. POSSIBLE SOLUTION:  Several owners who have experienced the black screen problem turn their computers on over and over until they hear the hard drive spin.  Then they wrap their TX1000s in a towel and let it heat up/overheat for several hours.  Then, they unwrap it, turn it off and let it cool down for several hours.  Then, they turn it on and voila, it works again.  I just tried it.  My computer is working again, but never again will I buy an HP.
I have repaired these laptops before many times as they are a cheap piece of garbage they will break often.  The hard drives, wireless cards, and basically the rest of the hardware is worth about 200 dollars assembled.  I had the same issues expressed here with a hp touchsmart (flatlined in 5 months of purchase and every pavillion I have ever seen.  Avoid HP.
This has been the most difficult laptop experience that I have ever had. Initially I was impressed by the small size, light weight, high tech features and modern appearance. Also, it had all of the storage and word processing features that I needed. The computer operated well for a year. Shortly after the manufacturer's warranty ran out I encountered several problems. The first was that the nib to the ac adapter broke off in it's port. I had to purchase a replacement. This happened again. I believe it is the poor positioning and the thin gauge that attaches the adapter to the notebook that is creating this problem. Shortly after replacing the adapter for the 2nd time the screen started to malfunction. The screen would turn completely white but it would turn on only after removing the battery and the adapter. This problem eventually became more serious where the computer screen would be completely black when it was powered on. I contacted hp customer service and I was told that I could send it back to the factory to be fixed for the bargain price of $365.00! My computer is essentially a $1000 paper weight. I am so unhappy with this computer and I wish that hp would recall this computer.
It started out great!  I loved this computer for the first month, then the touchscreen stopped working correctly (the whole reason I bought this computer was the touchscreen).  HP customer service informed me that it was *supposed* to do what it was doing (it registered the stylus touching about a quarter inch away from where it actually was touching), that this was a *feature* of the computer.  It made the touchscreen completely useless.  I returned it TWICE and both times it came back with a new screen and the same problem. I gave up on it and decided it was just a real expensive basic laptop now.  Fast forward 1 year and my wireless stops working off and on.  Then stops completely.  Next it starts shutting itself off.  Then follows the whitescreen of death...Then nothing.  I have a very expensive paperweight now.  Google this problem before you buy this laptop...wish I did.  VERY common issue with the motherboard.  I won't buy another HP.  Their customer service sucks and they don't stand behind the product.  Going back to Dell (my Dell laptop lasted 8 years with NO servicing of any kind).As for the nifty fingerprint upgrade...that was annoying as hell.  Any time I moved my screen my finger would brush the fingerprint reader and it would start screaming about how I couldn't log in here or it couldn't read my fingerprint.  I ended up covering it with tape so it would leave me alone.The audio on this laptop is not what you would expect, pretty crappy.  Same with the built in camera.NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.
I have the same Issue. HP must become responsible. Its a waste of money, to have a tablet that last only a year!HP answer our calls-
I'm a college student who bought this because my main laptop is too heavy to carry to school and back.Pros:-Tiny. It feels almost weightless to carry, which is wonderful if you're toting lots of books around.-Touch screen is great for writing and note taking. I can write almost completely normally, and comfortably, for extended periods of time using a stylus. I do my homework on it and take written notes, rather than typed, during class.-Long battery life. Right now, with two batteries and a 91% charge with a balanced mode, I am told I will get 10 hrs and 43 minutes. I've never tested it, but the battery life is very good.-Voice activation: it's just that cool to be able to tell your computer to open a file instead of actually clicking. Takes some getting used to, thought.-Has video and audio recording. Excellent for recording meetings, class lectures, etc.-I like the interface. There are numerous ways to interact with the computer. Like I mentioned earlier, it has voice recognition software, you can write on it with a stylus, even right click with a stylus. There are scroll down buttons, zoom buttons, right and left mouse click buttons as well as the mouse itself (which you can left click with). It comes with an adapter for ethernet and LAN connection to a projector. There's also button to rotate the orientation of the screen if you want to write in portrait or landscape mode.-Runs quiet: Once I optimized it (see below) and when the fans aren't running, the computer is completely silent, which I like a lot.Cons:-Small screen: this is both a good thing and a bad thing. I picked this computer because it was smaller than other Fujitsus I had tried. The larger screens meant your hand rested on the screen and made writing difficult to impossible. With a small screen my fingers are long enough to write across it without touching the screen. I've also found that resting my hand on a book helps. But I did have to adjust some of the settings to make things bigger. I am 22 with 20-20 eyesight and I had to hunch over, zoom in, or crank up the font size on my web browser. 5.6 inches is definitely pushing the limits of human comfort.-Small keyboard: I can type on it. But I have relatively small hands. Even with smaller hands, the keyboard is tricky because things have been moved around for space's sake. I've had it for about ten days now and only now am I able to get up some speed when typing--like now for instance. It's doable, but if you have big hands or need to type a lot a larger model might be a better fit.-Stylus: the one that comes with the computer is too small to write with. I bought some styluses from Frys and they work great. I definitely recommend people get their own, thought, unless you don't mind your hand cramping like crazy.-Optimizing Vista: Vista is not the best operating system for this little computer and it took me several days to get the laptop running at an efficient speed. It will never run as fast as my $3000 Dell laptop, but it runs perfectly fine for note taking, email checking, homework writing, and net surfing. Don't expect to be able to play a lot of hardcore games.Recommendations:-Be really gentle with it, especially the swivel screen. It's tiny and can't withstand a lot of force.-I was happy I got the two batteries, they've served me well.-Read the users manual and the start up manual. I spent the first few days frustrated because I didn't read it, thinking I was above instruction manual. Some of the features were very new to me (like voice activation) and I needed the tutorials for that.In summary: I recommended it to all my college friends who need small computers to take notes on that are highly portable and touch screen. This computer was one of the few I found that really combined everything I wanted--touch screen, small, long battery life, records audio/visual. It's perfect for certain subgroups of computer owners like students. In retrospect, I think a 7inch screen would've been perfect, but c'est la vie. I love it and I take it with me everywhere.The only reason I gave it four stars was because of Vista, but once I switch the operating system to Linex or Windows 7 I think it'll be a definite 5.
I've owned a Tablet PC before, I used it to make a lot of artwork.I've been disappointed with my Fujitsu Lifebook since I got it.  I almost returned it the next day but thought "oh, I'll get used to it..." I was wrong.  After 6 months of "living with it," I think it is/was a complete waste of money.Pros:+nice battery life,+bright screen+the docking station (sold separately) is quick to release when PC is running.Cons:--major issue: want to use a 2nd monitor? good luck.  It will reset your extended desktop every 10 seconds... I had to hack around and disable a bunch of fujitsu software in order to get it to stop.  So now it only resets my desktop display every time I turn it on/wake it up. ug. :(--major issue: in Tablet mode, the screen does not rotate to all 4 directions (I'm talking display/software settings, not physical manipulation of the screen)  this PC only has 2 portrait and 1 landscape modes... the 1 landscape is the direction that involves all the plugs on the back of the machine facing TOWARD you... so if you have anything plugged in, it will jab you in the stomach while when you try to get comfortable on the couch, etc. (again, my old Toshiba had all 4 directions).--major issue: Left handed? the scroll bar sensor on the frame around the screen is exactly where you'd rest your left wrist.  Expect the screen to scroll around while your tying to do ANYTHING using the stylus. (and don't expect to find a checkbox to disable the scroll bar sensor ANYWHERE.)--minor: lifebook has 13" screen -->smaller than my last TabletPC (Toshiba, which was cheaper!)--annoying: it doesn't remember your display settings when removing and replace in the docking station (but I guess that's windows vista that's to blame, not fujistu?)--annoying: went using it like a normal laptop, there's a hot spot right under your left palm, so it gets really hot and sticky from something inside the pc heating up.If I could give you one piece of advice, one artist to another, don't buy this computer. (and I'm truly heartbroken that Toshiba discontinued the 14" tablet PC I used to have :(
In April of 2008 I purchased the predecessor to the TX2 ( the TX2000). A couple of months after the warranty expired, I began to have spontaneous reboots and video problems and finally it became unusable.I contacted the HP support desk, via their online chat, and after all trouble shooting was completed, I was informed that the machine would need to be sent in for repair, to the tune of $400. I now have an $1100 dollar brick on my desk.A bit of research found that there are thousands of people in the same boat, with HP laptops that have failed in the same manner. The problem is with the Nvidia graphic processing unit (GPU). It runs so hot that the solder connections between it and the main board fail. My GPU would run over 212 degrees F and the exhaust from the cooling fans was 157 degrees F.Although Nvidia notified HP of the failing GPUs sometime in the later part of 2007 or the early part of 2008, HP continued to sell the defective laptops. Their solution was to issue a BIOS update that ran the cooling fans all of the time, which served to increase the life of the GPU, until the computer was out of warranty.You may be thinking the $400 dollar repair is a fair price to fix the laptop, so what is this guy whining about? Well, they are doing the repairs with the exact same parts that failed in the first place, so the problem is occurring again, just a few months after the repair.In short, be sure to factor the cost of the longest extended warranty into the cost of the computer, because after the 1 year warranty expires you are on your own. HP is not going to stand behind their product, even if they know they are selling defective units.
I've had this computer for about a month now and it is great. It so great not having to use yout mouse for everything and it's fun being able to interact with the computer. People say there are all kinds of problems with this computer, but I have yet to find one. I can burn disks, watch videos, and write notes. There's even a special kind of word program and notepad that is on here. I would suggest this computer for people who can't type or have issues with their wrists. And it's also nice for college students so they can write and then automatically convert their notes to typed. IF YOU ARE A SERIOUS BUSINESS PERSON OR WANT THIS FOR GAMING, DO NOT GET IT!!! If any problems occur with this laptop I will write another review, but I doubt anything will happen.
I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.First the good sides:This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.The not so good sides:As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.As a laptop replacement:The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.
The main difference between this item, and the wi-fi only version, is of course the sim card with 3G.  So, before I talk about the iPad in general, I'd like to explain my take on the 3G.3G Performance:The BOTTOM LINE:  Works good as long as you aren't using it in a moving car.  I ran an internet speed test on it and in the metro area it was 1.2Mbps down and 210kbps up, which is decent.The DETAILS: If you are doing basic computing, you will be able to be anywhere within a 3G service area to enjoy the internet.  (If 3g service sucks in your area, don't buy an iPad 3g)  Here is the only problem: when you pass from tower to tower the signal can hang as the data has to be rerouted to the new tower.  Lets put this another way.  If you are using the iPad netflix app to stream "Kim Possible season 3" videos to your iPad while driving at 60 MPH it will "hang" during the 22 minute show.  In summary: The AT&T; 3G works the same as my 3G expresscard from Verizon.2G Performance: Yes, you can use your iPad on AT&T;'s 2G EDGE network as needed.  The data is slow.  You won't enjoy it.3G setup:3G setup is simple:- press settings button, choose cellular data, press set up cellular service.- put in your *iTunes* password.  (AT&T; is "invisible" except for a logo.)- put your credit card into the iPad- voila! you have service for 30 daysIts very slick and takes less than a minute.  Its how it should be.Avoiding the 3G data charges:  If you are an iPhone user, and you have an iPad, you can avoid paying for 2 data plans by swapping sim cards.  Of course, you might miss a few calls while your sim is in the iPad because the iPad doesn't support phone calls.  If you have an older iphone: Older iPhones use large SIM cards and the ipad uses small microSIM cards.  You would have to cut your large sim card down to the microsim size, and put it in your iPad (you will need a needle to pop it out).  You would need to buy a little adapter (sold on the internet) to make your small sim fit back into your iPhone (so, buy the adapter first!)  But this isn't a great long term solution, because, if you want to use the iPad as a GPS in the car you will not be able to use your phone quickly or easily until you switch them back out again.  Here it is on Amazon:  Microsim Adapter for Ipad Iphone4g Convert Micro Sim to Regular Sim AdapterDO YOU WANT THE 3G INTERNET?Despite my little princess being vexed at Kim Possible hanging, the answer is yes.  Certainly, its wonderful to have the 3G access.  Everything about the iPad works better because its a bigger screen, and being able to access the internet (almost) anywhere is very, very useful for me.Now, the question begs to be asked:  why the ipad at all?I have to say I originally joined the legion of pundits who said "hey, its just a big ipod touch" and "it won't replace my laptop".  Certainly, this has to be the two most common things you hear people say about the ipad, right?  And yes, that can be the truth you choose.iPad vs. Laptop: If your idea is to buy an iPad to replace your laptop, and get an external keyboard, and a docking station, and bla bla bla... then you will be disappointed.  This is a different kind of device, and you can't put a square peg in a round hole.  The iPad is for even more mobile computing than a laptop can provide.  ***A laptop needs a desk.  But the iPad doesn't.***  Thats the point, and if its not compelling for you, then consider carefully before buying an iPad.iPad vs. iPod Touch:  To say its just a big iPod touch is not really fair.  The processor is much more powerful, allowing you to do a LOT MORE.  You also get a big screen.  And the 3g with this version.  So to refuse to upgrade from the ipod Touch is similar to refusing to upgrade from a Kia Rio on the grounds that all other cars do the same thing.But the biggest reason the iPad+3G will work for you, is that after a few weeks with it, you will want learn how to make it work for you.  You will *enjoy* using it and it will be easier to use.  You will say "how can I change what I do so I can do it on the iPad" not "how can the iPad do exactly what I did before".For an example: here is a day with the iPad.I get up in the morning, and if I'm not being lazy, I get on the treadmill.  I prop the ipad up on the treadmill while I walk.  I watch some news video on the iPad, read some email, play a game, catch up on facebook.  I'm usually not done with this after my walk, so I head downstairs.  Its like carrying a magazine, its so easy.  I bump into my daughter in the hall and show her a picture from her Grandmother, with the iPad securely held in only one hand.  While I'm eating breakfast, and shaving, and brushing my teeth, I'm catching up on a book I was reading on my wife's Kindle: using the kindle ipad app.  Then I can use the iPad when I leave the house, in a myriad of ways that I would not use my iPod Touch or Laptop.  And the iPad fits in the pocket in my car door.  Its really never in the way!So far I have used the iPad to:1) Watch streaming netflix movies.2) Read books on iBooks and Kindle for iPad, both to myself and to my children.3) Browse the internet without constantly having to use finger motions similar to "pinch" and "peace" (goodbye iPhone!).4) My kids use it as an interactive coloring book at restaraunts.5) I can control my laptop when I am away from home if something crucial comes up, as if I'm sitting at my laptop.6) Move pictures from my digital camera to the iPad very quickly and easily (using the camera adapter, sold separately).  Either for storage or for emailing.7) Listen to Pandora internet radio anywhere in the house. (ok, I can't really listen to "Crystal Method thump thump boom boom music" but most other music sounds good)8) I have used the internet to teach my children things when we are away from the house (Daddy, where does the word "helicopter" come from?)9) Watched owned or rented iTunes movies on my 42 inch LCD TV (using an adapter sold separately).The point of the above is that the iPad gives me more FREEDOM when computing, due to its small footprint and light weight.What you can't do on an iPad:1) Multitask.  You don't really need all those windows open, but, we're all used to that.2) Print.3) Use the iPad to connect to a TV and give a presentation.  When you use the HDTV adapter, the iPad screen blacks out so you can only use this for movies.4) See macromedia Flash based content online.  (a lot of websites use this, like Hulu)Steve Jobs says 1 and 2 are coming, in fact, multitasking is on the new iPhone4 so it won't be long.#4 will probably never come.  If you need to use Flash websites, then, stick with our laptop.  End of story.Oh and the battery....  The battery is consistently lasting all day, 12 hours, without a recharge.  But, its important to note that MANY USB ports will not charge an iPad.  None of mine will.  Also, my cheap iPhone car charger will not charge my iPad.  There has been discussion about this lately, apparently the charger or USB port has to actually provide the correct rated power.  Most don't provide enough power.  But the battery lasts all day for me so this is not a negative.If the reasons above don't help you make up your mind, consider Steve Wozniak's recent comments about the iPad:  "Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing."  No viruses.  No compatibity issues.  No wondering why your iPad is so slow (Apple vets all software to make sure this doesn't happen).  No questionable upgrades.  No cryptic errors.  All these things were things that took the joy out of computing for a lot of people.The iPad is such a simple thing.  And thats why the average person will love it and prefer to use it instead of a computer.I'll upgrade this to 5 stars if/when:1) More powerful iPad apps come out2) Multitasking 2 things at once is possible (at least web browser and word processing, or pandora internet radio app + any other app would be nice)3) Some kind of printing would be cool, although, I'm ok with paperless, really...There you have it.
Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a "Kindle killer" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term "baby" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an "oleophobic" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13" or 15" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring "folders" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a "netbook killer" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or "Kindle killer" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app "iBooks" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite "iWork" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term "multi-touch". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called "Camera A" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the "Camera B" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time toWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of "apps for that". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)
Want the long and the short of it without having to read a "mega review"? Here goes. I have an original Kindle and a DX and I've had an iPad for one week. I love them all, but the iPad has won me over. Here's what I've experienced so far:VERSATILITY - Apps, movies, music, pictures, effective internet connectivity, color display, extremely intuitive GUI all combine to make iPad the hands down winner in this category.DISPLAY - E Ink is much better for reading, especially in bright light. And, the matte screen on the Kindle doesn't smudge as easily as the iPad screen. However, the iPad has a gorgeous color display and once you get accustomed to it, reading is not difficult. I especially like the backlit display at night when reading in bed ... I can read to my hearts content and not bother my sleeping wife. Slip on the headphones and my full iTunes library is available while I read. If you want a device only to read books, the Kindle wins. If you want color and a display that shows book diagrams and pictures clearly, the iPad wins.PAGE INTERFACE - I actually like turning pages on the Kindle much better than I do on the iPad. While the iPad has a cool page turning visual (it looks like the page is actually turning), the touch screen is far too sensitive and there is very little edge around the screen to hold on to. The result is that I'm constantly turning pages on the iPad when i don't want to. Kindle's buttons win this one hands down.CONVENIENCE - on the iPad, all my media is in one place (audio books, photos, music, books, internet, breaking news/weather, address book, email ... the list goes on.) The Kindle, while and excellent book reading device, still requires me to bring along an iPod or a laptop when I travel. iPad is the clear winner.PRICE - Kindle and the iPad simply aren't that far apart. If a hundred bucks is going to break the budget, stick with the Kindle because it is an excellent reader. If you can afford a little more, go with the iPad... it just is much more versatile. If the Kindle DX were a couple of hundred bucks less, it would be a great reading bargain.AVAILABLE BOOKS - hands down, Amazon slaughters Apple in just sheer volume of available titles. However, Apple's titles often include color pictures, diagrams, etc. that can actually be sized by the reader for easier viewing. Downside here is that Apple's titles are often higher priced. Winner here is Amazon/Kindle. However, there is an App available for the iPad that allows you to read Amazon Kindle media. It is still not a very elegant design, but it does allow you to read these titles easily and I'm sure the App will only improve with time.SEX APPEAL - ok, when the Kindle was first introduced, it was a hot item. I couldn't read it at the airport without being interrupted at least a few times by people asking what it was and waning to look at it. Same thing with the iPad, only it's exponentially hotter. With it's sleek design, excellent color display and tons of Apps, people just go nuts asking questions. In short, it just generates a lot of interest and this is proven by the fact that Apple has already sold over a million of these things during the first month of availability. This thing is addictive ... with the Kindle, I can read a book. With the iPad, I can do almost everything I could before on my laptop AND I can read a book.MY OPINION ONLY - sorry Amazon. You have a great product that pioneered the whole ebook market (others came before you, but you made it work.) Your Kindle is an excellent product, but given the iPad, your device is very much overpriced. Your library continues to be the standard by which all others are judged and I will continue to buy e-books from you, but I'll be reading them on an iPad. On that rare occasion where I'll be laying on a beach reading in direct sunlight, I'll pull out my Kindle because you have an edge there.I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. I the end, it's your money and your preference so my opinion really doesn't matter. I hope you enjoy whichever device you settle on.

 Length:: 9:40 MinsHopefully my video shows you most of everything you needed to know.If not, please feel free and ask. I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price. I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.
I have 2 iPads. A 64 GB WiFi only model which I bought the day it was available, and this 32GB 3G model which I picked up last week. They are about the same price; if you have to choose between an extra 32GB of storage and 3G capacity, definitely go with the 3G if for nothing else future proofing. I consider this to be the sweet spot of the 6 iPad variants.Right now, my wife is in China with a WiFi only model. She is not a technical person, and can rarely find an open WiFi hotspot. So, she goes days between checking her e-mail. E-mail which might be critical to her business. If she had a 3G model, I could have purchased a modestly priced data plan from Chinese Unicom, modified a data SIM to a micro-SIM, and she would be getting her e-mail every minute, and doing some light web browsing.  On the other hand, her iPad is loaded with media with over a dozen DVD quality films, all her music, and a large number of family photos. This does take advantage of the extra storage, but is a poor substitute for the whole Internet.3G is not quite the great deal as it was yesterday, AT&T; is eliminating unlimited data for new accounts. In the past, the deal was you could get unlimited data for $30/month with no contract. Now you can get a $25/month deal for 2GB, which is probably more than enough if you don't watch video.  Existing $30/month users might as well be on contract, because they will have to keep paying to get the original deal.  There are also cheaper smaller plans. Right now I'm on the unlimited plan, and it is great. I have been Skyping to my wife in China, using Google maps, browsing the web in the dentist office and at lunch. It is very slick. I tried the 250 MB/month plan and that was just too small for what I was doing.As for the rest of the iPad, it is great. I downloaded a free novel from the iBooks store and read it comfortably without any eyestrain or hurting my arm. It's my preferred device for browsing the web, although you do get to notice the lack of Flash. It's mostly ads though so that's fine, but occasionally there will be a graph or video which you just can't see. Over time, I expect this will be less of a problem as Flash dies out, but it is mildly annoying now.The glass does get awfully greasy, but that is easily wiped away. Typing is surprisingly OK, I can type about as fast as I normally can if I concentrate. My kids like watching YouTube every night, and that is slicker than going to the website. So, I find I use the iPad several hours a day, which means I can get 2 or 3 days out of a full battery charging, which is a relief compared to being worried about keeping my iPhone charged.This is indeed a game changing device, and I think most anyone will find there are hours of the day whether it be on the couch, bed or passenger's seat where it is nearly the ideal computing companion.
Just to set the stage correctly - I'm a multiple Microsoft MVP winner for the tablet PC platform.  I've been using tablets since their inception in the early 2000's and have used Windows since 1988.  I've been programming since 1981.  My level of knowledge is way, way up there.  And until last July, I never even considered a Mac product.  Everything I needed to do was available on Windows, most of the critical apps of mine weren't even available for the Mac OS.Last spring I purchased another car, and I've long had MP3 players, but never an Ipod.  This new car had direct plug access to the Ipods, and allowed all the metadata to display on the radio head unit, as well as full control via the steering wheel controls.  So I got an Ipod, my first Apple device.  For the heck of it I threw the little Apple sticker on my back window and watched everyone who knew me, employees and clients alike (I'm the director of an IT consulting firm), freak out when they saw the apple on my car.Then last July a friend of mine showed me his new Macbook pro, and what got me was the hardware, NOT the software.  The touchpad was just magical, and after trying it, there was no other input method to compare, and all the windows machines had nothing that felt like this glass surfaced beauty.  The backlit keyboard, the solid body (My last two Lenovo's had cracks in their shells just from grabbing one side and picking them up), the design of the hardware was just light years past anything ever done on a PC.  And with the new ones running on the intel processor, and able to directly run windows, not just virtually, it made sense for me to get one.  So I did.Then last November I replaced my 1 year old Media center PC with a new Dell Zino, and a month after that replaced THAT with a new Mac Mini.  So in about 5 months, I went from a Mac hater to someone who had an ipod, a macbook pro, and a Mac Mini.So when the iPad was announced, people weren't sure where I'd fall.  I was a longtime Mac hater, now a convert, but this "first ever tablet device" was hardly that, Microsoft has been doing tablets for a long time.  And my initial take was very, very negative.  Like most of the talking heads out there who didn't like it, I was wondering what possible use something that wasn't a real OS would be, something that can't multitask, and, for my tablet background, why on earth there's no support for pens.  For me, the best thing about tablets and slates has always been notetaking.  I loved MS Journal, and Onenote.  Not for *converting* the handwriting to text, but for persisting my notes IN handwriting.  I liked it.  Worked great.  And the form factor on this device would have been outstanding for such activity.But no joy, we all know how Jobs hates pens.  Don't know why, he thinks it's an "outdated" method of input or some such, yet he puts keyboards on everything, which, according to his type of thinking, should also by now be an outdated type of input...So I had no plans on getting one.  I have been waiting for more info on the HP Slate, which would run Windows 7, have multitasking ability, all the things I was used to on a slate.But I kept thinking about the battery life.  And the form factor.  I use a kindle daily, and this would be a great replacement for it since, while I liked the concept, both versions of the device I've had just still didn't do it for me.  My eyes don't get strained from conventional monitors and displays so it didn't benefit me at all to have the paper ink, but it WOULD benefit me to have a backlit device again for night time reading.  And since the iBook app supposedly would allow me to open other books I already had (I've been doing ebooks for years and years before the kindle was ever announced, reading them on my windows PDA phones and comptuers), there was potential here.But I kept going to the single use, non comptuer OS, limitations.But I also start to twitch when there's a new toy available.  So I started thinking about what I do with computers, both for work and at home, and realized that I didn't *NEED* a full windows 7 slate device with multitasking and everything, since I did not want a second "main" computer.  I keep EVERYTHING for both work and my entire personal life on my laptop, so getting the HP would then necessitate a lot of syncing of data between both the windows side of my macbook as well as the mac side.  Something I don't like dealing with.So I realized I didn't want a full computer.  I didn't need the ipad to replace anything, or take over any existing functionality of my computers.  I wanted it to take over my kindle, and maybe give me some fun drawing apps to play with my 6 year old in.  So I decided to give it a try.So two days ago I ran to the local brick and mortar, figuring they'd be sold out, but at least I could play with a demo unit and see what it was like, get myself past my preconceptions and all the BS flying on the blogosphere.  I picked one up, held it, and two store associates were playing with the one next to me.  I asked them how quickly they sold out - they told me they didn't, that Apple did a great job stocking them, and they had all versions still left.  I decided to not even play with the demo, but just take one home.  So I grabbed the 16GB version (knowing I didn't need it for an ipod and such, so 16GB would be sufficient) and went home.Unboxed quickly since there's nothing but the unit, USB cable, and power adapter.  Came fully charged, so I was up and running instantly.  Within about 15 minutes I had 70 free apps installed already and was moving through things like a pro.  And it dawned on me that even if i wanted that HP Windows 7 based slate, it would NEVER be this smooth.  That is one place where Apple just dominates - the UI.  And this one was great.  Everything worked intuitively, the apps were well designed, and I found my conversions of some of my ebooks to EPUB format installed just fine in Itunes, and showed up just beautifully in iBook.  So the reading experience became way better instantly than the kindle could be.  And with the kindle software available, I can already get the books I purchased there as well, so i had the best of both worlds.The drawing apps were a big hit for my 6 year old, who, like any kid, loves finger painting.Weather apps abound, my favorite so far is weatherbug (not a shock, theirs was my favorite gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well).  I've had storms here, heavy, severe, over the last few days, and my usual thing when dealing with storms at night, while I'm laying in bed reading my kindle, is to randomly get up, go into the great room, and check out the local weather satellites from a few local news stations, see what is still heading this way, how heavy, etc, maybe check mail again while I'm there, then go back and read some more, repeat a few times over an hour or two.  So this time, I just changed form iBook to Weatherbug, saw instantly the local radar, what was still on the way, then hopped into the browser, checked all my mail accounts (the built in Microsoft Exchange support is seamless and works great BTW), and enjoyed the browser, which works and looks just as well as my Safari does on the macbook pro.  So without having to leave my toasty bed, I was reading, checked three weather sites, three mail accounts, and was back reading, all flawlessly, no running around my house.The last part I tried finally last night was instant message, which for me is critical since all my employees use it to keep in touch with me, as do a couple friends.  With the push technology, all the "you can't do this and that at once" fell apart for me and was debunked.  I already had noted that my ipad, regardless of what I was doing or what app I had open, chimed i had a new mail on my works' exchange server before even my smart phone, or my computer directly connected to my exchange server.  And so went my experience with IM as well.  I loaded a client I've used in windows, then closed the IM program and opened iBook, and a buddy of mine sent me a message.  I got not just the notification, but a bubble with his text actually opened in front of ibook, and had a choice of switching over to reply or just close the text bubble and keep reading.  So that really rid me of all concerns about the lack of multitasking since that gives me exactly what I need - notification of an email or an IM while I'm doing something else.  This is all the computing power I needed on this.So I finally realized I didn't WANT another tablet PC, another full fledged computer.  I wanted something to fill a need between my phone's screen and my computer.  Something to replace my kindle, something for some neat games, playing and painting with my 6 year old, and simple/convenient IM and mail access when i'm just vegging at home and don't always want to pull my laptop on my lap to check something quick.The keyboard is actually far easier and better to use than I had expected, and much faster to type on than I hoped.  Not as nice, obviously, as a full screen one, but works surprisingly well.Screen is a delight - even hours of reading later it's still comfortable, bright, but it gets fingerprints easily despite some "non fingerprint coating" they tried to use to minimize it.  Still looks awful after a while at an angle when you look at it askew.  But not at all noticeable while staring at it straight and using it.Screen brightness is good, but it doesn't go down as far as I would've liked for ebook reading, but then I found iBook has a separate brightness control that lets me dim it to nearly nothing for use in the dark.  Outstanding.So then I started throwing some music and photos on it, and that's when I realized I can easily use this to show my grandmother pictures of her great grandson, since she's in her upper 80's and refuses to have a computer, so we can't email her or send her links or anything.  So I started playing with music and photos, and this thing became such a cool toy at that point.  I had to run back to the store and return it so I could buy the larger 32GB model since I knew by this time I was keeping it.  Fortunately I have a 45 day return period with no restocking fees at this place, so the upgrade was painless and free of cost.That's when I found out that itunes was automatically backing up my unit when it synced.  So when I plugged the new one in, the first thing it said was "restore?"  So i tried it.  It restored all my settings, including mail, so all I had to do was reenter passwords the first time, and I was back up and running after it resynced my apps again.  Those stayed in Itunes so I didn't have to redownload everything.Playing with pictures is pretty fun and very smooth, and the speaker on this thing is surprisingly full of bass.  There's even an equalizer for tweaking the sound output to your liking.  And the music keeps playing after you close the app so you can have the tunes playing while doing other things (but it will stop when you hit something else that takes over multimedia like a video or some other sound thing from an email of course).I grabbed the apple book-like cover and the dock, but you can't charge it in the dock while that cover is on.So I went from the initial "What a useless piece of junk" detractor to the "I wouldn't live without it" supporter.I gave them all sorts of grief for using the term "magical" to describe it, but I have to say, that it actually felt nearly magical that first hour doing things...  All my experience with the tablet PC and I wasn't ready to experience what this interface was like.And with this, i may finally be able to get my grandma to have something to keep at her condo so we can email her pictures and such...  This would make it a lot easier for her than trying to get her to use a full computer...So for a first revision, it's a grand slam out of the park hit.  Granted, it's just a big ipod touch or iphone or whatever, but for someone who never used either of those, and wanted something with a useful form factor, this is a BIG hit.
I got a WiFi, non-3G version, the cheapest one; I don't need GPS and don't want to pay AT&T; any more than I absolutely have to, and don't want another monthly subscription, either.  Got plenty of those, it seems.  And, at least for now, I don't need all that storage.I'm not what one would consider a "Power User" of the iPad.  I use a laptop constantly, and bought the iPad a couple of months ago because it is great looking and I was curious about it and I got a case of The Wants.  I've been involved with computers since the mid-60's when I first was employed as an IBM 360 (and 1401 before that) programmer, and I've continued messing with them pretty heavily ever since, though I changed careers in the early 70's.  Over the years, I've owned (in a small business) maybe 40 or 50 desktops and laptops, including several Apple IIe's way back when.  I've always liked Apple products, but not used them due to the overwhelming prominence of DOS and Windows products (both software and hardware) and the excellent pricing of IBM clones.But when the iPad came out, I couldn't help myself.  I now pick it up several times a day and use it.  I've taken it on trips without a laptop.  Here's what I think, mostly.Pros:1. It's cool.  No avoiding it, the little fella is great looking and has that Apple minimalist approach to design that they do so well.2. It's tiny.  Well, small, anyway.  That's good and maybe bad, but it does have its appeal.3. Screen resolution seems creamy, silky smooth.  Don't know how they did it, and don't really care.  It's good.4. I love Apple's approach to WiFi....  Walking into a new place, without even the slightest thought from  you, the iPad finds an open connection and asks if you want to connect to it.  If you say yes, you never hear from it again.  Done.  If the proper connection needs a WPA code or such, it simply asks for it.  No fuss.  (It seems like Windows, which I use for hours every day and have since it came out, has never really felt comfortable with wireless networking).5. No keyboard.  Well, face it, most of the time you don't use one, anyway.  Not having it is OK.  No mouse, either, for that matter.  Good.6. Scrolling is a dream.  Fabulous.  Effortless.  Scrolling, something that simple, is probably the single thing this little unit does best.  You have to try it to understand it.7. One of my apps (I don't have many) is a flight simulator similar to MS Flight Simulator.... X-Plane.  It allows pilots to practice instrument flying, so I got it.  VERY cool.  No joystick foolishness.  You must rotate the iPad itself like you would a yoke and the airplane turns or climbs or descends, or whatever.  Way easier than Windows products to do the same thing.8. Pilot friends who use other apps for charts and such love it, so I would guess that all graphics applications work pretty well on the little system, though I haven't tried.  Oh, yeah, Google Maps and Earth and such look great, too.  Apple always has done graphics well, so no real surprise.9. Ditto for video.10. Battery life is great.  Days on end at my level of usage.11. My Blackberry has a cute feature (maybe everyone has it, now):  When typing an email address or URL, when one presses the space bar, the OS converts it to a @ or a period, whichever is appropriate.  The iPad takes that to another level....  There is a ".com" key that enters that when pressed.  A small thing, but more helpful than one might think on a device where typing ain't as easy as using an IBM keyboard.Cons:1.  It's hard to hold and easy to drop.  Needs a shell or something to protect it; that makes it as big as a netbook or small laptop, anyway.2. Can't keep several "windows" open at the same time to switch back and forth.  Not a horrible issue, because you can get back to a previous window relatively easily, but sometimes you'd like to have both open at the same time or be able to switch with a single click.  If there's a way to do that I haven't found it.3. Hotmail and Gmail don't work like they do on a laptop.  Or on a Blackberry Storm2, for that matter.  I don't know the issue, but I can't seem to find a way to send a new email (though it's easy enough to reply).  I'm sure there is some app or setting to fix it, but I really don't want to be troubled with that.  I just want it to work.  Like the way WiFi does.  (Since I wrote this, I actually went into the email setup and set it up; it works, but I would prefer to use Hotmail and Gmail as pure web based apps rather than something more akin to a cell phone feature, which, of course, it is).4. You can't print from it. I've read that there is a wireless printing feature in the next OS.  Waiting to see.5. When working with it in your lap, either in a chair or a recliner or bed, a laptop is just more well suited for the job.  The iPad has to be held up, and, the screen is lower, so you are craning your neck more.  I don't use a stand to put it in.  Things like that and the case to put it in detract from the advantage of small size, so you might as well use a small laptop which will make you happier in the long run for this sort of thing.6. No keyboard.  And don't tell me they make a keyboard for it.  If I have to buy that, I might as well get a laptop.  Typing on the screen is a trip.  If you use the virtual keyboard holding the iPad in the "landscape" position the keyboard is large, and a little awkward to span the keys with your thumb.  So, you end  up turning the iPad up to the "portrait" position where the keyboard is better suited to thumb-typing.  I haven't tried typing in the traditional way ("touch typing")....  I just reach for the laptop.  I'm using my Lenovo to type this review.7. OK, here we go....  No Flash.  Now, I don't have a dog in this fight, but I don't understand this.  Every now and then (pretty often, actually) some video will come up and the iPad will tell me that it doesn't do Flash. (Happens frequently on sports and news sites). I never even knew what Flash was before this issue came up.  Well, Apple wants me to go to iTunes to download their app that will let you view Flash files.  OK, y'all, why didn't you just put it in the iPad from the get-go?  I just want it to work.  Yesterday, I wanted to watch a video of a Tropical Storm in the Caribbean, so I clicked on the link to go get Apple's app.  Then I had to cycle through a few pages on iTunes.  Heck with it.  I just used the laptop (which has a larger screen, anyway).  There's a saying: "People don't want quarter inch drills, they want quarter inch holes. "So, what's the upshot?I like it.  I'd buy it again.  No, I wouldn't wait for the Android competitors to come out.  Well, I am curious about those and might get one of them, too, just to check it out.  But, the WiFi-only iPad is a nice, polite little computer.I do want to say this, and it's one of those potentially inflammatory things, but I don't mean it like that....  It's more of a toy than a tool.  If I am really in need getting things done....  Spreadsheets, presentations, documents, etc, it's really hard to beat the tried and true Windows laptops that are available everywhere and are dirt cheap and fit in with the way things are done and the formats that are used throughout the business community.So, sure I use it.  This morning (a Sunday) I've been using it....  looking at airplanes for sale (daydreaming) and checking out a few football forums and generally surfing the web.  So, if this review seems a bit too negative, that's not really intended.  I like it.That said, a would-be buyer needs to understand what it is that he is getting, and what that is, is something of a media machine that requires you conform to Apple's way of doing things, a very good little web surfboard and a pretty neat little toy.
I've had an iPad since the first day they were available. It's taken it's place in the household as the preferred way to browse the web, watch bedtime videos with the kids, and play games. Just yesterday, my four year old son sat around the device with his friend playing Plants vs. Zombies HD and it was as easy, natural and comfortable as if they were playing tic tac toe instead of an elaborate tower defense game. It would not have been possible for two four year olds to share a game like that with the mechanics of mousing in the way on a desktop computer or on the cramped screen of an iPhone.[Update: iPad Camera Connection Kit: I received my iPad Camera Connection Kit recently and that works well, quickly and slickly. It comes as two parts: an SD reader module and a USB port module. The idea being that you can either take the SD card out of your camera or you can connect the camera directly depending on the module. Pop it together and photos and movies are imported into the Camera Roll, and are viewable if the iPad can handle the format, so JPEG images off the SD card from my Lumix can be displayed, as can RAW images imported over USB from my Nikon D-3000. All RAW formats are not viewable, but they should be transferable. I was not able to use a 3rd party SD reader with the USB port as it "used too much power." The USB connector also allows a 3rd party audio device, so you can get digital optical stereo (not surround) out of your iPad instead of the normal dock connectors analog line out. Mass storage devices are apparently not supported.]In my opinion, the iPad delivers an unmatched content delivery capability. The browsing experience alone is worth the price of admission, but it does so many other activities so well and with such beauty and an organic interaction between user and content that just scratches the surface of what can be done.This is not a general purpose computer. I am not going to write much source code on it or transcode video or those other activities my laptop and desktop computers do so well. And while text entry is markedly better than on an iPhone, I would not look forward to writing anything longer than this review on its keyboard, although with each sentence of experience I achieve that gets less true. No, what this is is a viewing computer without peer.You have not browsed the web until you do it with the firm swipes of mobile Safari. I know people have fixated on the lack of Flash and Flash advertising, games and video. And maybe for some people that is a big loss. For me, the only loss is the occasional home improvement show on Hulu, and it seems likely there will be an app for that just as there are ones for Netflix, ABC, Youtube, etc, while sites like CBS put some, but not all,  content into DRM free HTML 5 video. What you lose in Flash you more then make up for in the amazing speed of browsing and how natural it all seems.  (Having said this, the first time I asked my wife to try answering her e-mail on the device, the first message was to a Flash greeting card.)The speed of the device is amazing for a low power portable device. Maybe it's the Apple custom A4 processor, or maybe it's the limitation of having so few processes, or the optimization of the OS for GPU acceleration, but the iPad is liquid fast at nearly everything.Video playback is fast. Photo browsing is fast. Mail is fast. The calendar is fast. Large games like Plants Versus Zombies HD launch in a fraction of the time they do on an iPhone. You get the idea.Third party developers have stepped up to the plate and delivered both beauty and added functionality. The Kindle app is smooth and imported all my Kindle account books quickly--it's good that there will be competition in the iPad eBook market between Apple's own iBooks store and Amazon't Kindle. The Weather HD app is stunning as it embroiders the mundane delivery of a weather report. Wolfram Alpha is big and well laid out and more powerful than ever.As for the hardware, I am really liking this screen. It is bright, colorful and sharp with an amazing viewing angle. It does get a little smudged which is noticeable when watching movies but its oleo-phobic screen cleans with a quick wipe.. Its wide viewing angle is a great improvement on my MacBook's screen which would be unreadably dark at the angle I'm typing this. Some people think the iPad is surprisingly heavy, while someone else was surprised how light it was (the same person also expressed remorse at having bought a Nook after about 8 seconds of playing with my iPad).Be careful with charging this. It likely won't work with your current iPhone  car charger. My wife's car charger started to burn trying to handle the extra amperage this device demands. Best to only use this with either your computer's USB ports or the charger it came with. And charging time is slow via a computer, from full empty it takes 7 minutes until reboot, and around 40 minutes per 10% charge (so you are looking at over 6 hours for a full charge from fully drained). The wall adapter is about twice as fast. Regardless, be prepared to make over night charging part of your daily routine, although you will get several days of moderate use between charges given the amazing 10+ hours of activity you get from a full charge. A decade of laptop use has not prepared me for how long you can use this to do everything. It seemingly doesn't matter what you are doing, you still get 10 hours. Or more.It goes without saying that you do not want to charge this device from your laptop's battery like you might do to your iPhone on a lengthy plane trip.As for the decision to buy the 64 GB model, I think it comes down to perceived usage. I plan to fill it with quality feature length movies for when my wife travels to China. At about 1.5GB per movie (720x480 h.264)--or more if you have 720p content--16GB seemed a little tight while still loading multiple gigabytes of photos and music. 32 GB would probably be sufficient, and it's going to seem insane in a couple years spending so much for 32 GB of flash memory.If you get a chance to play with one, try to find a comfy chair where you can put your feet up and make a platform for the device. This will negate the problem of holding its heft and allow you to build up your full speed typing skills. Realize there are all sorts of tricks you will learn and that after an hour you will be a master. Lock the iPad into landscape mode using the hardware toggle switch. I find I never have a need to use portrait mode unless a piece of software makes use of a separate portrait mode. Explore. There are so many little delightful touches to discover like the lock screen photo frame mode, the dictionary in the book reader, tapping on the status bar to go to the top of a web page, etc.This is a moving target. Every time Apple releases a new version of the OS or a 3rd party developer gets a bright idea, the device will get better. For instance, Apple has announced iPhone OS 4 which addresses many major complaints people have and adds features we didn't know we needed. This fall, you will be able to keep Pandora and Skype running the background while you are playing a game or browsing the web or whatever; this will make these apps vastly more useable. You will be able to organize your apps in folders. Better organize your e-mail. And look forward to smaller developers coming out with more social network games.If I were to point out one misfeature it is how badly the 2x mode for legacy iPhone apps looks. It just seems as though Apple could have put more effort in making non-bitmap GUI elements look sharp instead of just stretching all the pixels. You would think they could at least have made text and the built in keyboard look better.I don't like the Apple branded optional case, so I would try before buying the case. It just gets in the way making it hard to access the external controls, and should only be necessary in a scratch prone environment. I am thinking about going with a Gelaskin protective skin instead.In summary, I am a big fan of this device for a wide variety of activities be it web browsing, game playing, enjoying media, reading email (less so composing email), and reading books. I highly recommend picking one up if you have the means, although I would wait a few weeks until they are back in stock at the normal retail prices or even until the 3G version comes out.
From the first announcement of this device, I was prepared to dislike the iPad, on paper it has way too many flaws. With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone.Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate.Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device.Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view.Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size.Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected.The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right.I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device.I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen.Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading.Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books.But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach).And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons.
I have been using iPad for 10 days and decided to walk away. It is a nice tablet device that I primarily was planning to use as:  - ebook reader while using public transportation  - showing movies to kids during vacation trips  - using as picture hub on vacations to store/review/sort photos  - browser (one that I can use on the sofa)  - generic computer for vacations and travel (way lighter than notebook)  - viewing and occasionally answering email at home when primary iMac is occupied.Usually Apple devices are aesthetically pleasant to work with. iPad is not an exception, unless you are outside. The device is great for reading at home in controlled light (though a bit harder on the eyes comparing to e-ink readers), but outside (on a train/bus) it has serios glare and reflections on the screen even without direct sunlight. It felt annoying. I guess after months of use one gets used to it, but in a few days I haven't started enjoying reading with it. I wonder if matte screen would have done better.As far as watching movies, its mono speaker lacks power. I guess I'm not a typical user here as I got two kids, so headphones aren't an option. Getting its speakers up to the iMac level would be excellent. I realize that it's hard to fit on a way smaller device, but a little bit better speakers would actually let two persons watch movie together. Again, glare and reflection of yourself on dark scenes are guaranteed in pretty much every lighting condition. Some people don't bother about it; some people do, so see for yourself.Having SD port would be great to transfer photos from my camera. I don't really want to mess with extra cords here.Overall, it's been a pity to see device coming short of expectations.  I'll wait for 2nd version, and would love to see better screen, better speakers and SD port there. And a camera would let me Skype. I don't care much about flash or multi-tasking.Apple, please, do something about the glare/reflections. These "great" glossy screens aren't that great for some of us, I do have mirror at home already. That stands for both iPad and iMac. Old white iMacs had way better matte screens than current glossy ones. Having matte as an option would be excellent.
Life is too full of gadgets, unify where you can. Add an iPad 3G to your life and you can toss the eBook readers, GPS units, and probably an old laptop or two. It's great in the house as an e-mail machine in the kitchen, and it's better in the car, where we might otherwise be arguing about directions. It fits very neatly into basically any portfolio or briefcase.The games aren't bad either.One warning -- these devices are now readily available from Apple for $829 with free shipping. Beware 3rd party sellers on Amazon who are asking much more than that.
I love almost everything Apple, but the iPad just isn't there yet, primarily because it doesn't replace anything with better functionality -- not a netbook, not a Kindle, not an iPhone.  Yes, the display is absolutely gorgeous with its intense colors and sharp graphics.  Yes, it is sleek and easy to slip into a briefcase.  Yes, video and photos cannot look any better on a portable device.  But . . . .The iPad is dependent in part on apps that you can purchase in the iTunes store; however, many of those apps are either incompatible with the iPad (showing up on the tablet in iPhone screen size) or cost money.  There just aren't many free iPad apps the way there are with the iPhone.  The apps that do exist, whether for a price or free, just don't add much to the iPad's functionality.While the touchscreen keyboard is much easier to use than that of its cousin the iPhone (because of its larger size), it's not built for typing more than a few quick emails or notes.  Plus, if you use Word on your main computer, you can't install it on the iPad the way you can on a netbook.  You're stuck with Apple's note program or a separate productivity app purchased from the App Store.  As far I can tell, the only way to share notes is to email them.  You cannot edit an existing document.As an e-reader, it doesn't compare to the more portable, more book-like, lighter-weight Kindle 2, except in the case of books that have color photos and/or animated graphics.  It may compete well with the larger Kindle DX, although I don't have one of those to compare.  To download books, you have to be on a wireless network, unlike the Kindle, which uses free Whispernet for downloads. (Note: the iPad with 3G can download anywhere if you pay for monthly 3G service.) When I read on the iPad, it feels more like a computer than a book; the Kindle feels more like a book.The iPad does not have a camera, either still or video.  It does have a microphone for voice memos.  Its speakers are much better than those of the iPhone 4; you can start up the iPod and put the iPad on a table to listen while you do other things.  Still, I have a computer and separate iPod players in the areas of the house; music coming through real speakers sounds so much better.  I do like that I can play music while using other apps, just the way I can on all versions of the iPhone.  Its the only example of multitasking on the iPad.I'm leaving this iPad for my husband to use.  I'll get another when Apple releases a version that has a camera and FaceTime; when it can share and edit files; when more (useful) free apps are available; when it allows multiple open window/apps the way the Mac OS does -- in short, when it successfully replaces one or more of my other devices.The iPad has tremendous potential that isn't yet realized, but it is a fun toy to play around with.  As to whether you should purchase this wireless version or the 3G, consider how you would use this and whether you want to pay for 3G service.  You can tether your later model iPhone; however, that's an additional fee from ATT as well.  I recommend the iPad for tech geeks who have to own the newest toys -- and as toys go, this is great.  For the rest of you, hold off for a generation or two until Apple begins to fully utilize the power of this slender tablet.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I bought an the wi-fi version of the IPAD. It continually disconnected from my wireless network, repeatedly asking for my passward. I have an IPOD touch and an Apple G4 laptop computer, and neither disconnects from my network.  I spent hours on the phone with apple tech support, but they could not fix it.  I returned it and now they are charging me a $50 restocking fee, even thought their product is defective. I am a prior customer and they still are charging the fee. I will no longer be buying any Apple products. I would advise everyone to beware of buying the IPAD, and also beware of Apple.  They are making lots of money and still cannot be fair
Addendum Dec. 13th 2010...Comments on new IOS operating sys. for IPadThe Big Three improvements:1.) Multitasking...you can't do split screens BUT you can close one operation (or several if you wish), open another and then go back to the original(s) and open it/them to the same page you were working on.  VERY convenient!2.) Folders...great to organize different categories of apps and will allow you to reduce IPad screen clutter of the huge number of apps that most of us will collect over time.3.) Mobile-me. This is now a FREE feature of IPad with the new Operating System...use to be a paid yearly subscription ($99/year). With this you can find your lost IPad on your home PC or Mac, and once Mobile-me is alerted, your IPad will beep in about 15-20 minutes. It will even allow you to REMOTELY WIPE YOUR IPAD MEMORY, so sensitive info can be deleted, if needed!There are several other 'improvements', most of which don't concern me as much as the 3 mentioned above.My original review...Some thoughts after having used my Ipad 64 for about 1 month.Some (but by no mean all) of the things I appreciate:1.) the large, high resolution, touch screen on an extremely thin idevice.2.) the CONVENIENCE...all because of the portability and the ability to connect ANYWHERE to the internet, locally with WiFi or globally with G3. Allowing me to travel and yet do all the things I'd normally do at home. i.e. check e-mail, pay bills and surf.3a.) the Itunes set-up...making it easy with an Itunes account to buy apps, music, videos, books, movies etc.3b.) the Itunes set-up...making it easy to copy, back-up and sync your Ipad with your computer at home...for example, allowing you the make copies of everything you buy from Itunes and even books etc. you may buy from Ibooks or Kindle...this means that if you've finished your book or don't need an App any more, you can delete it from your IPad, but it's still available to you on your computer if you should need to reinstall it again to your IPad.  You can also copy all bookmarks from your pc/mac to the IPad Safari browser as well as e-mail addresses from your computer to your IPad (even if you use a hotmail account).4.) the ease with which I was able to sync my Apple wireless Keyboard via the bluetooth available on the IPad...done in less than 1 minute.5.) the ability to adjust the font size (so you won't even need your reading glasses) and brightness when reading books, ESPECIALLY the option of 'white on black' screen for night-time reading (never realized how comfortable on the eyes this would make reading in a darkened area)6.) Google maps...just incredible with G3 service...Be prepared to say good-bye to your GPS if your IPad has G3.Lost?...Touch the 'current location' button at the top of your Google map App, and you get a satellite map of where you are, with your exact location marked with a red pin.Want directions from point 'A' to point 'B'...just type in your destinations.Want a restaurant, library, hospital etc. in the area your in, just type your request in the 'search' window and you'll find your inquiries marked with red pins on your map.And it gets better...say you asked for restaurants in an area, touching any individual red pin you got in the reply to your search gives you the name, address, phone No. and (if available) e-mail address plus directions to get there from your current location. AND it allows you to save this information (if you want) in your list of contacts, with a simple touch of the screen.7.) Audio...although the built-in speaker is mono, the headphone jack gives exceptional quality stereo sound.8.) About 10 hours of battery time on a full charge.9.) The ability to expand the size of anything your reading by simply spreading apart two fingers while touching the screen.What's missing:1.) no USB Port...maybe not as important as I'd initially thought, what with bluetooth available...may mean some additional purchase for such things as a wireless  mouse, keyboard, printer etc.2.) no multitasking...The one MAJOR shortcoming of the IPad...you can't open a split screen to work on, and as everyone who has used a computer is aware, this is a very useful, time-saving feature. But you know, with all that this unit offers in the way of quality and convenience, I can live with this one deficiency.Conclusion:More useful...more an indispensable part of my life than I'd ever have believed possible.The large screen along with its thin profile makes it the ideal traveling idevice.Because of no multitasking...4 3/4 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.1.) I purchased the 64 Gb edition of Ipad because I figured that Apps would fill it quickly...well this may eventually happen, but with nearly 3 screens of Apps, so far I've used less than 2 Gb of space2.) This product may be lower priced at other locales.
Before buying my iPad, I spent about an hour in the Apple store playing with it.  I knew I'd get some real use from it, and I knew that it met many of my wants for an ultraportable computer, but the tiny underpowered thing costs almost as much as a macbook!Obviously, I laid down my credit card and walked out of the store with it.  The store is near my office but three hours from my home.  I must admit, I had regrets in the three hour drive home.  A $900 10" iPod touch?  Am I nuts?After owning and using it for two weeks, I no longer regret the purchase as much, but I still feel that it is overpriced.  My model is the 64GB with 3G+Wifi.  I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on "HD" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.I have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a "gamer" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the "magical" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other "killer app."  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called "Atomic Web."  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it.  The "acase" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes.
When I first wanted the iPad everyone I knew said the same thing, "Isn't it really just a bigger iPhone?"  Well, no but, at the same time, yes.  That was perfect for me.  Each time I used my iPhone I thought, "I wish this was bigger so I could do more."  Much like any time that I used my Kindle and would think, "If only the web interface was better and this was in color.  If only it was faster."  The iPad filled all of those needs.My Kindle was sold on eBay with in days of the iPad's arrival.  My laptop suddenly spent days sitting idle and untouched as my iPad took its place as my primary mode of web browsing.  Magazine subscriptions were halted as I waited patiently for iPad versions.  I could not be happier with publications like Vanity Fair and the New Yorker.I did buy a case and the Bluetooth keyboard for the iPad.  I found that these items added to the functionality and enabled me to get even more from the iPad.  I chose the option with 3G because, so often, when I had my Kindle and iPhone out in the world, I took advantage of the Internet access.  I did not want to have to rely on the existence of free or pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi.Here's a quick run-down of my impressions and how I rate each user experience.+ Web browsing - 5 starsIt is wonderful to be able to sit back and read a long article without craning my neck to look at the monitor.  The only downside is that I now spend a lot more time browsing the web than my pre-iPad self did.+Reading eBooks - 5 starsI have owned a Kindle and a Sony Reader.  While I understand the benefits of e-ink, I have to say that they are a bit overstated.  Yes, it is nice not to consume so little power and not have to deal with a back-lit screen to some extent.  However, unlike my laptop or computer monitor, the iPad screen does not bother my eyes even after prolonged periods of reading.  Also, it is terrific to be free from an external lighting source on airplanes or in bed.  With the e-ink devices, I often felt that the glare from any of the booklights I tried was distracting and difficult on my eyes.  I do not have that problem with the iPad.  All of my Kindle books are just as enjoyable on the Kindle for iPad app.  It's easy to use and the highlighting and dictionary features are even more useful without having to use the clumsy interface to navigate the Kindle screen.+Outdoor use - 3 starsThe screen is much tougher to see outdoors.  It's almost unusable in many cases.  Since I wear polarized sunglasses, I have to turn the screen to horizontally to even see it.  If I have them on and have the screen in portrait mode, it is totally black.  This is not a big problem for me since I don't really take an eBooks to the beach and rarely find myself in full sunlight wishing I could search the web.  It is fine in even slight shade so sidewalk cafes are still an option.+Business use - 5 starsThe calendar and contacts on the iPad are much more useful to me than those on the iPhone.  Having a larger screen makes the calendar feature much easier to use if you are navigating a day full of appointments.  I was awestruck when I first opened it after years of trying to get by with a Blackberry or an iPhone.  I also downloaded an app that allows me to store and read PDFs.  This was inexpensive and made keeping track of everything from whitepapers to meeting notes much easier.  I am anti-paper and this device really allowed me to put away all of my paper notebooks and avoid printing for weeks at a time.  I also have two mind map applications that are excellent for brainstorming and developing the top-level outline for a new project.+Movies (Netflix) - 5 starsThe clarity is amazing - even when I am on the 3G network.  I've also downloaded videos from the iTunes store and they are just as perfect.  If it was possible to give it 500 stars, I might be so inclined.
The first time I saw the iPad was when it was announced with much fanfare and I was instantly smitten.  I've never been an Apple person and have stayed away from their products like crazy, but this thing really stuck in my mind.  Once it was released I went to the Apple store and played with it, like so many other people, and I walked away still liking it.  I figured I would play with it and walk away thinking that it wasn't worth the money or didn't work the way I wanted it to.  I was wrong.  I found myself looking up reviews just about everyday seeing what other people thought about it and finally happened to be in a store when they had some in stock and I took the plunge.  Was I nervous?  Yes.  Was I afraid that it would just be a toy and that was it?  Yes.  Was I scared about the price?  Yes.  However, I typically feel that way before any large electronics purchase.What I have found in the month I've owned my iPad is that I carry it with me all over the house.  If I'm reading something on the internet and need to go in the other room....I take my iPad.  A lot of people have been bashing the iPad without every really using one and I can honestly say that it has changed how I consume entertainment.  It's not a replacement for a laptop or netbook, though it certainly could replace a lot of things that you use them for, but it is its own "thing".  When it really clicked for me was about a week ago.  It was a lazy Saturday afternoon and I was home by myself.  I was using the Netflix app to catch up on a show that I had missed a few episodes of and I started out watching it on the couch.  Soon I carried my iPad into the kitchen with me to make lunch.  Then went outside and sat on the deck.  I even took it into the bathroom with me....never having to stop watching the show.  The iPad haters out there would say that they could do the same thing with their laptop, but the iPad battery is so great that it gave me true freedom to move about the house without worrying about wires, batteries or anything else.  This is the true value of the iPad to me.  I can consume entertainment/information anywhere in the house instead of having to stay in one place.  Before I would either go to the office or sit on the couch to browse the internet with the laptop.  That way I had a power cord nearby.  With a 10 hour battery, I don't worry about that anymore.Now, will it replace my need for a laptop?  No.  There are things I still need to do that will require more storage or programs that cannot be done on the iPad.  However, I'm okay with that.  If you are someone that spends a lot of time on your computer looking up things on the internet or watching movies or just wasting time.  You will be amazed at the freedom you feel with the iPad.
This is from the point of view of someone who already owns a Kindle E-book reader, a Sony PSP handheld video game device, an Ipod Classic, an Ipod Touch, an Ipod Nano, a Blackberry Storm cellphone and an HP mini Netbook.  I have all of the toys anyone out there wants, but I had to make a decision whether to pay a hefty price tag for the Ipad, something that does a lot of what those other devices can do.I chose to buy the Ipad for this reason...it is the best "all in one" device out there on the market.  Unless I want to carry around all the other stuff, it is a better idea to carry just the Ipad and my cellphone instead.  With my netbook, I had to have somewhere to plug it in, with only two hours of battery life, it just was not  easy to start it up and keep it going.  The Ipad has a 10 hour battery life (that is no exaggeration), and it is much quicker to start up than a netbook or laptop.  Instead of carrying around the Sony PSP, I can download fun games onto the Ipad and kill time that way.  Instead of carrying around the Kindle, I can load my E-books on the Ipad and read them on there.  This is a device that you can play games on, type a document, surf the internet, read a book, watch videos and play music ALL ON ONE DEVICE.  That is why I made the purchase. I purchased the 64GB wifi model.While the Ipad is no expert at doing any one thing, it does them all to satisfaction (or better).  If you are a person who just wants a device to read books, this is not for you.  You might as well just buy the Kindle.  If you are just looking to type on this, it is not the device for you, you are better off with a netbook or laptop.  But if you are looking for an all-in-one device that is easy to start up, and has a long battery life, no cords hanging around to be plugged into a wall,...this is it.The only thing the Ipad does not do, is snap pictures and make phone calls.  With just my Ipad and my cellphone, I can do it all...play video games, play music, play videos, read books, view photos, surf the internet, snap pictures (my phone) and more...  I don't usually have a wifi connection in my area, but I have a portable hotspot anyway ($45/month through Clear...unlimited bandwidth), and I have the internet on my cellphone, so that's not a big deal to me, but it may be to you.  If you are relying on the internet a lot, a wifi only device is not the thing for you.  Wifi is not accessible in some areas.  You aren't ever sure you will be able to connect.  But, they now make a 3G model Ipad, where you can subscribe to a monthly service ($15/month I think) for internet access anytime,and almost anywhere (limited bandwidth though).  Again, I have internet on my cellphone, so it was not a big deal to me.  If you are relying on heavy internet usage with the device, this is not great, just good in that area, because it will cost you.When you see the Ipad, you appreciate the light weight, the beautuful screen, ease of use, super fast start-up, long battery life and how many things you can do with it.  I prefer to also have the other devices too, so that when I want something that is an expert in any one area, I can still use it.  But, if you want to conserve space in your bag when you travel, and you want to keep it simple...you have all you need.  I recommend the Ipad with a screen protector such as invisishield, and the apple carrying case.
You are either going to pick this up and love it, or pick it up and wonder what the heck it is.For me this is a great product. If you have an iphone or an ipod touch you know how to use it, it really is just bigger. Although it's faster and easier to use because the keyboard is larger and there is more screen area to use for applications. i bought the Wifi model initially and loved it. I put my movies, music, games, RSS readers on it and never looked back. The iPad truly is a great device. I imagine that there may be other brand coming out but in today's marketplace the iPad is the best portable computer I have seen.Some people say that it has flaws, I have only run into one website that I frequently use that didn't work, and that was CNN. All other sites I visit have changed their video formats over to html5 or other ipad friendly formats. Flash not running on here is really not a big deal for my applications.This makes a fantastic book reader as well. I've actually read more in the last few weeks with this then I had in the last few years. It makes reading so accessible because no matter where you are if you have a few minutes you can pull up a book, read a chapter and then move on without having to carry a book around.This is a fantastic product, I can't say enough about it. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because it's a bit heavy, and that's the only reason. But if you consider the battery life in my experience has easily been 10-14 hours without a charge you realize that's why it's heavy. It is so nice being able to have a computer that you can literally use all day and still not be able to exhaust the battery.Great product.

I now have been using my iPad for two days. It has gone through a full day workout with my kids (who are enthralled by it) and a full day of work as an itinerant professional in the public schools, using apps that I had purchased for my iPod Touch and using the Netflix app. It has been used as a remote desktop for work; a note taking device; a book reader; a word processing device; and a music player. The only thing it has not yet been used for is games. Movies look impressive on Netflix. As a remote desktop, it runs fairly zippy on a local network, but a tad slow over the Internet. All of my iPod Touch apps run fast, although half of them look somewhat granular in 2X mode. Pages runs really well and opens all of my templates. Someone had commented that it messes up formatting when transferring between files, although this has not been the case with me. Regarding weight, it is lighter than I thought. I can easily whip it out of my carrying case and jot a quick note in the hall. The wifi reception rivals my MacBook. I have yet to drain the battery to check battery life. Overall, it has performed impressively. The only negative thing right now is the fingerprints when the iPad is off. It can look  really dirty and I find myself cleaning it often.
I've had mine for about 6-months now and I honestly can't imagine not having it. I have all the latest gadgets as soon as they come out but actually waited on the iPad a bit since I really thought it was just a big iPod Touch. Well... it kinda is but it's not. It is basically the same software but modified for the much larger screen and much higher resolution. This really is a big deal and changes the way you use it. If you think you're just getting a big iPod Touch, you're right -- but not really and once you use it for a few days you'll completely understand what I mean. It's really amazing how quickly you get used to it, instant on is a given now days, but the 10-hour plus battery life is a bigger benefit than you might realize. The system is very responsive and there is a ton (that's an understatement) of apps available. Sorry to the Android crowd but you really don't want to use the iPad, it will make you feel very very insecure -- at least until Google gets a tablet version of Android out.Right now there isn't anything better in this form factor than the iPad. If you're looking to get a tablet don't get caught up in stats, they mean nothing if the software isn't good -- and right now only the iPad has software that was built from the ground up to work with it and that advantage is huge. Out of the non-critical computer / gadget related items in my house, I use this by far the most. In fact I sold my basically brand new Mac Book Pro 13 shortly after bying the iPad once I realized I completely stopped using the Mac Book. The iPad doesn't do what the Mac Book could do, but it does what it's made to do amazingly well.
Sorry guys but after reading review after review of people bashing the iPad and having never actually owned or used one I had to write this. First off would I be considered a "Apple Fanboy"? Well I guess if you consider the definition of the term I will say yes and I guess proud to be one. But I am going to give you the good the bad and the ugly without bashing the product.The Good:1. This is a tablet device that is easy to carry when you don't need the full power of a PC/Mac.2. The instant I saw this I Knew in that it had it uses in my field of work. I am a electronics tech contractor for the military and I work on equipment on trucks all day outside. If I tried to use a netbook( Which I have tried) to do the task of inventory and maintenance tracking while in the field the netbook would be trash in no time. This said the iPad isnt indestructible. If you use it like I do outside in a field environment buy the Defender series case from OtterBox, It is super tough and has a hard cover for the screen when its not being used.3. The apps are dirt cheap for the thing. I paid 9bucks for Apple Numbers (Spreadsheet app similar to Excel). That is way cheap for a functional spreadsheet app.4. I can use this for entertainment while traveling, which I do a ton of, without having to drag my laptop out of a bag and finding a place where the dust isn't going to gum up my keyboard.The Bad:1. If you want a full fledged laptop this isn't it. It is a complementary device to the laptop.2. In order to take full advantage of the iPad you need a laptop or desktop to sync it with. You don't have to have it but your not going to be getting many movies or much music on it otherwise.3. People will bash you for using the Apple brand of devices...but only because they are jealous or ignorant. Not because they actually use them and know their strengths and weaknesses. There is a misconception that if you use it your a tree hugging yuppy or something...which I am not.4. More cords and adapters to carry if you already lug a laptop around.5. They are not cheap.The Ugly:1. As soon as you decide to buy the iPad, know that next year Apple will come out with a better  and fancier product. They update products on a yearly cycle.2. Along with #1 that also means that when the newer iPad comes out that there will be functions you wont have and cant get without dropping more cash for a new one. You can only upgrade the software not the hardware.3. For those of you that like Flash games like Farmville, your SOL, the iPad does not support flash. Sorry.Thats my short OPINION on the iPad. My closing thought are this, if you are looking for a simple device to get on the internet and do light duty work while away from the desktop/laptop then it MIGHT be for you. Also if you like diving off in folders and exploring the guts of the operating system then I suggest looking elsewhere. Apple makes products that a non tech savvy person can pick up and fell comfortable using. Heck even my wife, who hates computers, would kill me over her iPhone. Lastly if your not sure whether it is right for you, find someone that has one, go to a Apple store give it a spin and do some research online into whether it has what your looking for. I give it 5stars because it works for me. Later.
OK - so not ANYTHING - but the iPad had enabled me to get so much done when I am on the go.  I understand why people might say it is a glorified iphone, but let me tell you - the screen size is critical and all of the cool apps that are available have opened up a whole world of, well, everything. Some of the most helpful things:- Internet access on the go (Yes - GET 3G if you you are going to get this!!). I can cull email, order something I need to buy online, look up information I need (addresses, phone numbers, directions), and just read something interesting on a nice, readable screen.- Entertainment for my kids on the go. There are lots of cool apps for kids and it has saved me from some really otherwise difficult situations with active boys (doctor's waiting room for 45 minutes...). They have read-along books and lots of educational options, so its not just brain candy stuff, either.- There is a kindle app, so it can do everything a kindle book reader can. I LOVE being able to read a book on my iPad and highlight it digitally.- It is small enough that I can carry it around the house with me from room to room and use the notepad feature to make notes of things that would otherwise end up on scraps of paper littered around the house.It has greatly enhanced my quality of life and now that I am accustomed to a computer I can carry in my purse, I cannot imagine not having one. If mine broke, I would replace it - right away.
My dad recently bought one of these, so had a chance to use it for a few days before he took it. My impressions of it are mostly positive; my two main gripes about it are these:1. On my Android phone, if I buy an app from the marketplace, I have 24 hours to try it out and decide whether I like it. As far as I can tell, there's no such feature on the iPad. So if you buy something and it really sucks, oh well. There's no trial period or anything for these apps. I don't recall this being mentioned in any of the reviews I read, but I think this is pretty important. I guess reviewers think anybody who's interested in an iPad already has an iPhone, so this would've been common knowledge to that audience.2. iTunes is just a huge PITA. I downloaded and installed a fresh copy of iTunes on my PC, hooked the iPad up via USB, and it promptly deleted all the books and apps I had on the iPad without so much as a warning. After that, when I set up iTunes on my dad's PC, it complained that the iPad could only sync with one iTunes library (presumably because I had already synced it on mine), and wanted to erase everything that was on the iPad. At least it warned me this time, but if you plan to sync the iPad with two different computers, you're going to have to jump through some hoops.Overall, it seems to be a very scaled down Android device, but that's ok, since this thing isn't really targeted at people who would ever know the difference anyway. Plus, there's a better selection of apps here. I probably would've bought one myself if I could find a way around not having to use iTunes to get content from the PC to the iPad. I did some searching to see if you could jailbreak it and just drag and drop stuff onto it without using iTunes, but no such luck.As far as my dad is concerned, he's not a complete computer novice, but not exactly highly skilled either, and he really likes the iPad. I installed the MLB At Bat program, and he can stream the audio from baseball games right on the device while browsing the web. I told him he could watch the games with an MLB.TV subscription, but he likes listening to them more. *shrugs*For those claiming it's just a big iPod Touch, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The size of the iPad makes it hard to carry around, but I can assure you... having a screen that's 3x bigger is a huge plus if you play with an iPod Touch (or similar device) a lot while on your couch :)And those of you who are dissing the iPad because it doesn't have USB/HDMI ports, a camera, or multitasking capabilities are really missing the point. In about 15-20 minutes, I was able to sit down with my dad and show him just about everything there is to know about this device, and now he can download and install his own apps and do whatever else, and he can do it while kicked back in his recliner. And I don't have to worry about him getting viruses and malware, and the ease of use of the iPad is certainly going to cut down on my support calls :) So I guess you could say that him having one of these benefits both of us. It has a much less steeper learning curve than a netbook, and there's little-to-know security risks involved.
First off: no, it isn't a portable computer replacement. If you expect it to be, you'll only be disappointed. Nor is it just an oversized PDA despite claims to the contrary. Instead, it's a robust adjunct to your main computer. It allows me to take most of my web browsing, game playing, email reading, etc. away from my desk. In large part, whether the iPad suits your needs will depend on whether you can find apps for it that suit your needs. So far there's a wide array of apps, so I haven't found this to be much of a problem--but again, it'll depend on your needs.It's true that there are some things you just can't do on an iPad, like view Flash content on websites. I do find this occasionally annoying, but honestly, I just hope it convinces more websites to stop using so much Flash content. I've always found that it bogs down my machine and causes more problems than it fixes.In contrast, I've found that the apps on my iPad load and run super-fast. They're streamlined to have a small footprint, and it shows. They load so fast that load screen tips in games often flash past before I can read them. They also take up a surprisingly small amount of memory; I'm amazed at how slowly I'm using up my 16G!The on-screen keyboard is actually pretty good, and suits normal finger size much better than that on the tinier iPhone screen, but it still isn't meant for extended typing. I'm also addicted to the touch-screen interface. It feels so natural that I find myself trying to use my laptop as though it had one.Since I do a lot of reading and reviewing, and I absolutely hate the other e-readers I've played with (the screen flash when turning pages would drive me batty before I finished a single book), the iPad's value as an e-reader was important to me. In this, it truly shines. You can download the Barnes & Noble reader and the Kindle reader for free. GoodReader makes a fantastic pdf reader (just import pdfs from the app tab when synching with your computer). iBooks, however, blew me away. As a book geek, I really like the experience of reading a book rather than a computer file. And iBooks looks the most like a book.I'm truly amazed by the screen quality, the speed of everything, the variety of apps available, and the utility of the iPad as an e-reader. I can use it near-constantly for heavy-use things like gameplay and the charge lasts me a good 24 hours.
Like many people here and everywhere, I was absolutely apprehensive about the iPad(or the giant iPod Touch as iPad haters like to call it). But after spending a few days with this device, I can tell you for sure that this is the way a large screen touch input based device should have been done.The Things that i love about the iPad1) The Keyboard is just awesome . Very easy to type even when using one hand.2) iBooks - Simply fantastic , Hopefully, the catalog will expand massively. I prefer this to the kindle when I am indoors because everything in an iBook is in colour.3) iWorks - Fantastic even though you cannot export to Powerpoint or Excel formats. Only Word is supported. Even the lack of "Track Changes" option did not  bother me much.4) Good Battery life5) The ability to import Photos on the go.6) Availability of Netflix App7) You can actually do things efficiently using just an iPad and a internet source.8) Safari for the iPad is a very efficient browser. Obviously, it does not support flash, but then that is price adobe paid for some crime they committed some time back.9) Most of the apps that work on an iTouch/iPhone works on the iPad.10) Does not heat up much after heavy usage.Things that are not available in the iPad when they should have been1) Finder for the iPad2) Network Explorer( so you can drag and drop docs from your other laptops/desktops into your ipad without using iTunes) - I have tonnes of pdf articles/books and other docs in my home server and would have loved to have this functionality)3) Print functionality ( Though this depends on HP , Canon and their ilk)4) bluetooth mouse connectivity5) ability to transfer data (music/files) using the camera connector kit accessory) from a USB drive or SD card drive.6) A Nice Photo Editor( Apple developed).7) I really did not feel the absence of multi tasking, but then I can appreciate controlled multitasking wherein I have control over what apps are allowed to run in the background.Things that are annoying1) iPad is smudge heaven - you dont notice those smudges when it is on, but the moment you press the sleep button/lock screen button , you can see hundreds of smudges.2) The screen is too glossy - I presonally prefer Matte, but we dont have that option anymore.3) Reading in broad daylight when the sun is right over your head is annoying4) Absence of a Finder/Windows Explorer kinda applicationOverall, I feel that there is no show stopper here and that the iPad is actually a good device for the average male/female and for anyone who is not into anything too technical.P.S , I have a verizon mifi and my iPad tethers to the mifi device. I have not experienced any network related issues so far. It seems sturdy and reliable.
I was a skeptic about the iPad, but after playing around with one at the Apple Store, I decided to give it a shot.  Like the iPod, I have used it more than I thought and I especially love it for traveling.  It's important for me to be able to get online when needed.With more and more applications being web-based, I'd found that I have just about all I need right out of the box.  A few additions, like a password management program I found via iTunes, and I was good to go.Typing is easier than I expected.  It's good for a quick trip, where I just have to check email or bank account stuff.  That's mostly what I use this for.  If you are a hardcore computer person, your results may vary.Things I like about it:- not having to pack a huge laptop when I travel- reading books and newspapers- the simple, ipod-like games are a nice diversion- being able to stay connected while living my life away from the computer
The iPad is revolutionary.  Sure, it's not the first tablet out there, but this year all anyone can talk about is a tablet, what's better, why to get an iPad, why not to get an iPad... I'm not sure when all the Apple hatred started, for me it was a lifelong obsession.  I grew up on DOS, moved to windows 3.11... I hated apple on principle.  I had an epiphany one night as I struggled to use my windows laptop and finally discovered that all those great things a windows based pc can do... I never use! So I switched to apple. My iMac replaced my unrelisble desktop.  My iPhone then replaced my irritating blackberry.  Then my iPod nano replaced my buggy zine (and iTunes replaced the ever changing nightmarish zine software - seriously, the original version was perfection MS, but alas). I had but one problem, my laptop.  I didn't want to do the full on laptop thing, since apple laptops have one of the same problem as all other laptops... Battery life.  For me, my laptop comes out when I travel, or want to window shop in the living room, but otherwise it gets put away in favor of my far superior desktop.  What I wanted was a laptop that I can pick up and go with.  Here is the iPad.  Me and a few friends got iPads, and now we have them all the time.  None of us ever carried around a laptop with us unless we were traveling.  Now, we have them at all times.The question for many is: can it replace my laptop.  The real question should be, can your laptop replace your iPad? I see far more iPad wielding corporate soldiers in the coffee shops now days, snickering at the laptop relic holder that runs in to plug his laptop in, not sure if he put it on sleep or power save mode before he left the house.  No, my iPad can't do more.  It can't play world of Warcraft or command and conquer.  But do you leave the house to do those things... No? Then why do you want your iPad to do it? Sure the iPad has games, but unless your a card game addict, it's only there to keep you busy for about a half hour while you can't do much else. Otherwise, I challenge you to find something I can't do.  Don't bring up flash, it was a sore issue at first, but since I found out either the anti iPad people are lying to me about the need for flash, or I just get lucky, I have found 1, yeah that's right 1 site that I don't get to play with, and it was just doing a search for a homework assignment and I found the site to be bogus on my desktop... Oh well.  HTML 5 is here and it's kicking butt. Flash has been on the edge for almost 4 years as devs looked for better ways to do Internet... And the iPad has ushered the revolution.  To think that this little device changed the Internet...I have complaints.  The first is that I am addicted to this thing.  It goes everywhere with me from the garage (how to vids) to the bathroom (why not watch a little Netflix or YouTube while I... Er... Download).  The second is that it is missing some things. It needs that camera on there.  IPad video chatting should be a next big step.  I want an sd slot for this thing, rather than be forced to shell out extra money for the bigger drive. The last thing I want is a screen lock switch.  It is funny to look at a photo and turn the photo to a different angle to look at something , only to have the screen adjust back to how it was in the first place.The best things... Simplicity, durability, longevity.  This is what makes it so much better than a laptop.  Simplicity makes it lessaggravating than a standard computer. You would be surprised at the durability of this thing (my 5 and 6 year olds play games on it all the time).  But the most significant factor is the longevity.  The advertised 10 hours is a lie.  I have not charged mine in two days, and I use nearly every waking hour.  Movies, airplay, dictation, games, everything... It's at 33% right now.  As a consumer I would have never even thought about an iPad if my laptop could go on batteries this long, I could have dealt with the frustration and blue screens all day long if I had power.  The iPad lasts forever. That is the number one selling point to me.  You will be surprised to see how much you can do if you don't have to plug in all the time.All this being said, if you can afford it... Get it, if you can't, sorry.From my iPad
I bought my iPad about 2 months after they came out and I had a chance to see it operate at the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA.  Surprisingly after having bad experiences with other palm type devices and the Kindle, I found I liked it.For a "Window to the Internet" which is the main use I found for it, it works fairly well.  A major problem with the iPad, and a major problem with all computers and the Internet, the WWW, is the display size.  Many web pages are not designed with any kind of logic or order about the screen.  For example, I find the blogs I read to be just slightly too wide to adjust comfortably on my iPad screen so that I do not have to scroll horizontally.  Horizontal scrolling for each line is what needs to be avoided.  It is possible to read things on the iPad just fine, but not if they are in a window that is too wide for the text size.  Ideally a newspaper column width where the text can be expanded and vertically scrolled is really idea.My favorite App so far is the Kindle reader for iPad.  Conspicuously missing the text-to-speech facility on a real Kindle, it is a visual only reader.  I do not like that there is no way to number the pages, but the Kindle experience is much better on an iPad than it is on the Kindle. I always say that I would more often want to read in the dark with a back lit screen that I would on a beach in the bright sunlight with monochrome e-paper.  The Apple reader I can do without.  I suspect that Apple and Amazon may partner to change the face of publishing, Apple in H/W and Amazon in distribtuion and content management.Which brings me to the frightful mess, but getting slightly better, that is iTunes.  The iTunes interface is ... well, honestly, terrible.  If you go to the ITunes store it is so slow and impossible to negotiate that they think only when someone really needs to buy something and knows what they want would they use it.  I buy audiobooks from the Apple store that are not available anywhere else, but I hate the experience, and the reviews and customer feedback is not helpful at all.My main App for fun is the online Backgammon game which I really enjoy being a backgammon fanatic.  The finger taps often seem to misregister ... I don't know if that is the problem of the iPad hardware or the program, but it has provided a lot of entertainment and brain stimulation.In general though the Apps are terrible and underwhelming, and following the trail of ITunes the App store is awful.  There are so many apps and so little or none useful feedback on what is good and so much disinformation that I just do not get anything that is not free.  I need a audio recorder App, but there are so many and the ones I have tried are clumsy and irritating.There is hardly anything to just take notes with.The email client is not that great and has the same problems as the Apple desktop OS version.All the Apps are so stripped down there seems to be no good help for any of them and most try to be too cool or cute.  I just want a simple interface to jot down some notes sometimes, or to record audio at a meeting or in some situation that I want to remind myself of something.Despite all the drawbacks, I believe the iPad is going to succeed despite itself.  What is lacks in some aspects can be made up for in multiple ways.  For example people complained about the lack of Flash, which I don't care about, but then ABC and other websites have some up with their own Apps to watch video on.  I watched episodes of "Lost" on the iPad and it is fantastic.  I am disappointed that Hulu.Com wants to charge a subscription for their content,but I guess they have to compete with NetFlicks.The Skype application works too, so you can use the iPad as a telephone, clumsy as it may feel.  I do not have the 4G3G ... whatever G is the one that is sold optionally with the iPad, and do not miss it.  The object was to get something fast, versatile, relatively cheap and easy with no recurring costs ... and for that I love the iPad.I carry around about 180 audio books that I have ripped myself as well as some music and stuff I bought from the iTunes store despite it's faults.  All in all this thing is a great tool for many things.  I recommend the Ipad to people who invetsigate it and find they can use it.  Don't buy it just to be cool, it really is a tool, and as such it can be very very useful, and will be more so in the future if Apple can get some of the faults out of it.The one thing that sticks with me is the impression one gets of Apple when one enters the Apple world.  I have an iMac, iPod and an iPad now.  I never bought Apple before about a year ago, but I like the UNIX OS underlying, and the ergononomics and ease of use.  My 24" screen iMac is just a joy to use.  My iPad complements that along with the Ipod ... BUT, Apple makes some some bad design choices and they refuse, maybe out of arrogance to fix them or do anything about them.  This is my on worry about the future of the iPad ... bad management decisions can kill a product dead even if it is a great innovative idea.Oh ... then there is battery life.  In all the months I have owned the iPad so far I have only once or twice gotten the battery down to about 40%.  For me, I find there is no danger of running out of juice and the battery life is really great.  After using the iPad most of the day one day I fell asleep listening to an audiobook and woke up in the morning and the thing was still going.One other thing that makes the iPad so wonderful is that companies and groups are making use of it too, as I mentioned above with ABC.  NPR has a fantastic app that lets you run through all the news in the last few days ... or weeks ... and then add the audio stories to a playlist.  Then you can set the thing going and create your own content for hours.  When companies perfect this webcasting thing like NPR this will be the way of the future, and a device like the iPad will the way to access it.I do wish the iPad had a camera in it, GPS would be nice too.  A better mail client also.  Multitasking is supposed to be on the way later this year, although I find it is not really a problem the way it is.  Bugs are fixed fast, and there are improvements as well ... so all in all I have to give the iPad a 4/5 ... which I mean to be close to the 5 than the 4 ... this is a really innovative product for those that can use it.
When the iPad was unveiled in January I initially felt very underwhelmed. The famed Apple Tablet, seemingly under production for a decade and now finally revealed, felt like a letdown: it ran the iPhone OS rather than Mac OS, it lacked sufficient hard drive space, and the on-screen icons were too small.Nonetheless, my curiosity remained at launch day, and I began to take a more serious interest based both on user reviews and my own personal needs. Trying the device out further solidified my interest, and this past weekend I reserved one and picked up my 32GB, Wi-Fi only model 24 hours later.The iPad fits my needs pefectly. I wanted a simple, consumption-oriented device that would allow me to watch my iTunes content, surf the internet, and would have access to applications that would further enhance it. The device would serve to supplement, but not replace, my laptop, would allow for instant access to the aforementioned features, and would be used daily. The iPad does all that for me and much more.Here are a few of my favorite features.Video looks superb; I've uploaded movies, TV shows, and video podcasts to my iPad, and each plays in high quality and without any hiccups. I particularly like the interface Apple selected for the video application, as the cover art for movies and TV shows is displayed in vibrant color; the video description feature, appearing to the left of the cover art, is a nice touch as well.While watching video on the iPad I'm left only with a thin screen to hold, which elicits a much more comfortable viewing experience with less mass to deal with. Though I've only watched a few videos, I much prefer it to watching video on my laptop. Audio, too, is great, both without headphones (mono) and with (stereo).Safari, the iPad's internet browser, is what really sold me on the device during my first hands-on. It's been said before, but viewing an entire web page at once, without the need to zoom in and out, is incredible. Both text and pictures look sharp, and pages render quickly thanks to Apple's custom processor. The "Bookmark Bar," a feature that can be toggled on and off in Settings, appears underneath the address bar and is a feature not available on the iPhone due to screen size limitations. I've found this to be really useful, and have added all of my bookmarks to it which allows for quick access to my favorite sites.Like the iPhone, however, page refreshes have become a nuisance when switching between tabs. I've grown used to it through browsing on my iPhone, however with such a large device I'd hoped it would be less of an issue. It's not significant enough to detract from the overall browsing experience for me, but it is something to be aware of for those who like to have multiple pages open at a time.Lastly, apps. The App Store has become a huge selling point for Apple, and it's hard to ignore the numbers Apple proudly boasts in its ads. I've uploaded both iPhone and iPad apps to the iPad, and both types play great. However, the difference in quality between the two is staggering, and I'm left reluctant to upload any more iPhone apps to the iPad. While the scaled quality of an iPhone app isn't as bad as some may lead you to believe, it's difficult to choose an iPhone app over an HD iPad app after experiencing both.Unfortunately, iPad app developers capitalize on this fact and subsequently charge many times more for iPad apps. While the price difference may be worth it to some, for others the lesser quality iPhone app will likely suffice.To conclude, the iPad won't be for everyone. The steep price can be difficult to justify for those who may not have a well-defined place in his or her life for a tablet device. Further, those hoping to get more features out of the iPad than the device offers may be disappointed in its functionality.  For anyone considering the iPad, defining when and how to use it can help to decide if it's the right purchase to make. You'll likely still need your laptop, but the iPad right now is the best complement device there is.Pros- Fantastic video quality and interface- Second-to-none internet browsing experience- The look and feel of the device- Photos in the Photo app look more than impressive- Snappiness with the accelerometer, opening apps, and other functions- Simple interface backed by easy set-up/maitenanceCons- iPad App Store pricing and selection- Hard drive space should be greater- Page refreshes in Safari- Price
Im just loving the iPad. It eliminated me having to carry my laptop with me everywhere i went. Lightweight and fast! I opted for the 3G which is a feature that i couldn't do without. The ability to be online anywhere i go (almost everywhere i go) makes it easier for me to keep up with emails from work and up to date with the news while im on the train. I would recommend buying a nice case for this. I got one from apple for $50 and it was well worth it. Avoids scratches and gives you a better feel when handling the unit. 16g is plenty for the average user based on research i did online. The 32g and 64g are more the for people that need to download big files and a ton of songs and movies. A good tip would be try not to have all your emails directly on your ipad. Instead try to use a website that links you to your emails. This will avoid you taking up memory with emails saved on your ipad. I have added Skype to my ipad and im able to even make phone calls now. Just wish this came with a camera!! Im sure that will be out in 3 months and i'll just HAVE to buy that too!
When I started trying cases in the seventies and into the eighties, I would take yellow legal pads to trial. By the end of the trial they would be full of rather cryptic notes for jury selection, opening statement, witnesses, and closing argument. By the nineties, I was a computer-savvy guy who sometimes rented a laptop for big trials, but usually relied a never ending supply of legal pads.By the millennium, I had a PC tablet on which I could load electronic copies of the files and depositions, and take notes during trial. I could actually walk about about the courtroom with it just like it was a very heavy legal pad. After I switched my office's computers from PCs to Macs. I would still bring it to trials. Then my tablet died (as most Windows machines are want to do) and I was back stuck at the lectern with my MacBook Pro. When I wanted to wander the courtroom while examining witnesses, I had to use my trusty old legal pad. Like many Mac enthusiasts I prayed for the day Apple would offer a tablet.For me that day came on April 27, when my 64GB WiFi+3G iPad was delivered. Since then I bring it to court in lieu of my laptop. Unlike my old Tablet PC, 3G gives me constant and immediate Internet access. And that is the principal reason to opt for the 3G over the WiFi only iPad. Many courthouses do not have hotspots. If you don't need Internet wherever you are, then the other model may be enough.As to storage, more memory  is better. You are going to want to load, movies, music and photos on it. 32GB is not enough. Given the marginal increments in costs of doubling the memory 64GB, the present maximum will seem tiny as the iPad evolves over the years. If you get it now, you may be able to postpone upgrading a year from now.The iPad, like the iPhone is basically a Swiss Army knife, and like the Swiss knife it is infinitely customizable. As a Mac user I am comfortable with iWork, Apples Office Suite. Consisting of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote each applications for the iPad, they all read Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and export them. You will want to buy them. Other critical work apps include Evernote, iAnnotatate PDF, PaperDesk, Penultimate, Dropbox and GoodReader. I track my expenses on the go with an iPhone app JetSet. On the fun side I read books using Kindle for iPad, which I prefer to Apples's iBook.On the negative side, at the moment the iPad lacks multi-taking, and has no camera. That will change. But waiting for those additions is no excuse not to get an iPad today.My iPad is a tool not a toy, I keep telling myself. And as a courtroom tool, it is small and light just like a yellow legal pad.  But when I stroll about with my iPad, I can't help having a big smile on my face.
A few years ago I read an interesting article by the developer of the Palm Pilot.  He described how he walked around the office with a block of wood to help him imagine what it would be like to carry and use a working PDA.  We have all walked around with a legal pad or something like it.  I think the Apple designers did this, too.  But with a little more awareness than most of us have.  The iPad is the result of this awareness.  I wangled mine at the beginning of this Christmas week and have had a few days to carry it around.  Here's what I think:The main advantages from my point of view: - Screen size.  As big as a piece of paper--not cramped like my iPhone screen. - Weight.  Just like a legal pad with a cover.  Maybe just a little heavier. - Keyboard.  Big enough to type with two hands.  Two fingers, in my case, but still... - Apps.  All iPhone's supported, with 2x mode for those that don't adapt to the big screen. - Convenience.  Type notes, documents, dissertations anywhere without setting up a laptop. - Newspapers.  I didn't think that screen size mattered for news apps, but it does somehow. - Web browsing.  As good as a desktop; better than iPhone special interface apps. - Pictures and movies. Wow!The minor disadvantages: - The size.  No complaints, but it is less convenient to carry than my iPhone.  Well, of course it is. - No split screen.  I really would like to have two apps side-by-side. - Not a laptop replacement.  This is fine--but don't kid yourself.  Keep your laptop. - Not an iPhone replacement.  Not small or convenient enough.  Also no phone. - Too shareable.  Unlike an iPhone, which is clearly personal, people feel free to borrow it.  Grrr! - Too pricey.  Worth it, but just barely.  Somebody at Apple is very good at figuring price points.I'm glad I got it and I don't think I will change my mind.  I think I will keep using it to write on the metro, in front of the TV--like I am now--and other places where using the laptop doesn't quite work.  And, as when I first got my iPhone, I will temporarily turn into more of an app junkie to find the coolest ones.  They're only a buck, right?  Mostly.
The iPad is a wonderful device that will meet some users needs, but not others. It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have "Facetime" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!). I've used the iPad for quite a while now, and am not disappointed. Just remember not to expect a laptop, but more of a new type of device. I would recommend it to anyone.
This is a great product but people thinking of buying this should consider that a newer version will be coming out early 2011.  If I bought one now or received it as a present I would feel a little ripped off.
Since I bought my 32-gb iPad from Verizon a month ago, my kids and I have been fighting over it (well not really, but eagerly waiting in a queue for our turns). It is such a pleasure to have around, and already we depend on it. We especially enjoy playing games on it, and my kids can check their email and Facebook pages while we are out and about. I have Pages and can word process with ease using the Apple bluetooth keyboard. I like how the MiFi bundle that Verizon offers turns the iPad and both of my children's iPods into internet ready devices anywhere we go. I can even use the MiFi on my Macbook Pro. Obviously the key danger is exceeding one's data plan, and I'm not sure how far 1 gb ($20 plan) will get me and my children in one month. We don't use the MiFi all that much. Mainly it's for quick checking.If you haven't bought the SD card reader and USB port, do so, as this will improve the versatility of the unit.I am disappointed that this device lacks a forward facing camera for video conferencing. Hopefully future models will include one. This is the main reason I am not giving it five stars.I wear bifocals and haver poor "near" eyesight. As much as I love my children's iPods and as much as I would love to have one of the new ones, my eyes just can't focus on tiny graphics. It is indeed wonderful to have a sizable screen. Some of the apps will freeze and need to be restarted. That can get annoying.One of my children is autistic and has a very difficult time on long rides in the car. I've found that the privilege of playing with the iPad can help him a lot. My kids and their friends also delight in the "pass and play" games that one can buy inexpensively at the app store. Many a drive has been saved and tempers maintained with this wonderful thing.Having owned and played quite a bit with an iPod, I must say that the iPad is definitely far more than a larger version. It is a little computer, light and easy to carry, even with the extras that one can buy to go along with it.
So I have had my iPad now for about a month. The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a "third device," not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.
My 8 year old son has autism. His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking. This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him. So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son. He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him. He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting. There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (neither of which are covered by insurance). We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle. But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad. I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything. I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device. (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc. Then don't buy it. But you won't convince me. I've been using my son's - and now I want my own! Books, email, etc. I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids. Last night I was playing Monopoly with my daughter on the family room floor while tracking some of these packages that I'm expecting. Also, there are apps that I can download which I haven't even explored yet.
What do i have to offer to the already 432 previous reviews?  Just - thank you guys!i'm a 52 year old male who grew up in a world without computers.  I dont thiink that i like them, but i know they keep creeping into my life as a marginal neccessity.Along comes this ipad thing. Fast, crisp, smooth operating (computer ?) pad.  yes it is a computer.  i can balance my checking accounts.  surf the web, email, chat, oh no even play games. thats gotta be a computer.  no viral worries.  no rebooting.  no defragmenting.  it works fantastic - and i just sit back and take all the credit.  You macsters really knew how to cater to the millions of  middle age guys who are not 22 year old computer whizzezzzzz.Addendum 01/01/11:  FYI we used to have a Sony Vaio PC.  The wife and kids "needed" it for their various life fulfilling projects.  Every week there would be some sort of drama surrounding its existance;  update the reader, update security,  10 minute download,  file this file that and forget it.  Now this iPad fills practically every need I have with no drama.  I need ice skates to keep up with its speed and ease.OH sure if your accounting or running your business you NEED a monstosity computer.  But i bet for most of us this is all you really need to be connected to the world in all the electronic ways.
I purchased my iPad for business travel hoping that I could comfortably and easily use it for e-mails, web surfing, watching movies and more. This is a really nice piece of hardware with an excellent design. The touch screen works easily and almost flawlessly. The virtual keyboard is fast and very effective. The display is very pleasing, particularly when playing movies. WiFi operation in my situation was very robust and basically transparent. The iPad is very light and easy to tote around initially. The bundled apps are sufficient for basic computing.On the demerit side, the first issue is that watching movies requires a stand of some sort which leads to a marketplace with solutions that are either expensive, heavy, wobbly or cheesy or all four (and not ideal for travel). I know that there is a cardboard origami solution but I didn't want to deal with that for every trip. The next issue is that it really isn't very comfortable holding the bare iPad for a long time and one worries about scratching the beautiful aluminum case. This leads to a search for a skin or case. I ended up with the InCase Silicone skin which has a very good design that levels out the back of the iPad with molded rubber protrusions. Unfortunately, this also almost doubles the weight of the iPad, negating its weight advantage for travel and lounging around with it. Next, integration with iTunes and a lack of a USB port leaves the iPad user chained to Apple solutions for data transfers with the exception of the camera connection kit. I am in a mixed OS household (Windows and Mac) and this created potential hassles that I didn't want to deal with. Finally, I was surprised by how many mainstream web sites that I went to that were inaccessible because of Flash (and despite Mr. Jobs' assurances otherwise). I returned my iPad after three days. I am sure however, that for many, this will fit the bill either as a third device or for those with the narrow requirements that this device meets.
For a very long time I have played with portable devices, trying to get one that met my needs. I tried the Pocket PC, Palm Pilot, cellphones, and nothing quite satisfied my needs. In general, I wanted a light weight, easy to carry device that would enable me to search the web and read pdf/word/powerpoint/ and  excel documents. I was also looking for something to store my address book and a calender for scheduling and to do list.Despite popular belief, the ipad is in no way a tablet PC. As a matter of fact, it is basically an ipod touch with a larger screen and slightly more powerful processor. Understanding that, you can decide whether this is really the device you wanted. In my case, it absolutely was. I have no ipod touch, so I did not have that feeling of repetition when purchasing this item. I have enjoyed the ipad, and while I initially felt some pangs of buyer's remorse, the longer I have it, the more I have enjoyed it.When purchasing the ipad, you probably should plan to spend some $50 on additional applications. Apps are not too expense, but you may want 5-10 applications to help you get what you want out of the ipad. One bonus, most ipod touch games work with the ipad, so you have access to all of those games and software. Unfortunately, one of my biggest reasons for wanting the ipad was to have a portable office. So far, I have yet to find any software (free or buyable, that really provided me with the office I wanted. The closest program so far has yet to be ported to the ipad, and the ipod version does not work correctly. On the other hand, the ipad brings a new feel to gaming. It is unique, fun, and enjoyable. I enjoy the gaming on this far better than the nintendo DS (stylus) gaming. It is fun, and there are hundred's of games for both the ipad and ipod touch to keep you busy for a long long time.In the end, I am someone who wanted an ipod touch, but with a larger screen, and I got it. I didn't care for an mp3 player (I have one). So I basically wanted a palm pilot with a large enough screen to be able to surf the web and read pdf's comfortably, and that is exactly what it is. Trying to make it more is what leads to disappointment and the lower score others are giving it. It is not fit in your pocket portable, but if it was, then you wouldn't be able to read and use the web comfortably. It is portable enough for me to take along in the car on long drives, take to a friends house, bring along on vacation, and do all the things with it that I would need on the go, without the need for a bulky keyboard or an inconvenient stylus, but I wouldn't "drag it everywhere with me", since it is too inconvenient for that.It is a 4 out of 5 because although I like it, it is lacking a couple of things that I think are no brainers. Some of them you can download at a cost, but I just would have expected them to come with the device free, such as a viewer and editor for .doc and .xls documents (word and excel), and a to do list. (seriously, you have to buy and download a to do list, they couldn't just give you one for free). If there are so many free widgets and gadgets out there, then why do ipad apps, which do no more or less than a widget of similar ability, have to cost $2-$5 each?Update: I figured I should reiterate what I mean with the portable office and my score. Yes, they offer "pages" and "numbers" at a cost of $9.99 each, but besides costing $30 to get all of the software needed (powerpoint, word, excel equivalents), they also limit the fonts used and are not the software I would choose. I would have expected at least a free viewer to be able to look at these files, but you have to spend money on that (good reader is what I purchased). For a device centered around the idea of being a very slick and portable itablet, they didn't put any effort to ensure it could do what an actually itablet computer can do. They should have thought of making a document viewer and editor come with it with limited features. Eventually, companies will come out with them, and I will purchase them at a cost of $10-$15 when a decent one does, but it is something almost required on this kind of device, but absent. There desire to nickel and dime customers with there apps is incredibly apparent, almost every free app either has ads, or tries to get you to buy their paid for version. Many of the free games constantly tries to get you to make "ingame" purchases. And seeing how easy it is to make a purchase once setting it up, definitely make sure you kid doesn't touch it or you could end up with a $200 bill easy. So Apple Ipad gets a 4, because for all its' potential, apple limits you so it can get every penny out of you it can.
The iPad is great for surfing the Internet on the couch or in bed.  It boots up quickly, and one can be surfing immediately.  The size of the iPad allows a good portion of the websites to be viewed easily; however, Java apps don't work.  The biggest downside to the iPad is that it does not support Java, which means you can't watch certain shows/videos online.  The other downside is that Apple controls the apps that get released to the iPad.  Some apps that would be beneficial and/or interesting are not allowed for the iPad.  However, the iPad does have some good apps that have been created by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.  It is much more fun to read the newspapers on the iPad.  Also, one can play crossword puzzles and other types of games.
My husband originally bought this device for himself.  He quickly learned that he prefers his Kindle e-ink screen to reading on the iPad screen... but he also quickly learned that our 2.5 year old toddler could work the device with minimal adult assistance.  Intrigued, we downloaded some learning apps.  iWriteWords, Thomas The Train puzzles, the Disney Toy Story ebook, and an app for developing hand-eye coordination.  The iPad has quickly become the center of my child's learning day.  He colors, learns to count, writes letters and numbers, reads, and completes puzzles.  He also watches cartoons on Netflix, which is great because this allows us to keep him in the same room with us and not have to be subjected to watching Noggin every night.Most of the apps (except for ebooks) take us a few days to teach our son to navigate.  However, we downloaded Sketchbook pro for my husband... and the baby figured out how to display the hiding menu and change brush colors before I did!  We now have about 12 apps for our toddler and add more every week or so.  While I wouldn't have originally planned to purchase such an expensive device for a small child, I'm really glad we did.  I think the iPad is going to give our child a great head start in school, not to mention it has made him comfortable with and curious about technology.In addition, we just purchased the OtterBox case on Amazon to protect our investment in this device.  It is also worth mentioning that even with constant daily use, the battery life has been great.  We charge it overnight each night and it usually lasts all day.
I'm really surprised at the number of 1-star reviews on here and the complaining about the lack of flash.  Let's face it -- flash is useful for some things, but as the dominant media plugin it is on its way out.  I've found very little that actually needs flash and the sites that do use it, there is mostly an app that can accomplish the same thing but way better.Why not review it for what it is rather than something that you think it is not.  Obviously many of these people do not own one.  The common thread seems to be "I used a friends".I bought this about a week after it came out and I have used it every day since.  I have hundreds of free and paid apps both for fun and work. I recently took it on vacation with my bluetooth keyboard and was able to leave all sorts of things behind.  Watching movies, reading books, playing games on the flight -- perfect.  After taking pictures on my iPhone I was able to wirelessly send them to my iPad where I could edit and enhance them with the dozens of image apps out there.Every day something new comes out that enhances the experience as developers have jumped on board in a frenzy.  Gaming is a totally different experience as the size makes a big difference.  Going back to gaming on a phone is just not possible.Battery life is amazingly long.  Even with alot of use every day, I can get 2-4 days of use with no charging.  It's well put together and slick -- hard to believe it is the first one.And yes, everyone will jump on the bandwagon and try to mimic it -- and if Flash is your one and only destiny that you can't live without, then by all means wait.  Otherwise this one is the one.
This iPad constantly disappoints. You don't realize how many websites use flash until you own an iPad. My $350 Acer laptop outperforms every time.I regret buying this.
Hi there! I have just recently received an ipad, and for the most part, it is absolutely useless, for me at least.Let me tell you a bit of my background, I am a college student with a part time job. I have a powerful desktop and a semi-powerful laptop. My laptop has about 9-11 hours of battery life (asus ul30vt, $600). It also have 2 graphics card, 1 for hardcore gaming, and 1 for power saving, very intuitive. I also own a Mytouch Slide smartphone. My computer background is slightly advanced. Below is some aspects important to me (college student).General Use:The Ipad is for the most part useless to me. My laptop is only $100 more expensive, but much more useful, and it only weighs 3 pounds, with about the same battery life. I'm not trying to advertise for Asus, but just comparing laptops to this ipad. At home, I use my desktop most often. At school and work, I use my laptop for notetaking and serious work. On the bus, I use my smartphone for various stuff. The only time I find myself using the ipad is when I am in the bathroom taking a dump, or on bed watching videos (early morning or late at night when I am too lazy to get out of bed). It actually works fairly good on bed because it doesn't overheat, it is always cool. My laptop always makes my blanket too hot after a while.Battery:If the ipad came 2 years ago, it would definitely be the best gadget ever because of the insane 10 hour battery life, but nowadays, many netbooks and laptops offer that amount for much less.Gaming:I find the games on the ipad fairly dull as I am much into hardcore games like Halo, COD, starcraft, etc.Use-abilityMostly everything the ipad can do, including ebooks, I can do on my laptop. The pros of the ipad can be experienced for novice to casual computer users. The ipad OS is very simple and clean. It's also very smooth. However for my generation, computer is a very big part of our lives.Apps:Because of all the apps, the ipad can be used for a lot of different things. However...you have to have the money. Yes you can jailbreak it, but that's the same as stealing.Keyboard:Speaking of which. The ipad keyboard is not bad. However, to type correctly with minimum error, you have to look at the keyboard because you can't touch type with the virtual keyboard, and also you have to lift you palm away from the keybaord because the slightest touch can make a letter click. The auto correction system is OK, not great.Portability:The ipad is only 1.5 pounds, but it is as big as a netbook. Which means, I will have to bring a bag or backpack. May be useful if you carry a medium sized purse that you can fit an ipad in (but this is for college review).Price:I got my ipad used (mint condition, 16gb wifi) for $400. You can get a brand new 16gb wifi for $450 on Craigslist fairly easily. It is NOT WORTH it to buy a 32 or 64gb version because Apple overpriced the upgrade. I mean...come on, $100 for such a small upgrade? no wonder they don't offer removable memory, so that they can force people to buy the bigger memory. Also a 3G chip shouldn't cost $130 to upgrade.Performance:The OS is very smooth, but I did find some lag. A few times it just froze, it wouldn't register any of my touches.Multitasking:simply doesn't have it, should wait for the 4.2 upgrade. I use AIM for instant messaging, and if I press the home button, it exits out of AIM. It doesn't sign me off immediately, but it also doesn't tell me if I received a new IM or not. I have to go back into AIM to see if anyone replied.Social:For the most part, college students will view you as an Apple fanboy, which is NOT a good thing. For our generation, we tend to favor variety. Apple products in general are very strict and linear.People who may want to buy an ipad:1. don't have a long battery life laptop or netbook2. not technologically experienced, casual users3. casual gamers.4. all about the apps (if you can afford it).5. travel alot.6. Have the money.7. don't need multitasking.People who will regret buying an ipad:1. have a all-around laptop with great battery life2. no empty niche for ipad3. hardcore gamer4. touch-typist5. Video chatting is a normThis is just what I feel. 3 stars because it is an OK product. Yes it is smooth and very nice to hold, but not really what I need, or even want. I am looking to sell my ipad because it doesn't fit any niche in my life. However, like I said, the ipad will be perfect for people who needs an extremely portable device with great battery life. But then again, you can always buy the Asus 1005pe netbook (12 hours of battery) for about $280. or my Asus UL series for about $600. (yes i LOVE asus, they are the best laptop/netbook company, check them out, much better than HP, Toshiba, Gateway, Acer). The one thing that is incomparable with the ipad is its multitouch and smoothness. However, come 2011, the ipad should have a lot of competitors coming out.-College Student 101
Update: We just went through the first big software update to the iPad and various issues have been corrected.  The chief one is multi-tasking.  I can now click the home button twice and a bar will appear which lets me choose other functions.  I choose one and my screen is visibly swiped for another.  Also, internet radio, like my Pandora app, will now continue to play if you leave to use another function of the iPad.  Prior to this, the music stopped playing when you left Pandora.  I now have a mute button on the side and the fix position button is now on the multi-tasking bar.  I've added a few more ereader apps and, as an ebook reader, I use the ipad all of the time.  It is as good for magazines and full color art books as it is for text books.  I have not discovered any downside to this update yet.  It of course still does not play Flash but I don't think that will change as Apple is opposed to Flash. My original review appears below:I use this every day and all day long.  I read all of my books on it.  I watch tv shows and movies on it--I have not turned on a tv set since the day it arrived. I listen to audios on it. I have no problem using the virtual keyboard and can write my emails just fine on it.  I look at my Picasa albums on it. I listen to audiobooks and music on it.  I surf the web.  Then there are the apps....oh, boy...the apps are something to get lost in.  I play scrabble against the computer on it, ditto gin rummy.  I play my crosswords on it and it downloads all of my New York Times ones. I have art history apps so watched art ones, beautiful images, while waiting for a nerve wracking CT scan.  In fact, I get so absorbed in my iPad that I am somewhat irritated when "tourists" want to bother me and ask me what it is and what I'm doing on it. However, my natural enthusiasm takes over and I find myself showing them all of the things I am doing on it.My husband got one after he watched me with mine for a few months.  He gets lost in it for hours every evening.  He has a few quibbles about the iPad.  His biggest one is that it doesn't play Flash.  However, I think his problem is that he doesn't realize that if he used Apps properly that he wouldn't even have a need for Flash.  I certainly don't.  I don't need it for my Crosswords, for example, because my App handles all of my crosswords brilliantly.When I listen to all the complaints about the iPad, I think it boils down to that somehow the iPad is not the macbook in iPad form.  I don't need another Macbook!  I have a macbook, an iPad and an iPhone and frankly there is nothing else I need.  What one may not do best, the other does.  At home, where I spend most of my time, I am surrounded by all three.  When I go out, I take the iPad and iPhone.  I used to take the Macbook too but that is rarely necessary anymore. Once you have these three products, you can junk the rest of your electronics.  I certainly did.  My nephew is now using my sony reader, my digital picture frame, our Hero phone and so on and so forth.
I bought my iPad for a trip to Europe so that I would be able to watch movies for the entire flight, as well as read books. For that, with its great screen and 10 hour battery life, it is fabulous. You'd have to spend at least $500 to get netbook computer with comparable battery life and graphics power, but miss out on the touch screen and portrait mode.My problem is that I cannot sync the Ipad to my computer. I have an iPhone too and was able sync that until the iTunes release 9.1 that coincided with the release of the iPad. When I try to sync either device, the message "Unable to load data class information from sync services" appears in iTunes. I have spent more than 16 hours on the phone with at least ten Apple support techs, at the "Genius Bar" in my local Apple store, and on my own trying various "fixes" posted on the web. The senior Apple tech I am now dealing with tells me he has the same problem trying to sync his iPhone to his own computer. I briefly found a work around and was able to sync for a day, but then when I installed iTunes 9.2, it stopped working again. You cannot roll back to a previous version of iTunes because 9.1 changed the library file structure.I just spent two hours emailing myself 150 mbs of pdf doucments that I need to read, opening them on the iPad and then saving them in iBooks. If I could sync, that would have been taken me five minutes of effort at most. I also cannot load music or photos from my computer library.This problem with iTunes seems to be affecting a lot of people according the Apple techs I've dealt with and the web forums I've read. If you are planning to buy an iPad, make sure you can sync it to your computer before you buy it. Install iTunes and take your laptop down to your local retailer and ask them sync it to a demo iPad in the store. Otherwise, you may end up like me.So far, my experience has been ugly and stressful. It's disgraceful that in Apple's rush to get this product to market, they wrecked the iTunes sync capability for thousands of customers and tens weeks later they still have not fixed it.
One of my favorite things about being an early adopter is when I pick up a device more for the novelty than anything else and I'm completely surprised by how useful it turns out to be. I had this experience first with my first iPod, when I discovered podcasts. I had it again when I first got a Kindle and my reading increased about 5 fold. And I've had it once more, in almost too many ways to count, with the iPad.Let me be clear, the iPad is not a computer. You can't do anything on it that you couldn't on a laptop or desktop PC. The difference with the iPad though, is that you'll find it allows you to many of those things in ways and places you would never bring a PC to. Let me give a few examples to better illustrate my point.A few days after I got my iPad, I discovered that it fit nearly perfectly on the reading ledge for my treadmill. Now my treadmill faces a blank wall, so up to this point workout entertainment has been strictly auditory. With the iPad though, I can now watch videos while I work out. The result, I've been exercising about twice as often in the three weeks since I bought my iPad.Another example. I used to love reading comics when I was younger. However, as an adult there's a certain stigma attached to having a comic book collection in the house. The Marvel and Xcomics apps on the iPad mean that I can now enjoy comics without actually having to keep them laying around my house. The result is that I've completely rediscovered a form of entertainment.One more example. The other night, while getting ready for bed with my wife, somehow the topic of old cartoon theme songs came up in conversation. I picked up the iPad from my nightstand and we spent about 30 minutes reminiscing over YouTube clips of old cartoons. Now you might say I could do the same thing with a laptop, which I could. However, my laptop wasn't in the room and it's unlikely I would have gone to fetch it simply on a whim. With a 4-5lb laptop, it more or less stays in one place unless I anticipate that there will be a need for it. With a 1.5lb iPad, it follows me wherever I go, almost always nearby should the need for it arise.Those are just 3 examples of how the iPad has proved useful in the short time I've had it. True, they're small things, but they add up quickly to form a completely different experience with a computing device than what I'm used to.Sure the device is not without its flaws. Flash would definitely be welcome. And I'd kill for a USB and SD slot. But the technical story of this device doesn't have a whole lot to do with what makes the experience of using it so special. It's a completely different computing experience, and trying to boil it down to a spec sheet comparison just doesn't do it justice.Update: I want to add a few of my thoughts on how the iPad compares to the Kindle as an ebook reader, since it seems particularly pertinent in an Amazon review.  I've been using the Kindle app on the iPad for a little while now, and I've reached a point where I'm using each device in more or less equal amounts for reading.  Overall, I think I prefer using the Kindle.  The screen is easier on the eyes; the battery life is significantly better; the size and weight feel better in my hand; and size of the iPad's screen just feels a bit too large for reading large portions of text.That said, the iPad is certainly a capable reader in the right circumstances.  In particular, I use it more than the Kindle when I'm in bed at night because the back-lit screen means I don't need a reading light that will keep my wife awake.  Also, I've been using it more often when starting a new book.  Navigation of the store is much easier and downloads go much faster than on the Kindle due to the WiFi.In conclusion, I'm certainly not going to get rid of my Kindle now that I've got an iPad.  There are simply too many situations where I prefer it over the iPad for reading.  That said, if I didn't already own a Kindle, I think it would be much harder to justify buying one as well as an iPad, since the iPad does serve as a capable ebook reader in most circumstances.
Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configurationThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDKCons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes
First off, do not buy this as a fully functional computer, that it is not.  Yes, you can check email and surf the net, but it really isn't fit for word processing or any heavy computer work.  It is a really cool peripheral device.  By the way, I bought my 64gB wifi+3G iPad at Best Buy for $829.  While I love Amazon, seriously, you save $200 by buying it in a store.  The apps are great, but by far, my favorite thing about it is watching netflix streaming movies.  That is the best.  I'm still waiting to try out the iBook feature, I downloaded it for free, just haven't tried anything with it other than the included Winnie the Pooh book.  I even downloaded the Kindle app, which makes the screen un-backlit, like a Kindle screen, for all of you who don't like the backlit screen.  All-in-all, I am extremely happy with the purchase.  Just don't buy it as a computer, buy it like you would an iPhone with much more programming and entertainment opportunities.
Received product, setup and quick startup operation in minutes.The screen is exceptionally bright and the touch screen works superb.Lots of free and fun apps to download with some really useful for maps and travel.Best of all, the battery life is unbelievable! Advertised as 10 hours but have been able to squeeze 12-14 with some rest periods in between uses.E-books using Kindle or iBook app works great.Absolutely no heat issues during use but can at times require switching the way it's heldas it does at times feel slightly heavy, but not a burden.Font's are much easier to read due to increased size and now my daily news reader.iPad 4.0 (due Fall 2010) will make the unit nearly 100% replacement for my MacAir  I normally carry.Utilized in business meetings for demonstrations of software applications and slide shows toshow product pictures. Slide show built into app works great too. 3G signal reception generallygood in most cities with no antenna issues.Well worth the $ 800.00+ for the 64GB 3G unit.
The iPad is ok, but I was hoping for better.What I like: watching movies, reading books, battery life.What I tolerate: browsing (many little issues with Safari and most web pages that I read have many small links that are challenging to touch at the default page resolution), email (builtin mailer isn't very good at managing mailboxes, especially trying to avoid reading messages that might be spam), typing (a learning experience for a touch typist).What I dislike: most of the rest of the apps, builtin and third-party. The lack of a decent way to view photos in an album or read PDF (offline) is particularly annoying because those seem like things that would be good on the iPad. Conventional wisdom is the apps will get better, but a major issue is that the iTunes user interface to the Apple App Store is poor. Support for searching for apps and sorting results by user rating is particularly lacking.
By way of background, I have never been a fan of Apple's closed ecosystem and forced use of iTunes, the iStore and App Store as the sole source of consumable content (not that we can't free the device with jailbreaking, but that's not for most people).  I haven't bought an apple product since the second generation ipod years ago.  I have also played quite a bit with android based phones and have been eagerly researching and awaiting the release of android based tablets.  After doing considerable research, I have come to the conclusion that android 2.2 (FroYo) is not ready for prime time use on tablet after having some play time with a Samsung Galaxy tab.  Apps have to be scaled up, which makes them look rather blocky and atari 2600 on the Samsung's 7" 1024x600  resolution screen.  This problem is further exacerbated on larger size screens like the demo I saw of the Archos 101 (10.1" with a 1024x600 resolution).  At some point in the not to distant future, app developers will release modified versions of their apps suited to higher resolution/larger size screens.  At the moment, froyo tops out at 854x480 resolution, which will cripple the ability of developers to rescale their apps until either Gingerbread or Honeycomb are released by Google (who has yet to confirm which update will actually allow android to accomodate higher resolution displays).  Don't get me wrong, the hardware on the Galaxy Tab, Archos 101 and Viewsonic G Tablet (this tab in particular) are all quite good--better than the iPad--but without the OS and the Apps, the hardware really doesn't do the user much good.Rather than wait the 6 months to a year before the Android guys get their acts together, I decided to go online and find myself a used 64gb iPad on ebay.  I did this reluctantly, but I wanted to give apple products another try.  The iPad was purchased for about $120 less than I would pay for the same product from Apple.  I did notice that there was a burn in the LCD which caused part of the screen to show up white when the rest of the screen was black.  I have seen this type of defect before and it is a manufacturer's defect that should entitle me to a replacement device.  I registered myself as the user of the iPad and brought my "new" used iPad to the Apple store.  They looked at the issue and 15 minutes later, I walked out of the Apple Store with a brand new iPad under my arm.  Now that's what I call customer service!!!!  Steve Jobs scored lots of points on that.I brought the iPad home, loaded iTunes onto my Dell (again no Apples) and in ten minutes I had the iPad ready to go.  I have downloaded tons of apps since then, including kindle, nook, netflix, hulu +, angry birds, N.O.V.A., NYT, WSJ etc.  All the apps are designed specifically to run on the iPad and they function perfectly.  The device boots quickly and opens apps almost instantaneously.  The battery life lives up to Apple's 10 hour claim.  The interface is smooth and polished.  The device itself is well built and has a high-quality feel to it.  The screen in particular is gorgeous with great color reproduction, inky blacks and terrific viewing angles.  On the whole, this is an excellent product.  I am looking forward the release of IOS 4.2, which will provide the iPad with multi-tasking capabilities, the use of air play and remote printing.  This should significantly improve the iPad's functionality.What the iPad is not:  As others have said, this is not a replacement for your laptop or desktop.  If you are buying this as an alternative to a more traditional computer you will be sorely disappointed.  You can not expand the storage on the device, nor can you connect the device to any external storage, which signficantly hinders functionality.  Most similar devices, including soon to be released android tablets, have microSD slots, USB 2.0/3.0 connections (mini and standard), OTG capability that will allow you to connect thumb drives and portable harddrives--the iPad has NONE of these features. If you're familiar with windows/microsoft products, you'll come to see that the treatment of files is not the same on ios as you're use to using.  You cannot save a "document" or "file" on the iPad.  The iPad's document management system just works in completely different manner.  To be clear, this is a great device for web browsing, reading ebooks, watching streaming movies from netflix, playing games and light productivity software.  It is not a real productivity device for use in place of a laptop.  Although there is some watered down productivity apps for wordprocessing and spreadsheets, this is not going to replace the microsoft word/excel suite that most of us rely on in the business world.On the whole it is a great product with some limitations.  This really a tool for media consumption, not for productivity.  If you can live with the limitations, you will love it!!!
This is our first and last experience with Apple. We purchased the 32G wifi version 3.x and it worked perfect, long battery life, no connection issues with wifi. Upgraded to 4.2.1, wifi is intermittent and when it does work, safari is a slower load. We've found a temp fix, go into settings / wifi / your network settings / 'renew lease'.Seriously this is a huge problem, hundreds are experiencing and Apple will not go public and recognize the issue and resolve it. Don't take my word, google it. 'ipad 4.2 wifi issue'. At this time there is a thread in [...] that is 30 pages long, 440+ posts alone of users trying to resolve the issue. "Topic : WiFi/Internet Incredibly slow after iOS 4.2 Upgrade" Many are taking them back for a full refund and will wait til apple comes to terms with this issue and resolve.This issue is hit and miss. We purchased another for our kids, they upgraded our pc and haven't had any wifi issues. It's possible you may not have issues, but from reports of others with like experiences. You are gambling. No more apple products for us after this.
Didn't think one of these would be useful until I saw it in action.  Have had mine for 2 weeks, and have found it a valuable tool for work & play.  Am presently running the 4.2 Beta with no hitches, and the multitasking & folders have been most useful.  I can put on music (my files or Pandora) then switch to a newspaper, weather, or other app and enjoy it as it should have been designed in the first place.  Presently it is shipping with 3.x, so new users won't have those bennies until 4.2 is certified and released.  But even without it, it's a great tool.  I can take meeting notes without having to wait for my laptop to boot up, then shut down with a push of the button and wait all of about 1-2 seconds.  I can pop it on quickly in the morning to read news, etc.  My email (exchange) is fed directly to it as well as my personal POP3 email.  I'm using an app for printing so I'm not using the 4.2 airprint feature but it works well enough there.  I even found a bunch of free apps for my grandson to use - he has fun while leanring some preschool concepts.  Many of the ipad apps work ok, some don't make good use of the enlarged screen, but others do.  Even installed a remote desktop app so I can work from/on my computer & network while away.  It looks for a wifi if available, but I've activated the cellular account so it makes a connection as it needs to. I'm using a cable in the car to connect the audio to my car sound system, it's easy to hookup and just as easy to unhook when I get where I am going.Have picked up a few ebooks, and while I have never liked "reading from the screen" and preferred a printed version, the screen reads much easier than a monitor or laptop.  Maybe it's the angle, or the distance from my eyes, but it's highly readable.I'm still learning new ways to make life easier with this critter...it's been a blast so far.  My laptop is not entirely obsolete...if I need 'flash' or files from work or a cd/dvd burned that's what I head to.  But this does about 85% of what I need to do techwise in any given day.Can't believe the inflated prices at Amazon compared to Apple or AT&T; Store locations (it's about 10% less at either of those), but I guess that's a function of supply and demand.
I've been using an iPad (16GB, WiFi only) since the day they became available (April 2010), and it's been far more useful/enjoyable than I expected.Personally, I mainly use it to browse the news sites at breakfast (a replacement for the paper) and as an e-reader (usually in bed late at night, but also when waiting for my kids at various activities of theirs). For both of these functions it easily beats a small portable computer because (a) it's significantly lighter, (b) the screen has the right form factor (and is of better quality than most small portables), (c) it's more social when showing a news item or other site with others, (d) the touch interface is more fun.My two (young) daughters also use it frequently to draw (with an app called "Art Studio") and play games (board games work especially well with this device). When we go out for dinner, my wife will just grab the iPad and drop it in her purse, and when service is a little slow, or we want a grownups conversation, the iPad works just perfectly to keep the girls entertained (again, much more effectively than the old laptop).We bought the simple dock (Apple® iPad(tm) Dock - White (MC360ZM/A)) to use the iPad as a picture frame when it's not otherwise in use.  It's in the kitchen, and it just puts every other digital picture frame to shame. The "Origami" transitions mode is very tasteful, and with two taps, we can add family pictures that come in through e-mail.In September, we bought another iPad (also with a dock) as a gift for my mom. She's been a bit a technophobe for years, and this was our last hope to get her to respond to e-mails and use Skype and Facebook (we live an ocean apart).  Lo and behold: It worked!  (She also set it up in her kitchen as a picture frame, and sending her pictures of her grandchildren no doubt helped convince her that checking an e-mail account on a regular basis is worth it.)I think Apple has another winner with this one. We certainly feel than we'll have multiple household iPads in our not-so-far future...
I loved my kndle, but then I got an I pad and I am thinking who can I give the kindle toy to. Sorry Amazon, the kindle feels and looks like a piece of fluff compared to the reading experience the i pad gives you. The best feature is the backlight on the ipad, i love reading in the dark.The reading experience on the ipad is so great but only the start of all the wonderful things the ipad can do.If you are on the fence, which to get kindle or ipad, take out a loan and get the ipad.
The iPad has potential to be a decent device.  After using it for a week, some general strengths and weaknesses.The Good- Excellent battery life (actually pretty amazing)- Great glossy screen (but also a negative)- Fast, no noticeable lag- Good balance between size and usability- Similar to the iPhone, so easy to learn- Apps developed for the iPad show real potential, some are excellent already- VIdeos worked great- Real potential as a gaming platformThe Bad- Glossy screen loves to show fingerprints and glare- No multitasking so using it as a notebook replacement is tough (too much flipping around)- USB charging requires high power USB port.  Many USB hubs will not charge the iPad- Lacks a native file system, ways to store files on it are clunky at best- WiFi issues, I had problems with dropouts where my MacBook Pro is fine- Using iWorks apps felt clunky, I wanted a keyboard and mouse- iBooks app is great, but content is currently lacking (that will improve)The current iPad falls a little short of me recommending it but the idea is a good one.  Apple can fix some of the shortcomings with a new release of the iPhone OS (v4).  But my money says iPad v2 will be the sweet spot in a year when Apple takes another shot at it.
This device is great for business and just sitting at home and doing the internet, playing games and just having fun. This product is really functional for school, and everyday things. It is like having your computer in your hands or in your lap, everything there at your fingertips. It is good for traviling, just put in the case and go! Just so simple, right there at your fingertips! You can do PowerPoint, documents, and sprend sheets (you have to get the apps 9.99 each). When you are ready to type, the keyboard just pop up from the bottom of the screen. It is amazing to hold you document, your spredsheet or anything els in your hands, ready to go, just hit the powerbutton and go. The iPad has multi-tasking, just double click the home screen button and the home screen appears at the bottom of the screen while what you are woring on stays there. It is very thin. The iPad can run ipod and iphone apps too. The iPad comes with a wall charger, to set it up, you do need a computer, it comes with an instruction packet along with stickers.The battery is 10 hours long (I believe so). It has accessories you can buy from the apple store, or any other store. The keyboard is basicly the size of a laptops keyboard. I do recommend this product. When I first got it, I didn't like, now I LOVE IT!!!!I typed this on the iPad(I'm using my moms account)
I use this tablet for just about everything and love it.  I don't use it for reading books. I prefer paper. The only problem that I have Is that it does not support Flash. That has proven to be a great inconvienience at times.
Love my ipad. I have the 16gb wi-fi model, and I absolutely love it. As an adult student headed back to college, it's been a life-saver for me in class. Taking notes, annotating my notes, keeping organized, the calendar, checking email, it's able to do everything I need it to do and more. Thanks for the revolutionary product apple, and thanks for the opportunity to tell my side.Apple iPad in any size, I give it 5 starts. Best thing I could have bought for my college career, bar none.
Overall this is a good device. Lack of flash support, ability to save webpages and manipulate files makes it annoying if your are trying to do anything other than surf the web or play around. Not a serious business tool. Apple really should mend bridges so as to install flash support on these.
you can save $30.00 if you buy this on apple's website or best buy.  i don't know why amazon jacked up the price.
The iPad is a wonderful device that will meet some users needs, but not others. It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have "Facetime" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!). I've used the iPad for quite a while now, and am not disappointed. Just remember not to expect a laptop, but more of a new type of device. I would recommend it to anyone.
This is an amazing product. But it is not a netbook, or even a computer, exactly.I use it to read/view web stuff, pdf's, kindle content, tv shows, ect on my sofaand in bed. Sounds unambitious--but its a great convenience--easily worth theprice. If your used the itunes sync set up you'll have no problems getting contentonto the ipad. There is no file system per se--everything is organized through theitunes browser. Also available at itunes are huge collection of apps--small softwareapplications. Some are truly great--like the autodesk sketch app, the kindleapp, and the marvel comic app. The device is very fast and seamless; and thedisplay is stellar. If your intent on doing  work on the ipad--you willbe frustrated by its form factor and lack of a true file system. If your lookingfor a portable content browser/reader--you will find the ipad is revolutionary.PS--get the apple case or similar product.
Wow is all I can say about this device. The first thing  noticed from opening the box is the built quality. It is superb. It is very sturdy and had a nice heft to it while you are holding it. It only had four buttons (screen lock,home, volume rocker, and screen orientation lock). It fits very nicely in your hands and is made from very high quality materials. I would definently recommend a case though because if you drop it then you are screwed.The screen on this thing is amazing. Watching movies is a pleasure. I have a couple 720p movies on here and they look absolutely fantastic. Normal definition movies also look very nice. The bad side to the screen though is it gets many fingerprints. They are not very easy to wipe off but with a lightly damped cloth they come off easily and the screen looks brand new.The internet browsing is very fast on this. Pages load quicker than my net book. The multi touch is great when needing to zoom in. You can have numerous web pages up at once. For some reason though every no and then the Internet starts to preform very slowly but fixes itself after a couple of minutes, but this is most likely my router causing this. Typing is very good and I got adjusted to it easily. I prefer typing in landscape because it is easier as in portrait mode it is a little awkward. By the way this whole review is being typed on the iPad without the Bluetooth keyboard attachment. The lack of flash player is not a big letdown to me because YouTube still works fine and I do not go on many flash websites.The speakers on this are very good. They are surprisingly loud but the sound quality is not lost much when cranked up all the way. When played at normal volumes or through headphones you will be amazed at how well they preform. The only problem is when you start to turn up the volume the device starts to vibrate a bit, but it is most likely no big deal.The apps are very good. Gaming is great, although most of the good games you have to pay for. They're are a couple good free games like tap tap radiation and air hockey but besides that not many. Some good paid games I would recumbent are x-plane, nova, real racing, touchgrind, need for speed, and plants vs zombies. Although these games are great they come at a cost. All of them combined are over 50 dollars. These games though will keep you entertained for hours and most are redisigned for the iPad while adding new features. Also they're are many good apps ranging from some similar to word to others for keeping baseball box score. One very creative app I enjoy is magic piano which is very fun to play around with. There are also apps like netflix and abc player which are very cool also.The battery life is insane. It lasts forever. I have gotten 9-10 hours on this with extremely heavy use. This includes hours of YouTube videos and playing very graphic intensive games like x-plane and real racing. Video playback time will easily be 13-14 hours at half brightness.It take about 3-4 hours to completely charge it. And also right out of the box it comes completely charged.The Only cons would have to be-Fingerprint magnet-Lack of flash( but only a con for some)-Apps are expensive and not many good free ones-Connection problems(but most likely only my router)-Apps take up a lot of memoryI would recommend getting the 32 or 64 gb version(like mine) because memory on this will become very limited with 16 gb. Most apps or games are between 100-200 mb.Also adding movies and songs will take up a lot of memory. My iPad had over 25 movies and more than 120 episodes of family guy,  more than 400 songs, and with about 20 apps and games installed and it takes up about 40 gb of space. I would also not recommend buying movies from iTunes as they are very expensive and take up more space. A normal 2 hour movie is 10 dollars and takes up 1.5gb of space so download them online for more space saving.
I can truly say that out of all the devices I've owned, this is the COOLEST!  I am absolutely in love with the iPad. I do all my readings on it since I got it. I read books, pdfs, documents.. etc. The gaming experience is MUCH better than iphones and ipod touches. I use it a lot so sometimes I get into a state of "ergonomical fail" (if that's a word) and it could get heavy on my hands and it hurts a bit. But other than that I am absolutely fine with the product I think it's sleek and advanced. You could do a lot with it and it's much more practical that a laptop, given it's weight. I once used it as a GPS for an hour and a half drive -WiFi model. So you could do a lot of serious work with it. Hands down, the coolest device I've ever owned!!!.oO..If only it had the iphone 4 camera and facetime, ohhh it would be heaven!..Oo.

 Length:: 9:22 MinsYou can thank me later.  For summary judgment skip to the very bottom.  I'll add a video review once I get settled.I bought an iPad just so I could review it.  Figuring that it would be one of the more popular reviews out there, I decided that it would be in my best interest to take the time to run it through its paces.  And you know what I've discovered?  It really IS an oversized iPod Touch.  No, I'm serious - right down to the functionality within, the navigation, even the Settings menu, it's clear that they took the iPod Touch (or rather, the iPhone OS) and tweaked a few settings, enlarged some others, and slapped it onto a form factor reminiscent of, as one person put it, an iPod Touch ran over by a steamroller.  For crying out loud, the iPad even runs iPod Touch and iPhone apps in their native resolutions, it's like looking at the apps on those devices!But, I digress.  The first thing that I noticed about this device was the fact that everyone seemed to want it, yet really didn't know why.  I and a colleague spent weeks trying to identify a single use case for the iPad; I even went out on a limb long before I laid hands on one and said that the iPad is effectively a toy.  Now that I've used it, that's exactly what it is: a toy.  It's not for those who want to get things done.  It's for those who want a pastime.  Now mind you, there's nothing wrong with that - but that's a fact.  I also like to say that it's a jack of all trades yet master of none, which is also a factual statement.Next thing I noticed was the blatantly excessive setup steps which are more the fault of iTunes than the iPad.  See, if you're a MacBook owner, you're asked to sign up for iTunes when you first set up the laptop.  That's the same process for any Apple device that runs iTunes even if you don't plan on using it on a regular basis.  The problem is that iTunes is not smart enough to detect and merge duplicate accounts.  Obviously, if I've got two accounts with the same email address, it's probably a good bet that they belong to the same person unless the name is different, which it isn't.  iTunes registered my email address from when I owned an iPod Touch, yet used my username from my MacBook, even though the email address is the exact same.  The problem is that iTunes attaches your download history to the username, not to the email address.  This wouldn't otherwise be an issue, but for the fact that you can't even start using the iPad until you attach it to a Mac and connect via iTunes to activate it.  The problem is the account that it uses to do said activation vs. the account that has the stuff you wanted.You can probably see where this is going.- I had bought a number of apps on the iPod Touch, and thought I could download them again at any time (email address);- I had created a number of podcasts on the MacBook (username, or so I thought);- I tried to get iBooks, Kindle, Amazon Mobile and Netflix on the iPad along with all of the above (email address, or so I thought).First the iPad wouldn't sync properly.  It gave me a list of everything (both from the email address and the username) but wouldn't download content from either.  Then it told me to activate the MacBook for access to the apps.  Did that, and tried again.  The iPad still wouldn't sync the apps.  I tried to download them directly from the iPad; it attempted a download, then sat there.  I had to clear out the iTunes account on the iPad (which was the username), log out of iTunes on the MacBook (which was the username), then log back into both with the email address, which then allowed me to get the apps, though slow.  But then I couldn't get the podcasts or some music I had bought.  Had to repeat and log in with the username to get those to sync.  After much futzing I got everything set up - 2 hours of my life wasted to set up.  Probably not an issue if you'd never owned a MacBook or an iPod or an iPhone or anything like that.  Basically, if you'd never used iTunes it would probably go smoother as you'd not have anything to transfer.Let's get down to it, shall we?  I approach this review in terms of use case, so for you, find the use case that applies, and see if the statement is enough to deter (or encourage) you.My first thought:- THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT DEVICE TO HAVE AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE PLANE, AT THE HOTEL, ETC!...this was hard to debunk, but I managed to do it.  First of all, it IS a fun device for those places, but the limitations hold it back from the greatness that it could have been if it were to have a full flavor of Snow Leopard rather than an iPhone OS derivative.  Let me explain:  Most important, the device is too heavy to be carried and held for extended periods.  Because the entire back is aluminum, and because the screen is so thick, nevermind the battery, it doesn't lend itself to being held for a long time.  Yes, I know there are docks.  But if you're going to just dock the thing you might as well bring the laptop along.  Additionally, there were minor issues with the WiFi - I didn't have the "refuse to reconnect" issue.  What I experienced was unusual slowness from two different hotspots: my Mobile Hotspot, and my home wireless.  My Mobile Hotspot has run GoToMeetings.  It's not a slouch.  Yet, for some reason, iTunes struggled to open and was unbearably slow, as was Kindle.  Yet, on a netbook that I recently sold, on the same hotspot, Kindle was reasonably quick and snappy.  I know why there was a difference...the apps on the iPad are very graphics-rich and it's clear that it wants at least medium (3Mbps down) speeds on the WiFi for an optimal experience.  It works, but it's just not fun to wait 20 minutes for a book to download, I mean really.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- THIS COULD BE A GREAT DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING DOCUMENTS TO CO-WORKERS!!...except for one small problem: interacting with Microsoft networks is nigh impossible, and file management is non-existent.  The only way to get a file on the device is to have it emailed to you or otherwise sent through MobileMe or iTunes.  If the data is sensitive there's no way to get it securely to your device (unless you have secure email screening services), since the iPad does not have any exterior ports for storage devices.  What's worse, since it's not running Snow Leopard, it means no VMWare, no Office 2008, no Office Online.  As much as some would hate to admit it, Microsoft Office dominates the workspace, and if a device cannot interact with those documents, it makes it hard to justify.  Even if the device can do other things, it's yet another (heavy) device to carry along with the user's regular computer/books/etc.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!...I did read the Seton Hall announcement about giving all of their students iPads and MacBook Pros.  It must be nice to have so much money to throw around - and I suspect they're taking it out of the loans that the students are ponying up to attend, but I'm guessing that this one depends.  I mean, on one hand, yes, the convenience of being able to pull out a device and research something really quick might be a boon.  It also might be convenient to be able to listen to broadcasts or see webinars that have been posted on iTunes.  On the other hand, some colleges might not care much for the potential cheating that the iPad seems to encourage by its open access.  Of course, "guns don't kill people", but you see what I'm getting at.My next thought:- WOW!! A COLOR TABLET EREADER!!...and yes, it is this, and does it fairly well, but then you run into the problem of cost-benefit.  Some would justify it by saying "yeah, but it can do other things!!" which is true, but I don't look at it that way; if all I wanted to do is read books, I would get an eReader (I actually bought a Kindle a while ago.  Great device).  In order for me to justify a purchase, it has to be spot on with what I intend to use it for.  If I can't find a viable use case, I can't justify its price.  In truth, I couldn't justify buying it this time, but for the need to actually review it and attempt to help others with my experience.  But back on topic, the big issue with the reader is threefold: first, iBooks is terrible.  It screams "gimmick" from the moment you launch your first book.  Looks extremely well made, but there were some bad framerate issues when flipping pages, and I found myself wishing I could disable the animation.  Then there was Kindle, which thankfully didn't have the page flip animation, and what's more, Kindle showed how much more evolved it was than iBooks by virtue of it giving you freebie books and userguides along with the software, unlike iBooks which let you stare at a blank bookshelf.  The second thing to decide is whether or not the backlit LCD works for you.  Some are sensitive to it and prefer the eInk display.  I'll tell you this much - if you're trying to read outdoors, the iPad automatically loses!  It also loses in battery life AND multitasking, believe it or not ( the Kindle allows you to play music while reading while still managing to pull out days of use without the need to recharge ).So on and so forth...try as I might, I could not find a viable use case for the iPad.  It does so much and yet so little.  It's a very specific market that could truly benefit, but at that narrow of a market target, the price is a bit steep.  It's not way out there on this model, but definitely on the 3Gs.In other words readers:-=- What the iPad does RIGHT -=-- Convenience.  Powers on quick, ready to use at your beckon call.- Navigation is smooth, no real hickups on the interface that I could tell.- Tight integration with iTunes allows you to get books, magazines, movies, trailers, games, etc. at the push of a few buttons.- Decent speaker volume for watching movies or trailers, even has an equalizer to adjust the output quality.- The screen is brilliant and vibrant and easy on the eyes (but see WRONG below).- The 16GB model isn't that overpriced considering the technology (Which has been measured to cost about $250 to make).-=- What the iPad does WRONG -=-- Weight.  It's a heavy device, a VERY heavy device not meant to be held for long periods of time.- Glossy screen - just like the MacBook Pros, they just don't believe in matte or at least polarized screens; this thing is a straight up mirror in broad daylight.  Might consider an overlay.- No external ports i.e. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB, etc.  Yes, there's a dock port, but you know what I mean.  A DisplayPort would not have hurt Apple.- Initial setup is cumbersome if you are trying to add all of your previously purchased content.- iPhone/iPod Touch apps are stretched with no optimization or smoothing.- Because it's based on iPhone OS and not Snow Leopard, or at least a slimmer version thereof, it's extremely limited in productivity; not quite feasible for a workplace replacement device.- WiFi seems extremely slow; there are reports of WiFi issues across the web, so it may be an antenna problem with the first gens.  As we all know, Apple likes to use first adopters as guinea pigs and then release the good stuff later.- It truly IS an oversized iPod Touch.  The look, the feel, the navigation, the limitations, all are identical to those found on the Touch.  The only difference is the larger screen, which for some is more than sufficient, but I consider this a negative, because it doesn't stand apart much from the Touch, and it should.So...in summary, do I recommend it?  Well...depends.  The answer is an emphatic "NO" if you're looking for something to replace your PC entirely.  It's not happening.  It's a soft "YES" if you accept that the device is a fun add-on that is not going to replace anything - something to pass time, or accompany you on your travel or something.  As long as you are ok with that then it won't disappoint you.  But don't expect a laptop out of this thing.
I know that I need to put a more detailed review of my iPad into this forum. I am just a little angry about how bad and good this product is. Before deciding to buy, Google iPad sync problems. There are many problems and they are real. I have had to restore my iPad at least 6 times to get it to work and right now it is a paper weight. It does not synch with my latest edition Dell laptop. No music. No apps. I will update this review at a later point and hopefully it gets better at some point in the future.Beware. Their are issues that are major with syncing with iTunes. When it does work it's great. Right now it is not working.
Five years ago I didn't believe that Apple had anything more significant to offer than a fancy MP3 player. Apple computers are still a novelty to at least some degree,  and I fully accept that. The iPhone is what led me to believe that Apple had the potential to change the landscape if mobile computing. The iPad is something I have been waiting for since I unwrapped my iPhone. The idea of a larger screen mixed with a seductively beautiful and wildly simple user interface made me ready to throw my laptop out the second the iPad was announced in San Francisco. The iPad is not perfect, but in my experience no computing product has ever achieved that distinction. Upon unwrapping the device the customer is struck by the familiar face of an iPod Touch enlarged to dramatic proportions. This visual has become one of the most harsh criticisms which the iPad has had to endure. Apple has a knack for innovation wrapped within the familiar. Upon a quick sync with iTunes the home screen opens with the sparse series of apps most familiar to owners of the first generation iPod Touch: Settings, iPod, Photos, iTunes, calendar, YouTube, mail and contacts, maps and the app store. The look and feel of each of these apps is considerably more expansive and longtime owners of iPhones will instantly fee an almost palpable sense of freedom as their fingers have space to explore, to touch the giant virtual buttons Apple presents.  When connected to Wi-fi the user is able to begin expanding their library of apps through the App Store. Thus brings me to one of my primary concerns with the iPad, price inflation. My first purchase was Angry Birds HD, an app which slides in at a wallet-crunching 6 dollars considering the gameplay is nothing more than flinging little birds against large structures to destroy little green pigs. One finds that 90 percent of iPad apps suffer from this rampant price inflation which will leave most users groaning. I have hope for the iPad app store, however despite the rampant sales of the iPad it is at best a niche product, thus the so-called "gold rush" for ipad exclusive apps might be somewhat overplayed.  From a hardware standpoint the iPad is just as capable and well-developed as any piece of Apple hardware. The touchscreen is responsive and the screen is bright and vivid. The keyboard requires a learning curve and if you have never used a touchscreen Apple product you have a long road ahead of you. I personally had little problem with it (I composed this review on my iPad). Finally, a note about iBooks. The iBook store has a beautiful format an reading is a pleasure. The major issue arises from the lack of selection at the time of this writing. This problem can be fixed with the Kindle app from Amazon which brings the robust library of Amazon to an equally attractive and comparable E-Reader to their flagship Kindle device. The battery life allows for a vast amount of tasks to be performed on a single charge, including games, video and other tasks which would typically be considered very draining on battery. As I have already mentioned, e iPad as a device is not perfect, but it makes an excellent companion and you'll soon find your laptop collecting dust.
This tablet did not live up to all the hype for me to be completely happy.  I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.  I am looking into the Gigabyte M912x Notebook Umpc 160g 8.9" Touchnote Mr or the Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook (Black).  They're around the same price point and have  touchscreens that swivels to fold into a tablet and then fold back into a netbook for protection.You buy an Apple product for the cool apps and this device is no different.  I love the concept of the gadget but need it to perform more work to justify the purchase to myself.  I do not need another media device.  I have my fingers crossed that the 2nd generation will be better.
First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips.  I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc.  What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user.  I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices.  There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for.  I purchased a game "Super Monkey Ball 2" for iPad and it looks and plays great!  I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good.  Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me.  Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie.  Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads "Safari Cannot open page  because the server stopped responding". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection.  Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem.  Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release.  It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection.  It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads "not charging".  I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem.  I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users.  The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read.  It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger.  If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection.  When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in.  The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from.  The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol  I have also used the internet radio while in the shower.  You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast.  Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations.  I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest "Batman" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off.  I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed.  However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it.  Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad.  You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens.  I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual.  the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting.  You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button.  The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change.  If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop.  Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook.  For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are.  Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing.  Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed "OMG" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted "OMB".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word "gay" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.  If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.
First if you want the quick sumery here it is. Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.The good...- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.The Bad...- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.Overall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.
I received my new iPad this past week and have been exploring the capabilities. I have to agree that the iPad is a very impressive device. I've only used my iPad with my home wireless network, but I anticipate that will I use it for casual browsing and reading more than my laptop. For more detailed browsing, correspondence, etc., the iPad is not really a practical alternative to the laptop. The iPad is well suited for the social networking functions with some nice apps for accessing Facebook, Twitter, etc. For those who are considering purchasing an iPad, I recommend it for entertainment use though it is not an essential product for the average computer user.
**this is my first Apple product to own** I purchased the 32GB wifi version of the Apple Ipad. I did not purchase it for any other reason than for entertainment purposes, and for that it fufills everything I expected of it. I'm happy that I did not purchase the 3G version, because it was simple to tether to my 3G cell phone for free. Simple couple steps that saved me a couple hundred dollars. Also purchasing a ton of apps, and putting almost a thousand songs on the built in Ipod I haven't needed to think twice about the memory. Unless you download tons of movies, I wouldn't suggest to anybody purchase anything bigger than the 32GB version. I've come to realize most of the complaints that you hear about the Ipad are easily worked around (multi-tasking, flash player, etc).Pros:(1) the USER INTERFACE(!!!) is something that no "ipad-killer" (which by the way, you know you're with the right company with every other companies product is advertised as a "Ipod killer".. "Iphone killer".. "Ipad killer"..) haha, I mean lets be real, no consumer cell phone has ever "killed" the Iphone, Ipod, nor will any consumer product kill the Ipad nor come close.(2) the WOW FACTOR(!!!) everytime you're in public with this bad boy you'll get a ton of "ohhhhs" and "ahhhhs" which is definitely cool.(3) fast, responsiveCons:(1) expensive, but the cool factor helps(2) expensive(3) kind of stuck to the Apple world of Apps unless you jailbreak your device. not suggested, but i've never had any issues with my jailbroken device.(4) 70% of App Store apps are paid versus 30% of Android Market appsAll in all, I love my Ipad. Wouldn't take it back for the world! ENJOY!
I love the iPad, but I bought this using a gift certificate thinking it was the 64GB Wifi 3G. It was priced just a little bit more than the one on the apple store, but be careful.  This one is not 3GGGGGGGG, but its $130 MORE than Apple sells it! I should have been paying more attention, but this is the first time Amazon was soooo far over the price elsewhere. I was stunned. Learned a very good lesson.
I cant help but think the Ipad is a glorified Iphone but love its ability to play media and be used as a book reader.  The big negative for me is the inability to see any Flash product and all those web sites that run FLASH. I know Apple hates FLASH but really if you cant see thousands of web sites and the product is designed to browse the web I cant help but feel the customer has been placed into this fight and for $700 dollars I think it serves to only upset apple customers. I wish they would fix this and quick.  I don't want a $700 book reader or DVD player.
I travel several times a year and have wanted something significantly lighter than my MacBook Pro. The iPad easily fit in my shoulder bag for the flight. Very useful for a nine hour flight. The UI is excellent.The apps that I need are available and work quite well.Any drawbacks that I might mention are that many of the iPhone app developers have yet to configure theirapps for the iPad. So, we use iPhone version apps on the iPad. As far as functionality is concerned, there is no difference. The graphics aren't as crisp as the ones made for the iPad though.Next, is the keyboard. If you already have an iPhone, there's nothing to this. It's actually a bit better than the phone'skey board. My one request is that it be a bit bigger.Lastly, Flash will come in handy when it finally arrives on the iPad. There are rumors that a generic Flash softwarewill appear soon.I am very happy with my purchase. My iPad works well in cafes, the train, planes, hotel rooms, anywhere. You cancache a lot of web content on it so it isn't terribly necessary to have the 3G connection. The games are great as wellas the Kindle and iBook apps.
First, as some background, I am not a so called "Apple" person. I think I might be the only person that does not own an iPhone or any other Apple product. However, I was looking for a netbook and was intrigued by the iPad. I checked it out in the store and then went to a friend's house to play around with his. I was sold when I saw the Netflix app whereby you could stream your instant queue. I also thought the user interface was incredibly easy. So easy that I am planning on getting one for my mom who has never used a computer.I have been using it for 2 weeks now and the device is doing everything I would want from checking email to surfing the Internet. I am also watching television and movies on it and trying out the different apps. I have actually taken it to the store now because the epicurious app is great and I just shop for the recipes in the store. The only downside and the loss of 1 star is the lack of a front facing camera. I would have like to be able to use Skype on this device and most netbooks have this capability. I am sure Apple will put this in the next version and will certainly upgrade when that happens.
I've been playing with my iPad for about a week and am very satisfied with it. As people here have noted, it's not a replacement for a laptop, although the ability to download iWorks in an iPad version does help there. For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me. Other user's experience may vary. Whichever way you decide, good luck with decision!
Guess I'm not the only PC-loving fan that bought the iPad.  Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable & light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music & moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.  It does the job fine.
Ive had both Kindle 1 and 2, and the 'Pad as I call it, blows them away with reading.  iBooks has adjustable brightness, so it is every bit as easy on the eyes when done right.  I am now reading all the time!  Reading is the tip of the iceberg though, the Apps make this thing soooo awesome!
As with many Apple products, the form factor of the iPad is amazing and what is does, it does incredibly well. There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros: -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking "Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99."  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a "go back to your previous app" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.  Takes practice and a good aim!
FIRST, THIS IS A PERSONAL  "USE" REVIEW.  IT IS NOT A "SPECS" REVIEW. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "SPECS" REVIEW, THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR YOU.  THERE ARE A LOT OUT THERE.Having said that, ..........I love my IPAD!!!!!!It is so much smaller than a notebook and so much thinner than a netbook.On top of that, I use my iPad alot for web surfing, emailing, watching movies, and reading while on the elliptical at the gym.  Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.No other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone.I'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. Ijust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close toipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having saidthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.
Steve Jobs states that 'FLASH crashes and is buggy on the iPad'. Instead of blaming Flash, Steve, just admit that the problem is with the iPad not being able to handle Flash, and not t'other way round. The processing power of the iPad is just fine for most things, but it's just too slow for full-on Flash applications and movies. Don't blame already proven and successful technology for not working on something you've made that is technically inadequate. It reminds me of when children say, 'I can do that too, I just don't feel like doing it!'What Steve Jobs doesn't want to utter, is that the iPad just isn't powerful enough to do everything we want it to.Let's also not forget that such decisions are driven by the need to protect Content Revenue. Instead of delivering a product that you'd fully enjoy using, the only thing on Steve's mind is 'How much can we squeeze out of the punters on this one?' Okay, he's in business, and profits must be made, but if the profits are more important than user satisfaction, why should anyone feel any kind of loyalty to such a brand?If you've already bought the first-version iPad, you may love it, but there will of course be countless others who'll feel cheated not far down the line, when a much more powerful version is launched. Apple play the same trick time-after-time. Release the Basic Version, and when all the hype and sales start to slow, release a much better version that should and could have been released in the first place. This is because Apple knows that those who bought the basic version are so in love with Apple, they will happily fork-out for the better version too. One user - two sales. Cunning.In my opinion, Apple are happy to take advantage of almost fanatical loyalty and snob-factor in it's users to make an extra buck. Some may be proud to be an Apple Nut, but they're being taken advantage of in a very clever and cunning way. Style over Functionality.Steve; beef-up the processor, include a camera, memory slot and I/O ports, and stop this childish excuse for an excuse for not including Flash. Just be honest about it - your iPad isn't capable of running Flash. Not yet..
I'm wondering how Amazon can charge $947 for this item. It is only $849 on the Apple website. I was under the impression that Apple controlled the vendor prices. Anyway, for a better deal, go directly to Apple and purchase this.
Ipad its simply the best device from Apple. And it much more than fun. Its a powerful device to work. Many apps turns it to a desktop! Buy a 64GB ipad
I have owned my 32gig wifi iPad for about 3 months.  I don't believe there has been a day where I haven't used it.  Saying that I can't live without this product would be a bit much, but I can say I wouldn't want to.  I use it for many purposes, but mainly entertainment.  Movies are gorgeous on the screen, games are great and there are some games with incredible graphics that look amazing. I can't compare it to a kindle, cause I never used one, but in can say reading is great on the iPad.  The screen makes it so you can read in the dark, on the flip side, you can't really take it outside in the sun unless you get a shaded area, even then it's kinda hard to see the screen.I've seen a lot of reviews saying it's a bigger iPod touch, which it is, but that's what I love about it.  I owned the iPod touch for  about a week and sent it back cause I didn't find it that great.  When the iPad came out I thought it looked perfect because the size is perfect.It's a bit on the pricey side, but well worth it.  If you have the money, get this thing.
Don't get me wrong.  I like my iPad.  My biggest use for it is having on my lap while I watch TV.  Not including flash capability is really the only thing wrong with it.  I can run flash on my netbook and cell phone fine but not on my $500 tablet?!?!??!?  It's so annoying to surf into a site that uses flash.  I usually end up putting the iPad down to go to my main computer.The other thing that sucks is the connectivity options.  There's absolutely no reason why the iPad can't have bluetooth dial up networking with my cell phone.  Netbooks at half the price can do this but not the iPad?  Are you kidding me Steve?!?!?!
The iPad is an impressive devise if you just want to use it like an iPot touch, but it really needs from my point of view:- Folders to store files that can be directly accessed or by different apps - the same way as it is right now for the photos- Want to transfer files from my computer while connecting to computer by using the cable- Want to have access to folders to organize files and folders from computer to match content and documents I am carrying with me (I do not want to have everything in the cloud)- USB port to connect directly to printer and digital cameraI hope the next iPad will have those features to make it more usable as a travel computer. Without those, this is not realy a portable computer.
With the exception of the unfortunate name,  I love my iPad. All of the software that I've bought or downloaded for free works great. It hasn't frozen, or even slowed down once. I've already written two multi-page papers using Apple's Pages program and the onscreen keyboard, which is surprisingly easy to use. While writing a paper and doing research online, interspersed with playing several games, watching a NetFlix movie and checking my email, I got a full 11.5 hours out of the battery without having to plug it in. It's light, easy to carry, great around the house and outside.  I've already gotten rid of my pocket pc and my GPS, and haven't had to power up my laptop since I got it.  Now here's the real kicker, my somewhat elderly mother, who is technologically challenged, even likes to use it, she went and ordered one, saying that it is so much easier to use then her laptop and iPod. ( She checks email and cruises the internet on her laptop, and thinks the larger screen is much easier to see then her iPod )I recommend this to any and all.  This really is a great device.
I bought my wife the iPad for her birthday a few months ago, and she's very happy with it.  However, she mostly uses it to watch Chinese YouTube videos and to surf a small set of web sites.  She occasionally uses the built-in apps (NYTimes, ABCnews, etc.)  Again, she's very happy with it in this limited capacity.We're also both very happy with the build quality and the fact that it works just like our iPhones - so the learning curve is 0.Where the iPad really falls down is when you want to (or have to!) visit web sites that use Adobe Flash.  No matter what Steve Jobs says about Flash (it being a battery hog, etc.) he did his customers an extreme disservice not giving *them* the choice.  His claim that only a small part of the Web uses Flash is pretty much a lie.  Just try to visit any commercial site that attempts to show its customers 360degree views of its products - none of them display with the iPad.  We're not talking minor web sites - try [...] (you can't even see their main page with the iPad because it's *entirely* flash based), volvo.com, honda.com, toyota.com.  Many games web sites use Adobe Flash for their games - again, none of them display on the iPad (I won't even go into the iPad's inability to display Java - forget about all the web sites that use it for games, or other content).And there's pretty much no chance that Steve Jobs will ever change his mind with regards to supporting Adobe Flash on either the iPad or the iPhone or the iPod Touch.  He simply decided that you should not have a choice in this matter.So while we enjoy the iPad for what it does, I can't give it 5 stars - because it is unable to browse a large swath of the Internet.If you want to be able to browse *all* Web pages with a tablet, you're better off getting an Android 2.2 (or above) based tablet - such as the Samsung Galaxy and a slew of other forthcoming tablets.  They all support Flash.-------------Update (Feb. 1, 2013): It's now three years later and Apple still doesn't support Flash.  But, guess what?  IT NO LONGER MATTERS!  Most web sites have moved their content to HTML 5.  We've moved on from from our original iPad to the iPad Retina, and from there to the iPad Air.  And we've been deliriously happy with all of them!  An added benefit of buying Apple products: you get a decent trade-in value!  Each time we traded in our old iPads (by the way Amazon has a great trade-in program for iOS devices), we've gotten at least two hundred dollars.  The competition gets you next to nothing in trade-in (I know - I bought my parents a Kindle HDX 8.9" a bit over a year ago - that's already only worth $90 - on Amazon's own trade-in store!)So I'm upgrading the iPad review to 5 stars.  Flash is simply no longer an issue.
I've been using my iPad for past 6 months and to be honest I use it more than I use any notebook. This is the best thing that Apple has made in a long time. It's super easy to use, (if my mom can use it, anyone can) great battery life, amazing apps and games and nice look and feel to it.The future of computing will definitely not support mouse or traditional screens and interfaces. The future is easy to use touch screen programs that connect to everything around you. iPad is that fist step in that direction.Great product!
I have had the Ipad 64g 3G for a little over two week and I'm still just as addicted to it as I was the first day. I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad 3G you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi plus 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t.; The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book. Like it or not the iPad is a revolution and created a whole new device category and will do for tablets what the ipod and iphone did for mp3 players and cell phones.
There are many things about this that I would LOVE to change but this is the best tablet out there right now even though it isnt perfect it does what its supposed to do and it does it well.I got mine the first day it came out I was 6th in line ..It can be VERY awkward to hold .. that is probably the biggest complaint that I have about it.apple tries to "revolutionize" EVERYTHING and they always forget .. or just do not include the simple things that the cheap crappy tablets have which can be very annoying and a turn off in many cases.the lack of flash IS NOT A BIG DEAL .. flash was designed and ment for a use with a mouse, ex. "mouseclick, mouserelease, mousehover" flash is not needed and does not play nice with touch screens .. html5 is amazing and works 100 times better then flash would ever work on a tablet.many apps are very useful but with the devs having a limited use of api's and not being able to use private api's and the fact that ios is not open source gets annoying .. in which jailbreaking can come in handy .. but does not have a wide or as well trained devs and does not make as much money .. but all in all the ipad is great and will probly be only getting better and betterDO NOT GET THIS IF you want it just for a ebook reader , the kindle is much better for that, if you want it for a combo book reader and cus its amazing then you should get it but for just reading books get the kindle you will be much happier.
Having purchased the Apple iPad I am very satisfied with the purchase. As soon as Apple gets off of their horse and uploads the version 4 firmware to allow multitasking I will be more happy.Also a few things the iPad needs are a camera, a USB port (or two) to add storage then it will be almost perfect.
I've decided to tell you my thoughts on the iPad instead of listing technical specifications. Those are available on the Apple website.Physical and Visual Attributes (Snobby sounding, huh? Maybe the statistics that say most iPad owners are stuck up are right...)Firstly, it's just a big black and silver rectangle. It's not really what I would call beautiful, but it is pleasing to look at. Oh, who am I kidding! It's beautiful! Uhem.The brushed silver back is nice. It doesn't show fingerprints or scratches as much as the chrome or plastic that backs most portable Apple products. It's also cool to the touch, which I like.It isn't too heavy to hold, but it's going to be set on my lap most of the time anyway.iPod, Videos, and Photos (or, to go in chronological order, Photos, Videos, and iPod)The Photos app is actually incredibly nifty! When you open it up, granted you have put pictures on it, you're greeted with folders. Each one looks like a couple pictures laid out on a table.You can peak into one of them by pinching slightly or open one of them by pinching a lot. This is awesome and has to be seen to be fully appreciated. If you're not a fan of pinching, you can also just tap on a folder to open it right up.There are a few other interesting things that you can do with this app, but mostly it's for viewing all of your captured memories. Flicking from one picture to the next is fast and smooth.I really like the new look of the Videos app. It's much more...muchier. The bigger view of the DVD and TV show covers and the effect that happens when you click the play icon are both great. Oh, and I love watching stuff on the big screen!The iPod is a lot like iTunes. Instead of cover flow, there is a grid view of your music library. Other than that, everything is pretty much the same.Web Browsing and YouTubeAll of the people out there that don't like the iPad wish that Safari could view flash. That honestly hasn't been a problem for me, but maybe that's just because I don't make a habit of viewing flash-intensive websites.I think browsing the web on an iPad is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  Sliding your finger to scroll down a page and tapping or pinching to zoom both feel really natural.  I'm really happy that it doesn't take long to load pages and that I don't have to zoom much.YouTubeAs I've said before, the big screen on the iPad makes watching stuff really enjoyable.  The YouTube app adds tons of videos to it without taking up much space at all.  (Yes, I actually got a 1,000...GB iPad!)Using the app feels like you're on the actual website, but at the same time much better.  The quality of the videos are great, and searching for a particular one is...fun.That's one thing I think is really cool about Apple's gadgets.  They make doing everything fun!  How do they do that?GamingPlants Vs. Zombies HD is the best game app there is! Alright, now that I've got that out of my system, let's me just say that playing games on the iPad is a blast!Racing on it is like having a Wii in your hands.  However, I don't think the iPad could replace a Wii or DS.  Apps can really add up, so make sure you watch how much money you spend on them.Mail and KeyboardThe Mail app that's on the iPad is much more better than the one that's on the iPhone and iPod touch.  In portrait mode you see one of your e-mails, and in landscape mode you see a split screen view of one of your e-mails and a list of any others you've gotten.When you want to compose an e-mail, all you have to do is tap on an icon in the upper right hand corner.  A box will then pop up that you can type in, and so will a keyboard.  If you're in portrait mode, the keyboard that pops up will be smaller than if you're in landscape mode.They keyboard is much easier to type on than I thought it would be!  I can type almost as fast on it as I can on a physical one.ConclusionI'm not sure how Apple managed to make such a great tablet computer!  One of the things that's great about it is that you can add to the things it can do by getting apps.  Maybe that's one of the keys to it, the iPhone, and the iPod touch's success.  I'm very happy with mine.
Loved the flatness, the portability while traveling, the endless apps and all the free book downloads (mostly of the 'classic' variety).In the end, I returned it to the Apple store even paying the 15% restocking fee. I didn't find it appreciably better than my netbook except for size, and it had disadvantages even: no easy way for a non technical person to save photos, incredibly awkward while lying down - which is the way I often use my laptop/netbook, semi reclining.I know there are nice accessories that allowed it to stand up, and accessory keyboards, but in the end I just found it a gimmicky little toy. I heard a better version was coming this fall so I will look for that.If I were not a lover of physical books I would rate it higher, because the bookcase /library feature was cool. I just can't dive into the virtual books with the same interest -- perhaps I'm a dinosaur but there it is.
I know I'm a kid but I know a lot about tech stuff and please listen to me. The iPad is a great tool for e-mail, web browsing, and games. It has got a 1GHZ custom-designed CPU, 16MB of onboard RAM, and a dedicated 256MB GPU. However, there are a few downsides to the products. It lacks a webcam, can't run Adobe Flash videos and applications, has a virtual keyboard (not too bad on landscape-mode), and runs a smartphone OS. Overall, this is a great tool, but it can never replace a laptop.
The iPad lives up to the hype. I was a skeptic myself, but after owning apple products the past two years, I knew the company would live up to my expectations.  It is in no way just a large iPhone.I purchased the iPad 32gb wifi version and quickly began loading apps and movies. I also jail broke my version and am writing this review on the iPad itself!So far, I've noticed that the iPad is extremely efficient.The safari pages load quicker than my iPhone 3G and the apps open very fast.The clarity is unbelievable.  I think it's even clearer than my MacBook!The battery life is impressive.  I know it will withstand my 5+ hour flights from Boston to LA.  I watched a two hour movie this evening and played around with it for an additional few hours and my battery is at 56%.I was surprised at how great the volume level actually is. I expected it to not be that great, but when I was watching the movie earlier, I did not use headphones and found the sound quality perfect.  Additionally, the iPad does not emit any noise when processing.Apps:I just dropped a lot of cash on my iPad so I am not willing to spend money on apps yet.  I've explored the free ones exclusively.iBooks has me wowed.  Apple offers an array of free novels to meet anyone's taste.  Classics are my liking and I've loaded at least 15 of them.  You can bookmark your pages and skip chapters or browse.  I was impressed by how easy it is to read on the screen as well. I've never been a fan of reading on a computer, but this app opened my eyes to another world. I like having the ability to change the font size to meet my needs.Bloomberg did a great job of creating an app that offers financial news and personalization. I can track my stocks, track indices, and listen to podcasts.  I can't think of a more informative app out there.Installous. Everything your little hacker heart desires.  If you like installous on your iPhone, you'll appreciate it on your iPad.***********Edit:  Downside found!  Charging this device can be a pain.  I just hooked it up with a USB to my work computer (PC) and, the top right hand corner reads "not charging."  Apple's website states the following:"Some USB 2.0 ports and accessories do not provide enough power to charge iPad. When this occurs the message "Not Charging" appears in the status bar next to the battery icon."Be that as it may, other websites are claiming the Ipad still charges even though the screen states otherwise.  I haven't tested it out myself.  This link provides further details:[...]
The iPad 16 gb wifi only is the best value for money in the iPad series. The screen display is absolutely gorgeous as well as the overall finishing quality of the product. Internet browsing, checking multiple mail accounts, watching videos and pictures, listening songs or just spending loads of time playing games and trying out loads n loads of fun filled applications is just an out of this world experience. Ofcourse you can't compare the ipad to a regular pc or a laptop (when it comes to heavy document or graphic processing) but for everything else specially while being on the move there's the iPad.
I have the 16 GB Wifi iPad, and I absolutely love it! It's amazing what you can do with it! I have photos, music, mucic videos, games, Pages, Keynote, iBooks and more on it, and I still have over 12.5 GB of free space left! It's awesome! A must buy! This is way better then any netbook, and I'm a HP fan! And the volume on here is really awesome too! The only thing that isn't so awesome about the iPad is the price. I think it should be $400.00. But still, don't let the price stop you from owning this amazing device!
I have spent more than a week using the iPad and have found many pros and cons which should be considered before purchasing one.Pros: -The opening and closing of applications is very fast making the device very responsive.Watching Youtube video is very much better and clearer than on a PC or iMac.  Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook & internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called "DocsAnywhere" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.Conclusion: -For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible. The brightness overcomes this issue while the device is on.  I have certainly enjoyed using the device and will for the foreseeable future.
When these first came out, I could not decide if I was going to get one. A friend showed me theirs and I was hooked. Have had mine a few weeks now and have to say I love it. But, I love my iPhone, so why wouldn't I. I really see the iPad as a big iPhone. The only thing that I don't like about my iPhone is the size if the screen... well that has now been taken care of. But there is more... I am finding I can use this in meeting and I don't have to take my laptop in. Reading books is great because they are in color, something my wife's Kindle cannot do. I can watch videos to and from work as I ride the bus. For someone that commutes, this is a dream come true.Now there are issues and a new product like this will always have some. I have not had the issue with the wifi problem. It needs a stylus. I want to be able to write notes and this is not going to happen with my finger. Camera would have been nice and when the multitasking comes around this fall, that will be a nice addition. More drive space or a slot for some kind of memory card should have been there, this is a real issue with me, but other than that, I am very happy and really enjoy my iPad.
I don't understand all the negative reviews commenting on connectivity. My husband has no problem with staying connected with his iPad. I on the other hand cannot keep my less than 3 year old MacBook connected in the same room as his iPad. It is driving me crazy. We are using Airport. I had this problem before the iPad came into the house. Anyway my husband loves his iPad and says there is not one thing he would change about it, at least not now.
Caution: Ipad does not support Video playlist of any kind (music video/ podcast/ tv shows), means you can not configure to play 10 video clips to play one after another(it works just fine on Iphone) which also means when you are playing video forward button will never work...Got it on first day and usually using it every day, have iphone too, other than most of the usual known issues and features here are some which will help you to make a right decision...Ipad is perfect to watch a video...a video looks way better than any laptop you have...Speakers are low yes its true, I was expecting it to be little louder than iphone but it seems its just marginalFlickr/facebook all works so beautifully, this is a perfect device to show your picture portfolioused Slingplayer (iphone edition) and can say it works awesome with dishtv and slingbox solo, very clear...I use google newsreader for news and it works just fine (i dont like other newspaper apps very little content)Calender is looking good though event detail opens in very small screen which means not using the full screen available to display appointment better(iphone does)...appointment forward feature is not supported (iphone has same issue), any link (say for attending webmeeting) is not supported to click, means you have to copy the link test and open in safari to start webmeeting (iphone supports clicking http links directly) last snooze feature is not supported (iphone does not do it either and i hate iphone for not doing it, not sure how many times i missed a meeting because of that)Jump app is perfect for remote desktop...I would say just superb, I usually attend all my web meeting (ofcourse on flash) with that...audio transfer to IPAD works just fine, use it to access all office documents as wellOutlook mails do not get auto refresh, probably to save battery life (bad move from apple and I hate that)Netflix works superb though crash sometimes if you try to move fingers on screen when movie is playingMoving apps from iphone to ipad is breezeyoutube works very fine though playlist is still not supportedI am not looking to get 3G edition cause dont want to be bound by single carrier and 3g limitation (will buy cradlepoint PHS3000 travel router and use any usb modem with it to create wifi with 4G bandwith, it will save ipad battery life and allows 16 wifi devices, make sure you go for 4G version (hardware rev2 cost around $140))Ibooks/kindle both works very fine no issues here(well i am not a bigtime reader as well)Comics are just superb on IPAD...
I don't understand all the negative reviews commenting on connectivity. My husband has no problem with staying connected with his iPad. I on the other hand cannot keep my less than 3 year old MacBook connected in the same room as his iPad. It is driving me crazy. We are using Airport. I had this problem before the iPad came into the house. Anyway my husband loves his iPad and says there is not one thing he would change about it, at least not now.

it's not a full computer, don't expect it to be. it's excellent for surfing the web, viewing ipad optimized videos, and have great apps. apple didn't include a front facing camera because it wants to save those features future product releases. i know this is cruel of apple but you'll just have to live with it. best tablet on the market and no other tablet even compares. the blackberry playbook might give the ipad a run for its money if it's ever released. i am certain apple will launch a new model by the same the playbook is out.
After using the iPad for a few months I agree with the predominant points I see here, that this is a nice device, a pleasure to use, with some drawbacks (single threading and speed) and a Kindle competitor, but not a Kindle killer.I would add that in my experience typing is a big concern. I like to type on mobile devices so one of my first concerns was whether I could use the virtual keyboard. I was pleasantly surprised that the keys, in landscape mode, are just in the right place and I can basically touch type. I did buy the dock with its real keyboard but don't use it. The screen keyboard is very effective for me.Another pleasant surprise I got is that, while I agree that this is not the end-all for e-reading (vs. the Kindle and such), it is outstanding for video. With streaming services such as Netflix it can be a nice TV and movie viewer for a single viewer or even two people.Finally the reason I gave it four stars rather than five is because I am a heavy user of my iTouch and the iPad doesn't add a whole lot to the experience. For me I measure the value of the iPad against the iTouch which I had been a big user of for over a year before I bought the iPad. The iPad does offer the touch typing that I can't nearly match on the iTouch. I can only thumb-type (at best) on the iTouch so the iPad offers a real writing experience against the clumsy iPod typing experience. But otherwise the iPad just doesn't get a lot of use for my set of apps because of size. I have the iPod with me all of the time and the iPad is larger so I only use it at home as a lightweight laptop substitute.In summary I'd say Apple made a good, very appealing product. I would recommend it to an Apple fan or someone who wants an outstanding web browsing and video experience. A particular strength is the browser which has the legendary multi-touch interface in the iTouch plus the better screen real estate. I would say it is the best plain browsing experience I have had on any device. Kudos to Apple for wedging a product in that in-between category against laptops and netbooks.
Very happy with it especially during my business calls. I use in it in place of a daytimer for notes, follow-ups, and emails.It works for me!
On the whole not a bad device at all. Very ease to carry around and use just about anywhere and don't be put off with what you hear about this device not cutting it as a real productivity business tool. Yes granted it does not come out of the box with everything necessary for the average business man to do a "honest" days. Work but the right tools to get the job done are available.Just a couple of things Steve, a camera might go down a treat in the next itteration of this device and the most annoying thing so far to come to mind is the version of Safari running on this device is seen by many sites as a mobile version and even after using a browser which masquerades as another browser some sites still see the device as mobile which is rather limiting.The Bluetooth services work well with one exception that the older Apple bluetooth keyboards do not pair with this device. I guess it's time for me to donate to the coffers of Apple again. (no only joking Steve :) mine is getting a bit long in the tooth any way.I really do beleive this is a the turning point in the evolution of the tablet based device. Can't wait to see the next step in it's creation. Well Done! Steve and all of your innovative staff and associates.

5/1/10 - APPLE HATERS ARE REALLY OUT IN FULL FORCE ON THE IPAD....TRY THIS PRODUCT AT AN APPLE STORE OR BEST BUY ......I have had my iPad for 2 weeks and it is totally wonderful. The LED backlit screen is the sharpest and most accurate I have ever seen! The device is light, easy to move around, extremely fast and does browsing, books, music, photo's, email, and loads of other things perfectly and so so clearly. The iPad also has a characteristic regarding ease of use that no laptop or desktop or net-book has ever had. It feels like you are totally in charge-no mouse to learn, no keyboard to click, all one seamless piece of glass that works flawlessly and faultlessly. Wi-fi is wonderful and works all over the house and outside near the house. The screen is so bright that even in daylight sunshine, you can work and watch this baby. And my first charge watching 3 movies and loads of other things gave me 12 hours of battery. You actually forget that it has a battery!This is another game changer devise and I fully recommend it to anyone who wants a computer thats powerful yet the simplest one I have ever used or in my opinion ever built! This is one strong solid tablet and it will do the job! 100% recommended!!!
Since the day I have received my iPad, I have yet to dig out my 17inch HP laptop to use.  I have also cut down on the use of my quad intel core Dell pc desktop, which I use to use everyday like clockwork.  It is far more handy and quicker to activate and get online than my old laptop or pc, which take far longer to startup and go, the iPad is a punch and go device for me and very convenient to use, it has a few drawbacks, like the lack of flash but to me that's no biggie anyhow, flash is mainly for the poor Porno geeks who can't get laid anyhow.  All in all, I love it, get one today!
I can't say enough good things about this!I received this as a birthday gift, and really didn't think I would have much use for it. I was so wrong. It has been wonderful, even if you just consider the entertainment value.  The apps available have been wonderful, and have provided hours of entertainment for everybody in the family.Last week I was using it in the kitchen.  I had a recipe up on the screen, and when I wasn't sure exactly how to chop up the fennel, I put on a youtube video.For work, I am able to access and read documents, and make changes/highlights on them. Very useful for lugging around files to meetings. If there is wireless available, I can check email, do web research, all fairly unobtrusively (esp. great for meetings that have gone off track!).I like the ease of use for travel--very good size for using on a plane. I will admit that I don't really like to edit documents with this, it is more of a reading tool for me, although the productivity apps seem to be getting better over time.
The iPad aka Giant Ipod Touch was known the be the iPhone's prototype prior to the iPhone's release. I don't feel like searching this truth, so believe it or not.I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and have been using my iPad since i purchased it 3 months ago. I am 2 months into deployment and all the while I was flying to arrive here, I have been using it on a daily basis. Continue 8 hour movie watching, music listening, and game playing. While there are modification options (ie. Jailbreaking), it will do the simple and basic tasks of execution, but ONLY to your liking and with the dependency of other software to achieve such goals.I was unable, and still am unable to update my OS to 4.X because of internet related issues overseas. However, with what I have now, I can only say I am satisfied. My screen has been scratched with the dust development in Shindand; I have used it in 105 DEG. F. while here and no issues! This is an outstanding piece of hardware to own, seeing the possibilities and modifications can be endless, despite what Apple INTENDS.I recommend the iPad for people who are familiar with Apple products and who want to be familiar with Apple products. I am an Apple lover and eat them when I get the chance. Good luck in your future purchasing!
I use a laptop every day, all day. When traveling, lugging around the laptop bag was a PITA. So, got the iPod Touch. Though it is sweet, it's just a bit too small for weekend travel fun.I bought it because I wanted a bigger screen than the touch and did not want a 5 minute boot up that a laptop has.iPad fills the bill...perfectly. Bigger than the touch, instant boot up and a fantastic, intuitive, easy interface. And it fits in my travel bag. Fits perfectly in between a laptop and a Touch. Love it. No regrets whatsoever...
I won't repeat what other reviewers already mentioned.  I would've given the iPad a 4 or 5 star except for the crippled Bluetooth.  The iPad CAN'T connect to a Bluetooth GPS nor your cellphone using dialup networking.  Why?  So you would buy a 3G version and pay monthly fees to AT&T; instead.  Big BOO to Apple for putting AT&T; ahead of it's customers.  Of course, if you have a cellphone that can act as a wifi router (like Win mobile, symbian with joikuspot, android 2.2) you can have the iPad use it, but this drains the battery significantly, unlike Bluetooth that can last the entire day.
Thinking about getting one, but what's up with the price? Why in God's name this one is 300 more than what Apple has to offer? Very very confused.
I don't own one but I have played with one in the store and read about it. So if I am wrong about something then forgive me. This is basicaly a big itouch. In my opinion it is great if you want to do some web browsing or read downloaded books on it. Size makes it good to take on a trip so you can browse the internet or watch movies. Wrong! It doesn't have a stand that can pop out so it can be propped up so you can watch a movie. Imagine holding this thing while watching a movie for 90 minutes or laying it flat to type on the onscreen keypad and staring straight down on it. Or you can hold it with one hand and type with the other. You can buy a case that doubles as a stand which makes it bulky and it is not adjustable. You need a case for this because it doesn't have a lid like a netbook. Imagine this big screen unprotected as you carry it around. They hype this up with it's ability to look at photos and watch movies on. Well you have to buy their cables to load pictures or movies into it. There are no ports of any kind or memory card slot. Just their propietary port for their cable. And what good is having your pictures loaded in it if you can't print them or transfer them easily.I would strongly suggest you to take a look at the Acer aspire 1410-2497 11 inch netbook (anything smaller will be a pain to stare at)and weigh out your needs and usefulness of something like this. An adequatley equiped netbook can do everything the ipad can and a whole lot more. Can you do your Microsoft word documents, spreadsheets, print, etc. on an ipad? No. And also when in keypad mode the keypad takes up like half of the screen. With a netbook you have a dedicated screen. You can get a Netbook loaded with features for less and it is a real computer. Add up the costs of adding the optional case/stand, keyboard, business apps, etc. How much is your ipad now.Gripes I have with Apples i devices is that you can't just pop out a dead battery and pop in another one and be on your way. No memory card slot so you can upload or download content. And the kicker is they do this on purpose because they don't want you to have the ability of more memory. Like the iphone, itouch, ipod they will market a device with unbelievable little memory. The following year they will market their newer model with a little more memory and charge you more and so on. What kind of scam is this.If you want one to take on vacations and to be able to look up places to eat or just to take to the coffee shop and do some web browsing then just get an itouch. It will serve it's purpose less expensive and you can carry it in your pocket and have with you all the time. On vacation it can come in handy. Most places have free wifi now. And if you have kids, just whip it out when they drive you crazy. Sure it's smaller than an ipad but your not going to carry an ipad around with you everywhere on vacation.So great for lounging, web surfing, read digital books. Heavy typing or business or school work, no. Netbook little more bulky but can do everything and more. It does have it's place in the world but unless they make a built in stand, put in a usb port, and a memory card slot don't bother. Some argue that it is great for presentations. Yeah but you have do all the work on a computer first and then pull out the cable to load it onto the ipad. You can't make any changes or print anything so now you have to go back to your computer again. Unless you use the ipad apps. And I believe the apps are limited on what you can do. I can understand the iphone and itouch with limited potential because they are meant as pocket media devices. But what makes the ipad such a leap forward besides its bigger screen?Everyone is allowed to agree or disagree. I am just trying give some thoughs for people to think about before buying. Some may be fine for what it does, but some might expect more. Ask a lot of questions and verify.
My after-one-month review:I think this thing will end up being kinda big. It's not perfect (typing at length without a keyboard attached, for example... but at least you can bluetooth a keyboard to it) but there will be a large number of interesting apps and games (there are already a number of eyebrow-raising apps out there such as virtual touchscreen music controllers, board/card game simulators, and streaming media consumption apps). It is in fact not merely a "giant iPod Touch," although to be sure that's some of it. Huge pluses are the interface responsiveness at all times and the long battery life coupled with the size/weight. (Hate it or not, that's what you get when 1 company designs the chip, the OS and all the other hardware.) It does not have a really powerful CPU, though, but you won't notice unless you attempt a heavy data-processing task such as running HTML5 Javascript Canvas demos. 3D games work surprisingly well. When OS 4 comes out, the multitasking will make this even more killer. The games coming out are really cool, for what that's worth.Completely unexpected benefits: 1) For years I was looking for a way to attach a laptop to my treadmill. The iPad fits PERFECTLY on the treadmill shelf. 2) Long car rides with passengers? This could be the ultimate kid pacifier slash map/directions device (with the 3g version). 3) You do in fact start using it more than your laptop, especially for "couchsurfing" and "bedsurfing" (and, uh, "poopsurfing") 4) AirVideo + your movie collection (in any formats) + available anywhere on the internet = amazing.Basically, this fits the bill better for anything that is not serious working or serious gaming.I see a lot of reviews here dinging bad wifi or the lack of this or that feature (sd card reader, camera, etc. etc.) I have not had any wifi problems with my Linksys router. Also, you may want additional features in this device but they would 1) add cost and 2) reduce simplicity, battery life, etc. This is a device of compromises, and I think Apple picked them well even as I know future iPads will probably add more features. If you are looking for SD card readers or USB ports (camera kit notwithstanding) or better data processing then you are really missing a netbook or a full fledged laptop in your life. If there's one feature I wish it had, it would be a camera on the back side to make possible even more amazing "augmented-reality" applications.Lastly, one review talked about an attempted iPad trojan on his setup. I'm sorry, but perhaps it is time to place part of the blame on your attack-vector-infested operating system ::cough:: Windows ::cough:: before you criticize the iPad for trojan attempts. ;) As usual, the situation could probably be improved but Apple stuff still ends up working much better with other Apple stuff.
If you are used to dealing with Amazon, and then you start dealing with Apple, pray that you never have a problem with the product. Amazon stands behind their products and gives the customer the benefit of the doubt. Apple is very difficult when you have a malfunction. I had to go to small claims to get my money back for something that was not my fault,after dealing with Apple service for two months. read their return and repair policy carefully.
I'm liking my iPad a lot more than I thought I would. Reading on it is a pleasure, especially on a crowded train. The New York Times free app has enough stories to get me to and from work, and the ebook reader is quite easy to use. There are a ton of free books out there, mostly books in the public domain, but that's fine with me since I like to read old literature. The music and game apps are numerous and very good. The web is extremely fast and the pad "just works".On the downside, the iPad doesn't come with a clock or alarm clock utility. You can buy apps written for this purpose, but, since there's no multitasking, you can't depend on them to work. For example, if you have a meeting scheduled, and your alarm clock app set, the meeting notice will pop up and prevent the alarm on the clock from ever going off.Magazines look awesome on the iPad, particularly Wired and Time. The downside is that you can't buy a subscription and have to pay a very inflated price. Hopefully, this will change in the near future. I wish more magazines were available, and I wish I could get the entire New York Times delivered to the iPad in one fell swoop since I don't have a wifi connection on the subway I ride (the workaround is to go to all the articles before leaving the house, which puts them in a cache for reading later).Another downside is that you still have to sync the pad to itunes to do any kind of backup or file transfers, and the sync HAS TO be done via cable. At this point, with such a poweful technology, I cannot believe Apple doesn't just automatically sync/backup the ipad wirelessly when it gets near its "mother" computer. Likewise, there should be some way to map the free space on the pad as a drive to transfer files to and from the device.The glare problem is bad if you're trying to read in bright sunlight, but I read mostly at night in bed and on the subway so it's not an issue for me. The backlighting is actually very nice for reading in bed.Overall, a very nice device. The screen size is just right to watch movies and TV on the go. Lots of apps are available. The word processor and spreadsheet app (sold separately) are very nice, even if syncing back to a PC or Mac is a bit of a pain.I've been taking my iPad on trips instead of my laptop PC--it is a good device for travelling and lets me get basic work done (e-mail, web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets).I'm sure the device will only get better over time.Please note that amazon's price for the 64-gig model is higher than buying it at the Apple store, even after tax.
I'm no nerd, so something that's basically self-explanatory is great for me. Ease of use is awesome. The thing's gorgeous! Love the screen quality. I have an iPod touch and iPhone 4, this is perfect to use in bed or on the couch. It's just the right size - bigger than iPhone, which is nice when you're writing longer emails or watching a movie, but not as clunky as a notebook. I love mine :-)
is a good toy device . is easy to use and connect and all. the shiping was fast and in the tome that saw to me the seller. excelent
It's just what I wanted for my birthday. I use mine everyday. It's wonderful to have. I love playing the Tap games on it as well.
It is a great device on days you can find uses for it. Unfortunately On days I can't find uses for it it goes unused. On days like that you feel awful. It is very snappy and a pleasure to use.Bottom Line: A great device if you can find uses for it.
I purchased this product at amazon and since I am not in USA now, I got it shipped to another country. The package arrived well before the estimated time and in good shape. I have been purchasing from amazon for a long time now and their brand reliability is legendary.
I love my iPad but the only drawback (and it's really starting to bug me) is that Adobe flash does not run on it. So many websites use Adobe and I'm getting tired of seeing the "flash player needed" message over and over. Apple really needs to sort that out. Everything else about the iPad is perfect! Love it!
I bought this iPad back in June and I must say I was very excited.  I've watched to keynote with Steve, but was quite disappointed the lack of features like a camera & 512mb Ram like the iPhone 4, (iPad has only 256mb of Ram).  But that didn't stop me from wanting one as a travel companion.As soon as I opened it up, I was just amazed on its beauty, 9.7" display was oh so gorgeous, OS ran smooth like silk.  I couldn't wait to download many many apps. I use this thing every single day, take it everywhere I go, for email, internet, reading, Netflix/video, games, notes, music, GPS, the list goes on!!I am pleased with my purchase, and I hope you future iPad owners are as well. :):DP
Just putting in my two cents, but this thing is amazing. I have been working with computers since cpm days andI have never had so much fun.  Some of the reviews I have read hear don't make any sense (the iPad is not heavy!)Having used this now for two weeks, there is no going back.
I've had my iPad for about a month now.  I use it several times a day.  I have used my netbook twice in that same time period - once to set up the iPad the other to transfer some pics.  The desktop is gathering dust. It doesn't get much better than this.
iPad is a bit intimidating at first.  However once you master the device, iPad becomes your second nature.
Amazing, a big iPhone with no USB port and no Flash!With many thousands of website developers integrating Flash into their websites and applications it is a sad thing to see Apple escalate their petty feud with Adobe by not including Flash in their hardware. Rather than hurting Adobe, Apple is instead hurting their customers web experience as well as showing their lack of respect for the millions of on-line business's that use Flash with this childish omission of a popular and long running web application.Once the darling of the computing world, with this ugly act, Apple has alienated millions of people who use the web. Apple is only hurting their own users and potential clients, as well as their reputation. Apple is soon to become the next disliked big company going the way of Microsoft.A company as big as Apple is expected to show a more mature attitude and lead the community as well as the world. It is a shame to see Apple become just another greedy company using it's power to hurt and destroy others. As long as Apple can settle a score with Adobe, it does not matter who else they trample underfoot along the way, or how much their interfere with their clients enjoyment of the web.
Be careful, this is the WiFi version for the WiFi+3g price.  Misleading and Amazon should take off!
It took me 30 minutes to get tired of the iPad. Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information.2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text. - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch.Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over.
iPad is one of the best devices I purchased ever ... it is really going to be the next generation of mobile computing ... with 3G and App store I got all I need to do my job as a university teacher
I would like to get this product. After searching around I am amazed that I can purchase this SAME EXACT Ipad at either BestBuy or WALMART for only $499.00. Why is that?  I make almost all these type purchases from Amazon, but will probably purchase this locally only cause of the price...
Why does Amzon allow such price gouging from some of it's vendors. These iPads are priced almost one hundred dollars above retail.Apple iPad Tablet (64GB, Wifi + 3G)
Hi,I am technical director at a software company. It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.I like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.My conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.From a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from "internet disks" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to "internet disks".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses "tricks" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings
Just wondering why anyone would pay over retail for an item you can buy retail direct from apple and have it ship within 24 hours for free. With some Apple devices you can get free engraving. (NOT SURE ABOUT IPAD)I would like to hear from someone who bought this from Amazon. I think Amazon should be ashamed of itself. Please post your reason for buying from Amazon .....
I have owned this for several months, and use it more every day. Highly recommended.
I was introduced to the Apple Ipad  by my sister.I fell in love with it.  I haven't turn my desktop computer on for at least three weeks because everything that I used it for I can do on my Ipad.  If your haven't purchased one yet, what are you waiting for?  You will truly enjoy this.  Oh, and by the way, it is very easy to setup and use.
The Ipad is all I hope it would be.  I use it for business and pleasure..
My 8 year old son has autism.  His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking.  This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him.  So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son.  He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him.  He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting.  There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (NOT covered by insurance).  We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle.  But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad.  I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything.  I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device.  (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc.  Then don't buy it.  But you won't convince me.  I've been using my son's - and now I want my own!  Books, email, etc.  I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids.  Last night I was playing Monopoly with my daughter on the family room floor while tracking some of these packages that I'm expecting.  Also, there are apps that I can download which I haven't even explored yet.
I no long use my netbook since I got the iPad. This device is totally awesome.
No flash, too heavy to read books, no webcam,,therefore no Skype, can't just view all those videos your children send you by email, screen too touchy, no USB port, apps are too expensive and most are inferior, too heavy to carry around in a large handbag or tote, 3G is ridiculously expensive and the price of the iPad is way too expensive for just a pretty face. As for support, forget about it. I spent months downloading library books and my own CD music. Then one day it was all gone. I called Apple and they said I could pay for assistance but I was past the 3 mos mark for free help. Are they kidding. Hours upon hours of downloading was lost and they do not care. One day a new tablet will come out to blow them out of the water. The kindle and Nook already blow them away as to ease of reading and weight. Any tablet that is lightweight will be better. Their apps are a joke. This is like the childrens story about the Emporer who has no clothes. There is no substance, it's just about more money for music, books, audiobooks and videos. Limited compatibility with free library content on purpose. Foolish purchase!
I was hoping this would be able to stand alone as a computer should, more so as a portable device. I was hoping not to need another device to bring along to my Acer netbook. it was on a recent trip to Puerto Rico that I was able to compare the two.In terms of reliability, as a travel computer, the netbook wins. My hotel, Sheraton, only uses wired connection (Ipad was pretty much useless). Also, web pages load differently in the Ipad and I'm always wondering if I'm missing information I would have seen on my PC. Videos are always hit or miss. Imagine pulling up a video and 50% of the time it won't work.However, the things that it does do, it does well. it shows pictures remarkably well. it has much more decent battery life than my netbook and it shows web pages (those that it can handle) easier for me.On my next trip however, the netbook will be my companion and the IPAD stays home.
I purchased this iPad w/ 3G  for family use when in the car, travelling, etc.  However, many of the educational sights and many shopping sites require Adobe Flash Player to be installed.  Apple has seriously crippled the effectiveness of the device without Adobe Flash Player.  Apple should be up front about this limitation but is not.  I'm totally disappointed that my children can not even use their school site b/c Adobe Flash Player is missing. While the graphics driver is great, it is not useful without the programs I, as the consumer, would like to use.
Android and WebOS tablets are coming, so why buy now when the next version of the iPad will have to have more memory, a higher screen resolution and multi-tasking to compete.  Apple products are innovative, but they only become worth the premium Apple charges when competition forces them to refine their offerings.  I'll wait until the iPad2 emerges, or until someone else offers a price competitive product that gives me what I want: instant-on web browsing in a tablet.
I bought an Asus Netbook that I tried for 2 days.  In my opinion, netbooks are worthless gimmicks.  The iPad is hands down the best portable computing device ever.  It is fast, easy to use, good looking, and the battery seems to last forever.
I for one was excited when the announcement came out about the iPad. Unlike friends and colleagues, I looked past the funny name and lack of camera and saw something big coming. Once I had the device in my hand I knew it was a winner - could anyone doubt Apple? Sure there are some missing pieces, but this is the beginning of something really great. I can't remember the last time I was enthused about technology.Now I'm addicted. I carry my iPad back and forth to work, to meetings, and I'm prone to checking the iTunes store for new apps every few hours. Its like Christmas almost every day. There are so many wonderful apps already out, more on the way, and those that are out now are improving with updates constantly.I don't think the iPad (or similar copy-cat devices) will be for everyone... I'm sad for those who don't see the potential or will never find a good use for something like this. Love or hate Apple, this is honestly the game changer it was billed as - it will change your life for the better.Its not a large iPod, its not a netbook, its not a laptop replacement.. or is it all of these things. Thats for you to decide. Once you try it you will know, and the uses will grow every day.I didn't see the iPhone coming, but this one was obvious. Just watch out because your life will change.
It's fun ... it's ok ... it's not amazing. I already have an iPhone, so it's really just a big iPhone. If you don't have an iPhone, though, you will love it.
Now that i have the iPad I only use my iPhone for calls, I rarely use my laptop, I'm always on thisAmazing science fiction magic iPad. Play the piano, produce lovely paintings, play games, watchmovies, read books! A USB port would be nice, but the iPad is a lovely bit of imagining.
I won a 64G 3G iPad from Rush Limbaugh several weeks ago, and since receiving it I have been absolutely satisfied with handy devise.  I now have a reason to put digital copies of movies on an Apple product, surfing the internet while mobile much easier, it's easier to carry around than a laptop... The list goes on and on.My only complaints so far has been the need for Leopard software on your Mac computers.  I only have Tiger so I am forced to use my PC's iTunes.  The other is the price.  This thing is friggin expensive! Yes I got mine for free, but I wouldn't have paid basically 900 dollars for this tablet.All in all this things is awesome! I would advise waiting a year or two when they become more common place and cheaper.  anyway I give it a 5 out of 5!
I love the ipad sure their are some needed updates like a usb port... but still love it. wishful thinking on my part that such updates do occurs we can get discounts... eh, not gonna happen? i know. so are you looking to by a ipad, I got a brand new one :)
It's a terrific toy when I am connected, but unfortunately I purchased the wrong ipad.  I deeply regret that I did not purchase the one with G3 capability.  It would make a great GPS; maps on the ipad are much easier to see than those on my iphone.At home where I have wifi, it is very convenient to use it for reading email, surfing the web and watching utube in my "reading chair."  However, for text only books, the Kindle is much easier to hold. It is slower than my desktop which is on the same wifi, but I tire of setting at my desktop all the time when I use a computer.  Sometimes I read on my Kindle and look up places and characters on my ipad.Frederica Shockley
Well, I just received an iPad as a present. Initially, I wanted to return it for a refund and get the Kindle, but it sounds like my wife may want the iPad. So, I decided to open it up and play with it and possibly get the Kindle for myself. I will have to wait until I get home however, because you cannot use the iPad without first connecting it to a desktop/laptop and going to iTunes. This further reinforces my desire for a Kindle over the iPad. I do not like iTunes and its many restrictions to begin with, and the only reason I wanted something like this was to read books. Something it appears the Kindle excels at.The iPad weighs nearly 1 pound more than the small version of Kindle which I am interested in (this makes a difference when I go backpacking); has a backlit LCD display which will fatigue my eyes (although this would be nice to read in the dark with); needs an available wi-fi to have functionality on the go (which is an additional charge in many places); runs through batteries in a fraction of the time; and basically has a lot of neat features, but features that I will rarely use once I check them out and when I would use them, I am already near a desktop/laptop that has them.On the other hand, Kindle is light, has a long battery life, is easy on the eyes, and connects free to cellular networks when needed. Amazon, you have it right. Keep Kindle a reader and only add features that support and enhance reading, and you will have no worries in "competing" with iPad.This is a bit like comparing a pen and paper to a computer. They are two totally different things that have something in common, but neither is better than the other in general. The Kindle is designed for a specific use and seems to do that well. While the iPad is confused about whether it is a notebook/ereader/desktop. What's funny, while the iPad tries to make itself the everything device, it fails to include a camera. Even my cell phone has that. Oh well, I guess I'll have a small device to take on vacations and road trips with me to watch movies and check the web, but it will not substitute for an ereader.
ok let's see, the iphone already does 90% of the tasks featured here. you can play a game, read a book, browse the internet, play mp3's and look at pictures. only here it's just bigger. minus the phone. and it doesnt even have a USB port or flash support (or wireless sync). and it's not a computer either . for this price why not buy a netbook? at least a net book has the ipad's features and more (even if you wont be able to 'enjoy' clicking on glass instead of a keyboard): it's actually a full computer.if you favor attitude over functionality, the ipad is your next best gadget to buy. it's thin, shiny and attractive.it's somewhere between the iphone and a netbook but misses crucial functions the iphones and netbooks (and laptops, in short) already have for a smaller pricetag.everybody wants the ipad. but do people actually need an oversized, overpriced and brainless browsing board?now if Apple manages to put a cpu into this, i'll be the first to buy one, as i work in heavy graphics (and carrying an electronic drawing pad/computer is also a great ecological alternative to paper), but for now, the ipad's functions havent convinced me to set myself back 600-800$.
I received my iPad the other day and it is amazing.  I was surprised at how easy it was to use and function.  Even my 70 year old grandmother was using it!  This is saying a lot since she is computer illiterate and is scared of them.  She used ipad for 5 minutes and was HOOKED.  She has already placed her order for one.  $500 is a little on the higher end but I was able to get mine for free on this site: [...].  I initially saw this discussed in USA Today and gave it a try.  Turns out it ACTUALLY WORKED and they shipped to my house for free.  Give it a try and get the BEST electronic toy out there today
After much research on the net and watching my cousin struggle to use his Ipad at home and work we discovered that its very much the router that you use. For some odd reason the Ipads don't like certain ones. For example we used a Belkin wireless N router and had the constant drops and asking for passwords, but had no problems with the regular laptops. After that we tried a linksys and the connection was pretty good, and only cut out maybe once or twice within a few hours, last but not the least the netgear, which was only a g connection wouldnt work at all, which shouldn't be even though it was an older router. We found the best results to be from a wireless modem, this is the best way to go for the ipads, as i said we had 3 other laptops with each router and they all worked great. I'm not really sure why this problem exist, but even manual setup would not work correctly. The wireless modem was a motorolla and the connection is solid and fast. I work on computers but i don't deal with Apple/Mac very much at all, and personally i'll stick with what i know. Now lets just see what Microsoft copies and puts out there next year.:)On another note: None of the wi fi hotspots worked right, if they did it was very slow or weak.
I tried taking the IPAD on a few biz trips, but since you cannot save and manipulate files very easily, its causes challenges.. Overall, my son watches yo GABBA on it and it has saved us on long flights and car rides.. Better than DVD player in a car since it can be removed after.. Giving it 5 stars only because its an awesome toy/gadget for my son and family.
So worth the money, actually writing this review on my Ipad...best purchase ever for the money.
I brought this item from the Apple website, I had to wait weeks before I got it. It's fast, easy to use, and plays video, but not flash. Of course, I use it to surf the web, check email, and make small purchases. All in all, this is a pretty neat item. Not to replace a laptop, or a netbook, but something to carry around the home, instead of some bulky laptop, or netbook. Looking forward to more apps, and feature updates. When I'm not using it, it makes a great digital picture frame. Battery life is descent, not to meantion connectivity, it's descent. Don't expect much though, all in all, I like my Apple Ipad.
I think I hopped on the bandwagon way too soon. I saw this device at my local Best Buy and like a lamb being led to the slaughter, I foolishly bought it not realizing what I was getting into. I was not aware it could not handle the multitasking I thought it could. I was so excited that I was not aware that it was missing a camera and I thought I would be able to ditch my smartphone but reality hit me tha I can't even talk on this thing even with the 3G iPad. Then when I wanted to download an application, it wouldn't work, I then realized that I had to go through iTunes on my other computer which I had to deauthorize in order to use my iTunes songs on the iPad. The iPad looks nice but I am seriously disappointed with it now, even the gaming experience is not what they make it seem and I thought I'd get a better hang of the racing games but no matter how much I try, it's just not ergonomical for games that I like in the first person unless somebody comes up with a fix for this. I noticed it also has become increasingly heavy just to hold like a book, a fact I overlooked in my initial excitement. Maybe by the end of the year Apple will be more in tune and offer multitasking and other features that I get on my notebook, but the 500 bucks I spent is now virtually money thrown away because I am Jonesing for something better for the iPad or just a better version of it.
Another superb product from Apple!!  No problems with this product, very easy to operate, minimal learning curve.  The number of apps available grows by the day.I highly recommend this product!!
Don't waste you money on this over-hyped IPHONE (sans the phone). I got one as a gift (Father's Day) with ALL the bells and whistles (my wife spent over $1000). Now don't get me wrong. I appreciate the thought.....just not excited about the gift. But, now I have to carry it with me in my briefcase everywhere I go and lie to my wife that I love it! I guess my hope was that it would be useful for business; unfortunately it is more a toy than a tool.
I have had my Apple iPad 64GB 3G since May 2010.It is truly the best and most useful device I have ever owned. Period !Nothing else even comes close !Buy it now if you don't already have one.

We traveled by car throughout Western Europe October '10 and purchased the non-3G unit specifically for this trip. The WiFi worked well for most (90%) of the time when I finally learned the drill. We had few reservations and it was most useful for searching out (and then getting to) the next day's sightseeing and the next night's hotel, hostel or B&B.; As a side note, it won't replace a cell phone for pricing, availability and confirmation.  I've been PC and my wife has been Apple for years. I won't bore you with the amply listed pros and cons of this product so well documented in other reviews but I will say that the usefulness and convenience of this specific item has made me a convert/believer. So why did I sell it for a modest loss when we returned?  The answers will be obvious as the 2nd and 3rd generations arrive.
First of all, YES, I actually got to play with it.Secondly, YES it looks really sleek and the display is pretty when you don't have direct light on it.I really like the ipad idea, I really do, but for over $500 I still won't be able to play standard DVD on it?I like the fact you can use netflix streaming, which to me is very cool, but I can't play any of the DVDs or Blu-rays I already have.  I'd have to decode them on another computer or buy them again in itunes.  That SUCKS!  I'm not trying to repurchase everything I already own again.I don't care that it doesn't have a camera, but what's with the tiny storage space.  My ipod which is a much smaller device has more space than the ipad. If I can't play DVDs, that means I'd be buying the movies or TV episodes on itunes and then I'd run out of storage space.  That's not cool.  I realize that one of the reasons the ipad seems so powerful is because it doesn't have to struggle with a fully loaded OS and a DVD drive.  I get it.  I'd love to just have one device to do it all.  If I am still using my laptop to do all of my other chores then what's the point?  That's why I'm waiting for iPad 2.0, or 3.0.  When some of thee issues are surely to be address.  Hope the success continues, so they can make better and cheaper ones.
THE INTERNET WAS FAST AND EASY TO USE BEST THING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! DEFENITLY
It has excellent screen and a nice oprating system but WIFI does not work - unstable, horrible connection, dropping it all the time. APPLE support is incompetent - they say "change brightness??" basically, trying to get rid of you. I made a big mistake buying it.
First off its an inanimate electronic device nothing more.Save your passion and love for the PEOPLE in your life should you be so blessed.No USBNo SD SlotNo Security softwareNo Camera or VideoNo Tethering to anythingNo Voice RecorderNo CalculatorNo WeatherNo FlashNot a true user configurable tablet PC nor is it a true user friendly portable device (Room to Room) does not count.It is a considerably dumbed down, denuded and stripped down iphone, iguess with no phone......wow.......how inovative.Curious, how does it feel to be an unsolicited beta-tester ?It is also a huge content pig providing considerable additional profit for apple by driving up the cost of ownership skyhigh........ca-ching.App. buy ins could potentially soar into hundreds of dollars again rasing the cost of ownership...........ca-ching.USB was specifically excluded to prevent users from connecting 3G broadband devices from providers other than at&t.........can; you spell verizon ?Any well configured HD notebook will leave this Gen-1 tablet in the dust and for similar dollars.A failed attempt at being the first on the block with the newest thing mentality by Obi-Wan Jobsand this from the same genuises who brought their customer base the NEWTON.You apple weenies got seriously hosed.Read and weep......"Engadget also suggested said that the next-gen Apple TV will essentially be an iPad without a screen, using the SAME HARDWARE, including the CPU OS, and 16-Gbytes of flash memory. To accommodate the smaller storage, Apple will EMPHASISE STREAMING CONTENT the report said".All that and more for only $99 bucks.....wow.....talk about getting screwed out of the contents of ones wallet.Thats nothing, wait till the 2nd Gen ipad, better configured and cheaper hits the stores for xmas.Apple-ites will be jumping out of their starbucks windows....eh !Furthermore from the august pages of  the "No news is good news" dept.AT&t; in partnership (co-conspirators) with snapple, royal screws its customer base.....again.Read on; [...]
I'm very disappointed with Amazon as I just placed an order for the ipad 64GB (without 3GS) and the lowest price showed was $848 plus shipping. Few minutes after placing the order I received an email that the order was already shipped. I happen to check the apple website just to be shocked that the selling price with free shipping is just $699.. To make things worse I'm not allowed to cancel the order..
Why would anyone want one? I would love for my mom to be tech savvy, to be able to wipe and reinstall her system software, to backup her hard drive on a regular basis, to upgrade and install RAM into the motherboard of her computer, to run the terminal to ping IPs to see why she can't get through somewhere.Is it going to happen? No. I'm not being pessimistic; she really has better things in her life to do. She's 76! I can't even adequately explain the concept of windows and menubars in a way that makes sense to her. Not to mention she has tremors and has a difficult time holding and accurately directing a mouse. I could get her an iPod Touch. I love mine, by the way. But with her near-sightedness and hand shaking, good luck touching the correct tiny little icon.With all that said, mom is getting a nice iPad w/ 3G for her birthday. I may not need one -- though they are awfully pretty and would be a wonderful lightweight companion while traveling -- but I really think my mom does. Besides, she loves games and this is a great way for her to keep her mind active while also being able to check her stocks, her email and whatever else she wants to do.And me? I will have saved countless hours of PC support time. Time that I can use enjoying time with my elderly mom rather than beating my head against a wall.
Received the iPad in record time.  It was everything I expected it to be.
Loved the screen, but had problems from day 1 with loading from a European SD card. Apple shop spent over 2 1/2 hours trying to sort it out, but finally I transferred items to my Windows PC and then via the ITunes app onto the IPad. Stupid. The Apple store's Geniuses were worthless. Once working it lost the Economist magazine which I downloaded after two days!! Each time I hooked up the same pc it wanted to verify it was approved, but I needed to be on the internet to do this - and I was travelling.  Apple IPad is more of a sour apple to me. Wish I never bought it, and waited until they sorted out the kinks.
This is an amazing product!!I am just shocked that Amazon is charging $907 for it when it is on Apple.com for $829!!All the accessories seem to be cheaper on the apple website as well!
iPad doesn't take you beyond more than half a step. Battery is too weak, resolution is too low. Next gen will be something to consider. This is just a bigger iPod. Some do say it can replace Kindle: actually I do not think so. It is something different, but definitely not a suitable ebook reader. To sum up: An iPad? I bought one, tested for a week and then resold. And guess what: I don't miss it at all.
THE IDEALImagine this: A tablet Mac with a pressure-sensitive touch screen that turns Photoshop into a one-stop Wacom-killing portable graphic design supersolution. It has a built-in iSight camera (as most Macs do) so you can video Skype with anybody in the world at any time, thereby creating a revolution in telecommunications and the eventual death of the cell phone! 3G is built in, so you can video chat any time without needing additional hardware peripherals. It has (at least) one USB port, just like the MacBook Air, so you can upload your pictures to iPhoto easily... unless you shot your photos directly from the iPad's iSight camera (which BTW swivels to either be front-facing or outward-facing). The device runs OS X just like any other Mac, so you can run all of your professional graphic design or pro audio applications on it, with the touch of a finger! That's right, it runs a version of OS X that fully supports pressure-sensitive multi-touch functionality. The price is between $1000 and $1500 depending on the configuration you get.Since hearing early rumors of an Apple tablet this is what I imagined and was hoping for. Now I am disappointed because my idealist expectations have not been lived up to. But enough about what isn't - let's discuss what is...THE REALITYThe iPad is not a Mac. It's a big-ass iPod touch. No, it's not even a big-ass iPhone, or something that can replace a phone. It's a big-ass iPod touch. It doesn't support Flash, or any other Adobe products. Steve Jobs has made enemies with both Adobe and Google now and you, the consumer, are bearing the consequences. OK, to be fair, it's not entirely Steve's fault, but he doesn't appear to be cooperatively working toward a solution for us.It lacks an iSight camera, so forget video chatting. There is only one port on it, which is the 30-pin connector for syncing with iTunes and charging. If you want to pay extra for the adapter, there is one that will allow you to plug in your USB camera or SD card. It makes sense when you consider it from Apple's perspective: allowing standard USB functionality would mean that you could just plug in your own thumb drive (or hard drive) and instantly upgrade a 16GB model to a 48GB model (or more). For me this all feels limiting since I am used to being able to open Finder and see/edit all of my documents, software, even system files, and transfer them to any external device.This leads me to my final gripe: All of the software you install on this device must be approved my Apple. It all goes through the App Store, folks. That means you can't install things that Apple doesn't like... i.e. torrent software, adult content, competing browsers like FireFox, your cracked version of the Adobe Creative Suite (not that I would do this), and all open-source software. Even if Apple approves some competitor's software (like Skype and Dropbox), they can pull those titles from the App Store as soon as they decide they dislike them. This disempowers you as an end-user. Apple is asking the masses to surrender their computing freedoms and since the majority of consumers don't grasp these concepts it is allowed to continue. 1984 was not like "1984", but 2010 sure is.Also, if you already own an iPhone and pay AT&T; $30 a month for 3G data, get ready to do it all over again with the iPad. That's right, $60/month if you own both!On a positive note, I commend both Apple and AT&T; for making the 3G version free of a 2-year contract. This is exciting news. Another pleasant surprise of the iPad has been the price. It ranges from just $500 to $830 in cost, depending on the configuration.CONCLUSIONSEven though the iPad is nothing like what I had been hoping for, can it be a solution for some people? YES! Yes, it can.The people who will benefit most from the iPad are people with simple needs looking for a cheap portable computer. It's not for me, but I can't say that it's not for some people. It's a cool device for kids to play games on or for your grandma to send you emails from, but it's not for multimedia professionals or die-hard Mac people. It's not a computer and we just have to accept that.Can it do some things that a Mac can't? Yes! It can run almost all of the same apps that your iPhone or iPod touch can, which is pretty cool. And most importantly, it has portable versions of all three iWork applications. This means you can create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations on the go. The iWork apps are a step in the right direction for the iPad, making it more computer-like. I have been a fan of iWork since its initial conception on the Mac and it has always been easier to use and produced more professional-looking results than anything MS Office (or even Open Office) has had to offer. But don't expect the iPad versions of the iWork titles to boast the same full set of features as the Mac versions.To be fair, we must also consider that the iPad platform is still brand new and we will surely see many more apps released for it that will be useful to many people.OVERVIEW OF AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS1. iPad - Best for reading e-books, running apps, watching videos, web-browsing, emailing, creating simple documents, and listening to music.2. Hackintosh netbook - Apple hates them, but they're the cheapest portable platform for OS X and they do the job! I admit, I'm a fan.3. MacBook Air - It's a bit large, it's lacking in ports, it's overpriced, but it's lightweight and it's the smallest Mac you can get.4. ModBook - For those who just must have an Apple tablet. It's basically a Wacom screen tablet fused with a MacBook. Cool, but expensive.5. iPhone/iPod touch - You should be familiar with these by now. One is a phone with a paid internet subscription. The other is Wi-Fi only.6. PC netbook - Eeewww! Don't do this. You're only hurting yourself. (Linux users are somewhat excused)  :-)7. Amazon Kindle - The iPad has succeeded in making the Kindle and other e-book readers obsolete. Don't get it.Thanks for reading. I hope this review has been helpful.
We love the iPad as it stands but it will be better in its second gen form.But how on earth can Amazon charge $544.00 for 16gig WiFi when retail price is $ 399.00?
Another great device from Apple! Works seamlessly!  Instant on and off. PC take notice..
This thing is amazing. It really feels futuristic. The touch is amazing. The games are great, my main reason for the unit. Touchgrind HD and Asphalt 5 HD are amazing! You got to get one of these... You'll be the talk of the town.
The eponymous iPad!I was able to purchase this thru Amazon - a reseller called FUZZY BRIGHT MEDIA! They shipped in very good time too!Now, as to the iPad...The GOOD1. Extremely easy to use (yes, I am, typing this on the iPAD!), especially for viewing pictures. Touché!2. Solid build quality... This thing is impressive.3. Very eye-catching design tooTHE GOOD1. Fantastically easy to use - especially when viewing pictures and web pages2. Solid solid build quality3. the WOW factor - this thing is great to look at!The NOT SO GOOD4. I live in Nigeria - And much to my chagrin, I cannot download FREE software from the apple store because.. Hold your breath... I DONT HAVE A REGISTERED USA CREDIT CARD! This is at best, VERY DUMB!5. You have to sync thru iTUNES... All the time! That's like having a USB drive (which the iPAD effectively is!) but not been able to plug it into a PC!6. The web browser constantly reloads web pages... Frustrating!the downright BAD!7. No multitasking! Honest. Thats like having a fridge which only cools water... I mean, even cheap Nokia phones MULTITASK8. Inability to download software if you are outside the USofA. Silly, silly, silly.After all said and done, I would say... BUY THE IPAD IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT.. it is indeed a blast! But rest assured, Googlemor Microsoft will dust these guys within 6 Months... Apple's lack of flexibility will see to that!
I had the small Kindle; returned because I read fast enuf was changing pages 3 to 4 times a minute.  Got the big K2.  Loved it and still have it.  Got the iPad as soon as the 3G 64GB model was available.  Later I got the big new Kindle - much better than the old - so I have all 3 - 2 big Kindles and the iPad.  Have used the iPad for several months.It has great potential but one very great weakness.  It is TOTALLY dependent on the Apps written for it.  I had essentially wanted it for notetaking - really, a simple minimal database.  No such luck.  Even Apples apps are relatively useless - poor instructions, very limited usefulness, no decent import/export ability.The best app is a FREE one - Kindle's reader for the iPad !!! - in many ways this is a better reader than the Kindle's because of the touch screen - for a real reader the scroll feature at the bottom of the page (which allows you to scroll swiftly through a book or pdf converted to a book) - is practically worth the price.  Also you can set a small font size, and use the 3-finger enlarge tap followed by finger-spread to get EXACTLY the size you want.  In the kindles, scrolling is very awkward and slow.  In fact the only time I use the Kindles any more is in bright light or to read newspapers (subscribe to the NYT, Wa Post, and Shanghai Daily - none of which is available on the IPad.  I read them at home at breakfast and when I leave for work only the iPad goes with me.It is amusing that Apple's own reader is so bad.  After buying a couple of novels thru Apple I learned to forget it and get only Kindle books.  The 2 page spread on the Apple (the horizontal feature of the reader) is like the rest of the apps - designed for adult children with very limited abilities.  Bizarre.  However, Jobs/Apple know their market and I understand why they do it.  What Apple makes SELLS.  Which just means there are a lot of buyers, not that the products are useful.The next best app is the Wall St Journal - which shows what COULD be done.  I don't see how this could be improved.  Pricey but worth it to me.  The magazines available are either uninteresting (like the mag - I forget the name - which had the interview with the US general in Iraq who wanted to be fired - the mag is well executed for the iPad but uninteresting to me except for the above interview.  That general is a smart cookie - he got out clean.I did buy Paris Match for one issue just to see what COULD be done - FANTASTIC, gorgeous, beautifully executed - and all in French, which I don't speak.  If they ever get an English version I will sign up instantly - but since the French don't want English or American customers, never happen.I have tried other Apps and apparently they are mostly toys and games for adult children with limited intelligence and attention span.  Even the ones titled "get things done" and "productivity" are mostly junk written for adult children with limited intelligence and attention span.  (I don't think I am very smart, btw - but these apps - ugh!  - blech - who in the world could benefit from them ? )So, for me, the iPad is basically a reader for Kindle books.  I enjoy it but it is almost useless for anything since there are no usable apps I can find.  Be careful - they all claim to be great - read the CRITICAL reviews first.  GoodReader seemed to work but is so clumsy I took it back off.  Keynote, Photos, WSJ, USA Today, BBC News, Evernote, and the NYT Editor's Choice are all worthwhile but thats about it for me.Calendar works as a reminder.  Notes, Contacts,Safari, Pages are all so limited as to be useless.What a shame.  It could be so great with usable Apps.  And Paris Match and the Wall St Journal show what COULD be done.  If Apple upgrades the iPad so 1) 2 or more programs ran at once, and 2) it was easy to copy from one app to another and 3) easy to import/export  - it would BEGIN to reach the potential claimed for it.
I love it except for one major flaw - you can't view the iPad screen on a larger display.  Even if you buy the vga or composite dongles, the iPad will not support it.  For me, that's simply critical for any business or home use.  It makes it essentially useless with clients and at work.  Overall, I'm guessing it costs me almost 60% of the potential functionalityNot to mention it makes it useless with a motel tv when traveling and trying to use a streaming video provider like netflix..  Most video services - in fact most applications - don't work at all - only a very few apple apps.This is embarrassing. My iPad may go back unless Apple can fix this with software pretty darned quickly.We have two 17" macBookPros, iPhones, iPods, airPorts, etc. And this is the first Apple product we didn't love out of the box.

iPad is just a larger expensive iPod touch.  I will have to buy one of these Netbooks http://www.amazon.com/Netbooks-Computers/b/ref=amb_link_83353631_3?ie=UTF8&node;=679517011&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_s=left-1&pf;_rd_r=0PY4PH7HWG8YR310ZP51&pf;_rd_t=101&pf;_rd_p=1261382342&pf;_rd_i=565108I am very frustrated with iPad.Here is what experts say about it;To do everything you need to do on the iPad, you still need to connect it regularly to a PC or a Mac. You have to connect in order to sync up your latest podcasts and media files. You need to sync to get OS updates. You need to sync in order to get your latest business documents on the iPad.read the details here;[...].10 things Netbooks still do better than an iPad[...].
I just wonder, all these reviews with such long info and technical specs, are really written by regular folks like me, or there is a hidden agenda to trash or elevate the quality of a product.
High prize for this model WI-FIIn this prize better to buy WI-Fi + 3G
Apple has produced a device even THEY cannot explain. They just expect their legions of fans to do the hard work and come up with the suggestions. Having bought one of these and played with it for an hour, I am none the wiser as to what this thing is for, needless to say, i took it straight back! Its awkward to hold, its actually quite heavy (although feels nice), the screen is too bright, could hardly see it at all outdoors, wrong aspect ratio for movies etc etc. I knew what this thing couldn't do, but i'm still unaware of what it CAN do! All i see it as is a portal into Steve Jobs pocket. Don't be fooled - this thing is next to USELESS. I see a market in those annoying lifestyle, starbuck-sipping fashionista types, who have to be seen with stuff like this, but the sensible among you take heed and get a top of the range netbook with a longlife battery - you'll save big money AND have a better machine capable of unlimited applications.
I live in Eastern Europe,the The condition of the product as listed. Factory seal.The delivery, reach before the estimated date.
If I start describing it, there will be no end. I just think the Apple iPad is truly "M A G I C A L". It is an astonishingly sexy, elegant and useful swiss-army-knife.Buy it without thinking. I suggest the 16 GB with WiFi+3G.
INCREDIBLE!!! A MUST HAVE!! LOVE IT!! APPLE DOES IT AGAIN.. NO ONE DOES IT BETTER... 10 STARS PLUS...
I am V'ry satisfied with iPad and I would recommend it to all of you.
Spent 15 minutes in the store playing on this thing, trying to figure out why the hell I would want to buy this. I found myself awkwardly going through the "features" trying to find something to distinguish this product as something worth buying. It goes on the internet? Wow.  I've got at least 3 different devices that do that. It has a book? So what?  I have a Nook that does that. Even if I didn't, I'd sooner just buy a paperback than drop $600.I knew this product was useless when I handled it in the store, come to find out it's more useless than I thought.  Can't print?  It'd be bad enough if it were no different from a laptop.  Come to find out, it does LESS than most laptops and netbooks, but for more money.  Oh, and THIS IS NOT PORTABLE.  It's heavy.  I shortly tired of holding it and put it down.  This thing doesn't even do much more than my IPOD. At least you can throw the IPOD in a purse.  Even your laptop can go in your backpack without too many worries since the screen is enclosed.  Not the case with this item that has a fragile, glass screen with no protection.This is a device for those tools who go to Starbucks to be seen writing their manuscript and have to ice their boners whenever Steve Jobs announces a new scam **cough** sorry, I meant "product."  A more discerning buyer will not purchase something so frivolous.
Okay, I don't own it but I am tech-savvy enough to understand this device after reading reviews, after seeing product specifications, AND after playing with a friend's iPad for sometime. So I think I can write a review here!I don't think this device is worth the steep price! Wait for the upcoming Android or Windows based tablets. If you want functional devices then stay away from iPads! My $250 Toshiba netbook is far more functional than the cheapest iPad of $500. Heck, iPad does not even have a standard USB port (my Toshiba has THREE!). For iPad, you are supposed to dish out some (MORE) hard earned money to get an Apple-approved gadget to get the USB functionality. See how you are being fleeced?Don't fall for the Apple hype. Educate yourselves about what you are about to buy/into. Yes, iPAD is very fluid and my Toshiba can't match that fluidity. But the Toshiba is adequate for web surfing, easier to handle (light weight), has a physical keyboard, and has a 6-cell battery which lasts 5-6+ hours. And, running Windows 7, it has access to tens of thousands of free and time-tested Windows software out there.One more myth-busting about Windows: The Toshiba has NEVER been infected by viruses or trojans even though it does not run any anti-virus software. I take it to public places and hook up to public WiFi, still no issues. No 'Blue Screen of Death' either. It's been at least 10 months of trouble-free ownership for me!If you are looking for tablets, then might as well want to read the following "user" comment made about HP Slate 500 which is coming out. This is from the Hewlett Packard's Slate 500. I will keep checking Amazon for HP Slate 500 or other non-Apple tablet devices.PS. I know Apple fanbois are not going to like my comment but so be it! Apple gets free pass in the media and that is not good to inform users about Apple's crippled products. Some of us are starting to challenge that.[Quote Begin]"Nice device  Date: November 8, 2010"can iPad join windows domain control? Network shares? Can we use USB-to-Ethernet adapter on iPad? iPad has no sd, hdmi, and USB slot. iPad can not run Microsoft office. With more than 250000 apps on ITunes, there is no app has ability to analyze wifi signal strength. HELLO!!!! There is no way you can edit an PDF file on iPad. Full web experience with ipad? What a joke! No flash, no java. You can't even use simple "scroll bar" function on safari browser. iPad is a cripped toy. Period!Hp slate does all that and it is what I need on the road.(typing on iPad)"[Quote end]
How i got it free: I went here [..]and signed up.They did make me do offers but i did the ones that was a 2-week-free-trial, then i canceled the memberships in 12 days, so it didn't cost me a thing. Don't cancel too soon cause the ipad-offer has to process. I do ask for your creditcard but if u cancel the memberships on time, they don't charge u a thing. when process-requirements r done, they ship u the ipad 4 free. My friend did it and told me about it iand i was sooooo surprised that it worked.Review: Wifi is a bit weak sometimes but lately it is great. Having problems syncing it to my computer but then again maybe it's cause i'm not very certain if i'm doing it right. Overall i luv it. at 1st my wifi was bad but got better and i wish it was bigger but it's still A LOT BETTER than my ipod touch.hope u got it free, cause free is still better than buying it cause in my opinion, it's very pricey.
This piece of technology was designed for simple people who only do simple tasks. This is not a real computer, but a limited entertainment device. The out-of-the-box experience is terrible, with non-intuitive user interfaces that are not documented. There is no instruction manual. There is no file management utilities, and you cannot easily bring in your own files. The power cable is way too short to be useful. The setup for Outlook e-mail does not work, and the Safari operating system is incompatible with my web-based e-mail. It does not allow the user to scroll through e-mail messages, so you end up only being able to read the first part of each e-mail. People who buy this obviously are easy victims of technology propaganda hype.
I'm a product design student and the following is my experience of Apples, so called magical ipad.Worked out of the box(both of the ones I've had), Into a recovery mode loop after updating, even when I replaced an ipad!!! And it was updated by apples own software, with itunes 10 whatever. The fact of the matter is, Apple are selling defective products to whoever gets them at high prices, even my ipod classic has been acting funny, and the iphone 4 is a showcase of how they want to manipulate people and take peoples money, whilst they build their empire. The high reviews are most likely from people who's ipads are working, please take my advice and avoid apple, products, my brothers ipod touch also got returned to the apple store more than 3 times, from what I remember.Your risking your money, when you buy one of their products, will you get what works or not, that's what should be in your mind. It aint magical it's a pain!!! I've wasted over £500 with a case, I will get my money back/sort something, pc world!!!Don't buy Apple products, if your upset about what I wrote, go into an Apple store and check for the customers returning defective/non working products and count how many throughout the week if you can.Very upset with a rubbish piece of engineering, don't buy North American products if you can.
Yes, it actually works if you willing to waste your time. Very unfriendly tablet. No paperwork. As I compare this tablet to regular PC this tablet worth exactly  10 bucks. The only valuable future is Internet access. Its not really fast either. Other strange thing is everybody told me Apple protected against viruses--nonsense. In first 10 minutes some program attacked tablet and luckily for me I was fast enough to shut tablet down. If I have question and I do I have to drive to Apple store and ask.Avoid.after having this toy for some time i realized anything i want to do i need second computer like printing or word prosessing and they always trying sell me music and install upgrades on my regular PC so finally i shut it down. useless toy. now i am planning buy Toshiba with 4G.
Now I'll admit I dont own one, just played with it at a store. I own an Iphone so am familiar with general approach. The Ipad is a great device, and I applaud it, but here's why I hesitate to buy one, unless just for an ereader device (and these things were amazingly not mentioned in the leading negative review)-I cant back up my Iphone onto it. I can on a netbook. duh-I cant backup my camera chip on it. Can on netbook.-netbook runs photographic editing sware (picasa - free from Google)-netbook has usb ports-netbook baterry lasts 10 hours.-netbook costs $300 with 160-250 gb hd mem-netbook has keyboard and office swWith that kind of competition, I think Apple has to carefully position themselves as an ereader.Just my 2 cents.added 8/4i bought one, and above comments are true. it also doesnt print, you gotta email or sync the file to your Mac/Pc  and print from there.I like the gizmo, though. Its just that the reader should br aware this is a beta, rushed product whose main advantage is its a tablet with nice form factor. ,I reach for my ipad over my laptop every time.
Well its like (exactly like really) the i phone...bigger screen is the only difference. I would rater given my money for anything else, including 600 mcdonalds double cheeseburgers (at least then I would have eaten)....I can't say this does not function well, it does, but then again so does my iphone. It's ver awkward to type on, does not make phone calls (granted neither does my iphone (thanks AT&T;))....why did i feel this was needed????
I blame myself for this purchase because the seller just sent me the IPad without the getting started booklet or any of the original box contents except the usb cable and the charger, the box was opened and in some places was damaged.The Ipad itself is ok but it's value is greatly degraded without it's original packaging.
I'm just writing these lines to be able to rate it, having returned mine ,I mostly agree with all the other reviews the iPad is overrated mostly because the hype surrounding it,
Like all other Apple products, I have never been impressed with them and their price schemes are too high.  Never been one of those that believe in "techno-hype".  I stick with what works and what provides the most support and what will be around.  Despite my dislike for Microsoft, I love the stability of the operating environment and the familiarity of its technology.
If you buy this product you are a sucker.  You are part of the problem with this country, in that nobody thinks about the choices they make or are about to make.  I LOATHE Crapple, but the iPhone is still the best phone/mini PC on the market.  It does a multitude of tasks that the iPad can't.iPad sucker factor:1.  This device is being billed as a web browser, but Apple won't allow Adobe Flash content to be played on it because they're afraid of losing money from the istore.2.  If you want 3G connectivity, which isn't available on the cheapest model, you'll have to spend an additional $150.3.  You can't replace the battery.4.  No camera.There is NO reason to buy this instead of an iPhone unless you have so much money that you scoff at the price, in which case you are DEFINITELY part of the problem.
Nothing to add to the title.Had it -> found no use for it -> returned it
It'll be on my wishlist until I can save enough to buy it...maybe by the time Apple puts out the next version of it's iPad.
Looks pretty.Works as it should. Priced well. Touch function works well.Somewhat slow(I guess OK for the price).Touchgate with the three floating desktop screens is a dumb distraction and does not add any functionality.WORST OF ALL,the pen writing in the tablet mode (which was the main reason I bought this tablet)DOES NOT WORK, as the palm touch input is not blocked.This NEEDS to be fixed, including updated software for those of us who bought it without knowing this serious deficiency.And the User Manual (paper as well as oline) is virtually useless. Does not give any info or suggestions on using the various functions unique to this tablet.CK
I've always wanted a tablet PC, and much to my surprise Asus debuted this wonderful netbook just in time for my first semester of college. The T91 is great for online course content, as you can push buttons and click through equations and slides with just a tap on the screen.  I've quickly become so used to this awesomeness that I keep mistakenly touching the screen of my older, bigger laptop, expecting a mouse click.For fun and utility the T91 really can't be beat. I have all my textbooks on board, so it's the only resident of my bookbag save for my note paper. The screen-swiveled tablet mode is great for reading and reviewing slide shows and notes. And walking around campus it doubles as an mp3 player and a (web) radio!The only minor annoyances are a less-than-perfectly-responsive keyboard (please, Asus, tune this up in the next version) and the 1GB of RAM - I highly suggest upgrading to 2GB, unless you're a more patient soul than I.This is fantastic product for the price, and it allows for some seriously new and exciting uses. If you enjoy innovation and want a super-lightweight way to read ebooks and stay connected, I'd look no further.
I was looking for a tablet computer that I could use to display my instrument approach plate (IAPs) when flying IFR.  This device fit the bill!  It is easy to use and does almost all the things I wanted it too with only a few exceptions.  I can download my IAPs from the internet site I use ([...] - Thanks DOUG RANZ - If you use him, donate to him, Great Service).  I can use FOXIT Reader to view these, finding the plate I need and then going Full Screen in tablet mode and BAM!  I have it.  Battery life is good and the 12 volt adapter is compatible with aircraft using a 12 volt system.  I will use a 24V to 12V adapter for mine.
Ok I've read the reviews here and I am not amused... As a computer technician I know and trust Asus products without question,and with my recent purchase of the T91 my trust has only grown.First off for the yokels that bought this for heavy work loads... you're a moron case in point; with a 16 Gb SSD (solid state drive) and 1 Gb memory topped off 1.6 Ghz processor and a 8.9" screen did you really think that this could handle that kind of work load? And for the idiots that scratched the surface of your touchscreen with the stylus do you poke your wife or girlfreinds like that? If you do bet you spend alot of time "Alone".As a tech and a Sales executive for my own firm I needed a laptop that 1. I could travel with that wasn't to cumbersome (specially when I'm flying) and 2. when I was up in someones roof or in their wall fixing their network I could still have information and a great test tool at my finger tips. The T91 did that and never broke a sweat...if you haven't figered it out then let me spell it out for you..."I LOVE THIS MACHINE!!!" My T91 has taken over as mission critical equipment in my work as a tech, I use her to trace network cables, shorts and hub problems. she connects to my test equipment and gives more information on the problems I face. Wireless interfarence and blind spots are no longer problems that bother me.So you want a good system to do a few things when you're on the road? want something not to bulky, enough speed to get info on the road, or you're a tech looking for a cheap alternative to buying high grade test equipment on a buget then look no further... The T91 in my opinion is a great buy and a great netbook / tablet.
Bought it with deeper discount, so cost/benefit is not an issue.This notebook needs Windows 7!  If you do handwriting in languages other than English, you should get Windows 7 Ultimate instead of professional.  It runs much better in Windows 7 just for the fact that Windows 7 supports Tablets right out of the box.Hard drive is a bit too small - 16GB is never enough, and I have to uninstall programs before I can even get a clean Windows 7 installed into it. After Windows 7 I have about 5-6GB left, and I seriously doubt I will install anything more to it at this point except some small utility softwares.Touch screen works great but expect minor delays in actions, although this may be common to all tablets.Performance is a bit sluggish but understandable.  This netbook is used primarily for my emails, browsing, and web TV, and reading - I don't use it for anything else and should not be.Overall not bad but not as intuitive as IPad (that is the OS problem not the machine itself).  The good part is it offers much more external ports that IPad can offers, so you will be able to connect multiple things to it.It is small, lightweight, good looking, and does well for what it intends to ... otherwise it is hard to type, a pain to look at the tiny screen for an extended time, a bit slow, and can't get everything you need into it.I guess that is the two sides of the same coin.
I purchased the product from a referral and am happy that I did.  I use the product for business and it has proven to be an asset in my line of work.
Computer arrived quickly and in perfect shape.  A bit slow, but makes a great book reader.  Wish it had more memory and Hard Drive space, but that would have to cost more and I was looking for inexpensive.  All in all I really like it.
Order was placed on 10/24/2010 and shipped 10/25/2010. Merchandise delivered on 10/27/2010 as promised. Absolutely no regrets with my order. The price was the driving force behind my purchase. SD card and card slot became defective and I had to returned it. Amazon exceeded my expectations with their handling of my replacement unit and return authorization. Enough to make them my primary online retailer for all further purchases.I upgraded the memory to 2GB. Although the 1GB chip seem adequate, I preferred the added memory for better performance. This unit shipped with Windows XP and I am impressed with the overall touch performance in general, especially considering that it is a resistive touch screen. Being a Computer Science Major who is almost finish with my degree requirements, I installed Windows 7 (free) under the Academic Alliance Program with the community college that I am enrolled in. I am running a dual boot (Windows XP and Windows 7) from the 16GB SSD. Windows XP handles well and is the primary focus. The computer is small, lightweight, and is ideal for portability. Functionality is great and is a good alternative to the IPAD. Since showing off some of it's features and functionalities, I have had several colleagues order the same computer from Amazon. I gave it only four stars solely because of the small hard drive (despite the 16GB SSD card and 20GB of free online storage). Definitely a good value for the money.
The unit is not very reliable.  The tablet portion stopped working the first day into the special project that I purchased it for.  By the second day, the entire unit had stopped working and would not even turn on.  I was several hundred miles from home and had to use a backup unit that I had bought along with me.It has been returned to ASUS for repair or replacement.  Hopefully they will satisfy me with their repair service.  Time will tell.
Only about 7 months old.  The touch screen has already failed.  It appears to be a bad connection between the screen and the motherboard.  If I pivot the screen, the touch screen quits.  I really regret buying this EEE PC T91.
this item is wrong damaged it is not working, this seller is unprofessional because does not solve my problem. i think amazon.com have not related with this kind of bad seller. i think amazon.com will improve this mistake
When it comes to deciding on a computer or anything else more than $20 bucks, I tend to be cautious.  Even more so with something close to $500...  I compared the Lenovo to the Ipad, the Acer and Acus models, and finally went with this for the following factors: Most of my international friends trust Lenovo over Acer and Acus.  Also, it has the ability to change batteries, and use USB directly, as well as have a real Keyboard, which isn't a part of Ipad.  And for all the I-pad bells and whistles, its not really all that great for typing. I'm old school. when I'm not typing, my fingers rest on the keys... even occasionally tapping lightly while I'm thinking. On an Ipad, I'll have a whole line of nnnnnnnnnnnn or whatever.when I ordered it, I also got the 2GB upgrade for memory (Kingston) and upgrade package for Windows home premium.  It wasn't all that difficult to upgrade the memory. there's a few micro screws, but it snaps off and back on pretty well. The memory just pops out. And I had no problems upgrading to Home premium Windows 7 using my wireless connection. Again, no problems with that either.Now for the usage.  Its fine for me. The more I get used to the touch screen, the more I wonder how I got around without it.  I'm not perfect with it. There's still the problem of my big finger not hitting the X close button precisely, but combine that with the smaller touch pad's precision, and it's a great combo.The included programs are hit or miss. Natural touch took a little tooling, but I think I have it under control now. and I decided not to use the lenovo ready go program because its full of adware. I just don't need any of it cause I don't use wireless all the time.the keyboard is fine for me, and I hardly notice much difference between it and a full size on my other computer.  Windows 7 seems much easier to use than Vista, so I have less problems finding the program I want easily without using lots of energy on wasted animation.With the 2GB Memory, I have no problem with Kindle, or movies or streaming. I can't exactly play World of Warcraft or other big games, but I didn't buy it for the game potential, but for the word processing and transportation ability.  The 8 cell battery it comes with is a little big, but as another reviewer said, it's a find handle when you use it for a book reader, etc.  I love the long battery life. I can use it off and on, and play videos or type away for hours. For example, my flight from Chicago to Tokyo was 12 hours, and I used it most of the trip for typing, plus I played a video for my daughter, and even a Dora game for her.  Typically, I only need to charge it once every 2 days, and keep it in sleep mode (just shutting the lid) when not in use.I'm sure if you are looking for a reasonably priced alternative to the I-pad which will actually allow you to type something without hurting your neck or your wallet, then this is a great choice.
As soon as Steve Jobs specified what the iPad would be, I was disappointed, and realized that I needed something else to be my touch-screen computer of choice.  I looked first at the Archos 9 PC tablet, but I realized that the touch screen was resistive, would not support multi-touch, and did not have a real keyboard, which was a large downside for schoolwork.  After looking at CES, I found the Lenovo s10-3tWhen I first put this netbook together, I was surprised by the size of the battery- it wasn't as large as people who reviewed it told me it was, but it definitely jetted out of the computer.  Many argue that the keyboard is cheap, but I actually like the way it feels.  Unlike most netbooks, It doesn't feel super-duper small in your hands.  The track pad is ridiculously small compared to most other netbooks in its class.  The two buttons are integrated into the touchpad, but it does not work like the Macbooks, where you can click anywhere on the track pad.  When I plugged it in, the light on the lid of the netbook is not helpful.  It does not indicate when the battery is full, and there is no way to check the level of charge without actively turning on the computer.  IT was also difficult for me to disconnect the charger from the port on the computer.  The netbook has two USB ports, a VGA port, which is useful for connecting to projectors, and an Ethernet port for wired access.Turning on the computer, there were loads of bloatware, as Lenovo does not even let your load Windows without launching all of their software programs.The touchscreen-The multitouch capacitive screen works well.  Turning the screen, rotating the hinge was pretty easy.  However when moving around the laptop with the screen open (in laptop mode) the screen would fall flat backward.  The hinge moved too easily.  This began to concern me.  I have not taken action to call Lenovo about this issue yet.  Most of its capabilities are only available after upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium.  I found a copy of the Anytime Upgrade to Home Premium on EBay for 40 dollars, but otherwise the full cost of the product is 79.99.  The upgrade process takes 10 minutes, and does not affect your files.  Once the upgrade was installed, I was able to pinch, zoom, swipe, rotate and highlight almost any website or window. The raised bezel makes it difficult, however, to click in the corners.  I had some trouble clicking the start button; every time I tried it would load something different from my taskbar.  I fixed the issue by increasing the size of the taskbar, and moving the start button a little higher on the screen.  However this limited my viewing space.  In tablet mode, portrait was uncomfortable, there isn't much room to hold the tablet in this orientation, and although some argue the battery makes a nice handle, it gets in the way. I imagined I could hold the tablet in portrait mode to read eBooks, but the screen is almost too widescreen and the reading space I was left with were extremely narrow.  When holding the tablet in landscape mode, Lenovo did a great job making it easy to hold, to prevent the accidental touch of the power button, they created a hold switch.  This was nice for watching Hulu, or any video.  I found myself loving Aero Snap- I would unmaximize my windows and center them so I could click the X button, closing programs.  The Ribbon UI of the MS Office Suite worked great with the touchscreen, but some programs did not work as well.Anyone who purchases this computer must remember that Windows 7 is a full desktop operating system with features that allow touch, and is not a trapped, compressed Apple-support-only operating system where all of the buttons and everything has been customized to the hardware.As a netbook-The netbook isn't slow.  It isn't super-fast either, it's a netbook.  The processor is pretty fast for an Atom, 1.66 GHz.  When I opened Windows task manager with all of my usual programs open, I found that I was using 82% of my memory.  I purchased 2GB of RAM on EBay for 30 dollars, and I found a significant difference in speed.  Converting to tablet mode became much faster.  Loading, minimizing, and all touchscreen functions became much more responsive.I enabled the Quick Start in the BIOS settings, and enjoyed that functionality, it was speedy, but I kept the netbook on for most of the time, and never used it extensively.OVERVIEWPROS- Great, speedy netbook (with add-on), Quick start Feature, long lasting battery (14 hours, I was able to achieve) Responsive multitouch touchscreen, Wireless N, full size keyboard.CONS- hinge moves too easily, tiny touchscreen, touchscreen loves fingerprints,  horrible speakers ( tinny sound)  have to pay extra for Windows Upgrade.
This is the best option you have if you want a tablet. Everything works great, and it has so many more features than the iPad will. It is faster and with a built-in keyboard, it makes an awesome little netbook.Basically, no one else will be releasing anything quite like this. If you're on the fence because of that, just go ahead and take the plunge. A "netvertable" has taken the backseat to pure tablets. Which is too bad, because the hybrid concept is much more practical. I can take notes on this thing, or even write a quick review for Amazon.With the right codecs, you can push out 720p/1080p on this thing. I have successfully pulled that off with CoreAVC. It is no substitute for Tegra/ION, but in this form factor, no one will be releasing an ION based device this year anyways.Great device, highly recommended. Just be smart with it, upgrade the RAM and get Home Premium. Then you'll be golden. Enjoy!

 Length:: 6:35 MinsThis is a video review of the Lenovo S10-3t with Windows 7 Premium and 2 GB of memory.My overall impression is quite positive given the flexibility of using my existing PC applications and using it as a tablet for reading e-books, surfing the internet, and watching videos. One pleasant surprise is that the wide screen display gives me a much better internet browsing experience than my other existing netbooks. In my opinion, it does a lot more than an iPad with a similar price as its low-end model.The multi-touch experience is not the best but it works quite well after some training.Hope you enjoy this videoCheers
I have been looking at netbooks for a while in order to have something a little more portable than a laptop and more usable than a smartphone for basic e-reading, email, and web browsing. I was close to buying an iPad when I came across the Lenovo S10-3T. After reading the reviews on both products, I opted for the S10-3T as it seemed to have the functionality and expandability of a netbook, but the touch screen capabilities of an iPad. I have been very pleased with my decision and have found this to be the best of both worlds. Below are the pros and cons which are consistent with what I had read in other reviews -- note I gave this a 5-star review because despite a few cons, I believe it to be the best product on the market today. Also, while some reviews have complained about the battery that sticks out, I have found it to be quite handy for holding when in tablet mode.Pros:* Touchscreen* Fast* Intel platform (can support multiple OSes)* Expandable - USB (wireless broadband, printer, external drive, etc.), SD Reader, memory* Near full-size keyboard (for times when you have a bit of typing to do)Cons:* Windows 7 Starter -- this is a functional OS and probably could have gotten by with it, but wanted something a little more configurable -- upgraded to Home Premium* The pre-installed software is more than the configured memory adequately supports -- either remove some of it or add more memory.* Somewhat heavy for one-handed holding (this is going to be the case of any of these type of devices unless you want just an eReader).There are a number of sites which have some good tips for configuring this device. I found the [...] site to be very helpful -- thank you Jesse for the info.
My Bottom Line:  For the way I use a computer, this one isn't perfect, but it's pretty close.  It takes some upgrading and tweaking to get it working just right and if you aren't willing to spend some time doing this you are likely to be disappointed.  If you are willing to make the investment, this computer is a gem!The details (long):Here is what I use my computer for:  I spend a fair amount of time on-line.  I do quite a lot of text entry, both on-line and on a word processor.  I do all my personal finances, using Quicken.  And I interact with several USB  devices.  I do not do games or compute-intensive work.Here is how I use my computer:  I use it as a portable, around the house.  I move from location to location, room to room, out on the patio, whatever.  I never use a mouse, because that impedes my desire for portability.  We do quite a bit over-the-road traveling, and I take my computer on the road.  Portability is very important to me.My current computer is an entry level Sony laptop.  Six pounds.  15.4" screen.  Two hour battery charge.  Decent keyboard, decent touchpad, nice screen, adequate performance.  It gets the job done, but is far from ideal.  Recently, in a hotel room, I got the power cord tangled on a piece of furniture and dropped the device onto a carpeted floor.  Fortunately, and surprisingly, the computer survived, intact.  But this was the last straw.What I would like in a computer is something that is very small and lightweight that will handle all the general computer work I do (I want ONE computer), and will have a battery that lasts long enough so that all I have to do is plug it in over night.  Also, I have always wanted to able to drive down the road and be able to connect to the internet as we are traveling.The iPad caught my attention.  This would be a perfect device for a person like me, if it can do my job.  Unfortunately, after studying the device, I found a number of shortcomings that I can't live with, such as the lack of a physical keyboard, no USB ports, no Flash support, a cell phone operating system, etc.  The wide band cellular data plans, $15 and $30/month with no contract, would be perfect for me for travel.In evaluating the iPad, I came across the Lenovo S10-3T, and looked closely, and bought one from Amazon.  I've had it a week.  Here is my experience to date:My first, and key, point is that if you want a computer that works just right, straight out of the box, you probably aren't going to be very happy with this computer.  This one seems to work best with some upgrading and tweaking, an investment I was ready to perform in order to get what I want. If you aren't willing to make the investment, you might wind up like the recent reviewer here who thought that there is no on-screen keyboard in tablet mode, and sent it back (there is an on-screen keyboard, and it's fine, and you have a lot of control over it, but you have to invest the time to find it and learn how to control it).Amazon Prime is great.  I ordered the netbook, the 2gb memory upgrade, and the System 7 Anytime upgrade to Home Premium from Starter, and I had it all with free shipping in two days.There is an Amazon review of this device by Jesse Andersen.  I read this review particularly closely, as Mr. Andersen clearly has done a ton of work with the S10-3T and has documented his work and findings in detail.  Look at his review.  And mostly, look at his web site, which he links you to in one of the comments attached to the review.The touch screen was sluggish, out of the box, so I did what Mr. Andersen and others recommend.  I removed bloatware, and upgraded the operating system and the DRAM.  I also went to Jesse's web site and did a lot of the tips he suggests.  This helped a lot, but it still isn't perfect, and I'll comment in a bit.I'm a Chrome user.  Chrome lacks touch screen support, so I had to abandon it.  I have never liked Explorer, and Safari seems to always bog down on me.  Firefox has always been my second choice, and it's the best browser for this system, as it has good touch screen support and add-ons that help even more.  I couldn't do side-to-side finger scrolling on the touch screen, but the "Grab and Drag" Firefox add-on solved that problem and made the entire touch screen experience better.  I think this is the most important add-on.  All of this is covered in Mr. Andersen's tips.April 30, 2010 Update:  Firefox add-ons:  I already noted that "Grab and Drag" is an important add-on.  I want to say that "Flashblock" is also a key add-on.  The touch screen responds much better for web surfing on many sites with Flashblock installed.July 6, 2010 Update:  I miss Chrome.  I found a Chrome extension that supports touchscreen functions.  I am now using Chrome again.  It is great, so much faster than Firefox, and the touchscreen is more responsive.  Chrome is nice for the small screen, because it is a cleaner screen interface.  Also, when you hit F11 and go to full screen, you actually get full screen(!).  Further, you can eliminate the side scroll bars, using an option in the touchscreen extension.  Also, text editing, cut/copy and paste, and the like are more intuitive.  I haven't found anything I can't do with Chrome.  Perhaps you can do all of what I just described with Firefox, but I never found it.  Try Chrome and the touchscreen extension!Overall, the resulting system satisfies every one of my wants and needs, except one, which is the broad band cellular capability.Here are some specific comments:I am a pretty fair typist, and I have always loved IBM keyboards.  Lenovo has retained the IBM keyboard style, and I can power type on this keyboard better than any full sized Sony or Toshiba laptop keyboard I've ever used.  It's really good, and this is very important to me.The touch pad is not very good, compared to a full sized laptop.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that you hardly use it, given the touch screen!!The internal speakers live up everything stated elsewhere - they are terrible.  But I knew this going in, and I am ordering Bluetooth headphones.  The computer has Dolby sound, so headphone sound should be great.  NOTE:  If somebody out there can tell me how to order and install an internal Bluetooth adapter, so that I don't have to use a USB port for a dongle, I would really appreciate it!Screen size:  very small compared to my 15.4" Sony screen.  But there are a ton of tricks you can play with hidden task bars et al to maximize the effective size of the screen. I have gotten used to the size of the screen, and the speed and convenience of touch, and I don't miss the bigger screen at all, after only a week.Touch screen:  It is so great for the internet.  I just love it.  I hardly ever use the touch pad.  I know that in time I will become even more proficient, and learn new tricks and techniques, too.  I am sure I will never go back to a non-touch screen computer.Touch screen performance:  Very good, actually, but not always perfect.  Scrolling gets sticky from time to time.  Things that make it sticky seem to be dense graphics and text on a page, numerous open tabs in Firefox, and numerous open applications.  If the screen gets a little sticky when I am looking at dense, small text and lots of graphics, like a news page, I just make things a little bigger.  And if I keep the Firefox tabs and open applications to a minimum, there are absolutely no worries.  Touch screen performance is not a problem for me, but it's not perfect.  Edit:  I checked my startup applications, and found a large number of things I don't use.  I disabled them, and touch screen performance is now smooth under nearly all conditions.Battery:  It must last 5 or more hours (8 cell).  Plenty for me.  I charge overnight.General performance:  Surprisingly good.  I have had no noticeable problems with my work, but again, I don't do a lot of compute-intensive things.  I run Norton Internet Security 2010.  This is not your grandfather's Norton.  The new Norton doesn't slow you down, and you hardly know you have it except for when you need it because it's caught something.Tablet mode:  I don't do any stylus things, but I do use it when I am sitting in certain positions, and it's very useful and I'm happy to have it.Wide Band Cellular:  Nothing available that is comparable to the AT&T; offerings for the iPad.  You can get excellent national coverage with a two year Verizon plan for $60/month.  No thanks.  I'll bet that, given the AT&T; support for the iPad, there will be attractive plans soon for the PC world.I have had one problem.  I have a 60 GB USB hard drive.  It won't work.  It's a driver problem.  The drivers are in a Lenovo folder, so I called Lenovo.  They answered right away, and worked with me for quite some time, then we got "accidentally" disconnected.  I never called back.  The hard drive still doesn't work.  This is a minor issue, and I'll get it fixed later.  I wasn't happy to get disconnected, but I was pleased that I got through so easily to Lenovo, and that there was a good spirit of helpfulness.
Hey playing right now on my lenovo s10-3t. I purchased with the upgrade 2 gigs of ram, and after you kill all the crap pre-loaded lenovo software that comes with this beastly little tablet, you get the true experience of how great it actually is. First off 8 cell battery is  awesome long life although that big a battery does add some  heft but makes for a nice bezel. Second, it is windows, but once you can tweak the settings to work for you (including  power) its fast. As a simple reminder, low power settings decrease overall cpu speed. Optimal setting is great for life and speed. Mind you, I am an apple fanboy but this beats ipad hands down in cost and bang for your buck. Webcam has built in internal cam and mic, for skype or video chat(beats ipad). Great capacitive touch, typing review in tablet mode as I speak, but if I wanted could use real keyboard. (beats ipad.) I know my fellow apple lovers will hate me for the following comment and for rubbing salt in an open wound. It plays flash, both in video and in games! It lets you see the  web, without limitations. "It just works!" but unlike apple ipad, no lego blocks of fail to hold you back. I would recommend playing with settings a bit before  rushing reviews, if you do, you'll quickly see that this little tablet is money well spent.
I run a technology company and needed a nice tablet/netbook to use while I'm mobile...  which is a lot.  I researched many different brands and models and kept coming back to this Lenovo S10-3t.What do I like?  The size!  It's a great size, slips into my backpack and I can tote it around in my hands anywhere.  The bigger battery acts as a "handle" to utilize the touchscreen ability like you would hold a clipboard.  The atom processor is fast, but it's still an Intel Atom processor and won't do what a laptop can.  But I'm not trying to launch a shuttle mission with this thing...  I'm browsing the web, doing light word processing, emailing and using it to log into terminal servers.  The white keyboard is different and really attracts attention.  I have people constantly asking me what I'm carrying.  Once I give a overview and show them the touchscreen, they start [...]I find the keyboard comfortable to use.  If I were typing a novel on it, I'd look for something different.  But for average use, it's perfect.I haven't used the webcam yet so I have nothing to say about it.I can complain about the battery life...  I expected about 6 hours out of this, I'm getting about 4.  But I have my screen brightness all the way up and I'm constantly multitasking on it.The speakers are terrible.  I can't really hear anything on them.  But what can you expect from such a small device?  I didn't buy this to watch movies or listen to music.I put some upgrades on mine...I scrapped the hard drive and put in a SSD drive (WD 120GB), made a big difference on speed and I can sleep better knowing my data is safe if I ever drop this tablet.I took out the 1GB of memory and added a Cosair 2GB module I got here on Amazon.I got a kick ass "skin" from [...] for cosmetic reasons.  :)I'd recommend this netbook for business if you're bouncing from one office to the next.  Also, if you're looking for a nice internet browser to keep around the house, this is perfect.  I'd even say a college student could utilize one of these for note taking and short paper work.Don't get this if you're doing design work or heavy data processing.  Or if you're looking for something to watch movies on or listen to music...  the speakers just bring it down.If you've got the dough and are looking for a netbook, pick this one up and you'll be impressed.Also, google "lenovo s10-3t blog" and you'll find a website dedicated to this machine that has so many tweaks and tips that it'll make you want to buy it with next day shipping from Amazon...  which by the way is always dead-on with shipping.
This has got to be one of the best purchases I've made.The good: This netbook with the proper mods is really awesome: I added 2GB of ram + 4GB Class 4 SDHC for ReadyBoost and upgraded the default Windows 7 starter to W7 Ultimate for the multi-touch experience. I've also picked Firefox as my main browser because of it's touchscreen support. I really can't say anything bad about this netbook because it runs so smooth and the touchscreen is super responsive, I've even run Android x86 on VMWARE with 300MB of reserved RAM without any major issues except the touchscreen calibration. I consider myself a very demanding user and this netbook has exceeded my expectations, I find myself using it in tablet mode more often while watching TV or reading before bed.The bad:-The windows 7 version that comes with it is not the most adequate for touch screens-The 1GB of ram that comes with it is not enough to decently run windows 7-No 3G-No BluetoothFor the price, I would highly recommend this netbook to anyone.
I just got my hands on the this machine last night..and I'm surprised by the versatility.Pros: The touch screen is  great even without the upgrade, must be the sheer novelty. Nicely sized chicklet keys, and windows syncing made it easy to share music and files between my main computer and this lenovo. Im still waiting for my 2gig Ram upgrade in the mail, so Ill hold out on my final judgement until then. The tablet setup is kinda fly, but remember it twists 180 degrees not 360!!Cons: The Windows Starter is inadequate for the scope of this machine. I will be upgrading using the anytime Upgrade option to Home premium this weekend. There is so much bloatware!!! I spent all of last night just deleting stuff! No accelerometer, which is disappointing, but I hope it will be added in the next version of this computer. Ive heard many complaints that Lenovo shipped a super-size battery (8 cell). Other laptop brands usually give a 6 or even just a 4 cell, so to complaining that there is too much battery is asinine.Overall, Im happy with my purchase.I cant wait till i get some tablet games! Thanks to Amazon for getting the product to me in less than a week instead of a month like the other websites!
Got this for my folks instead of an iPad due to the freedom to travel internationally and not be locked into a contract; same functionality, plus skype access and multiple inputs. Working well so far. Only draw back is that it doesn't swap the camera around in tablet mode, i.e. you can't have a long screen with the camera on in the same orientation. There might be a way to do it but I guess I haven't figured it out yet. Not bad for 400 clams.
I am very pleased with this little netbook. Very easy to use. Touch screen is very responsive and the screen size is just big enough to read books without any problem. I will be using this netbook for all my textbooks next semester since I can get them in PDF form.An upgrade of Windows 7 from Starter to Professional or Home Premium is essential to get the full functionality out of the tablet. Battery lasts 6-7 hours while running Winamp and working with MS Word or surfing the net at the same time. The 8 cell battery could potentially last the full 10 hours if you're not doing any high processing activities.My only complaint is that some flash videos and .avi files will not play with the netbook in power save mode. This is kind of expected with the slower processor.Overall, this was a great purchase. I got it used/like new, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who travels or needs something ultra portable.
I've had a couple of weeks to sit down with this netbook, and find it to be quite wonderful all-around.  The big selling points include the touchscreen, which works like a charm.  I didn't expect it to scroll so smoothly.  My version has the 2G of RAM.  I'm sure this helps.  It's a joy to use.  The other great aspect is the keyboard, which is full sized.  The ability to toggle between keyboard and touchscreen is terrific.There are a few minor drawbacks.  First, the speakers are probably the smallest and tinniest of anything I've ever heard.  The netbook is just barely usable in terms of speakerphone/skype applications without external speakers.  Also, while the keyboard is very nice, there's an initial give to the keys that makes them a bit noisier than usual.  Finally, at least on my model, the accelerometer is a bit off so that it doesn't switch orientations at the midline.  Some directions need more tilt than others.Aside from these misgivings, I'm perfectly satisfied with this netbook.  It's small, but I have no problem using it for all of my work.  I really like reading pdf's with it and browsing news sites.  Very comfortable.
For the price you get a great netbook with excellent featuresBut I hate the size of mouse pad, irritatingly small.Love the responsiveness of the touch screen though.Overall a happy owner of this netbook.
I like this net book very much, although it is a short time that I have it, I haven't seen any problems with it yet. It looks very nice,and is light, which is good.
For what price most tablet netbook PCs are running for, this was the most reasonable. I love the portability and convenience of a netbook. I find most of the pre-installed lenovo programs are somewhat useless to me because they do not seem to be a shortcut or easier way to complete a task. however, the lenovo quickstart program is handy, when i have to look up something on the net, i don't have to wait for the system to boot & do the whole start-up process.I installed windows 7 premium and it significantly increased the touch screen function! it seemed to me that 7starter did not incorporate the use of the multitouch function in everyday programs such as a web browser. The touch screen's response is similar to that of an iphone (using the ball of your finger rather than a pinpoint of a stylus) It makes it easier to do things on a netbook (which usually come with a small mousepad) such as copy, drag, drop, scroll, flick, etc.I like the idea i have options with the swivel screen. I can use it as a conventional netbook as well as a tablet. There is an on-screen keyboard available, but for when i have more intensive typing to do, all i have to do is flip the screen up and swivel it around to have access to the keyboard (which has large keys to my surprise.)the processor could use a little more power behind it. just a little. from time to time I experience slight pauses while streaming video, scrolling web pages, and switching between programs (even with power saving settings to the max). My primary needs from this computer are to access internet, check/maintain email & social sites, use the ms office suite, quickbooks -- all on the go. And it does those things. I highly recommend upgrading the windows 7 starter. Other than that, I am pleased with my purchase.
Synopsis for now, more to come... The version I bought had 2GB ram, Windows 7 Home Premium, 250GB hard drive, and the standard non-extended battery (3 or 4 cells).  I love this machine, it's not perfect but it has quite a bit of functionality for the money.  It's the swiss army knife of computers.  It isn't really the best at anything but it does more than anything else out there at this time - as far as touch-pad/tablets are concerned.  I'm not sure a 1GB version would work well enough but other reviews here will tell that. Also, some say the Home Premium version makes this work better, so an upgrade may be necessary.Bullet points:Note: See the many Youtube videos about "Lenovo S10-3t" for tips on usage and tuning the machine to work better.* Sumatra PDF - I found this program to be the best for reading PDF e-books. It's small and smooth on flick-scrolling pages. I read mostly text so have not tested it much with graphic rich PDF's.* Firefox Browser with plugins - The "Grab and Drag" plugin is a must for touch-browsing.Pro's: everything. This device gets allot right in abilities/functionality, especially for the price and compared to the iPad.Con's:* Standard battery lasts longer than many notebooks but nothing great. I would recommend a 6 or 8 cell battery.* Even with 2GB and 4GB SD card running as Windows "ready boost", things sometimes slow down. But not often enough to be too annoying. Good overall. Still, not the smoothest touch-pad experience. Don't expect it to be as fast/smooth as an iPhone or iPad.* Keyboard and Touchpad could be better but are sufficient.* The left side buttons for changing screen orientation and starting up the Lenovo NaturalTouch app are hugely annoying.  They are too easy to hit on accident when using the S10 in portrait mode.* Not sure how useful the NaturalTouch app is, and it crashes fairly often. They'll probably update it and fix the bugs in the future.* It's a little heavy.Again, not perfect, but a great machine for the money!
I had this netbook/touch screen for about month now. I like using the netbook for pc apps. The touch screen part takes some time to get use to. Over all I like it. Pros: 10 inch screen, white keyboard-touch pad (easy on the eyes), good battery life for its size, solid feel, nice touch screen function, comes with good software utilities, and it is light weight. Cons: fan is a bit loud when it kicks on, buttons on screen are easy to hit by accident, battery extends out from the back of the unit, Windows starter (need to get the Win7 upgrade $70), and needs memory upgrade.
I purchased one mainly for working on the fly. I did upgrade the RAM and OS, added MS Office 2007 with OneNote and am very happy with the results. Touch sensitivity is great. Keyboard is nice size and responsive. The key pad takes a little getting used to as I am always tempted to use two fingers which results in jumps, but I've gotten past that and it is responsive. Video and voice recording are definitely sufficient for my purposes, though audio playback (as noted elsewhere) isn't very good through the speakers. The only input issue is the rim around the screen which can make it tough to close application windows with a touch.As a lot of people noted with their models, the accelorometer for screen orientation doesn't work on mine. There is a button which flips things, and I actually prefer that to automatic, so it isn't a problem for me. The on/off lock is nice. layout of ports is generally reallly nice, though the two USBs are pretty close together which can frustrate if you have fat usb drives (I can fit 2 standard usb chords, but not thumb drives).The Windows 7 starter is the reason I give this 4 not 5. The included proprietory stuff works fine with touch, but it didn't do everything I wanted. I loaded home premium, Office 2007, and most especially One Note. This is a great machine for one note. Home premium continues to impress me for handwriting recognition. As a book reader, it works great except in direct sunlight - Tried to read while walking to the car on a sunny day, and it was impossible. Cloudy conditions were OK, though. Hard drive speeds are sufficient but not fantastic.
I love my new Lenovo tablet. It does more than an iPad, weighs about the same, and does nearly as much as a more powerful (and more expensive, and heavier) laptop. The swivel screen works like a charm and even allows you to surf the web without booting into Windows. You can use the touchscreen, trackpad, and keyboard seamlessly. Too seamlessly perhaps: I keep finding myself trying to use my desktop monitor as a touchpad.One caveat: Many reviewers complain about battery life with the standard battery. Amazon shipped me the extended battery by default, and it lasts 8-10 hours on a charge.
I purchased this looking for a cheap alternative to a proper Tablet PC, specifically for drawing. The screen on this Lenovo S10-3t doesn't allow for stylus use, defeating the point of my purchase. However, before I sent it back I did play with it for a few hours.At first the machine was *incredibly* slow to respond, touches registered more than a second late, or not at all. I assumed that this was due to a poor quality screen, but after replacing McAfee with avast anti-virus, touches registered properly.The physical design is the worst part of this however. Here are some reasons why.* The S10-3t is built with a recessed screen, presumably to protect it from scratches. However, this ends up with your finger not being able to touch the edges of the screen. This means that, if a window (like your internet browser or a PDF) is maximized, you CANNOT touch the scroll bar to navigate through your document. The only way to do so is to open the netbook to get to the touchpad to navigate. Since this is Windows 7, and not an OS like the iPad which is designed for touch, you *have* to get to this unreachable scroll bar to scroll through documents.* Lenovo attempted to compensate for the above point by making it so that the "Lenovo touch interface" listed above launches when the monitor is snapped into tablet mode. But this software crashes if other programs (tested with MSN Messenger, Adobe Reader, and Google Talk) are open in the background. When it did work, it was slow to respond, and missed several touches and gestures, even after uninstalling McAfee. It also doesn't do web browsing itself, or eBook reading, instead launching the default programs for both. This then leaves you back at the first bullet point mentioned above.* The monitor is supposed to rotate and snap into a "channel" when in laptop mode. In this channel that is designed to hold the screen in laptop mode, there are two plastic/rubber guides that are supposed to allow this to rotate smoothly at the proper angle. Both of these popped off the third time I rotated the monitor. Without these the monitor does not stay in place in laptop mode.* (Minor Complaint) The track pad on this tablet I believe is Lenovo's standard netbook design. The buttons for left and right click are part of the track pad surface. Since this track pad allows multitouch, if you're like me and tend to leave your finger on the mouse button, your cursor will be constantly jumping to the lower left part of the screen.* (Minor Complaint) The adverting makes a big deal of multitouch, it's even selected as one of the default tags in this review. However, unless you find yourself zooming in and out on web pages a great deal, its functionally useless in a Windows 7 environment. Get a cheaper netbook and don't fall for this buzzword.
it wasn't for me, though.First, this computer ships with Windows 7 Starter which doesn't allow users to really get the feel for tablet functionality.  Sure, you can upgrade but I think Lenovo should have thought it through before shipping it--what good is a multi-touch tablet if you can't use the multi-touch functionality outside of the small, slow software created just for this machine?Second, I think Lenovo made a sacrifice in the overall quality of the machine in order to bring the cost of the touchscreen to average consumers.  I have a Lenovo S10-2 and I love it--I'm fully aware that Lenovo is capable of producing a reasonably-priced netbook that is high quality.  Comparing the S10-3t to the S10-2, I'm sad to see a dramatic decline in the quality of the smaller things like the keyboard (noisy, loose, rattling) and the speakers (tin can and string quality).Third, the battery is a little nuts.  It has to weigh at least two pounds and it knocks the laptop off balance in strange ways.  It juts out like a diving board weights nearly as much as the computer itself.  I will admit that the 10+ hours of battery life is impressive and very useful... but not for me.Finally, the capacitive touchscreen simply did not do what I wanted and the dimensions are a little wonky.  Rumors were that the S10-3t would have a digitized overlay and ship with a stylus and, obviously, it does not.  It's fun for Paint but unfeasible for any kind of note-taking requiring even the slightest amount of detail.  With such a small screen (and zero Windows-tablet functionality), even my considerably small fingers were a difficult interface.  As for the dimensions, this is not a 16:9 10.1" widescreen--it's a little wider and a little more squat.  Screen real estate is already a valuable commodity on such a little machine, screwing with the dimensions further complicates matters when you're rotating from portrait to landscape and etc.  Of course, there are a slew of tricks to maximize screen real estate in various operating systems but, for all of its flaws, none seemed with it for this machine.But that's just me.
after looking at the previous reviews, I bought 2GB RAM along with s10-3t. After upgrading the memory and OS it is a complete tablet with multitouch.But the processor became very slow after installing all the drivers of windows7, microsoft office-10(word, excel and power point), Firefox, VLC player and adobe reader,flash...it is not even playing the youtube video. while playing the youtube video the CPU performance was reaching upto 99-100% and the video got struck.Except streaming videos, it can play everything very well.note: Do not expect to play games in this netbook and also the size is more than 10.2' with battery. So do not buy a 10.2' laptop sleeve. Better to prefer 11.6' or 12.1'.Overall, I like it for webbrowsing, basic purposes and to watch downloaded movies.
excellent product in terms of quality/price ratio....not good for inking, though, since there is no stylus that work with this capacity screenotherwise it does exctly what it is promising. Neeed to update to windows prof e 2 GB of RAM
This netbook is great, but i had to upgrade the OS. Keep away from windows starter. You should move at least to home premium. Also the Lenovo Software is bad.  It crashes very often. Once you have upgraded the Operating System,  this becomes a real  tablet. Otherwise it becomes an expensive netbook.
Lenove Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook is great tablet and combine netbook too . I purchased it 2 weeks ago and I enjoy it from the first time it was turned  on. I did upgrade to windows 7 home primum and 2GB of memory so I can get everything from this little netbook/tablet.I have no issue with using microsoft office and other programs and WiFi works great whenever it recognized to be around.I gave 4 stars due to weak speakers ,lack of bluetooth ( I added bluetooth dongle ) and having stops while watching movies.I recommand this tablet for its price , functionality , connectivity and battery life.
I've had this for 3 days and not played a lot with it so far, but felt like sharing the cost factor for people looking into this kind of a PC laptop.I bought it from Amazon, because Lenovo's site would take upto 5-9 business days to ship and I had to travel with this. It is indeed a better deal for my requirements after all, read on :) .First of all, this is an IdeaPad and not a ThinkPad, hence it is designed for home users and not enterprise.This laptop has >> 166 MHz Atom Processor, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB HDD with 8 Cell Battery > $478 (no tax and free shipping)Lenovo has the following standard packages.A. [2 models different colors] Same Processor, 1 GB RAM, 160 GB HDD with 4 Cell Battery > For around $399 (if you use a eCoupon found on the internet) + Tax and Shipping. Hence around $450To match this deal, you would need :a.1. Replacement 2 GB RAM (since there is only 1 slot), Note: Atom processors support only upto 2GB. Add appx. $50.a.2. Replacement 8 cell battery, appx. $60.Total -> $590B. [1 model ] Better processor 183 GHz, same RAM, same HDD with lesser 4 Cell Battery > + Cost + Tax and Shipping > appx $480To match this deal, you would need :b.2. Replacement 8 cell battery, appx. $60.But since it ships with 2 GB standard, we can take the difference upto $30.Total -> $510I had 2GB RAM from my 17"-HP-paper-weight so worked out best.PROs* Its mostly-exactly what was expected.* I like the touch-pad, I may not care for the multi-touch, but the feel and behavior is good.* The construction material is good, given that I have never used an IdeaPad, my "ThinkPad" expectations were not shattered (yet).* I configured the VeriFace and VeriTouch, they are cool (considering they are slow but they work).CON(ishes)* The wireless connection keeps dropping, this may be an issue with my tablet (I have 4 other computers at home and none have such issues),  hope it gets resolved soon.* "HD ready" is mis-leading, there is no HDMI connectivity.* The bloatware on the first start is annoying.* The McAfee takes up a lot of space, I uninstalled it.* The OS (Windows 7 Starter) is a pain.* If you run on batteries the laptop will run slow because of the power settings.No comments on the touch yet!For the price its awesome, I am beginning with a 4 star, perhaps more to come.
I purchased this computer as a kind of commuter computer to take between the house and work.  It's certainly small enough to fit in along with a small backpack or messenger bag.  The operating system and tablet functionality is very handy for most situations.  Overall, an outstanding computer for the person on the go!But, as with most things, a few caveats.  First, it comes with Windows 7 Starter installed.  The only issue that I have with that is that there are some functions of the OS that aren't available.  The most noticeable, for me at least, was the fact that you cannot change the desktop background.  I understand that it has this version of Windows installed because the computer's hardware is just above what's needed to run Windows 7, but still an annoyance if nothing else.  The update to Windows 7 Home is about $80, but I don't know yet if the improved features will outweigh the price and possible increased demand on the already taxed CPU resources.  Secondly, the desktop can get rather cluttered if you have more than a half dozen icons on it.  But there are several ways to work around that.  Thirdly, there is no CD drive.  If you fortunate enough to have an external drive that you can use (e.g. DVD burner), this isn't an issue.  There simply isn't room in the case for a CD drive.  It has all of the other usual peripheral ports (USB ports, SD card slot, audio out jack, and a built-in camera).  Finally, the touchscreen functionality is very user-friendly, but is a little difficult to use right near the edges and corners.  For closing maximized windows, for example, it's better to direct the cursor via the mousepad.For me, none of these things was enough to discourage me from getting this fine piece of computing awesomeness!  I highly recommend this notebook!  I think of this as PC's answer to the iPad; similarly priced and better functionality in my opinion.
I bought this directly from penpower since Amazon didn't carry it at the time. I've used it on a PowerMac G5 running OS X 10.5.8 with two monitors. At one point it worked pretty well, though not nearly as well as the handwriting built into higher-end versions of Windows 7. The strokes are not as smooth, the recognition of poorly drawn characters is not as forgiving, editing is harder.  Also, the tablet is not quite calibrated correctly and there's no way to adjust the calibration.  This is a minor annoyance. Recently when I've used it I've had two big problems. First, the screen cursor doesn't track the pen when you hover it above the tablet. Second, when trying to use full screen input I got a spinning beachball cursor and was unable to get control back. I had to reset my Mac. It' been years since I've had my Mac crash like this.  I probably should uninstall and reinstall and try again, but I don't think it's worth the effort.This may work better with an Intel mac, or if  you don't have have two screens. It doesn't work for me.Chinese handwriting may work with Apple's Magic Trackpad. If it's like the Chinese input on the iPhone, it will be worthwhile.
I've now spent the better part of a day playing with the new iPad, and while it excels in many things there are still some things anyone considering buying one should probably keep in mind.First the good sides:This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.The not so good sides:As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.As a laptop replacement:The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.
The main difference between this item, and the wi-fi only version, is of course the sim card with 3G.  So, before I talk about the iPad in general, I'd like to explain my take on the 3G.3G Performance:The BOTTOM LINE:  Works good as long as you aren't using it in a moving car.  I ran an internet speed test on it and in the metro area it was 1.2Mbps down and 210kbps up, which is decent.The DETAILS: If you are doing basic computing, you will be able to be anywhere within a 3G service area to enjoy the internet.  (If 3g service sucks in your area, don't buy an iPad 3g)  Here is the only problem: when you pass from tower to tower the signal can hang as the data has to be rerouted to the new tower.  Lets put this another way.  If you are using the iPad netflix app to stream "Kim Possible season 3" videos to your iPad while driving at 60 MPH it will "hang" during the 22 minute show.  In summary: The AT&T; 3G works the same as my 3G expresscard from Verizon.2G Performance: Yes, you can use your iPad on AT&T;'s 2G EDGE network as needed.  The data is slow.  You won't enjoy it.3G setup:3G setup is simple:- press settings button, choose cellular data, press set up cellular service.- put in your *iTunes* password.  (AT&T; is "invisible" except for a logo.)- put your credit card into the iPad- voila! you have service for 30 daysIts very slick and takes less than a minute.  Its how it should be.Avoiding the 3G data charges:  If you are an iPhone user, and you have an iPad, you can avoid paying for 2 data plans by swapping sim cards.  Of course, you might miss a few calls while your sim is in the iPad because the iPad doesn't support phone calls.  If you have an older iphone: Older iPhones use large SIM cards and the ipad uses small microSIM cards.  You would have to cut your large sim card down to the microsim size, and put it in your iPad (you will need a needle to pop it out).  You would need to buy a little adapter (sold on the internet) to make your small sim fit back into your iPhone (so, buy the adapter first!)  But this isn't a great long term solution, because, if you want to use the iPad as a GPS in the car you will not be able to use your phone quickly or easily until you switch them back out again.  Here it is on Amazon:  Microsim Adapter for Ipad Iphone4g Convert Micro Sim to Regular Sim AdapterDO YOU WANT THE 3G INTERNET?Despite my little princess being vexed at Kim Possible hanging, the answer is yes.  Certainly, its wonderful to have the 3G access.  Everything about the iPad works better because its a bigger screen, and being able to access the internet (almost) anywhere is very, very useful for me.Now, the question begs to be asked:  why the ipad at all?I have to say I originally joined the legion of pundits who said "hey, its just a big ipod touch" and "it won't replace my laptop".  Certainly, this has to be the two most common things you hear people say about the ipad, right?  And yes, that can be the truth you choose.iPad vs. Laptop: If your idea is to buy an iPad to replace your laptop, and get an external keyboard, and a docking station, and bla bla bla... then you will be disappointed.  This is a different kind of device, and you can't put a square peg in a round hole.  The iPad is for even more mobile computing than a laptop can provide.  ***A laptop needs a desk.  But the iPad doesn't.***  Thats the point, and if its not compelling for you, then consider carefully before buying an iPad.iPad vs. iPod Touch:  To say its just a big iPod touch is not really fair.  The processor is much more powerful, allowing you to do a LOT MORE.  You also get a big screen.  And the 3g with this version.  So to refuse to upgrade from the ipod Touch is similar to refusing to upgrade from a Kia Rio on the grounds that all other cars do the same thing.But the biggest reason the iPad+3G will work for you, is that after a few weeks with it, you will want learn how to make it work for you.  You will *enjoy* using it and it will be easier to use.  You will say "how can I change what I do so I can do it on the iPad" not "how can the iPad do exactly what I did before".For an example: here is a day with the iPad.I get up in the morning, and if I'm not being lazy, I get on the treadmill.  I prop the ipad up on the treadmill while I walk.  I watch some news video on the iPad, read some email, play a game, catch up on facebook.  I'm usually not done with this after my walk, so I head downstairs.  Its like carrying a magazine, its so easy.  I bump into my daughter in the hall and show her a picture from her Grandmother, with the iPad securely held in only one hand.  While I'm eating breakfast, and shaving, and brushing my teeth, I'm catching up on a book I was reading on my wife's Kindle: using the kindle ipad app.  Then I can use the iPad when I leave the house, in a myriad of ways that I would not use my iPod Touch or Laptop.  And the iPad fits in the pocket in my car door.  Its really never in the way!So far I have used the iPad to:1) Watch streaming netflix movies.2) Read books on iBooks and Kindle for iPad, both to myself and to my children.3) Browse the internet without constantly having to use finger motions similar to "pinch" and "peace" (goodbye iPhone!).4) My kids use it as an interactive coloring book at restaraunts.5) I can control my laptop when I am away from home if something crucial comes up, as if I'm sitting at my laptop.6) Move pictures from my digital camera to the iPad very quickly and easily (using the camera adapter, sold separately).  Either for storage or for emailing.7) Listen to Pandora internet radio anywhere in the house. (ok, I can't really listen to "Crystal Method thump thump boom boom music" but most other music sounds good)8) I have used the internet to teach my children things when we are away from the house (Daddy, where does the word "helicopter" come from?)9) Watched owned or rented iTunes movies on my 42 inch LCD TV (using an adapter sold separately).The point of the above is that the iPad gives me more FREEDOM when computing, due to its small footprint and light weight.What you can't do on an iPad:1) Multitask.  You don't really need all those windows open, but, we're all used to that.2) Print.3) Use the iPad to connect to a TV and give a presentation.  When you use the HDTV adapter, the iPad screen blacks out so you can only use this for movies.4) See macromedia Flash based content online.  (a lot of websites use this, like Hulu)Steve Jobs says 1 and 2 are coming, in fact, multitasking is on the new iPhone4 so it won't be long.#4 will probably never come.  If you need to use Flash websites, then, stick with our laptop.  End of story.Oh and the battery....  The battery is consistently lasting all day, 12 hours, without a recharge.  But, its important to note that MANY USB ports will not charge an iPad.  None of mine will.  Also, my cheap iPhone car charger will not charge my iPad.  There has been discussion about this lately, apparently the charger or USB port has to actually provide the correct rated power.  Most don't provide enough power.  But the battery lasts all day for me so this is not a negative.If the reasons above don't help you make up your mind, consider Steve Wozniak's recent comments about the iPad:  "Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing."  No viruses.  No compatibity issues.  No wondering why your iPad is so slow (Apple vets all software to make sure this doesn't happen).  No questionable upgrades.  No cryptic errors.  All these things were things that took the joy out of computing for a lot of people.The iPad is such a simple thing.  And thats why the average person will love it and prefer to use it instead of a computer.I'll upgrade this to 5 stars if/when:1) More powerful iPad apps come out2) Multitasking 2 things at once is possible (at least web browser and word processing, or pandora internet radio app + any other app would be nice)3) Some kind of printing would be cool, although, I'm ok with paperless, really...There you have it.
Having spent some serious time with Apple's iPad since its release, it's easy to see how the device can stir up so much excitement and so much disappointment from all different angles with much less middle-ground. People tend to either love it or hate it. I hope I can shed some light on the details of real-world iPad usage, not just blind claims like several non-iPad users seem to be screaming. I'll detail all the benefits and the caveats of owning the device I've found so far, with hopes that you'll get a clear picture of whether or not the iPad really is for you.For those interested, I've also compiled two iPad listmania lists:Must-Have iPad Accessories:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R1M3AJDBR2BCA7?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8iPad vs. Other Tablets:http://www.amazon.com/lm/R3QLZ307253XU6?tag=1pad-20&ie;=UTF8===== Background and Initial Reaction =====I'm a mobile app developer who's created apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. Leading up to the announcement of the iPad, several rumors surfaced about Apple's new tablet device within iPhone development circles. The big rumor was that it would likely be based on the iPhone OS (the operating system built for the iPhone/iPod Touch). I had a lot of mixed feelings about that though. Part of me wanted the iPad to be able to run standard Mac apps (which the iPhone OS simply cannot do), while the other part of me saw the potential for app developers to take full advantage of the iPad's bigger screen and multi-touch interface on a whole new level, as iPhone/iPad apps generally aren't available for the Mac or PC specifically. What this meant for future iPad users was the potential to do more with the iPad than you would be able to do with an ordinary Mac or PC, though there would be some compromise therein until Apple or other developers could create an app that would fill any gaps in functionality.When announced, I was fairly critical about how similar the iPad was to the iPod Touch. Indeed it does seem like an oversized iPod Touch, especially with the overly huge icons (and excessive spacing between them) on the home screen. Only 4 additional apps per-screen are permitted on the iPad (24 total) than the iPod Touch (20 total). But while iPad isn't without flaw, nor is it a complete laptop or desktop replacement by any means, it's still certainly more than just a glorified iPod Touch. After spending some time with it, the differences quickly become evident.Neither is it a "Kindle killer" though it is certainly a great e-reader that will have a lasting effect on the future of digital books and publications. Moreover, there is a definite potential for the device to be useful beyond everything it is currently being touted as by Apple. Consider what the iPhone can do now compared to its first version with nothing but Apple's standard iPhone apps (before the app store was created).===== First Impression =====Taking the iPad out of the box for the first time, you'll come to realize just how touch-worthy the device really is. The slick screen reflects your glossy-eyed likeness as you gaze upon it and inhale in that one-of-a-kind scent synonymous with brand-new electronic gadgetry. Wrapping your hand around your new baby to embrace it for the first time, you find new meaning to the term "baby" because the back feels smooth like a baby's butt. And there's no doubt that this is exactly how Apple wants you to feel when unboxing the iPad for the first time.Right away, you'll probably notice that it's heavier than you might expect for such a slim device. For a real-world reference, the weight is comparable to that of two 200-page magazines (or 400 pages). Why so heavy? This thing's got two massive batteries which give it that touted 10 full-hours of life with wifi, though I got eight full hours out of constant Netflix streaming. Either way though, such a great battery life is something the iPhone/iPod Touch can't, uh... touch! Another contributor is Apple's signature glass touch-screen. However, the glass screen is phenominal at preventing scratches and ensures the display will always be crystal clear... at least until you lay your greasy mitts all over it.Smudging of finger oils is an issue with just about any touch screen device, but the iPad is special. It has an "oleophobic" coating that should repel the greasy smears, streaks and fingerprints. After using it a majority of the first day, it became evident that the coating doesn't work 100%. It resisted much better than the iPod Touch, which has no such coating, but you can expect there will still be some traces of oil residue from the skin contacting the screen. Washing your hands frequently helps reduce this, but you'll really only notice it if you try to notice it (by either reflecting light off the screen, or turning the screen off). So ultimately your experience interacting with the iPad will hardly be affected by such smearing--there won't be any blurriness or ill effects. However, do note that oleophobic coatings usually start deteriorating after a few months, so expect it to degrade over time, and eventually wear off completely, resulting in more pronounced smearing.One of my bigger grievances with the iPad is the utter waste of screen real-estate. I'm specifically talking about the excessive 1" black margin around the sides. What is the deal with that? Surely Apple could have thinned that out and either made the actual screen slightly bigger, or made the iPad itself slightly smaller. It really disheartens me for Apple to have squandered such valuable space on rubbish like that. The margin should have been the size of the margin used for the 13" or 15" MacBook Pro or the iPhone/iPod Touch--about half an inch.While on the subject of wasted space, I'm also equally disappointed with the excessive spacing (padding) between the app icons on the home screen. Just like the much-smaller iPod Touch, you can only have four apps per row (i.e. four columns) when in portrait mode (orientation in the upright position), though an additional row has been added. On the other hand, flipping the iPad to landscape mode (on its side) enables you to have one additional column of apps, though you lose the additional row that you get with the iPad's orientation set to portrait mode. Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPod Touch cannot show apps in any orientation other than portrait/upright.Either way, in both iPad orentations, it seems like Apple could have fit an additional column of app icons between each other, though five or six columns in portait mode (and six or seven columns in lamdscape mode) would satisfy my preferences. In any case, at least the iPhone OS 4.0 update (scheduled for the iPad this fall) will bring "folders" to the iPad, a feature that allows you to better-organize apps on the home screen by grouping them into a single icon whose app collection is revealed in a popup region.===== So What Can This Thing Do? =====When Apple first announced the iPad they didn't tout it so much as an ebook reader as they did a "netbook killer" (due to its ability to surf the web, check e-mail, watch videos, listen to music, and do a lot of the simpler tasks that netbooks were originally designed to do. Thus Apple had put less weight on the iPad as an e-reader in their announcement, which is still very apparent now that the iPad has been released.Despite the fact that it has begun to spark a revolution in the publication and delivery of full-color magazines and news, in addition to its support for reading e-books, Apple has taken a low-lying strategy with their iPad as an e-reader or "Kindle killer" as some iPad users have touted. When you go to Apple's website, and browse the guided tours that Apple has made for the iPad, you'll see that the guided tour for Apple's e-book reader app "iBooks" is near the bottom of the list. (Just below it is Apple's guided tour for its iPad productivity suite "iWork" which lets you edit Microsoft office documents such as Word files, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations). What they don't exactly tell you outright is that iBooks (or iWork) is not included on the iPad out-of-the-box. They're extra applications that you have to download from Apple's iPad app store.Having not bundled the iBooks app with the iPad, Apple seems to be positioning the iPad as more than just an e-book reader. Despite the fact that you have to download iBooks, the app itself is indeed free, though the books themselves aren't (of course). As a courtesy though, and as a sort of demonstration, Apple decided to throw in a Winnie the Pooh book for free. What a nice gesture, Apple!On the other hand, to use the iPad for editing office documents, you'll need to download Apple's productivity suite iWork, a trilogy of apps which consists of: Pages, for word processing; Each of the three apps can be downloaded separately for $9.99 each. Completely reworked for the iPad, the complete iWork suite will set you back a whole thirty bucks. So be aware of that before you go ahead and grab the iPad for use with work-related document editing, and so forth.Also note that if you do intend to use the iPad for heavy writing or word-processing purposes, you'll find that your ability to type quickly will be greatly inhibited by the virtual keyboard. Thus, you should snag the external keyboard as well (Note: I'll also explain some typing techniques below). Either way, be prepared to pay more than merely the price for the iPad alone. There's clearly more than meets the eye if you intend to transform the iPad into something a little more productive than it might be for you out of the box.===== Interaction Experience =====The iPad is fast and responsive, and touch interface is phenomenal on the same level that all of Apple's other touch-screen devices have been to date. With the iPad, Apple brings a whole new meaning to the term "multi-touch". The iPad touch-screen supports up to ten simultaneous touches, assuming there is ever a need for that, and given that the developer of whatever app needs that many touches has integrated support for that many touches. For example, the most common app supporting ten simultaneous touches is the piano app.Being touted more as a Web browser and email device than an e-book reader, plus with the added potential that you'll be using the iPad to edit office documents, typing on the device can quickly become a concern. First off, realize that the iPad is not a laptop in the sense that you aren't going to be typing at a speed that I would consider fast enough to be conducive for heavy usage like writing a book, posting articles on blogs or typing lengthy emails. With that in mind, there are a couple approaches you can try to determine what' typing method is right for you. The ideal method might also change depending on where you are and how the iPad is oriented when using it.Typing Method #1:The most common and most flexible approach is to type with your thumbs, which can be done whether sitting or standing. To do this effectively, the iPad should ideally be in portrait mode--I'll explain why in a bit. Grasp the bottom of your iPad with your palms facing each other, and your pinky fingers towards you for the iPad to rest on. To stabilize the iPad and prevent it from flopping over and falling out of your hands, stretch both of your index fingers upwards towards the top of the iPad as much as is comfortable. Proceed with using your thumbs hunt and peck the keys on the virtual keyboard to your heart's content.This typing method works best with the iPad in portrait orientation (tall/upright position). It can also be used like this in landscape orientation (wide/sideways position), though I find it much harder to reach the central keyboard keys with my thumbs without the edge of the iPad interfering (constantly hitting the web of skin between the thumb and index finger).Typing Method #2:I've found this next method to be even more useful, though it requires you to be is best used while seated, with the iPad in resting in your lap, or on something soft, preferably with the iPad in landscape mode. With the iPad situated securely on your legs, you'll find it becomes easier to type with your full range of digits (fingers), like you would on a full sized physical keyboard.I found it slightly awkward, though, to hit the spacebar frequently with the side of my thumbs as you typically would on a physical keyboard. Still, whether you use your thumbs for the spacebar, or decide to use your fingers instead, you'll still find yourself typing slightly faster than with the thumbs-only hunt-and-peck method.Also, this typing method doesn't work well with the iPad resting any anything hard and flat like a desk or table, as the rounded backside of the iPad causes it to wobble uncontrollably while trying to type. However, if placement on a hard surface is a must, you might try putting something soft under the iPad to stabilize it.Other methods of typing on the iPad include the aforementioned external keyboard, as well as speech-to-text transcription apps. The latter includes the Dragon Notes app from Nuance, but I've found its quality in transcription to be laughable at best.===== Web Browsing =====Alongside email, and spending money in the app store, Web browsing is one of Apple's biggest suggestions for using the device. The iPad was born to surf the Web, and its screen resolution of 1024x768 tends to concur, especially in landscape mode. Most websites are around 800-1000 pixels wide, so when the iPad is in landscape orientation, Apple's Safari Web browser will render any sites that are less than 1024 pixels wide at their intended original size, meaning you see them at their true size, rather than seeing a smaller, more compressed version of the site.In general though, I tend to prefer browsing the Web in portrait mode, since web pages are almost always taller than they are wide. Still, even in portrait mode, the iPad allows you to see more content at a decent size, Of course, even in portrait orientation, the compressed pages rendered are still easily readable without squinting your eyes, which isn't often the case for Web browsing on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Plus, you can always zoom into any section by double tapping any region of the active page. Even zoomed-in regions are displayed with crisp clarity, and working within the Safari browser interface is swift and responsive.However, not all your sites will work desirably on the iPad. Apple is closed-mindedly refusing to support Adobe Flash on the iPad (as it has with the iPhone/iPod Touch). Regardless of whether you like it or not, Flash is being used around the Web, not only for advertising and video but for many other uses from graphs to product comparisons. The same lack of support is true of Java, AIR, Silverlight and others. So expect some of your sites to only be supported to a certain degree, if not entirely in rare cases. This can be a bit of a bummer until Flash starts being replaced with other technologies like HTML5's canvas technology, which is poised to take on some of Flash's most familiar capabilities.===== Email =====Email on the iPad's Mail app is best viewed in landscape mode, as it allows you to see both your list of messages on the left as well as the selected message itself on the right. It also makes managing emails easier, such as moving messages to other folders (or to the trash). Another reason for landscape mode is to make typing those lengthy emails easier (using typing-method #2 mentioned above).You can have multiple email accounts, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange and other custom POP3 and IMAP accounts.Overall, The Mail app is fairly simple to use. It's easy and quick to read and answer your emails, but in general it's not very powerful. For example, there is currently no support for a unified inbox, but support for that will be added in the fall with the iPhone OS 4.0 update.Important Note: With the growing number of portable web connecting devices, there is one concern I want to express on your behalf. When you close the Mail app, it continues running in the background, even after disconnecting from one WiFi hotspot and reconnecting to another. My concern with this is that if haven't set up your e-mail with a secure connection, and you connect to a public WiFi hotspot that a malicious user is monitoring, then the instant your mail app connects to the hotspot to check your e-mail, your e-mail credentials may be suddenly compromised. To avoid this you definitely want to be using some kind of secure connection for your e-mail if at all possible. Web-based email such as Gmail typically support this out of the box, and Gmail accounts are the easiest to setup on the iPad.===== Media =====If you own an iPhone or iPod Touch, it's comforting to know that you audio/video experience will be similar on the iPad. You can watch videos via the YouTube app, which has been updated for the iPad to show YouTube HD videos beautifully. While the 1024x768 resolution of the iPad is a standard 4:3 ratio, not a widescreen 16:9 ratio, the HD videos as well as other video (including downloads from the iTunes store) display just fine.The Netflix app was also a pleasant and much-welcome surprise, as I'd been waiting over a year for Netflix to put out an app for the iPhone/iPod Touch. While it isn't that, it is indeed just as good. Netflix videos stream quickly and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quick without much time rebuffering the video.===== Photos =====Two words: No camera!But thinking seriously about this, would you really want to take pictures/video with this device? You might look kind of awkward. I can't say that I've felt the urge to whoop out my iPad and shoot a photo yet. On the other hand though, logically speaking, Apple should have put the camera up front (as a webcam) instead of on the back, to make the iPad more versatile as a video-chat device for use with apps such as Skype. Ultimately, though, I think Apple couldn't make a decision on exactly where to put a camera. Even on the front, they would have to put it either at the top (optimized for portrait mode) or on the side (optimized for landscape mode). I'll admit, such a decision would be tough, which might explain why Apple decided to nix it all together.Of course, that left an open market for iPad apps that could help bridge the gap. Now, there are a couple apps that allow you to pair your iPhone to your iPad, take pictures with the iPhone, and then subsequently send them to your iPad. First, download an application called "Camera A" on your iPad. Then on your iPhone and grab the "Camera B" app. One of the apps will be free, the other is 99 cents, but for that 99 cents you will get the ability to take pictures with your iPhone and save them directly to your iPad through the Bluetooth connection.===== E-Reading =====Whether it's books, magazines or news, the iPad isn't just making history, it's making an impact on the future of media reading on a whole new level. Apple has been under-emphasizing the e-book and e-publication reading capabilities of the iPad to date, but I feel it's one of the iPad's greatest strengths, regardless of how heavy it is. Fact is, the iPad is still a game-changer. After all, it's lighter than 98% of other laptops with the same sized screen. It is becoming crystal-clear just what the iPad means for the publication industry. This goes far beyond simply reading e-books. Magazine and newspaper publishers have been jumping onboard the iPad bandwagon by creating their own custom apps that take their publications to a whole new level, but interactively and financially.My experiences interacting with some of these new digital representations of magazines and newspapers have been a breath of fresh air. Being able to read them on a screen simply isn't enough. The ability to still touch them, combined with a rich interactivity on a level that can't be matched by their printed counterparts has really given new life to what I feared was becomming a dying trade. Of course, another big perk for me has been the ability to save space because now I can keep all my magazines around without ever taking up more than the size of a single magazine (since the iPad is comparable in size to a single magazine).As far as e-books go, you're not losing out by passing up on the Kindle, because you have full access to Kindle books on the iPad via Amazon's Kindle app. That's not to say that the iPad is a Kindle killer by any means, as the two devices are distinctly different, and both offer a very unique experience. If you read a lot of novels, or prefer to read outdoors, and you don't mind reading in shades of gray rather than in full-color, then the Kindle was indeed made for you, as the Kindle is lighter and the display is easier to read in the sunlight. However, that doesn't mean the iPad would serve no purpose to you, even as an e-reader, because it can read Magazines, News and even the Web on a level that cannot be matched by the Kindle (at least not yet). Besides, no one said your choice was limited to one device or the other. Get them both, if it tickles your fancy!All physical aspects aside, the iPad is definitely a great e-reader, just on a whole new level. Those touting that the iPad is just a glorified iPod Touch, however, probably don't realize this important distinction: the apps being put out by publishers are iPad specific and cannot be used on the iPod Touch nor on the iPhone.===== Gaming =====If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Ultimately, I still se the iPad as a productivity device more than as a gaming console. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. Alas, it may just be time toWithout a doubt, millions of people use their computers for gaming, and with the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPad is, and will continue to be, a decent platform for playing games.I see board games and lap-friendly games being the most popular on the iPad. Meanwhile, I suspect that games heavily dependent on rotation and other accelerometer-based interaction may quickly wear you out do to the weight of the iPad. I got tired of playing EA's Need For Speed: Shift after about 5 minutes. Resting the iPad on my knee didn't help much.===== Productivity =====Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its "getting something done" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPad's strengths considering it currently does not support multitasking (yet). In the context of software though, applications that allow you to edit office documents are commonly referred to as productivity software. Apple's own suite of productivity apps, collectively called "iWork", has been re-created from the ground up just for the iPad. (Previously it was only available for Macs.) For work-minded individuals, it will probably one of the most popular uses of the iPad. There are three apps in all: Pages is a word processing app that allows you to create and edit word processing documents. Then there's Numbers, which allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. Finally there's Keynote, which lets you create or edit presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files). So far, I've found the latter to be pretty invaluable in giving personal presentations within small groups or one-on-one meetings.However, there is a whole category of iPhone and iPad-specific apps dedicated to productivity, and are consequently located under the category titled "productivity" in the categories section of the app store. Remember, any app that works for the iPhone will run on the iPad, but do note that there are some exceptional productivity apps made or updated for the iPad specifically. Some notable iPad-specific productivity apps include Bento (personal organization/information management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote desktop/VNC), Layers (drawing/painting), and GoodReader (best PDF+ reader around).===== Printing =====Notice that I haven't said much about printing so far, as there is no perceived way to print from any of the iWorks apps, nor from email, nor Web pages in Safari. This is a potentially huge flaw, especially for people who want to use the iPad for editing office documents. This, if nothing else, is what I think sets the iPad apart most from desktops, laptops, netbooks and even other (Windows-based) tablets. There are apps that support printing, but they have been quirky to use and typically require a printer that supports them and the details of what you can and cannot print varies widely between the available printing apps.===== Security =====With portable devices, there should always be some level of concern regarding the safety and protection of your data. The iPad  deliver surprisingly well in the area, providing several layers of security to protect your data. You can require complex passcodes to securely access important information, encrypt data whether stored or transferred over WiFi, and even remotely wipe everything from your iPad instantly in the event of theft or loss (with subscription to Apple's MobileMe service).===== Technical Specifications =====Amazon's product descriptions tends to be a bit lacking so here's all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

There are apps for that, but there should be a universal method for printing if you're going to use this for productive purposes.===== The Bottom Line =====Despite several disappointments, the iPad is a device worthy to be in a class of its own. This is a good and a bad thing, as it's certainly no laptop nor netbook replacement. But there is a lot of potential. Apps from the app store, built especially for the iPad, will be what makes the iPad shine, as more and more developers see its potential and start coding world-class apps for the device.It may not leave your pockets or wallet happy, but if you want to take the iPad from good to great, there are plenty of "apps for that". Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPad to be a usable device, with a deceptive price (given upgrades, apps and AppleCare). And just like every other Apple fan, you'll get over its flaws. There's always hope for Apple to improve on the iPad 2G in another year or two.I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. :)
Want the long and the short of it without having to read a "mega review"? Here goes. I have an original Kindle and a DX and I've had an iPad for one week. I love them all, but the iPad has won me over. Here's what I've experienced so far:VERSATILITY - Apps, movies, music, pictures, effective internet connectivity, color display, extremely intuitive GUI all combine to make iPad the hands down winner in this category.DISPLAY - E Ink is much better for reading, especially in bright light. And, the matte screen on the Kindle doesn't smudge as easily as the iPad screen. However, the iPad has a gorgeous color display and once you get accustomed to it, reading is not difficult. I especially like the backlit display at night when reading in bed ... I can read to my hearts content and not bother my sleeping wife. Slip on the headphones and my full iTunes library is available while I read. If you want a device only to read books, the Kindle wins. If you want color and a display that shows book diagrams and pictures clearly, the iPad wins.PAGE INTERFACE - I actually like turning pages on the Kindle much better than I do on the iPad. While the iPad has a cool page turning visual (it looks like the page is actually turning), the touch screen is far too sensitive and there is very little edge around the screen to hold on to. The result is that I'm constantly turning pages on the iPad when i don't want to. Kindle's buttons win this one hands down.CONVENIENCE - on the iPad, all my media is in one place (audio books, photos, music, books, internet, breaking news/weather, address book, email ... the list goes on.) The Kindle, while and excellent book reading device, still requires me to bring along an iPod or a laptop when I travel. iPad is the clear winner.PRICE - Kindle and the iPad simply aren't that far apart. If a hundred bucks is going to break the budget, stick with the Kindle because it is an excellent reader. If you can afford a little more, go with the iPad... it just is much more versatile. If the Kindle DX were a couple of hundred bucks less, it would be a great reading bargain.AVAILABLE BOOKS - hands down, Amazon slaughters Apple in just sheer volume of available titles. However, Apple's titles often include color pictures, diagrams, etc. that can actually be sized by the reader for easier viewing. Downside here is that Apple's titles are often higher priced. Winner here is Amazon/Kindle. However, there is an App available for the iPad that allows you to read Amazon Kindle media. It is still not a very elegant design, but it does allow you to read these titles easily and I'm sure the App will only improve with time.SEX APPEAL - ok, when the Kindle was first introduced, it was a hot item. I couldn't read it at the airport without being interrupted at least a few times by people asking what it was and waning to look at it. Same thing with the iPad, only it's exponentially hotter. With it's sleek design, excellent color display and tons of Apps, people just go nuts asking questions. In short, it just generates a lot of interest and this is proven by the fact that Apple has already sold over a million of these things during the first month of availability. This thing is addictive ... with the Kindle, I can read a book. With the iPad, I can do almost everything I could before on my laptop AND I can read a book.MY OPINION ONLY - sorry Amazon. You have a great product that pioneered the whole ebook market (others came before you, but you made it work.) Your Kindle is an excellent product, but given the iPad, your device is very much overpriced. Your library continues to be the standard by which all others are judged and I will continue to buy e-books from you, but I'll be reading them on an iPad. On that rare occasion where I'll be laying on a beach reading in direct sunlight, I'll pull out my Kindle because you have an edge there.I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. I the end, it's your money and your preference so my opinion really doesn't matter. I hope you enjoy whichever device you settle on.

 Length:: 9:40 MinsHopefully my video shows you most of everything you needed to know.If not, please feel free and ask. I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price. I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.
I have 2 iPads. A 64 GB WiFi only model which I bought the day it was available, and this 32GB 3G model which I picked up last week. They are about the same price; if you have to choose between an extra 32GB of storage and 3G capacity, definitely go with the 3G if for nothing else future proofing. I consider this to be the sweet spot of the 6 iPad variants.Right now, my wife is in China with a WiFi only model. She is not a technical person, and can rarely find an open WiFi hotspot. So, she goes days between checking her e-mail. E-mail which might be critical to her business. If she had a 3G model, I could have purchased a modestly priced data plan from Chinese Unicom, modified a data SIM to a micro-SIM, and she would be getting her e-mail every minute, and doing some light web browsing.  On the other hand, her iPad is loaded with media with over a dozen DVD quality films, all her music, and a large number of family photos. This does take advantage of the extra storage, but is a poor substitute for the whole Internet.3G is not quite the great deal as it was yesterday, AT&T; is eliminating unlimited data for new accounts. In the past, the deal was you could get unlimited data for $30/month with no contract. Now you can get a $25/month deal for 2GB, which is probably more than enough if you don't watch video.  Existing $30/month users might as well be on contract, because they will have to keep paying to get the original deal.  There are also cheaper smaller plans. Right now I'm on the unlimited plan, and it is great. I have been Skyping to my wife in China, using Google maps, browsing the web in the dentist office and at lunch. It is very slick. I tried the 250 MB/month plan and that was just too small for what I was doing.As for the rest of the iPad, it is great. I downloaded a free novel from the iBooks store and read it comfortably without any eyestrain or hurting my arm. It's my preferred device for browsing the web, although you do get to notice the lack of Flash. It's mostly ads though so that's fine, but occasionally there will be a graph or video which you just can't see. Over time, I expect this will be less of a problem as Flash dies out, but it is mildly annoying now.The glass does get awfully greasy, but that is easily wiped away. Typing is surprisingly OK, I can type about as fast as I normally can if I concentrate. My kids like watching YouTube every night, and that is slicker than going to the website. So, I find I use the iPad several hours a day, which means I can get 2 or 3 days out of a full battery charging, which is a relief compared to being worried about keeping my iPhone charged.This is indeed a game changing device, and I think most anyone will find there are hours of the day whether it be on the couch, bed or passenger's seat where it is nearly the ideal computing companion.
Just to set the stage correctly - I'm a multiple Microsoft MVP winner for the tablet PC platform.  I've been using tablets since their inception in the early 2000's and have used Windows since 1988.  I've been programming since 1981.  My level of knowledge is way, way up there.  And until last July, I never even considered a Mac product.  Everything I needed to do was available on Windows, most of the critical apps of mine weren't even available for the Mac OS.Last spring I purchased another car, and I've long had MP3 players, but never an Ipod.  This new car had direct plug access to the Ipods, and allowed all the metadata to display on the radio head unit, as well as full control via the steering wheel controls.  So I got an Ipod, my first Apple device.  For the heck of it I threw the little Apple sticker on my back window and watched everyone who knew me, employees and clients alike (I'm the director of an IT consulting firm), freak out when they saw the apple on my car.Then last July a friend of mine showed me his new Macbook pro, and what got me was the hardware, NOT the software.  The touchpad was just magical, and after trying it, there was no other input method to compare, and all the windows machines had nothing that felt like this glass surfaced beauty.  The backlit keyboard, the solid body (My last two Lenovo's had cracks in their shells just from grabbing one side and picking them up), the design of the hardware was just light years past anything ever done on a PC.  And with the new ones running on the intel processor, and able to directly run windows, not just virtually, it made sense for me to get one.  So I did.Then last November I replaced my 1 year old Media center PC with a new Dell Zino, and a month after that replaced THAT with a new Mac Mini.  So in about 5 months, I went from a Mac hater to someone who had an ipod, a macbook pro, and a Mac Mini.So when the iPad was announced, people weren't sure where I'd fall.  I was a longtime Mac hater, now a convert, but this "first ever tablet device" was hardly that, Microsoft has been doing tablets for a long time.  And my initial take was very, very negative.  Like most of the talking heads out there who didn't like it, I was wondering what possible use something that wasn't a real OS would be, something that can't multitask, and, for my tablet background, why on earth there's no support for pens.  For me, the best thing about tablets and slates has always been notetaking.  I loved MS Journal, and Onenote.  Not for *converting* the handwriting to text, but for persisting my notes IN handwriting.  I liked it.  Worked great.  And the form factor on this device would have been outstanding for such activity.But no joy, we all know how Jobs hates pens.  Don't know why, he thinks it's an "outdated" method of input or some such, yet he puts keyboards on everything, which, according to his type of thinking, should also by now be an outdated type of input...So I had no plans on getting one.  I have been waiting for more info on the HP Slate, which would run Windows 7, have multitasking ability, all the things I was used to on a slate.But I kept thinking about the battery life.  And the form factor.  I use a kindle daily, and this would be a great replacement for it since, while I liked the concept, both versions of the device I've had just still didn't do it for me.  My eyes don't get strained from conventional monitors and displays so it didn't benefit me at all to have the paper ink, but it WOULD benefit me to have a backlit device again for night time reading.  And since the iBook app supposedly would allow me to open other books I already had (I've been doing ebooks for years and years before the kindle was ever announced, reading them on my windows PDA phones and comptuers), there was potential here.But I kept going to the single use, non comptuer OS, limitations.But I also start to twitch when there's a new toy available.  So I started thinking about what I do with computers, both for work and at home, and realized that I didn't *NEED* a full windows 7 slate device with multitasking and everything, since I did not want a second "main" computer.  I keep EVERYTHING for both work and my entire personal life on my laptop, so getting the HP would then necessitate a lot of syncing of data between both the windows side of my macbook as well as the mac side.  Something I don't like dealing with.So I realized I didn't want a full computer.  I didn't need the ipad to replace anything, or take over any existing functionality of my computers.  I wanted it to take over my kindle, and maybe give me some fun drawing apps to play with my 6 year old in.  So I decided to give it a try.So two days ago I ran to the local brick and mortar, figuring they'd be sold out, but at least I could play with a demo unit and see what it was like, get myself past my preconceptions and all the BS flying on the blogosphere.  I picked one up, held it, and two store associates were playing with the one next to me.  I asked them how quickly they sold out - they told me they didn't, that Apple did a great job stocking them, and they had all versions still left.  I decided to not even play with the demo, but just take one home.  So I grabbed the 16GB version (knowing I didn't need it for an ipod and such, so 16GB would be sufficient) and went home.Unboxed quickly since there's nothing but the unit, USB cable, and power adapter.  Came fully charged, so I was up and running instantly.  Within about 15 minutes I had 70 free apps installed already and was moving through things like a pro.  And it dawned on me that even if i wanted that HP Windows 7 based slate, it would NEVER be this smooth.  That is one place where Apple just dominates - the UI.  And this one was great.  Everything worked intuitively, the apps were well designed, and I found my conversions of some of my ebooks to EPUB format installed just fine in Itunes, and showed up just beautifully in iBook.  So the reading experience became way better instantly than the kindle could be.  And with the kindle software available, I can already get the books I purchased there as well, so i had the best of both worlds.The drawing apps were a big hit for my 6 year old, who, like any kid, loves finger painting.Weather apps abound, my favorite so far is weatherbug (not a shock, theirs was my favorite gadget for Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well).  I've had storms here, heavy, severe, over the last few days, and my usual thing when dealing with storms at night, while I'm laying in bed reading my kindle, is to randomly get up, go into the great room, and check out the local weather satellites from a few local news stations, see what is still heading this way, how heavy, etc, maybe check mail again while I'm there, then go back and read some more, repeat a few times over an hour or two.  So this time, I just changed form iBook to Weatherbug, saw instantly the local radar, what was still on the way, then hopped into the browser, checked all my mail accounts (the built in Microsoft Exchange support is seamless and works great BTW), and enjoyed the browser, which works and looks just as well as my Safari does on the macbook pro.  So without having to leave my toasty bed, I was reading, checked three weather sites, three mail accounts, and was back reading, all flawlessly, no running around my house.The last part I tried finally last night was instant message, which for me is critical since all my employees use it to keep in touch with me, as do a couple friends.  With the push technology, all the "you can't do this and that at once" fell apart for me and was debunked.  I already had noted that my ipad, regardless of what I was doing or what app I had open, chimed i had a new mail on my works' exchange server before even my smart phone, or my computer directly connected to my exchange server.  And so went my experience with IM as well.  I loaded a client I've used in windows, then closed the IM program and opened iBook, and a buddy of mine sent me a message.  I got not just the notification, but a bubble with his text actually opened in front of ibook, and had a choice of switching over to reply or just close the text bubble and keep reading.  So that really rid me of all concerns about the lack of multitasking since that gives me exactly what I need - notification of an email or an IM while I'm doing something else.  This is all the computing power I needed on this.So I finally realized I didn't WANT another tablet PC, another full fledged computer.  I wanted something to fill a need between my phone's screen and my computer.  Something to replace my kindle, something for some neat games, playing and painting with my 6 year old, and simple/convenient IM and mail access when i'm just vegging at home and don't always want to pull my laptop on my lap to check something quick.The keyboard is actually far easier and better to use than I had expected, and much faster to type on than I hoped.  Not as nice, obviously, as a full screen one, but works surprisingly well.Screen is a delight - even hours of reading later it's still comfortable, bright, but it gets fingerprints easily despite some "non fingerprint coating" they tried to use to minimize it.  Still looks awful after a while at an angle when you look at it askew.  But not at all noticeable while staring at it straight and using it.Screen brightness is good, but it doesn't go down as far as I would've liked for ebook reading, but then I found iBook has a separate brightness control that lets me dim it to nearly nothing for use in the dark.  Outstanding.So then I started throwing some music and photos on it, and that's when I realized I can easily use this to show my grandmother pictures of her great grandson, since she's in her upper 80's and refuses to have a computer, so we can't email her or send her links or anything.  So I started playing with music and photos, and this thing became such a cool toy at that point.  I had to run back to the store and return it so I could buy the larger 32GB model since I knew by this time I was keeping it.  Fortunately I have a 45 day return period with no restocking fees at this place, so the upgrade was painless and free of cost.That's when I found out that itunes was automatically backing up my unit when it synced.  So when I plugged the new one in, the first thing it said was "restore?"  So i tried it.  It restored all my settings, including mail, so all I had to do was reenter passwords the first time, and I was back up and running after it resynced my apps again.  Those stayed in Itunes so I didn't have to redownload everything.Playing with pictures is pretty fun and very smooth, and the speaker on this thing is surprisingly full of bass.  There's even an equalizer for tweaking the sound output to your liking.  And the music keeps playing after you close the app so you can have the tunes playing while doing other things (but it will stop when you hit something else that takes over multimedia like a video or some other sound thing from an email of course).I grabbed the apple book-like cover and the dock, but you can't charge it in the dock while that cover is on.So I went from the initial "What a useless piece of junk" detractor to the "I wouldn't live without it" supporter.I gave them all sorts of grief for using the term "magical" to describe it, but I have to say, that it actually felt nearly magical that first hour doing things...  All my experience with the tablet PC and I wasn't ready to experience what this interface was like.And with this, i may finally be able to get my grandma to have something to keep at her condo so we can email her pictures and such...  This would make it a lot easier for her than trying to get her to use a full computer...So for a first revision, it's a grand slam out of the park hit.  Granted, it's just a big ipod touch or iphone or whatever, but for someone who never used either of those, and wanted something with a useful form factor, this is a BIG hit.
I got a WiFi, non-3G version, the cheapest one; I don't need GPS and don't want to pay AT&T; any more than I absolutely have to, and don't want another monthly subscription, either.  Got plenty of those, it seems.  And, at least for now, I don't need all that storage.I'm not what one would consider a "Power User" of the iPad.  I use a laptop constantly, and bought the iPad a couple of months ago because it is great looking and I was curious about it and I got a case of The Wants.  I've been involved with computers since the mid-60's when I first was employed as an IBM 360 (and 1401 before that) programmer, and I've continued messing with them pretty heavily ever since, though I changed careers in the early 70's.  Over the years, I've owned (in a small business) maybe 40 or 50 desktops and laptops, including several Apple IIe's way back when.  I've always liked Apple products, but not used them due to the overwhelming prominence of DOS and Windows products (both software and hardware) and the excellent pricing of IBM clones.But when the iPad came out, I couldn't help myself.  I now pick it up several times a day and use it.  I've taken it on trips without a laptop.  Here's what I think, mostly.Pros:1. It's cool.  No avoiding it, the little fella is great looking and has that Apple minimalist approach to design that they do so well.2. It's tiny.  Well, small, anyway.  That's good and maybe bad, but it does have its appeal.3. Screen resolution seems creamy, silky smooth.  Don't know how they did it, and don't really care.  It's good.4. I love Apple's approach to WiFi....  Walking into a new place, without even the slightest thought from  you, the iPad finds an open connection and asks if you want to connect to it.  If you say yes, you never hear from it again.  Done.  If the proper connection needs a WPA code or such, it simply asks for it.  No fuss.  (It seems like Windows, which I use for hours every day and have since it came out, has never really felt comfortable with wireless networking).5. No keyboard.  Well, face it, most of the time you don't use one, anyway.  Not having it is OK.  No mouse, either, for that matter.  Good.6. Scrolling is a dream.  Fabulous.  Effortless.  Scrolling, something that simple, is probably the single thing this little unit does best.  You have to try it to understand it.7. One of my apps (I don't have many) is a flight simulator similar to MS Flight Simulator.... X-Plane.  It allows pilots to practice instrument flying, so I got it.  VERY cool.  No joystick foolishness.  You must rotate the iPad itself like you would a yoke and the airplane turns or climbs or descends, or whatever.  Way easier than Windows products to do the same thing.8. Pilot friends who use other apps for charts and such love it, so I would guess that all graphics applications work pretty well on the little system, though I haven't tried.  Oh, yeah, Google Maps and Earth and such look great, too.  Apple always has done graphics well, so no real surprise.9. Ditto for video.10. Battery life is great.  Days on end at my level of usage.11. My Blackberry has a cute feature (maybe everyone has it, now):  When typing an email address or URL, when one presses the space bar, the OS converts it to a @ or a period, whichever is appropriate.  The iPad takes that to another level....  There is a ".com" key that enters that when pressed.  A small thing, but more helpful than one might think on a device where typing ain't as easy as using an IBM keyboard.Cons:1.  It's hard to hold and easy to drop.  Needs a shell or something to protect it; that makes it as big as a netbook or small laptop, anyway.2. Can't keep several "windows" open at the same time to switch back and forth.  Not a horrible issue, because you can get back to a previous window relatively easily, but sometimes you'd like to have both open at the same time or be able to switch with a single click.  If there's a way to do that I haven't found it.3. Hotmail and Gmail don't work like they do on a laptop.  Or on a Blackberry Storm2, for that matter.  I don't know the issue, but I can't seem to find a way to send a new email (though it's easy enough to reply).  I'm sure there is some app or setting to fix it, but I really don't want to be troubled with that.  I just want it to work.  Like the way WiFi does.  (Since I wrote this, I actually went into the email setup and set it up; it works, but I would prefer to use Hotmail and Gmail as pure web based apps rather than something more akin to a cell phone feature, which, of course, it is).4. You can't print from it. I've read that there is a wireless printing feature in the next OS.  Waiting to see.5. When working with it in your lap, either in a chair or a recliner or bed, a laptop is just more well suited for the job.  The iPad has to be held up, and, the screen is lower, so you are craning your neck more.  I don't use a stand to put it in.  Things like that and the case to put it in detract from the advantage of small size, so you might as well use a small laptop which will make you happier in the long run for this sort of thing.6. No keyboard.  And don't tell me they make a keyboard for it.  If I have to buy that, I might as well get a laptop.  Typing on the screen is a trip.  If you use the virtual keyboard holding the iPad in the "landscape" position the keyboard is large, and a little awkward to span the keys with your thumb.  So, you end  up turning the iPad up to the "portrait" position where the keyboard is better suited to thumb-typing.  I haven't tried typing in the traditional way ("touch typing")....  I just reach for the laptop.  I'm using my Lenovo to type this review.7. OK, here we go....  No Flash.  Now, I don't have a dog in this fight, but I don't understand this.  Every now and then (pretty often, actually) some video will come up and the iPad will tell me that it doesn't do Flash. (Happens frequently on sports and news sites). I never even knew what Flash was before this issue came up.  Well, Apple wants me to go to iTunes to download their app that will let you view Flash files.  OK, y'all, why didn't you just put it in the iPad from the get-go?  I just want it to work.  Yesterday, I wanted to watch a video of a Tropical Storm in the Caribbean, so I clicked on the link to go get Apple's app.  Then I had to cycle through a few pages on iTunes.  Heck with it.  I just used the laptop (which has a larger screen, anyway).  There's a saying: "People don't want quarter inch drills, they want quarter inch holes. "So, what's the upshot?I like it.  I'd buy it again.  No, I wouldn't wait for the Android competitors to come out.  Well, I am curious about those and might get one of them, too, just to check it out.  But, the WiFi-only iPad is a nice, polite little computer.I do want to say this, and it's one of those potentially inflammatory things, but I don't mean it like that....  It's more of a toy than a tool.  If I am really in need getting things done....  Spreadsheets, presentations, documents, etc, it's really hard to beat the tried and true Windows laptops that are available everywhere and are dirt cheap and fit in with the way things are done and the formats that are used throughout the business community.So, sure I use it.  This morning (a Sunday) I've been using it....  looking at airplanes for sale (daydreaming) and checking out a few football forums and generally surfing the web.  So, if this review seems a bit too negative, that's not really intended.  I like it.That said, a would-be buyer needs to understand what it is that he is getting, and what that is, is something of a media machine that requires you conform to Apple's way of doing things, a very good little web surfboard and a pretty neat little toy.
I've had an iPad since the first day they were available. It's taken it's place in the household as the preferred way to browse the web, watch bedtime videos with the kids, and play games. Just yesterday, my four year old son sat around the device with his friend playing Plants vs. Zombies HD and it was as easy, natural and comfortable as if they were playing tic tac toe instead of an elaborate tower defense game. It would not have been possible for two four year olds to share a game like that with the mechanics of mousing in the way on a desktop computer or on the cramped screen of an iPhone.[Update: iPad Camera Connection Kit: I received my iPad Camera Connection Kit recently and that works well, quickly and slickly. It comes as two parts: an SD reader module and a USB port module. The idea being that you can either take the SD card out of your camera or you can connect the camera directly depending on the module. Pop it together and photos and movies are imported into the Camera Roll, and are viewable if the iPad can handle the format, so JPEG images off the SD card from my Lumix can be displayed, as can RAW images imported over USB from my Nikon D-3000. All RAW formats are not viewable, but they should be transferable. I was not able to use a 3rd party SD reader with the USB port as it "used too much power." The USB connector also allows a 3rd party audio device, so you can get digital optical stereo (not surround) out of your iPad instead of the normal dock connectors analog line out. Mass storage devices are apparently not supported.]In my opinion, the iPad delivers an unmatched content delivery capability. The browsing experience alone is worth the price of admission, but it does so many other activities so well and with such beauty and an organic interaction between user and content that just scratches the surface of what can be done.This is not a general purpose computer. I am not going to write much source code on it or transcode video or those other activities my laptop and desktop computers do so well. And while text entry is markedly better than on an iPhone, I would not look forward to writing anything longer than this review on its keyboard, although with each sentence of experience I achieve that gets less true. No, what this is is a viewing computer without peer.You have not browsed the web until you do it with the firm swipes of mobile Safari. I know people have fixated on the lack of Flash and Flash advertising, games and video. And maybe for some people that is a big loss. For me, the only loss is the occasional home improvement show on Hulu, and it seems likely there will be an app for that just as there are ones for Netflix, ABC, Youtube, etc, while sites like CBS put some, but not all,  content into DRM free HTML 5 video. What you lose in Flash you more then make up for in the amazing speed of browsing and how natural it all seems.  (Having said this, the first time I asked my wife to try answering her e-mail on the device, the first message was to a Flash greeting card.)The speed of the device is amazing for a low power portable device. Maybe it's the Apple custom A4 processor, or maybe it's the limitation of having so few processes, or the optimization of the OS for GPU acceleration, but the iPad is liquid fast at nearly everything.Video playback is fast. Photo browsing is fast. Mail is fast. The calendar is fast. Large games like Plants Versus Zombies HD launch in a fraction of the time they do on an iPhone. You get the idea.Third party developers have stepped up to the plate and delivered both beauty and added functionality. The Kindle app is smooth and imported all my Kindle account books quickly--it's good that there will be competition in the iPad eBook market between Apple's own iBooks store and Amazon't Kindle. The Weather HD app is stunning as it embroiders the mundane delivery of a weather report. Wolfram Alpha is big and well laid out and more powerful than ever.As for the hardware, I am really liking this screen. It is bright, colorful and sharp with an amazing viewing angle. It does get a little smudged which is noticeable when watching movies but its oleo-phobic screen cleans with a quick wipe.. Its wide viewing angle is a great improvement on my MacBook's screen which would be unreadably dark at the angle I'm typing this. Some people think the iPad is surprisingly heavy, while someone else was surprised how light it was (the same person also expressed remorse at having bought a Nook after about 8 seconds of playing with my iPad).Be careful with charging this. It likely won't work with your current iPhone  car charger. My wife's car charger started to burn trying to handle the extra amperage this device demands. Best to only use this with either your computer's USB ports or the charger it came with. And charging time is slow via a computer, from full empty it takes 7 minutes until reboot, and around 40 minutes per 10% charge (so you are looking at over 6 hours for a full charge from fully drained). The wall adapter is about twice as fast. Regardless, be prepared to make over night charging part of your daily routine, although you will get several days of moderate use between charges given the amazing 10+ hours of activity you get from a full charge. A decade of laptop use has not prepared me for how long you can use this to do everything. It seemingly doesn't matter what you are doing, you still get 10 hours. Or more.It goes without saying that you do not want to charge this device from your laptop's battery like you might do to your iPhone on a lengthy plane trip.As for the decision to buy the 64 GB model, I think it comes down to perceived usage. I plan to fill it with quality feature length movies for when my wife travels to China. At about 1.5GB per movie (720x480 h.264)--or more if you have 720p content--16GB seemed a little tight while still loading multiple gigabytes of photos and music. 32 GB would probably be sufficient, and it's going to seem insane in a couple years spending so much for 32 GB of flash memory.If you get a chance to play with one, try to find a comfy chair where you can put your feet up and make a platform for the device. This will negate the problem of holding its heft and allow you to build up your full speed typing skills. Realize there are all sorts of tricks you will learn and that after an hour you will be a master. Lock the iPad into landscape mode using the hardware toggle switch. I find I never have a need to use portrait mode unless a piece of software makes use of a separate portrait mode. Explore. There are so many little delightful touches to discover like the lock screen photo frame mode, the dictionary in the book reader, tapping on the status bar to go to the top of a web page, etc.This is a moving target. Every time Apple releases a new version of the OS or a 3rd party developer gets a bright idea, the device will get better. For instance, Apple has announced iPhone OS 4 which addresses many major complaints people have and adds features we didn't know we needed. This fall, you will be able to keep Pandora and Skype running the background while you are playing a game or browsing the web or whatever; this will make these apps vastly more useable. You will be able to organize your apps in folders. Better organize your e-mail. And look forward to smaller developers coming out with more social network games.If I were to point out one misfeature it is how badly the 2x mode for legacy iPhone apps looks. It just seems as though Apple could have put more effort in making non-bitmap GUI elements look sharp instead of just stretching all the pixels. You would think they could at least have made text and the built in keyboard look better.I don't like the Apple branded optional case, so I would try before buying the case. It just gets in the way making it hard to access the external controls, and should only be necessary in a scratch prone environment. I am thinking about going with a Gelaskin protective skin instead.In summary, I am a big fan of this device for a wide variety of activities be it web browsing, game playing, enjoying media, reading email (less so composing email), and reading books. I highly recommend picking one up if you have the means, although I would wait a few weeks until they are back in stock at the normal retail prices or even until the 3G version comes out.
From the first announcement of this device, I was prepared to dislike the iPad, on paper it has way too many flaws. With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone.Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate.Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device.Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view.Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size.Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected.The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right.I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device.I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen.Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading.Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books.But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach).And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons.
The PAD fills that nebulious space between a notebook and a smartphone.  Smartphones offer the ultimate in portability plus a camera and the ability to place calls.  Notebooks offer a reasonable amount of computing power plus an expectation of portability especially in the 13 to 15" screen size areas.However, smart phones are very difficult to use because the screens ARE so small. Web browsing , reading and responding to email are a chore. Notebooks provide all the functionality of desktops except expandability and usually video cards required by high end games are lacking.  But even though they are transportable, for many simple functions that such as email and web browsing, they can be cumbersome to set up and take down.  Any larger screen size than 15" and its unlikely it will leave home.  The cost of laptops has fallen considerably over the years and from being primarily a business tool, laptop owners use the machine as their primary computer for personal use.  The laptop is unobtrusive, can be moved from room to room especially if wireless internet is available, and does not have the dearth of cords and junk that seems to easily collect around an embedded laptop.  Still, in spite of its portability, many people would just rather leave the laptop behind if their travels do not require work specific needs.Sensing a need for an email machine, web browser and the ability to run regular programs should the need arise, the computer industry introduced the low cost NETBOOK. There was certainly some interest in these machines as they allowed a very convenient way of checking email and web browsing while traveling around town without the bulk of a laptop.  A NETBOOK could literally be folded up and placed in a purse or cargo pants pocket.However, consumers soon noticed limitations and annoyances about the NETBOOKS.  Durability was in question.  Cheap production meant a cheap product which easily broke down.  Installs of software had to be downloaded or an external drive hooked up to it. The screen was small and especially for older eyes, hard to read and make out was was being viewed.NETBOOKS were still computers and required all the maintenance of one: anti-virus had to be installed / updated or else it was susceptible for infections by any type of badware.  Startup programs had to be monitored to insure "too much junk" was not loading or its already slow boot times would be further impeded.  Many programs ran sluggishly, creaking along primarily on ATOM processors.  The Windows 7 Starter edition was a crippled version of Windows 7, lacking functions and the ability to run certain  programs which ran under "normal" Windows 7, diminishing some of its expected capability.Though the NETBOOK could be taken anywhere, its optimistic battery times were usually half its advertised rate under real world operations and begged still for the presence of a desk or other table like furniture to set up upon for proper control and use of the cursor.And then Apple announces the iPAD, a tablet style computer.  Tablets existed before and many of them were just morphed Windows machines into the tablet form factor with styluses that often found their way into toilets, sewer grates, and dog maws.  And a Windows tablet is typically priced 20 to 30% higher than a corresponding laptop.  It seemed a little overkill to check email and web-surf.Few guessed how well the iPAD might sell. SuperGeeks decried the lack of a true USB port, camera and the fact DOSBoX could not be installed nor a game controller, let alone a boot configuration into Linux.  They foresaw little use for such a device and predicted its utter failure.  But since its release a little less than a million a month have been selling.  Granted the Flash, Python, MySql, sed, XCode, and Linux demographic were entirely ignored; but the habitual e-mailers and Websurfing crowd was not.  And especially at these two tasks, the device excelled. Add in some other useful tasks such as e-reading, to include comic books (previously a chore on a PC or even Mac with incessant mouse / key scrolling / zooming and clicking), and some games with various other programs and the iPAD became an overnight sensation.At once other companies began to announce various tablets of their own.  Microsoft and HP each announced products based on Windows 7, but bailed when it became apparent their technology and Windows could not deliver what they originally envisioned.  Other companies instead decide to work with the Android OS, already in use on phones and scale-up to tablet seemed much more promising.This is all fine and good, a summary of this slice of industry from my viewpoint--so HOW does the PAD benefit me?1.=The iPAD is available NOW (though not on Amazon at a reasonable price YET).  Announced products that are canceled or have uncertain release dates are of little use.2. = The iPAD is unbelievably portable and unlike a smartphone, the screen quite readable.3.= I have not read a comic book in years.  This allows a small collection available at all times.4.= The entire works of Shakespeare are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.5.= Scads of translations of the Bible are available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. And the type can be ENLARGED.6.= The Quran available FREE in a 1.6 lbs form factor. Jewish friends may be upset  because they don't see the Torah's Icon, but remind them the 16 translations of the the Bible's first five books is the Torah. And FREE. Also the type can be enlarged.7.= If  WiFi is there, the WEB is there.8. = EMAIL is very easily accessed, ALL ACCOUNTS.  If one has multiple accounts, the iPADs interface makes it easy to monitor them without going around to various websites to log in and out of them9.= Drawing / sketch apps allow direct sketching on the screen.  Previous technology required cabled Wacom tablets or a Wacomized computer with propitiatory stylus.10. = Artists often make use of reference material to better paint or draw an accurate representation of an object.  Researching on a computer usually requires the expected Google search (or library visit in the olden days).  Once an image was found, it had to be added to a paint program, resized and printed out then taken over to the work area. The iPAD  allows one to go to Safari, pull up an image, save it, then go into the photo album and resize it for easy display viewing while it is being painted or drawn paint it.  Other pictures of various subjects can be switched over to easily.  The iPAD's size and the fact it has no spill vulnerable keyboard, makes for an easy unobtrusive. insertion next to an artists work area.I give the product 5 stars less one for, well I'm REALLY trying to knock it down one star, OK maybe for the lack of a USB port for printing to my non wireless printer, and perhaps some nuanced things like the included NOTES text program--no re-sizable fonts, or that I cannot delete spam without opening the email first.  But it is really hard to deduct that star.
After receiving an unexpected bonus from my employer I decided to use it to pick up an iPad.  I went with the 16 gig wifi only model as I didn't want to shell a lot out of pocket and the bonus barely covered the cost.  While I like the device from a "coolness" perspective, I have found that over the past month of use that the lack of flash support makes the device nearly useless for effective web surfing.  I would estimate that nearly 80 to 90 percent of run of the mill sites use some form of flash that makes them crippled on the iPad.  Try going to any of the national chain restaurant websites, (fFriday's, Chilis, Applebees, Buffalo Wild Wings) and it's likely that you'll end up not being able to view much if anything.  Many sports news sites or general new sites have huge holes in their pages where flash is supposed to be running.  Even with all the other nice bells and whistles, and the hundreds of thousands of apps available, this one drawback makes it tough for me to recommend the iPad to someone who expects a full web browsing experience from a portable tablet based device.  As for use as a laptop replacement for business purposes, the options in the app store for MS Office compatible software for editing word, excel and PowerPoint docs are quote broad, but not a single one let's you edit in any form that is close to the full blown desktop software, especially PowerPoint which I use extensively.  Logmein Ignition picks up the slack however in giving me access to my work laptop when I am away, albeit it's tough sometimes positioning the mouse on the laptop's screen accurately.  It will allow me though to leave my laptop at home on short business trips as long as I have wifi where I am.  I am going to add on a MiFi hotspur from one of the major carriers to allow me access anywhere rather than having gotten the 3G version, which allows me to pick the vendor of choice and upgrade to 4g or whatever newer technology comes out.  The lack of cameras is glaring considering all android based devices are seemingly coming out with them in their first gen offerings.  My hope is that e next gen iPads have dual cameras to support FaceTime and other video chatting software.  I also hope they work something out with adobe so that flash support comes to the iPad.  Without it, I am definitely leaning towards an android based device as an "upgrade" from the iPad because viewing the web is to me what these devices are supposed to do well and the iPad falls way short of acceptable.
When the iPad 3G became available it seemed to be an ideal solution for us to use when traveling away from our home in northern New Mexico.  We knew that ATT 3G service was not available in our immediate area, but that was not important because we planned to use the iPad either with the WIFI in our home and or when we were traveling to a place with 3G. Because we could get a data plan on a monthly basis without a long-term commitment it seemed workable.Unfortunately, when we tried to sign up for ATT service before a trip to CA, we found a glitch in both the ATT and Apple plan.  iPad software will not allow users in an area without 3G to sign up, as determined by the billing ZIP code.When we called ATT and asked how to get around this problem, we were told that the only way was to apply for a credit card with a ZIP code in an area with service.  When I suggested that was a nutty suggestion, the ATT representative told me that the problem was really Apple's and gave me their contact number.Apple, of course, immediately told me that I should contact ATT as this was their problem.  When the Apple representative learned that ATT had no reasonable solution, Apple admitted that I was out of luck for using the iPad in the way we wanted.  It is impossible to believe that neither Apple nor ATT had encountered this problem, but ATT service really seems unavailable.As a result, iPad 3G buyers in areas without 3G coverage in their billing ZIP code end up with a larger, and much more expensive, but fancy version of an iPod.
The IPad constantly drops my WiFi connection, both at home at at work, that works just fine with three Windows 7 laptops and one Macbook. It happens every 5-10 minutes. It keeps asking for the password, often 3-4 times in a rom. My Iphone has the problem sometimes (once a week or so).Its basically unusable at this point. An internet search revealed that many users have the same issue.
Horrible wifi brought 16gb non-3g and 32g with 3g and both have horrible wifi. I know that apple has a history of not working well with non apple wifi routers, but this is ridiculous. It prompts me every other hour for a wifi password. If you experience the same problem the quickest work-around is to NOT re-enter your password, but to cancel and then go to settings and switch the wifi off and then back on. I would not recommend purchasing the ipad until they put out a service pack to fix this issue. I am beginning to sound like I am taking about microsoft.Had to reduce to 1 star. The wifi is bad same thing happening to friends. Obvious software problem when ipad repeatedly prompts for wifi password when it already has the password stored in settings.
Steve Jobs described the iPad as a magical and revolutionary device at the Apple press event that launched the product. So, as an owner of the device, would I also consider it "magical" and "revolutionary"?Well, I don't know about magical as I generally reserve that for unicorns and the like. I've logged several hours on the device since launch day to give you a well-rounded account of the great, the not so great, and hopefully help you know if the iPad is right for you!--Overview:I really love my iPad. Like many, my first impression was that it was just a giant iPod Touch. I've come to realize that's not the case. In fact, it's so much more useful than an iPod Touch, I just chuckle these days when people say this. For me, the applications, utilization of the extra space, and the web capabilities that really won me over. There are a few features I'm really hoping are forthcoming in a future software build that would make the device even more useful. On the whole, the iPad has become an extremely useful device that's got my laptop feeling a bit unloved and jealous these days.--Hardware:There's no denying the iPad is gorgeous. Apple has re-envisioned the beautiful look of the iPod Touch/iPhone in a fuller form. The screen is flawless and (as I unfortunately learned) very resistant to scratching. If you intend to use the device outdoors you'll want to know that the high-gloss on the screen makes it very difficult to see in direct sunlight at times. The speaker and mic are great in this device. The speaker will fill an entire room with sound. Unfortunately, Apple (yet again) put a focus on design over ergonomic. The iPad is a bit hefty, and a bit difficult to hold for long periods of time. It is; however, much sturdier than you might expect from the pictures.The processor works extremely well with the iPhone OS, it's a screaming combination that makes this one of the fastest tablet computers I've used in ages. That being said, much of the software is designed for the less powerful iPhone still. We'll see how the iPad's speed stands up to a new wave of software designed for 1GHz mobile processors soon enough. Initially; however, it's been unimaginably quick.Battery life is amazing. I'm getting at least 8 hours (even watching video) and sometimes more. I also opted for the 64GB version of the iPad. It has plenty of storage for what I've been using the device for, but as my video collection becomes progressively more High Definition, it won't be long before I have to start picking and choosing what I can place on my iPad. This is not something I'm happy about in a device costing $699 + Tax that's so clearly designed for HD video and content. I'm also very disappointed in Apple's decision to not include an SD card reader for the device. This is one area where the HP slate still has a compelling advantage. There are many instances in which, popping in an SD card and being able to access the documents, images, music, and video stored on it would be extremely nice. Apple has planned an accessory for the iPad which will allow you to port your photos to it via an SD card adapter, but that's the extent of its functionality with SD cards. That's a definite delta for me.I have the Wi-Fi edition as the 3G version has not been released yet. I've run into a few instances where it would have been extremely nice to have 3G connectivity. If I had to make the choice over again, I think I would question my decision that everywhere I go has Wi-Fi anyway, and probably wait for the 3G edition. I'd really encourage you to hold out if you think there's any way in which you'd use the iPad regularly outside of Wi-Fi coverage.Just a quick note, I've had none of the issues that other users have reported with wireless connectivity. My iPad has been drama-free thus far. I'll update this review as I encounter issues to keep you aware.--Web Browsing & EmailTwo of the iPad's strongest features are web browsing and email. Safari (the iPhone OS' native browser) is very fast. It's a significantly better browsing experience on the iPad than you'll have on the iPhone. I've found that I really don't use apps for sites like Facebook anymore. The iPad's screen makes it much easier to just visit the actual Facebook site.Even on the iPhone, email has never been so quick and simple. Apple really devised a great approach to email. A quick tap calls up a pain showing you all the emails in your inbox with a brief preview. You can organize, clear, or open email in ways that seem decades ahead of what MS Outlook is capable of. Setting up my Corporate Exchange account on the iPad took less than 60 seconds! It's hard to express what makes email so much better on the iPad than the iPhone/iPod Touch, but you'll know it when you see it.--The ApplicationsThe applications really sold me on the iPad. I can't say enough about the iWork suite (sold separately via the App Store)! This software suite puts a desktop-grade word processing application and presentation software on your iPad. The "Numbers" spreadsheet application isn't exactly as smooth, but is still the best spreadsheet app available on a mobile platform. There are just so many great applications already available for the iPad that I can't list them all. My favorites so far are iWork Suite, Sketchbook Pro, Kindle for iPad, ABC Player, and Marvel Comics App. The extra screen real estate makes this device unquestionably better for media. Even the iPod application within the iPad is much smoother than on other iPhone OS devices. The iPad will also run your iPhone applications, and can double their size to help them fill more of the gigantic screen. Honestly, the iPhone applications aren't much of a selling point on this device. They look grainy and ridiculous on the iPad's screen.--iBook Store/ReaderThe iPad does several things well. One it doesn't do well would be eBooks. The backlit screen is tough on the eyes and the resolution leaves the characters fuzzy. As a Kindle owner, I can honestly say that the iPad is not a replacement for that device. This is pretty much universally true of the eReader applications available for the iPhone/iPad. It may be personal preference but I really don't enjoy more than brief periods of reading on backlit screens. There's a reason 700 page novels aren't backlit = ).--I really wish it had...I really wish Apple would reconsider their stance on Adobe Flash. The absence of the key internet video technology makes the internet a little hit or miss. You'll still have a great YouTube option via the iPad's YouTube app, but little embedded videos on places like the NYT, MSNBC, or other sites are just not there at this point. Let's hope that Adobe and Apple either make up soon or HTML5 catches on extremely fast! Until then, the HP Slate may be a better option for users who really take advantage of web video other than YouTube.A camera would also be really nice, especially a front-facing camera for video conferencing. In a dock the iPad seems almost born to video conference! I doubt I'd be taking many pictures with my iPad if it included just a standard back-mounted camera, but it might help developers do more in their applications.--The Accessories:The iPad uses the same (30-pin) style connector as the iPhone/iPod so it already has a wealth of compatible accessories on the market. If you own an iPhone/iPod, it may even be compatible with devices you already own. Here's the rule of thumb: If you have to dock the iPhone/iPod Touch... the iPad won't be compatible, if you can connect it via a cable, it'll work. This is mostly due to the considerable size of the iPad. Obviously, it's not going to fit in that smaller indentation that most iPhone/iPod docks utilize.I really recommend a case, and dock for this beast. I've owned my iPhone for 3 years and never owned a case for it (until a few weeks ago). I got away with that just fine. The larger screen of the iPad makes it a different sort of device; however, and I wouldn't even think of running around without a case on this thing. It's actually a bit disappointing that Apple didn't include one. I'm sort of glad they didn't; however, because I purchased the iPad case designed by Apple and was extremely disappointed. It's of a very weak felt lined cardboard from what I can tell. Its material holds oil and lint making the screen worse when you close the case. It also has such a tight grip on the device that putting the iPad in or taking it out of the case makes you feel like you might damage it.The iPad really needs a dock! You wouldn't really anticipate it, but having this giant on your counter can really occupy much of your kitchen or desk space. I'd recommend a dock as they generally hold the device upright maximizing the space around it. Apple makes a really great dock for the device that includes an audio-out port. Just note, that the case designed by Apple isn't compatible with the dock. Go figure.If you intend to carry a lot of video on the device, you may also want to invest in a video-out cable. The solutions available for the iPhone/iPod Touch will work for the iPad, or you can opt for the Apple video out cables (they actually aren't too horrible price-wise).--A note about iPhone OS 4:Apple announced the newest edition of the iPhone operating system (which the iPad runs on) last week. Some really great features are on their way that will benefit the iPad a great deal! Amongst the best of them- multi-tasking (run multiple applications or processes at once), geotagging, improvements to gaming on the device, and more! Read up on the new OS! It should be available for the iPad later this year.Thanks for reading my review! I hope it helped. If you do decide to purchase an iPad, have fun. It's a great device, and don't forget to try out the Sketchbook Pro, and iWork apps. I really love them on mine!
OK, I've had my iPad for almost a month.  I continue to suffer repeated WiFi problems.  It's not my router, it works fine with my iMac and my iPod.  It's time for Apple to admit there is a problem and get a software fix for this thing.  It becomes useless to you since you won't be able to maintain a connection with the internet.WAIT TO BUY THIS UNTIL APPLE ADMITS AND FIXES THE PROBLEM!!!Other than that, it is very nice, but it really needs to work.
I was very disappointed when I finally got my hands on this ipod touch with a big screen, a "magical device". Simply put there is nothing magical about it. I have been using a windows-based tablet since 2003, and it has more advanced technology and capability than apple's 2010 Ipad. The biggest paradox is that despite people calling this the apple ipad tablet, it's not a tablet at all, you can't take hand-written notes on it. The one thing that would have been able to define a new category of device would have simply been that. Furthermore there is:no camera,no usb ports,no easy way to organize a file system and transfer/copy,no easy way to print your files, no interaction with office productivity software (Office),the on-screen keyboard is not practical,the screen resolution is 4:3 so you see movies with huge black bars,there is no HDMI out so you can't connect it to your new LCD,no card readers for your photos,no flash support for websites (rendering 50% of the web useless),there are wifi issues (connections dropped),the screen is glossy so you can't read on it outdoors,no multitasking supportridiculously low storage space (even netbooks have over 200gb now)it's very fragile and slippery in your hands (one drop could kill the screen)it will set you back $600 (the price of a full-featured laptop)I could go on for a while but I'll just stop here. What is frustrating is that Apple obviously has the technology to include these things easily, so it was purely a short-term business decision on their end. For the moment, they are blatantly exploiting certain consumers' willingness-to-pay for the ipad. They are taking advantage of their brand recognition and marketing power to extract revenues from a purposely made sub-par product. The only way to stop this type of behavior is to either stop buying bad products (sounds easy but people aren't always rational), or wait until competition kicks in over the next six months. I hope this business plan doesn't come back to bite them in the end, in my opinion they are definitely playing with fire on this one.On the plus side because of these omissions, it's simple (a grandma could use it), it's fast (but this is because it doesn't run a real operating system) it has ok battery (9 hours) and it's thin (although not light, you will get tired of holding it after 5 minutes).In one sentence: You're paying $600-1000 for a semi-portable web-browser which gives you access to about 30% of the web.Hope that helps you make up your own mind, I returned mine after 48 hours.
Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configurationThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDKCons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes
I jumped on the iPad craze and purchased a 32GB on launch date- I was excited about this device as a way to read books online and to surf the net.  It is a nice looking device and it is very fast.  Unfortunately, I experienced constant dropped WiFi connectivity as I moved throughout the house.  I do not have this problem with other wireless devices and the signal is always strong/excellent.  When the iPad was sitting right next to the router, the internet was much improved but obviously I did not buy a mobile device to be tethered to a stationary router.  I tried all the tricks suggested (rebooting settings, etc) and nothing seemed to help in my situation.  I have a Verizon Actiontec router in the house.Apparently this is not a new issue for Apple wireless devices if you look at the Apple support discussion boards. The iPod also has these issues. Apparently many others are having similar problems with WiFi and iPad.  You would think Apple would work out the bugs before releasing the iPad.I am going to wait a few generations for Apple to get the bugs out.  This is too much money to spend on this kind of "toy" and then to struggle with the internet connection.  I cannot recommend the iPad based on my 5 day experience with it.  This was my very first Apple purchase- too bad Apple wasted this opportunity to lure this PC user to the Apple brand.
I've had my iPad since sometime in June. When I first bought it, I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it, and for the first month or so it languished, just a huge version of my beloved iPod Touch. Too heavy to use as an e-reader. I love the keyboard but not for writing long or multiple emails. And then slowly over time I started to find uses for it, until at this point I would miss it very  much if I didn't have it. It's a tedious process to find the apps that you want and will use, but it's worth taking the time to search. Everything looks so good on this thing! I keep it by my bedside and use it as a quick reference device after the primary computer has been put to sleep in the living room. I have a super weather app. I am not a big game player but I found several that are fun and the iPad makes them very portable. I put episodes of TV shows that I like on it and watch when I am camping and it's raining outside (again, HD is gorgeous on it). I have a musical app that's interesting (Beatwave), and two drawing apps (Uzu and LineArt). I have a bird ID app in it and one that plays bird songs for identification. I know that there are those who use it for business; if that's your plan, this review is not for you. This is for the other people out there who like gadgets and geeky things like this but who have no real need for it. If you want it, get it--if you buy it, the need will come. It's really fun.
I've had the iPad for about a month now, so I've had some time to play around with it.First off - the device is NICE looking. Much like a giant iPhone/iPod Touch, and in fact, if the iPod Touch had 3G and was 4x the size, I don't think you could tell the difference.The device shares the same OS (or a slight variation of it) and most of the iPhone/iPod Touches built in apps (although some are slightly modified such as Mail and Contacts to better fit the large screen).A great touch is that it runs MOST of the iPhone apps. Most? not all?? No -- some apps (I've figured out the hard way) are designed for iPhone only and will simply NOT WORK on the iPad. Be sure to check apps ahead of time to avoid disappointment! Emulation is decent, giving the option of either "boxing" around a 100% sized screen or "2x doubling" which fills the iPad screen. You either get the best quality at a lower size, or a full screen at a lower quality - a poor tradeoff (also, running iPhone apps at 4x their intended size looks very odd in some cases -- skype turns the iPad into a 10" phone display that looks like one of those joke remote controls they sell with the 4" buttons). iPad apps make much better used of the available space, but so far those apps are behind the iPhone counterparts that have been in development for years (and usually cost a bit more!).One big disappointment of running iPhone apps on the iPad are that they don't run the same! Photo editing apps, for example, save all photos at 640x480 on the iPad (but full resolution even on the original iPhone 2G). To edit photos and keep them at full resolution you need to use iPad specific apps (which again are not up to the point of iPhone apps).Much like the iPhone, almost everything needs to be done through iTunes (transferring movies and music, updating, syncing), so those of you who hate the program will need to just suck it  up for this one (even on my newer quad-core PC iTunes is a big resource hog, so I understand the pain!).The 3 sizes available (16GB, 32GB and 64GB) are before formatting - you get about 59GB usable on the 64GB model (which is expected if you've ever purchased a hard drive). Unfortunately there isn't any other storage option available, so if you buy 16GB and need more you'll need to delete stuff to free space.Overall speed of the product is very nice - I only have the original iPhone (2G) and with all of the updates over the last couple years it's really slowed it down. The iPad is blazing fast now, but I wonder how long it'll be before OS updates slow it down and you need the the 2nd generation iPad to get that speed back. Also, a big problem with the iPod Touch are that updates cost between $5-10. Will the same hold true for the iPad?The device is great for movies.. sometimes. It's closer to a 4:3 (fullscreen) aspect ratio than the iPhone (widescreen) so widescreen movies WILL display black bars (and those 2.40:1 movies like the Matrix will be mostly black bars). Movies will also quickly fill the iPad (coming in around 1.5 - 2.5GB a piece).Sound is a bit better than the iPhone, but still in a very poor position (one speaker, located at the bottom right of the iPad) - You'll want headphones for this thing.Wifi is nice, but what about away from the house? the option to even get 3G is another $129. On top of that you need to purchase a monthly plan (fortunately no contract!). Unfortunately, just a month or so after release, ATT has killed the option for Unlimited 3G and replaced it with a 2GB cap (you also have a 250MB plan available for a few bucks less). People who purchase the iPad by 6/7/2010 will be able to purchase the Unlimited plan but will only have the 250MB/2GB plan available if they cancel the unlimited plan and want to sign up again).A big disappointment are the included accessories. You'd expect something to come with it for the outrageous price it costs, right? No case, no dock, no headphones. Just a USB cable and wall adapter. Expect to cough up way more than necessary for a dock, headphones, case, etc.. I went with the A-frame for Ipad and Belkin F8N277tt Pleated Sleeve for iPad - Black , both very nice accessories.A great thing about it is being able to use the web without a computer. No more booting up the PC or bringing the laptop out of standby. The iPad is 'always on' and just takes a click to use it. That's the big selling point for me. The downside is that you lose all other functionality of a PC and have to resort to using available apps (more $$).A bit selling point for me was the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit - being able to plug my DSLR into it, download photos, edit them using iPad apps and then upload them to flickr from anywhere! Problem is, the kit is more $$ (why not just add a USB slot to the thing?), the memory card adapter is SD only (not the popular Compact Flash found in DSLRs, so those people (myself) will need to plug a USB cable from the camera to the iPad camera kit to the iPad to download photos). More stuff to carry around!There are some very cool apps on it - I love being able to hold movies on a larger device than an iPhone. I love being able to put all my photos on there. I love being able to browse the web from anywhere. For that, I give it 4 stars.A couple last disappointments - the things a bit heavy (1.5LBs) and hard to angle anywhere. Trying to watch a movie and hold it isn't fun, and the stands aren't perfect (or usable in all situations). It's also big -- a little too big! Unlike an iPhone which can always be in your pocket, this thing needs its own bag that you have to bring with you.It's much like cameras -- a Point & shoot gets the job done and can go with you everywhere. A DSLR does a much better job, but being so bulky you can't take it with you all the time.
Bottom-Line: So far the "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi" has more than lived up to my expectations and I have no regrets concerning my decision to buy one.The "Apple iPad."  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  For me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the "Apple iPad" does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?I was enamored with the "Apple iPad" the moment is was announced because I saw the potential in the portable e-book reader that not only offered more memory than any other device on the market, but also offered up a full color widescreen display, Wi-Fi or 3G wireless, access to hundreds of applications, a web browser, music player, GPS address book, calendar, e-mail reader.I know, I know, it lacks support for Adobe Flash as a fellow iPad elitists recently pointed out, but I don't miss it.  There has only been one instance where I could not play a video on my "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi;" that to me does not constitute a crisis, nor does it diminish the considerable functionality the device brings to the hand.  And, I know, I know, the device does not multi-task, but the "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi" is not a computer it is an e-book reader that also does other functions.  I have a laptop and desktop if I want to multi-task.The iPad 64GB Wi-Fi FactsThe Ultra-Portable, 1.5lbs (1.6lbs if 3G is installed) "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi" is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5" thick "iPad" you'll find the screen lock and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The silver-bodied "iPad" can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A4 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR is also provided.The 9.7-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The "Ipad" is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.First ImpressionsI really, really, really, like my new Apple "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi." Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public like I did today!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.iBooks the e-book reader that is specially designed to work with the "iPad" is not preloaded unto the device, I had to download it from the iTunes Store; not a big deal.  Once downloaded e-books can be download either directly (through iBooks) or via iTunes.When I connect the "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi" to my computer and launch iTunes, it automatically sync's the two transferring any e-books I may have bought into iTunes.  Conversely, any e-books I purchase via iTunes are synced with the "iPad" automatically.Hands down, the Apple "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi" is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (699.00 for the Wi-Fi 64GB; hey its $100.00 more to add 3G), but I think it is well worth the cost.  I wanted 64GB in order to have room to download app, music, e-books, and images without concern about running out of space.  This is especially true since you cannot add memory to the "iPad."So far the "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi" has more than lived up to my expectations and I have no regrets concerning my decision to buy one.  Who needs flash, my NPR videos play just fine thank you!
This is an amazingly addictive device. However, it neither brings the same level of unprecedented convenience to end-users as the iPhone, nor does it feel like a credible replacement for the traditional laptop. And yes, it is over-priced.PLUSES+ Display is bright and sharp. A joy to behold.+ Compared with a traditional laptop, it is and feels quite lightweight, and therefore convenient to carry.+ Flash memory means that it wakes up in a matter of seconds. Laptops take longer to wake up from their "sleep" mode, and a lot, lot longer from a cold boot.+ Safari mobile browser is almost as capable as your typical desktop browser - IE, Firefox...+ There is an app for almost everything you need, want, wish for, think about, don't care about, and wished you didn't know.+ Video playback (have not tried full HD so far) is smooth and without any jerkiness.+ Audio quality is very good, even without the headphones.+ Managing your wi-fi networks and VPN configurations is very straightforward.+ Downloading and installing apps from iTunes is simple. Nothing to it really. You click to install and the app downloads and installs. No mucking around with install folders, specifying your JRE folder, or such things that we have grown to become accustomed to.+ iOS4.2 will bring multi-tasking to the iPad, so that's another huge plus waiting in the wings.+ The touch keyboard is large enough to enable almost full-speed touch typing. No more pecking awkwardly with your fingers.+ The more powerful processor means that it performs perceptibly better than the iPhone 4 on similar tasks.NEGATIVES- Light though it is, it is still inconvenient to use it for extended periods of time in your hands. You will need to place it on a surface at some point.- The lack of an in-built stand means you will have a terrible time viewing the screen in a brightly lit room. You will need to buy a third-party accessory.- The iTunes software is a frustration-laden nightmare to use. Version 10 does nothing to improve matters. If you have multiple Apple devices, managing them effectively with iTunes is next to impossible. Knowing which apps are syYou never know when a right-click is available, where it is not, when to use drag-and-drop, and when to use the menu. Needless to say, it is the weakest link in this chain.- The lack of a right-click gesture.- The lack of tooltips and the equivalent of mouse-hovers. You get so used to hovering your mouse over a link or text or image and seeing more information about that markup that you sorely miss it on the iPad. Especially when browsing. You sometimes feel like you are taking a step in the darkness when you click on a link that you don't know what it is going to lead to.- The automatic content orientation from portrait to landscape does not work quite as well or as expected. If you place your iPad on a flat surface and then rotate it by 90 degrees, the iPad, most of the time, does not automatically change the orientation of the content. You have to pick up the tablet and hold it at a slightly tilted angle, of say 30 degrees or more, for the content to reorient itself. Minor quibble.- You need to connect the iPad into a wall outlet to charge it. Evidently you cannot charge the iPad by connecting the USB cable into your laptop.- The closed, walled world of the iPad. No Flash, no Java. Yes, you can use your browser for most things, but if you want to use apps, then the iTunes stores it is. Yes, the store provides some assurance of safety and protection from malware, but this closed worldview is a regressive one, and reminds one of Microsoft's attempts in the 1990s to wall off its Windows users from the internet. Microsoft failed then. Apple could well fail now.- Price. The iPad, even at its cheapest, at $499, feels overpriced. You can get full-featured laptops for that price, with more RAM, more hard disk, a bigger screen, a physical keyboard, USB ports to plug in external devices into, no limitations on Flash or Java, your choice of software to install, and more...The FutureConsider this. A laptop with Flash memory and without optical drives, if well designed, could weigh just as much as an iPad. Innovate a bit more and provide a sliding keyboard so that you can use a physical keyboard when you want to, and which also allows you to place your laptop on a flat surface with the screen tilted, and you have an iPad competitor.What Apple has managed to do is bring an unprecedented level of architectural integration competence and a very viable third-party commercial ecosystem to the world of its devices, in the form of the iTunes App Store. This, more than anything else, will prove to be a formidable barrier to competition. Till that happens, Apple's iPad (and iPhone and iPod) will continue to enjoy super-economic profits.
The ipad seems to be the device that you either love or love to hate. I've never really owned many apple products and have always been more of a "PC guy", but I decided to try the ipad out and have now owned the 16GB Wifi version for 3 months. There has not been a day that I have not used it... I guess that means I would have to be counted in the "love it" group.Yes, the ipad has it's flaws - which undoubtedly have been covered in great detail in the other 150+ reviews, so I won't go into much detail about them. Yes, I wish it could handle Flash, multitasking (which will be added with iOS4 this Fall), and it could definitely use a camera (or 2). Yes, it's basically a big ipod touch and a netbook would be more powerful, more capable, and seem to make more sense.Despite these short-comings, the ipad has a convenience factor about it that makes it extremely appealing. Being able to pick up the device and have it turn completely on in about 1 second is something no netbook or computer can offer. Being able to lay in bed and hold the ipad like a book while surfing the web, watching movies, playing games, reading magazines, putting together a document for work, shopping, etc. is fantastic and just wouldn't be the same on the tiny screen of an ipod touch or while having a netbook laying on your stomach. Perhaps soon some android tablets will offer what the ipad does and more, but as of yet, no other tablet/netbook even comes close to offering the convenience and appeal that the ipad offers. The interface is extremely smooth and I've become addicted to shopping in the curated app store. It's much easier to navigate and find apps than in the cluttered android marketplace. I've even found that I love some of the games offered - something I never imagined myself using the ipad for.As for the Wifi vs 3G debate, I can only say that I'm pleased I went with Wifi because it rarely leaves my house. Even if I do take it somewhere else, there is usually Wifi available and if not and I need 3G access somewhere, I have my phone. I'm equally happy I went with 16GB, because I haven't even come close to filling it up even with a medium sized music/video library and tons of apps.As for the ipad vs a kindle - I've owned both the DX and ipad. I love both, but find myself using the ipad more just because of the wide variety of things to do. The kindle does have the advantage of the e-ink screen. If my eyes feel "tired" or if I'm in sunlight, the kindle is definitely what I reach for. I've found myself using the kindle app on the ipad a ton though. It's fantastic that I can buy books from amazon and keep my kindle library on the ipad. I do wish amazon would sell magazines through their kindle app like they do on the kindle though. There are other options on the ipad like Zinio, but I feel it's an area that amazon could really thrive in.A device that I haven't been able go a day in the last 3 months without picking up for hours on end deserves no less than 5 stars in my mind. The ipad hasn't replaced my computer, but it has opened up a new area in my life that I don't think I could go without now... okay, I could but I don't want to. I use it for so many things that I try not to think about those dark days before the ipad came along.
I love Apple products so I bought a (Wi-Fi) iPad as soon as it came out. Nine months later I sold it on eBay (a woman in Russia bought it). Why? First, iPad is for consumption, not for producing any content. At the time I did not have a notebook, and I need to send, not only receive emails. iPad has no keyboard and is bad for this. Even after I bought the external Bluetooth Apple keyboard, it was still way too cumbersome. Second, the Wi-Fi reception is not sensitive - Apple Macbooks get much better signal at the same hotspots; I have compared. Third, Wi-Fi alone is not enough. One needs the 3G/4G connection now and then. But this means paying ATT for a second service on top of my iPhone. I refuse. iPad should allow the iPhone to be plugged in to share the 3G network. Fourth, it is cumbersome to get files into the device, needing either iTunes or email. This is inconvenient.Fifth, I discovered I just don't like a touch interface. There, I said it. With the iPhone, it's clearly necessary but for a bigger device, I prefer keyboard and mouse. Touch on the iPad is imprecise and often does not respond immediately. Often necessary to press a spot several times to get a response, or it will not accept input. Frustrating and I'm mystified why more people don't complain about this. The good things about iPad include the long battery life. The iPad is wonderful for many purposes - schools to replace books - but it's not for everyone.********Update added June 2011. After selling my first iPad, I bought an iPad2 recently to try again. I like it better this time, partly because I now have a MacBook Air also and no longer expecting the iPad2 to be something it's not such as a platform for typing memos. I just use it now to read email and the news in bed, and to read journal articles and magazines. And to carry photos. And for Facetime. This is what it's designed for. Also, the iPad2 is slightly thinner which does make it noticeably easier to handle and the software has been smoothed up. I still feel a bit ripped off that I can't share the 3G connection between my iPhone and iPad; after all, I cannot use both at once so why not use the minutes on the device in use at the moment? Also I would REALLY like to see a USB port to read files on a USB drive. Finally I would like to see the iPad integrated with the MacBook; one would detach the display and it would switch over to being an iOS device. Maybe Apple will offer that someday. Modular devices with integrated services would be much better for consumers. I'm raising the stars rating.
The iPad is revolutionary.  Sure, it's not the first tablet out there, but this year all anyone can talk about is a tablet, what's better, why to get an iPad, why not to get an iPad... I'm not sure when all the Apple hatred started, for me it was a lifelong obsession.  I grew up on DOS, moved to windows 3.11... I hated apple on principle.  I had an epiphany one night as I struggled to use my windows laptop and finally discovered that all those great things a windows based pc can do... I never use! So I switched to apple. My iMac replaced my unrelisble desktop.  My iPhone then replaced my irritating blackberry.  Then my iPod nano replaced my buggy zine (and iTunes replaced the ever changing nightmarish zine software - seriously, the original version was perfection MS, but alas). I had but one problem, my laptop.  I didn't want to do the full on laptop thing, since apple laptops have one of the same problem as all other laptops... Battery life.  For me, my laptop comes out when I travel, or want to window shop in the living room, but otherwise it gets put away in favor of my far superior desktop.  What I wanted was a laptop that I can pick up and go with.  Here is the iPad.  Me and a few friends got iPads, and now we have them all the time.  None of us ever carried around a laptop with us unless we were traveling.  Now, we have them at all times.The question for many is: can it replace my laptop.  The real question should be, can your laptop replace your iPad? I see far more iPad wielding corporate soldiers in the coffee shops now days, snickering at the laptop relic holder that runs in to plug his laptop in, not sure if he put it on sleep or power save mode before he left the house.  No, my iPad can't do more.  It can't play world of Warcraft or command and conquer.  But do you leave the house to do those things... No? Then why do you want your iPad to do it? Sure the iPad has games, but unless your a card game addict, it's only there to keep you busy for about a half hour while you can't do much else. Otherwise, I challenge you to find something I can't do.  Don't bring up flash, it was a sore issue at first, but since I found out either the anti iPad people are lying to me about the need for flash, or I just get lucky, I have found 1, yeah that's right 1 site that I don't get to play with, and it was just doing a search for a homework assignment and I found the site to be bogus on my desktop... Oh well.  HTML 5 is here and it's kicking butt. Flash has been on the edge for almost 4 years as devs looked for better ways to do Internet... And the iPad has ushered the revolution.  To think that this little device changed the Internet...I have complaints.  The first is that I am addicted to this thing.  It goes everywhere with me from the garage (how to vids) to the bathroom (why not watch a little Netflix or YouTube while I... Er... Download).  The second is that it is missing some things. It needs that camera on there.  IPad video chatting should be a next big step.  I want an sd slot for this thing, rather than be forced to shell out extra money for the bigger drive. The last thing I want is a screen lock switch.  It is funny to look at a photo and turn the photo to a different angle to look at something , only to have the screen adjust back to how it was in the first place.The best things... Simplicity, durability, longevity.  This is what makes it so much better than a laptop.  Simplicity makes it lessaggravating than a standard computer. You would be surprised at the durability of this thing (my 5 and 6 year olds play games on it all the time).  But the most significant factor is the longevity.  The advertised 10 hours is a lie.  I have not charged mine in two days, and I use nearly every waking hour.  Movies, airplay, dictation, games, everything... It's at 33% right now.  As a consumer I would have never even thought about an iPad if my laptop could go on batteries this long, I could have dealt with the frustration and blue screens all day long if I had power.  The iPad lasts forever. That is the number one selling point to me.  You will be surprised to see how much you can do if you don't have to plug in all the time.All this being said, if you can afford it... Get it, if you can't, sorry.From my iPad
I bought my iPad about 2 months after they came out and I had a chance to see it operate at the Apple store in Palo Alto, CA.  Surprisingly after having bad experiences with other palm type devices and the Kindle, I found I liked it.For a "Window to the Internet" which is the main use I found for it, it works fairly well.  A major problem with the iPad, and a major problem with all computers and the Internet, the WWW, is the display size.  Many web pages are not designed with any kind of logic or order about the screen.  For example, I find the blogs I read to be just slightly too wide to adjust comfortably on my iPad screen so that I do not have to scroll horizontally.  Horizontal scrolling for each line is what needs to be avoided.  It is possible to read things on the iPad just fine, but not if they are in a window that is too wide for the text size.  Ideally a newspaper column width where the text can be expanded and vertically scrolled is really idea.My favorite App so far is the Kindle reader for iPad.  Conspicuously missing the text-to-speech facility on a real Kindle, it is a visual only reader.  I do not like that there is no way to number the pages, but the Kindle experience is much better on an iPad than it is on the Kindle. I always say that I would more often want to read in the dark with a back lit screen that I would on a beach in the bright sunlight with monochrome e-paper.  The Apple reader I can do without.  I suspect that Apple and Amazon may partner to change the face of publishing, Apple in H/W and Amazon in distribtuion and content management.Which brings me to the frightful mess, but getting slightly better, that is iTunes.  The iTunes interface is ... well, honestly, terrible.  If you go to the ITunes store it is so slow and impossible to negotiate that they think only when someone really needs to buy something and knows what they want would they use it.  I buy audiobooks from the Apple store that are not available anywhere else, but I hate the experience, and the reviews and customer feedback is not helpful at all.My main App for fun is the online Backgammon game which I really enjoy being a backgammon fanatic.  The finger taps often seem to misregister ... I don't know if that is the problem of the iPad hardware or the program, but it has provided a lot of entertainment and brain stimulation.In general though the Apps are terrible and underwhelming, and following the trail of ITunes the App store is awful.  There are so many apps and so little or none useful feedback on what is good and so much disinformation that I just do not get anything that is not free.  I need a audio recorder App, but there are so many and the ones I have tried are clumsy and irritating.There is hardly anything to just take notes with.The email client is not that great and has the same problems as the Apple desktop OS version.All the Apps are so stripped down there seems to be no good help for any of them and most try to be too cool or cute.  I just want a simple interface to jot down some notes sometimes, or to record audio at a meeting or in some situation that I want to remind myself of something.Despite all the drawbacks, I believe the iPad is going to succeed despite itself.  What is lacks in some aspects can be made up for in multiple ways.  For example people complained about the lack of Flash, which I don't care about, but then ABC and other websites have some up with their own Apps to watch video on.  I watched episodes of "Lost" on the iPad and it is fantastic.  I am disappointed that Hulu.Com wants to charge a subscription for their content,but I guess they have to compete with NetFlicks.The Skype application works too, so you can use the iPad as a telephone, clumsy as it may feel.  I do not have the 4G3G ... whatever G is the one that is sold optionally with the iPad, and do not miss it.  The object was to get something fast, versatile, relatively cheap and easy with no recurring costs ... and for that I love the iPad.I carry around about 180 audio books that I have ripped myself as well as some music and stuff I bought from the iTunes store despite it's faults.  All in all this thing is a great tool for many things.  I recommend the Ipad to people who invetsigate it and find they can use it.  Don't buy it just to be cool, it really is a tool, and as such it can be very very useful, and will be more so in the future if Apple can get some of the faults out of it.The one thing that sticks with me is the impression one gets of Apple when one enters the Apple world.  I have an iMac, iPod and an iPad now.  I never bought Apple before about a year ago, but I like the UNIX OS underlying, and the ergononomics and ease of use.  My 24" screen iMac is just a joy to use.  My iPad complements that along with the Ipod ... BUT, Apple makes some some bad design choices and they refuse, maybe out of arrogance to fix them or do anything about them.  This is my on worry about the future of the iPad ... bad management decisions can kill a product dead even if it is a great innovative idea.Oh ... then there is battery life.  In all the months I have owned the iPad so far I have only once or twice gotten the battery down to about 40%.  For me, I find there is no danger of running out of juice and the battery life is really great.  After using the iPad most of the day one day I fell asleep listening to an audiobook and woke up in the morning and the thing was still going.One other thing that makes the iPad so wonderful is that companies and groups are making use of it too, as I mentioned above with ABC.  NPR has a fantastic app that lets you run through all the news in the last few days ... or weeks ... and then add the audio stories to a playlist.  Then you can set the thing going and create your own content for hours.  When companies perfect this webcasting thing like NPR this will be the way of the future, and a device like the iPad will the way to access it.I do wish the iPad had a camera in it, GPS would be nice too.  A better mail client also.  Multitasking is supposed to be on the way later this year, although I find it is not really a problem the way it is.  Bugs are fixed fast, and there are improvements as well ... so all in all I have to give the iPad a 4/5 ... which I mean to be close to the 5 than the 4 ... this is a really innovative product for those that can use it.
When the iPad was unveiled in January I initially felt very underwhelmed. The famed Apple Tablet, seemingly under production for a decade and now finally revealed, felt like a letdown: it ran the iPhone OS rather than Mac OS, it lacked sufficient hard drive space, and the on-screen icons were too small.Nonetheless, my curiosity remained at launch day, and I began to take a more serious interest based both on user reviews and my own personal needs. Trying the device out further solidified my interest, and this past weekend I reserved one and picked up my 32GB, Wi-Fi only model 24 hours later.The iPad fits my needs pefectly. I wanted a simple, consumption-oriented device that would allow me to watch my iTunes content, surf the internet, and would have access to applications that would further enhance it. The device would serve to supplement, but not replace, my laptop, would allow for instant access to the aforementioned features, and would be used daily. The iPad does all that for me and much more.Here are a few of my favorite features.Video looks superb; I've uploaded movies, TV shows, and video podcasts to my iPad, and each plays in high quality and without any hiccups. I particularly like the interface Apple selected for the video application, as the cover art for movies and TV shows is displayed in vibrant color; the video description feature, appearing to the left of the cover art, is a nice touch as well.While watching video on the iPad I'm left only with a thin screen to hold, which elicits a much more comfortable viewing experience with less mass to deal with. Though I've only watched a few videos, I much prefer it to watching video on my laptop. Audio, too, is great, both without headphones (mono) and with (stereo).Safari, the iPad's internet browser, is what really sold me on the device during my first hands-on. It's been said before, but viewing an entire web page at once, without the need to zoom in and out, is incredible. Both text and pictures look sharp, and pages render quickly thanks to Apple's custom processor. The "Bookmark Bar," a feature that can be toggled on and off in Settings, appears underneath the address bar and is a feature not available on the iPhone due to screen size limitations. I've found this to be really useful, and have added all of my bookmarks to it which allows for quick access to my favorite sites.Like the iPhone, however, page refreshes have become a nuisance when switching between tabs. I've grown used to it through browsing on my iPhone, however with such a large device I'd hoped it would be less of an issue. It's not significant enough to detract from the overall browsing experience for me, but it is something to be aware of for those who like to have multiple pages open at a time.Lastly, apps. The App Store has become a huge selling point for Apple, and it's hard to ignore the numbers Apple proudly boasts in its ads. I've uploaded both iPhone and iPad apps to the iPad, and both types play great. However, the difference in quality between the two is staggering, and I'm left reluctant to upload any more iPhone apps to the iPad. While the scaled quality of an iPhone app isn't as bad as some may lead you to believe, it's difficult to choose an iPhone app over an HD iPad app after experiencing both.Unfortunately, iPad app developers capitalize on this fact and subsequently charge many times more for iPad apps. While the price difference may be worth it to some, for others the lesser quality iPhone app will likely suffice.To conclude, the iPad won't be for everyone. The steep price can be difficult to justify for those who may not have a well-defined place in his or her life for a tablet device. Further, those hoping to get more features out of the iPad than the device offers may be disappointed in its functionality.  For anyone considering the iPad, defining when and how to use it can help to decide if it's the right purchase to make. You'll likely still need your laptop, but the iPad right now is the best complement device there is.Pros- Fantastic video quality and interface- Second-to-none internet browsing experience- The look and feel of the device- Photos in the Photo app look more than impressive- Snappiness with the accelerometer, opening apps, and other functions- Simple interface backed by easy set-up/maitenanceCons- iPad App Store pricing and selection- Hard drive space should be greater- Page refreshes in Safari- Price
Im just loving the iPad. It eliminated me having to carry my laptop with me everywhere i went. Lightweight and fast! I opted for the 3G which is a feature that i couldn't do without. The ability to be online anywhere i go (almost everywhere i go) makes it easier for me to keep up with emails from work and up to date with the news while im on the train. I would recommend buying a nice case for this. I got one from apple for $50 and it was well worth it. Avoids scratches and gives you a better feel when handling the unit. 16g is plenty for the average user based on research i did online. The 32g and 64g are more the for people that need to download big files and a ton of songs and movies. A good tip would be try not to have all your emails directly on your ipad. Instead try to use a website that links you to your emails. This will avoid you taking up memory with emails saved on your ipad. I have added Skype to my ipad and im able to even make phone calls now. Just wish this came with a camera!! Im sure that will be out in 3 months and i'll just HAVE to buy that too!
When I started trying cases in the seventies and into the eighties, I would take yellow legal pads to trial. By the end of the trial they would be full of rather cryptic notes for jury selection, opening statement, witnesses, and closing argument. By the nineties, I was a computer-savvy guy who sometimes rented a laptop for big trials, but usually relied a never ending supply of legal pads.By the millennium, I had a PC tablet on which I could load electronic copies of the files and depositions, and take notes during trial. I could actually walk about about the courtroom with it just like it was a very heavy legal pad. After I switched my office's computers from PCs to Macs. I would still bring it to trials. Then my tablet died (as most Windows machines are want to do) and I was back stuck at the lectern with my MacBook Pro. When I wanted to wander the courtroom while examining witnesses, I had to use my trusty old legal pad. Like many Mac enthusiasts I prayed for the day Apple would offer a tablet.For me that day came on April 27, when my 64GB WiFi+3G iPad was delivered. Since then I bring it to court in lieu of my laptop. Unlike my old Tablet PC, 3G gives me constant and immediate Internet access. And that is the principal reason to opt for the 3G over the WiFi only iPad. Many courthouses do not have hotspots. If you don't need Internet wherever you are, then the other model may be enough.As to storage, more memory  is better. You are going to want to load, movies, music and photos on it. 32GB is not enough. Given the marginal increments in costs of doubling the memory 64GB, the present maximum will seem tiny as the iPad evolves over the years. If you get it now, you may be able to postpone upgrading a year from now.The iPad, like the iPhone is basically a Swiss Army knife, and like the Swiss knife it is infinitely customizable. As a Mac user I am comfortable with iWork, Apples Office Suite. Consisting of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote each applications for the iPad, they all read Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and export them. You will want to buy them. Other critical work apps include Evernote, iAnnotatate PDF, PaperDesk, Penultimate, Dropbox and GoodReader. I track my expenses on the go with an iPhone app JetSet. On the fun side I read books using Kindle for iPad, which I prefer to Apples's iBook.On the negative side, at the moment the iPad lacks multi-taking, and has no camera. That will change. But waiting for those additions is no excuse not to get an iPad today.My iPad is a tool not a toy, I keep telling myself. And as a courtroom tool, it is small and light just like a yellow legal pad.  But when I stroll about with my iPad, I can't help having a big smile on my face.
A few years ago I read an interesting article by the developer of the Palm Pilot.  He described how he walked around the office with a block of wood to help him imagine what it would be like to carry and use a working PDA.  We have all walked around with a legal pad or something like it.  I think the Apple designers did this, too.  But with a little more awareness than most of us have.  The iPad is the result of this awareness.  I wangled mine at the beginning of this Christmas week and have had a few days to carry it around.  Here's what I think:The main advantages from my point of view: - Screen size.  As big as a piece of paper--not cramped like my iPhone screen. - Weight.  Just like a legal pad with a cover.  Maybe just a little heavier. - Keyboard.  Big enough to type with two hands.  Two fingers, in my case, but still... - Apps.  All iPhone's supported, with 2x mode for those that don't adapt to the big screen. - Convenience.  Type notes, documents, dissertations anywhere without setting up a laptop. - Newspapers.  I didn't think that screen size mattered for news apps, but it does somehow. - Web browsing.  As good as a desktop; better than iPhone special interface apps. - Pictures and movies. Wow!The minor disadvantages: - The size.  No complaints, but it is less convenient to carry than my iPhone.  Well, of course it is. - No split screen.  I really would like to have two apps side-by-side. - Not a laptop replacement.  This is fine--but don't kid yourself.  Keep your laptop. - Not an iPhone replacement.  Not small or convenient enough.  Also no phone. - Too shareable.  Unlike an iPhone, which is clearly personal, people feel free to borrow it.  Grrr! - Too pricey.  Worth it, but just barely.  Somebody at Apple is very good at figuring price points.I'm glad I got it and I don't think I will change my mind.  I think I will keep using it to write on the metro, in front of the TV--like I am now--and other places where using the laptop doesn't quite work.  And, as when I first got my iPhone, I will temporarily turn into more of an app junkie to find the coolest ones.  They're only a buck, right?  Mostly.
The iPad is a wonderful device that will meet some users needs, but not others. It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have "Facetime" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!). I've used the iPad for quite a while now, and am not disappointed. Just remember not to expect a laptop, but more of a new type of device. I would recommend it to anyone.
This is a great product but people thinking of buying this should consider that a newer version will be coming out early 2011.  If I bought one now or received it as a present I would feel a little ripped off.
Since I bought my 32-gb iPad from Verizon a month ago, my kids and I have been fighting over it (well not really, but eagerly waiting in a queue for our turns). It is such a pleasure to have around, and already we depend on it. We especially enjoy playing games on it, and my kids can check their email and Facebook pages while we are out and about. I have Pages and can word process with ease using the Apple bluetooth keyboard. I like how the MiFi bundle that Verizon offers turns the iPad and both of my children's iPods into internet ready devices anywhere we go. I can even use the MiFi on my Macbook Pro. Obviously the key danger is exceeding one's data plan, and I'm not sure how far 1 gb ($20 plan) will get me and my children in one month. We don't use the MiFi all that much. Mainly it's for quick checking.If you haven't bought the SD card reader and USB port, do so, as this will improve the versatility of the unit.I am disappointed that this device lacks a forward facing camera for video conferencing. Hopefully future models will include one. This is the main reason I am not giving it five stars.I wear bifocals and haver poor "near" eyesight. As much as I love my children's iPods and as much as I would love to have one of the new ones, my eyes just can't focus on tiny graphics. It is indeed wonderful to have a sizable screen. Some of the apps will freeze and need to be restarted. That can get annoying.One of my children is autistic and has a very difficult time on long rides in the car. I've found that the privilege of playing with the iPad can help him a lot. My kids and their friends also delight in the "pass and play" games that one can buy inexpensively at the app store. Many a drive has been saved and tempers maintained with this wonderful thing.Having owned and played quite a bit with an iPod, I must say that the iPad is definitely far more than a larger version. It is a little computer, light and easy to carry, even with the extras that one can buy to go along with it.
So I have had my iPad now for about a month. The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a "third device," not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.
My 8 year old son has autism. His $6,000 communication device burned out about 2 months before the iPad came out - so we started looking. This fantastic device has a communication program (Proloquo2go) that is PERFECT for him. So what we have now is a fabulous multi-tasking device for my son. He communicates using PLQ2Go, he can also read books we download (The Cat in the Hat, etc.) or they can be read to him. He has horrible handwriting, so in school he can use the Notes application to type, which is great since we can hardly interpret his handwriting. There are educational apps (spelling, math, etc) which will help reinforce what he is learning in a fun way.One con I have is using the device in a noisy location (classroom with lots of kids) - you need an external speaker, which we have on order.We are VERY terrified of him dropping it, but as we have few alternatives, I'd rather replace a $500 device than a $5000 device (neither of which are covered by insurance). We have a binder/cover on order - and I'll look for a padded travel case as well which should have a handle. But this is just the thing for us.My other complaint (not sure if it's ipad related or not) - I personally hate the app store - at least via the iPad. I cannot find much unless I know EXACTLY what I'm looking for, and in searching for educational apps that my son can use - it's only by luck that I find anything. I think I need some tutoring, and will get to that when I have a free moment (ha!) but otherwise I recommend this as a great AAC device. (p.s. the Proloquo2go works great on the iPod phone and touch - which my son will probably graduate to - but he needs the big screen right now).For those of you who are complaining that it's a larger or heavier iPod, or not as functional as a laptop, etc. Then don't buy it. But you won't convince me. I've been using my son's - and now I want my own! Books, email, etc. I don't have a laptop (I have a desktop) and I like this because I can carry it around the house and use it while I do things with my kids. Last night I was playing Monopoly with my daughter on the family room floor while tracking some of these packages that I'm expecting. Also, there are apps that I can download which I haven't even explored yet.
What do i have to offer to the already 432 previous reviews?  Just - thank you guys!i'm a 52 year old male who grew up in a world without computers.  I dont thiink that i like them, but i know they keep creeping into my life as a marginal neccessity.Along comes this ipad thing. Fast, crisp, smooth operating (computer ?) pad.  yes it is a computer.  i can balance my checking accounts.  surf the web, email, chat, oh no even play games. thats gotta be a computer.  no viral worries.  no rebooting.  no defragmenting.  it works fantastic - and i just sit back and take all the credit.  You macsters really knew how to cater to the millions of  middle age guys who are not 22 year old computer whizzezzzzz.Addendum 01/01/11:  FYI we used to have a Sony Vaio PC.  The wife and kids "needed" it for their various life fulfilling projects.  Every week there would be some sort of drama surrounding its existance;  update the reader, update security,  10 minute download,  file this file that and forget it.  Now this iPad fills practically every need I have with no drama.  I need ice skates to keep up with its speed and ease.OH sure if your accounting or running your business you NEED a monstosity computer.  But i bet for most of us this is all you really need to be connected to the world in all the electronic ways.
I purchased my iPad for business travel hoping that I could comfortably and easily use it for e-mails, web surfing, watching movies and more. This is a really nice piece of hardware with an excellent design. The touch screen works easily and almost flawlessly. The virtual keyboard is fast and very effective. The display is very pleasing, particularly when playing movies. WiFi operation in my situation was very robust and basically transparent. The iPad is very light and easy to tote around initially. The bundled apps are sufficient for basic computing.On the demerit side, the first issue is that watching movies requires a stand of some sort which leads to a marketplace with solutions that are either expensive, heavy, wobbly or cheesy or all four (and not ideal for travel). I know that there is a cardboard origami solution but I didn't want to deal with that for every trip. The next issue is that it really isn't very comfortable holding the bare iPad for a long time and one worries about scratching the beautiful aluminum case. This leads to a search for a skin or case. I ended up with the InCase Silicone skin which has a very good design that levels out the back of the iPad with molded rubber protrusions. Unfortunately, this also almost doubles the weight of the iPad, negating its weight advantage for travel and lounging around with it. Next, integration with iTunes and a lack of a USB port leaves the iPad user chained to Apple solutions for data transfers with the exception of the camera connection kit. I am in a mixed OS household (Windows and Mac) and this created potential hassles that I didn't want to deal with. Finally, I was surprised by how many mainstream web sites that I went to that were inaccessible because of Flash (and despite Mr. Jobs' assurances otherwise). I returned my iPad after three days. I am sure however, that for many, this will fit the bill either as a third device or for those with the narrow requirements that this device meets.
For a very long time I have played with portable devices, trying to get one that met my needs. I tried the Pocket PC, Palm Pilot, cellphones, and nothing quite satisfied my needs. In general, I wanted a light weight, easy to carry device that would enable me to search the web and read pdf/word/powerpoint/ and  excel documents. I was also looking for something to store my address book and a calender for scheduling and to do list.Despite popular belief, the ipad is in no way a tablet PC. As a matter of fact, it is basically an ipod touch with a larger screen and slightly more powerful processor. Understanding that, you can decide whether this is really the device you wanted. In my case, it absolutely was. I have no ipod touch, so I did not have that feeling of repetition when purchasing this item. I have enjoyed the ipad, and while I initially felt some pangs of buyer's remorse, the longer I have it, the more I have enjoyed it.When purchasing the ipad, you probably should plan to spend some $50 on additional applications. Apps are not too expense, but you may want 5-10 applications to help you get what you want out of the ipad. One bonus, most ipod touch games work with the ipad, so you have access to all of those games and software. Unfortunately, one of my biggest reasons for wanting the ipad was to have a portable office. So far, I have yet to find any software (free or buyable, that really provided me with the office I wanted. The closest program so far has yet to be ported to the ipad, and the ipod version does not work correctly. On the other hand, the ipad brings a new feel to gaming. It is unique, fun, and enjoyable. I enjoy the gaming on this far better than the nintendo DS (stylus) gaming. It is fun, and there are hundred's of games for both the ipad and ipod touch to keep you busy for a long long time.In the end, I am someone who wanted an ipod touch, but with a larger screen, and I got it. I didn't care for an mp3 player (I have one). So I basically wanted a palm pilot with a large enough screen to be able to surf the web and read pdf's comfortably, and that is exactly what it is. Trying to make it more is what leads to disappointment and the lower score others are giving it. It is not fit in your pocket portable, but if it was, then you wouldn't be able to read and use the web comfortably. It is portable enough for me to take along in the car on long drives, take to a friends house, bring along on vacation, and do all the things with it that I would need on the go, without the need for a bulky keyboard or an inconvenient stylus, but I wouldn't "drag it everywhere with me", since it is too inconvenient for that.It is a 4 out of 5 because although I like it, it is lacking a couple of things that I think are no brainers. Some of them you can download at a cost, but I just would have expected them to come with the device free, such as a viewer and editor for .doc and .xls documents (word and excel), and a to do list. (seriously, you have to buy and download a to do list, they couldn't just give you one for free). If there are so many free widgets and gadgets out there, then why do ipad apps, which do no more or less than a widget of similar ability, have to cost $2-$5 each?Update: I figured I should reiterate what I mean with the portable office and my score. Yes, they offer "pages" and "numbers" at a cost of $9.99 each, but besides costing $30 to get all of the software needed (powerpoint, word, excel equivalents), they also limit the fonts used and are not the software I would choose. I would have expected at least a free viewer to be able to look at these files, but you have to spend money on that (good reader is what I purchased). For a device centered around the idea of being a very slick and portable itablet, they didn't put any effort to ensure it could do what an actually itablet computer can do. They should have thought of making a document viewer and editor come with it with limited features. Eventually, companies will come out with them, and I will purchase them at a cost of $10-$15 when a decent one does, but it is something almost required on this kind of device, but absent. There desire to nickel and dime customers with there apps is incredibly apparent, almost every free app either has ads, or tries to get you to buy their paid for version. Many of the free games constantly tries to get you to make "ingame" purchases. And seeing how easy it is to make a purchase once setting it up, definitely make sure you kid doesn't touch it or you could end up with a $200 bill easy. So Apple Ipad gets a 4, because for all its' potential, apple limits you so it can get every penny out of you it can.
The iPad is great for surfing the Internet on the couch or in bed.  It boots up quickly, and one can be surfing immediately.  The size of the iPad allows a good portion of the websites to be viewed easily; however, Java apps don't work.  The biggest downside to the iPad is that it does not support Java, which means you can't watch certain shows/videos online.  The other downside is that Apple controls the apps that get released to the iPad.  Some apps that would be beneficial and/or interesting are not allowed for the iPad.  However, the iPad does have some good apps that have been created by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.  It is much more fun to read the newspapers on the iPad.  Also, one can play crossword puzzles and other types of games.
My husband originally bought this device for himself.  He quickly learned that he prefers his Kindle e-ink screen to reading on the iPad screen... but he also quickly learned that our 2.5 year old toddler could work the device with minimal adult assistance.  Intrigued, we downloaded some learning apps.  iWriteWords, Thomas The Train puzzles, the Disney Toy Story ebook, and an app for developing hand-eye coordination.  The iPad has quickly become the center of my child's learning day.  He colors, learns to count, writes letters and numbers, reads, and completes puzzles.  He also watches cartoons on Netflix, which is great because this allows us to keep him in the same room with us and not have to be subjected to watching Noggin every night.Most of the apps (except for ebooks) take us a few days to teach our son to navigate.  However, we downloaded Sketchbook pro for my husband... and the baby figured out how to display the hiding menu and change brush colors before I did!  We now have about 12 apps for our toddler and add more every week or so.  While I wouldn't have originally planned to purchase such an expensive device for a small child, I'm really glad we did.  I think the iPad is going to give our child a great head start in school, not to mention it has made him comfortable with and curious about technology.In addition, we just purchased the OtterBox case on Amazon to protect our investment in this device.  It is also worth mentioning that even with constant daily use, the battery life has been great.  We charge it overnight each night and it usually lasts all day.
I'm really surprised at the number of 1-star reviews on here and the complaining about the lack of flash.  Let's face it -- flash is useful for some things, but as the dominant media plugin it is on its way out.  I've found very little that actually needs flash and the sites that do use it, there is mostly an app that can accomplish the same thing but way better.Why not review it for what it is rather than something that you think it is not.  Obviously many of these people do not own one.  The common thread seems to be "I used a friends".I bought this about a week after it came out and I have used it every day since.  I have hundreds of free and paid apps both for fun and work. I recently took it on vacation with my bluetooth keyboard and was able to leave all sorts of things behind.  Watching movies, reading books, playing games on the flight -- perfect.  After taking pictures on my iPhone I was able to wirelessly send them to my iPad where I could edit and enhance them with the dozens of image apps out there.Every day something new comes out that enhances the experience as developers have jumped on board in a frenzy.  Gaming is a totally different experience as the size makes a big difference.  Going back to gaming on a phone is just not possible.Battery life is amazingly long.  Even with alot of use every day, I can get 2-4 days of use with no charging.  It's well put together and slick -- hard to believe it is the first one.And yes, everyone will jump on the bandwagon and try to mimic it -- and if Flash is your one and only destiny that you can't live without, then by all means wait.  Otherwise this one is the one.
This iPad constantly disappoints. You don't realize how many websites use flash until you own an iPad. My $350 Acer laptop outperforms every time.I regret buying this.
Hi there! I have just recently received an ipad, and for the most part, it is absolutely useless, for me at least.Let me tell you a bit of my background, I am a college student with a part time job. I have a powerful desktop and a semi-powerful laptop. My laptop has about 9-11 hours of battery life (asus ul30vt, $600). It also have 2 graphics card, 1 for hardcore gaming, and 1 for power saving, very intuitive. I also own a Mytouch Slide smartphone. My computer background is slightly advanced. Below is some aspects important to me (college student).General Use:The Ipad is for the most part useless to me. My laptop is only $100 more expensive, but much more useful, and it only weighs 3 pounds, with about the same battery life. I'm not trying to advertise for Asus, but just comparing laptops to this ipad. At home, I use my desktop most often. At school and work, I use my laptop for notetaking and serious work. On the bus, I use my smartphone for various stuff. The only time I find myself using the ipad is when I am in the bathroom taking a dump, or on bed watching videos (early morning or late at night when I am too lazy to get out of bed). It actually works fairly good on bed because it doesn't overheat, it is always cool. My laptop always makes my blanket too hot after a while.Battery:If the ipad came 2 years ago, it would definitely be the best gadget ever because of the insane 10 hour battery life, but nowadays, many netbooks and laptops offer that amount for much less.Gaming:I find the games on the ipad fairly dull as I am much into hardcore games like Halo, COD, starcraft, etc.Use-abilityMostly everything the ipad can do, including ebooks, I can do on my laptop. The pros of the ipad can be experienced for novice to casual computer users. The ipad OS is very simple and clean. It's also very smooth. However for my generation, computer is a very big part of our lives.Apps:Because of all the apps, the ipad can be used for a lot of different things. However...you have to have the money. Yes you can jailbreak it, but that's the same as stealing.Keyboard:Speaking of which. The ipad keyboard is not bad. However, to type correctly with minimum error, you have to look at the keyboard because you can't touch type with the virtual keyboard, and also you have to lift you palm away from the keybaord because the slightest touch can make a letter click. The auto correction system is OK, not great.Portability:The ipad is only 1.5 pounds, but it is as big as a netbook. Which means, I will have to bring a bag or backpack. May be useful if you carry a medium sized purse that you can fit an ipad in (but this is for college review).Price:I got my ipad used (mint condition, 16gb wifi) for $400. You can get a brand new 16gb wifi for $450 on Craigslist fairly easily. It is NOT WORTH it to buy a 32 or 64gb version because Apple overpriced the upgrade. I mean...come on, $100 for such a small upgrade? no wonder they don't offer removable memory, so that they can force people to buy the bigger memory. Also a 3G chip shouldn't cost $130 to upgrade.Performance:The OS is very smooth, but I did find some lag. A few times it just froze, it wouldn't register any of my touches.Multitasking:simply doesn't have it, should wait for the 4.2 upgrade. I use AIM for instant messaging, and if I press the home button, it exits out of AIM. It doesn't sign me off immediately, but it also doesn't tell me if I received a new IM or not. I have to go back into AIM to see if anyone replied.Social:For the most part, college students will view you as an Apple fanboy, which is NOT a good thing. For our generation, we tend to favor variety. Apple products in general are very strict and linear.People who may want to buy an ipad:1. don't have a long battery life laptop or netbook2. not technologically experienced, casual users3. casual gamers.4. all about the apps (if you can afford it).5. travel alot.6. Have the money.7. don't need multitasking.People who will regret buying an ipad:1. have a all-around laptop with great battery life2. no empty niche for ipad3. hardcore gamer4. touch-typist5. Video chatting is a normThis is just what I feel. 3 stars because it is an OK product. Yes it is smooth and very nice to hold, but not really what I need, or even want. I am looking to sell my ipad because it doesn't fit any niche in my life. However, like I said, the ipad will be perfect for people who needs an extremely portable device with great battery life. But then again, you can always buy the Asus 1005pe netbook (12 hours of battery) for about $280. or my Asus UL series for about $600. (yes i LOVE asus, they are the best laptop/netbook company, check them out, much better than HP, Toshiba, Gateway, Acer). The one thing that is incomparable with the ipad is its multitouch and smoothness. However, come 2011, the ipad should have a lot of competitors coming out.-College Student 101
Update: We just went through the first big software update to the iPad and various issues have been corrected.  The chief one is multi-tasking.  I can now click the home button twice and a bar will appear which lets me choose other functions.  I choose one and my screen is visibly swiped for another.  Also, internet radio, like my Pandora app, will now continue to play if you leave to use another function of the iPad.  Prior to this, the music stopped playing when you left Pandora.  I now have a mute button on the side and the fix position button is now on the multi-tasking bar.  I've added a few more ereader apps and, as an ebook reader, I use the ipad all of the time.  It is as good for magazines and full color art books as it is for text books.  I have not discovered any downside to this update yet.  It of course still does not play Flash but I don't think that will change as Apple is opposed to Flash. My original review appears below:I use this every day and all day long.  I read all of my books on it.  I watch tv shows and movies on it--I have not turned on a tv set since the day it arrived. I listen to audios on it. I have no problem using the virtual keyboard and can write my emails just fine on it.  I look at my Picasa albums on it. I listen to audiobooks and music on it.  I surf the web.  Then there are the apps....oh, boy...the apps are something to get lost in.  I play scrabble against the computer on it, ditto gin rummy.  I play my crosswords on it and it downloads all of my New York Times ones. I have art history apps so watched art ones, beautiful images, while waiting for a nerve wracking CT scan.  In fact, I get so absorbed in my iPad that I am somewhat irritated when "tourists" want to bother me and ask me what it is and what I'm doing on it. However, my natural enthusiasm takes over and I find myself showing them all of the things I am doing on it.My husband got one after he watched me with mine for a few months.  He gets lost in it for hours every evening.  He has a few quibbles about the iPad.  His biggest one is that it doesn't play Flash.  However, I think his problem is that he doesn't realize that if he used Apps properly that he wouldn't even have a need for Flash.  I certainly don't.  I don't need it for my Crosswords, for example, because my App handles all of my crosswords brilliantly.When I listen to all the complaints about the iPad, I think it boils down to that somehow the iPad is not the macbook in iPad form.  I don't need another Macbook!  I have a macbook, an iPad and an iPhone and frankly there is nothing else I need.  What one may not do best, the other does.  At home, where I spend most of my time, I am surrounded by all three.  When I go out, I take the iPad and iPhone.  I used to take the Macbook too but that is rarely necessary anymore. Once you have these three products, you can junk the rest of your electronics.  I certainly did.  My nephew is now using my sony reader, my digital picture frame, our Hero phone and so on and so forth.
I bought my iPad for a trip to Europe so that I would be able to watch movies for the entire flight, as well as read books. For that, with its great screen and 10 hour battery life, it is fabulous. You'd have to spend at least $500 to get netbook computer with comparable battery life and graphics power, but miss out on the touch screen and portrait mode.My problem is that I cannot sync the Ipad to my computer. I have an iPhone too and was able sync that until the iTunes release 9.1 that coincided with the release of the iPad. When I try to sync either device, the message "Unable to load data class information from sync services" appears in iTunes. I have spent more than 16 hours on the phone with at least ten Apple support techs, at the "Genius Bar" in my local Apple store, and on my own trying various "fixes" posted on the web. The senior Apple tech I am now dealing with tells me he has the same problem trying to sync his iPhone to his own computer. I briefly found a work around and was able to sync for a day, but then when I installed iTunes 9.2, it stopped working again. You cannot roll back to a previous version of iTunes because 9.1 changed the library file structure.I just spent two hours emailing myself 150 mbs of pdf doucments that I need to read, opening them on the iPad and then saving them in iBooks. If I could sync, that would have been taken me five minutes of effort at most. I also cannot load music or photos from my computer library.This problem with iTunes seems to be affecting a lot of people according the Apple techs I've dealt with and the web forums I've read. If you are planning to buy an iPad, make sure you can sync it to your computer before you buy it. Install iTunes and take your laptop down to your local retailer and ask them sync it to a demo iPad in the store. Otherwise, you may end up like me.So far, my experience has been ugly and stressful. It's disgraceful that in Apple's rush to get this product to market, they wrecked the iTunes sync capability for thousands of customers and tens weeks later they still have not fixed it.
One of my favorite things about being an early adopter is when I pick up a device more for the novelty than anything else and I'm completely surprised by how useful it turns out to be. I had this experience first with my first iPod, when I discovered podcasts. I had it again when I first got a Kindle and my reading increased about 5 fold. And I've had it once more, in almost too many ways to count, with the iPad.Let me be clear, the iPad is not a computer. You can't do anything on it that you couldn't on a laptop or desktop PC. The difference with the iPad though, is that you'll find it allows you to many of those things in ways and places you would never bring a PC to. Let me give a few examples to better illustrate my point.A few days after I got my iPad, I discovered that it fit nearly perfectly on the reading ledge for my treadmill. Now my treadmill faces a blank wall, so up to this point workout entertainment has been strictly auditory. With the iPad though, I can now watch videos while I work out. The result, I've been exercising about twice as often in the three weeks since I bought my iPad.Another example. I used to love reading comics when I was younger. However, as an adult there's a certain stigma attached to having a comic book collection in the house. The Marvel and Xcomics apps on the iPad mean that I can now enjoy comics without actually having to keep them laying around my house. The result is that I've completely rediscovered a form of entertainment.One more example. The other night, while getting ready for bed with my wife, somehow the topic of old cartoon theme songs came up in conversation. I picked up the iPad from my nightstand and we spent about 30 minutes reminiscing over YouTube clips of old cartoons. Now you might say I could do the same thing with a laptop, which I could. However, my laptop wasn't in the room and it's unlikely I would have gone to fetch it simply on a whim. With a 4-5lb laptop, it more or less stays in one place unless I anticipate that there will be a need for it. With a 1.5lb iPad, it follows me wherever I go, almost always nearby should the need for it arise.Those are just 3 examples of how the iPad has proved useful in the short time I've had it. True, they're small things, but they add up quickly to form a completely different experience with a computing device than what I'm used to.Sure the device is not without its flaws. Flash would definitely be welcome. And I'd kill for a USB and SD slot. But the technical story of this device doesn't have a whole lot to do with what makes the experience of using it so special. It's a completely different computing experience, and trying to boil it down to a spec sheet comparison just doesn't do it justice.Update: I want to add a few of my thoughts on how the iPad compares to the Kindle as an ebook reader, since it seems particularly pertinent in an Amazon review.  I've been using the Kindle app on the iPad for a little while now, and I've reached a point where I'm using each device in more or less equal amounts for reading.  Overall, I think I prefer using the Kindle.  The screen is easier on the eyes; the battery life is significantly better; the size and weight feel better in my hand; and size of the iPad's screen just feels a bit too large for reading large portions of text.That said, the iPad is certainly a capable reader in the right circumstances.  In particular, I use it more than the Kindle when I'm in bed at night because the back-lit screen means I don't need a reading light that will keep my wife awake.  Also, I've been using it more often when starting a new book.  Navigation of the store is much easier and downloads go much faster than on the Kindle due to the WiFi.In conclusion, I'm certainly not going to get rid of my Kindle now that I've got an iPad.  There are simply too many situations where I prefer it over the iPad for reading.  That said, if I didn't already own a Kindle, I think it would be much harder to justify buying one as well as an iPad, since the iPad does serve as a capable ebook reader in most circumstances.
Summary:The iPad is beautiful, gorgeous device. It is, perhaps, one of the first true consumer computing devices -- excellent for content consumption (web, video, audio, books), Superb for one-on-one presentations (demos, photos!!!, presentation slides) but with only mimited use for content creation (writing, spreadsheet work, image manipulation). The jury is still out on games, but I expect a slew of great real-time strategy games in the near future. There are some seriously rough edges and oversights, especially when synching and sharing documents. Yet, in light of what's available today, the iPad is still a truly wonderful casual computing device that I recommend to anyone.Exterior:I admit it: I'm a sucker for design. Holding the iPad for the first time was an exhilarating feeling. It's simply beautiful. Glass, Metal, Black. Perfect heft, perfect dimensions. The gentle curve of the backplate. Put simply: the iPad simply *feels* right.The iPad is roughly the size of a US magazine ( 30 cm (12 inch) across, of which 24 cm (9.7 inch) are touch screen. i.e. somewhat smaller than A4). It's weight lies somewhere between surprisingly hefty and optimal (this becomes somewhat of a liability when you read holding it single-handedly). The brushed aluminum backplate - it's much, much better than the iPod Touch's polished chrome, and feels better than the plastic from the iPhone.The outside is mostly clean, broken only for the dock and audio connectors, and a grand total of three buttons (volume, home, and screen lock -- the latter a welcome surprise). While the curved back looks great and certainly feels natural while holding it, I was afraid that it would somehow be wobbly when put on a flat surface. It's not.The only outside connectors are audio (the headphone connector also provides an integrated Mic connector), and the iPod dock connector. Unfortunately this means that there is also no SD or CF card connector, meaning that all such devices must interface with the iPad via an adapter. This is disappointing. Downright cheap is the fact that Apple chose not to include any headphones in the package. You may say what you want about those white earbuds (mostly agree that they are crap), but it's the thought that counts. At least I want the choice to discard them for myself.Hardware:The screen is just gorgeous, with astonishingly good viewing angles. It's bright enough to read outside (except in direct sunlight), and the colors are crisp and vibrant. The screen is glossy, which unfortunately reflects light too easily (significant glare). The glass surface is allegedly oleophobic (i.e. it supposedly is 'fingerprint-resistant'), but as you might expect it does pick up fingerprints quickly. They do wipe off easily, though. The 4:3 aspect ratio is great for showing off photos and presentations, but HD videos will display with black bars.My unit came with 64 GB, *without* 3G/GPS. Unfortunately, to me, 64 GB is way too little storage (we do a lot of photography, and my camera alone holds a 32 GB chip). I would have preferred 256 or more GB storage.Speaking of cameras - the iPad has none built in, which may disappoint many people who would have expected it. I don't really miss it, but suspect that Apple will soon incorporate one into one of the next versions.One annoyance is the fact that there is only one dock connector and only one headphone jack - both on the short edge. The iPad can double as a picture frame, and I would have loved to use the iPad that way in landscape orientation when it's not in use. Alas, since it can only connect to the dock in portrait orientation, I'll have to wait until some inventive soul comes up with a solution (a landscape dock). I would have preferred if Apple had provided two dock connectors.The iPad comes with a built-in speaker wich may even be stereo. It sounds mono, tinny, and weak, but is noticeably louder than the puny little thing built into the iPod Touch. It may be loud enough to watch video on a plane, but definitely is enough to watch one on a train and car ride.The iPad comes with WiFi 802.11n - which is fast. Reception range is somewhat sub-par (compared with other WiFi devices), but is well within acceptable limits. It also has Bluetooth built-in, which I use to connect a wireless keyboard (nice touch: as soon as you connect the wireless keyboad, the on-screen one disappears. Even niceer, most common keyboard shortcuts work, and 'ESC' dismisses auto-completion. Annoyingly, the arrow keys usually do not work to choose an item in a pop-up menu)). I've also tried to connect a bluetooth headset (worked), and a mouse (no go).Finally, the dock connector has again undergone some changes. While I can connect the iPad to my car integration, some other 'built for iPod' Some iPod accessory devices work only in limited fashion: while they are able to access sound and some are able to remote-control it, they won't charge the iPad. [Update: it appears that these devices do charge the iPad, but only when it is turned off, otherwise the power drain is too great]Finally, the iPad has an ambient light sensor so that it can dim the screen in dark rooms, and increase brightness when there is more light.Using the iPad.Immediately when using the iPad, you'll face one glaringly disruptive obstacle. You must sync your iPad to a Mac or Wintel PC, and you must synch it to iTunes. Even worse, you must synch via USB. This issue comes up later again (when using the seriously flawed file sharing).The large touch screen and instantaneous response to touch make this device immensely usable and enjoyable. Few things are as satisfactory as going over a design or photo spread with a client or famly member and be able to touch, flick, pinch, and zoom in on details. Same goes for maps and other visual interaction. Of note: for some businessws this is an integrated presentation device that is hard to beat in price/performance.The home screen interface is a curiously sparsely populated grid of 4 x 5 apps, which looks plain silly. Either the app icons should be larger, or you should be able to pack more icons on a page. As with the iPod Touch/iPhone you can flip though multiple pages of apps.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with overall usage is that the iPad is tied to a single person. In a household or small office where many items are shared, I would have liked to have small 'personal corner' for email and some other things (playlists etc.) that was only accessable to specific users.iTunes (desktop)As with the iPhone you must synch the iPad before you can use it (really annoying). You can only synch it to one iTunes account. App management is similar to the iPhone: drag the apps to arrange them in screens. Integration is tight and works reasonably fast. My initial synch took well over 30 minutes, but that was mostly due to large amounts of data being transferred (50 GB of music and images). Synching data (documents) with your desktop clearly shows the limits of iTunes here. It's a painful, difficult, and entirely unintuitive process, using one of the most braindead file sharing metaphors ever envisioned. Apple must improve this immediately.The iTumes/iPad apps on the iPad are a strange mixture of the iPod and Mac interface. One big disappointment is that neither (iTunes nor the iPod app) can open shared Libraries on the WLAN. In an environment like a home or office it makes sense to store all digital media on a central repository and have external devices access it. We do it at home and in the office. Yet, the iPad can't access these Libraries but must download them.The iPad comes with fewer standard Apps than the iPhone, of which i feel that Mail, Safari, Maps, and Photos are the most important ones (the Bookstore is currently not available in Switzerland where my account is tied to).Mail is a curiously mixed bag. It's definitely great to read emails, and you can see your inbox down the left side of your screen. Still, as with the iPod/iPhone version, you can't get a unified view of all inboxes, only that of the currently open account. Writing emails is trying at best - better than on the iPhone, but to me the lack of integration with other content creation apps makes writing emails something taht you'd only do for short messages. Using the on-screen keyboard is good enough in landscape orientation for that.Safari (Internet) is glorious. No Adobe Flash support, as everyone knows, and unlike with the iPhone, it hurts much more on the iPad. Other than that, though, speed, and 'touch-surfing' make it a thoroughly rewarding experience. The bigger screen (compared to the iPhone) suddenly transforms the touch/multi-touch interface from a good concept to a great experience. Pages load and render quickly, but by no means are rendered as fast as on my desktop. Which is usually ok with me, as 'slower' is relative, and fast enough for me.The Maps application has gained a new terrain topology mode. As with Safari, the increased screen estate makes all the difference. While the iPhone/iPod Touch was a stop-gap measure, the iPad's map app is simply great. Now, my iPad has no GPS (unlike those that come with G3), so it has to rely on inprecise triangulation of WiFi hotspots. That being said, I envision that the GPS-equipped iPad will give dedicated GPS devices a run for their money, including aviation and maritime navigation. I wish my (admittedly old) Garmin Pilot III had only a fraction of the map capabilities of Maps.Photos... Well, I have to admit that I was stunned. Photos simply look great. And since I work in image processing, i'm not easily impressed. As I said before, taking images and presenting them to your client on the iPad is something close to magic. Unfortunately, as before, iTunes appears to downsample images, which I really, really hate. But all in all, the iPad is a supreme presentation device. I'd also love to be able to directly download photos from my camera into the iPad (Apple has announced such a device). However, since my camera uses 32 GB storage, the iPod would be filled much too quickly in it's current configurationThe other apps to me are rather insignificant (Video, Contacts, YouTube), with the exception of Calendar. But after trying to enter two new entries into that app, I've decided to not ever talk about that experience again until Apple significantly enhances that clunker of interface.App StoreAgain, the App store is a killer feature. It gives you access to a great selection of software that you can purchase and download in seconds. The iPad is compatible with software written for the iPod Touch/iPhone - in a way. Those apps either run in a tiny space at the center of the screen, or in '2x' enlarged mode. Unfortunately, '2x' is actually '4x' more, as each pixel is doubled both horizonatlly and vertically, giving the application a blocky, perhaps even retor '80s look.I did not (could not) download the eBook reader application - but did not have to, as there are other readers already available in the App store. Now, there are dedicated eBooks reader (Amazon's own Kindle) available. I have no idea ghow the iPad compares to those devices, ad I don't own one. But I *can* say that reading books on the iPad is definitely enjoyable, even though youi can't really do it single-handedly. The kicker, though, is that were able to bring all our documentation (in PDF) onto the iPad, and now always have it available in a nicely readable way. This alone makes the iPad worth the cost. The iPad still lacks a way to print, though.Dedicated iPad apps can be great. As with the iPhone version of the store, usability, price, and quality vary greatly. Generally the price point is above that of iPhone apps (curently Apps range from $10-$45). Purchasing an App is quick, seamless, and works great. Once you purchased an App, it starts downloading and installing by itself. Should a download be discontinued due to loss of network or any other unforseen event, it picks up where it left off as soon as the iPad reconnects to the Internet. Once installed, it is immediately usable. Once you sync the iPad to iTunes, the purchased App becomes available to all other devices that are synched to that account (provided, of course, they can run it). That way, if you already have an iPhone or iPod Touch, you can immediately use Apps that you already purchased - some of which have built-in iPad modes.SDKThe seriously geeky or technologically advanced can download the SDK to roll their own apps. Caveat emptor, though: You must have an Intel-based Mac to use it, have OSX 10.6 (or later) installed. The SDK relies on Apple's XCode integrated development environment. The initial leraning curve is steep, and people not used to Objective-C will at first feel bewilderd. That being said, Cocoa-Touch's framework is comprehensive, extensively documented, and well worth exploring if you are interested in such things. You don't even need an iPad to test your code, as the SDK provides an iPad simulator. In order to install your own apps on your iPad, however, you must be a registered developer (yearly fee required).All in all, the iPad is a great device. It has some decidedly rough edges (synching), and curios omissions (camera, SD slot). While built-in memeory at 64 GB is still on the low side for me, the overall computing experience is currently top-of-the class. The iPad won't replace a fully-blown computer (laptop, desktop) when it comes to heavy-duty content creation. But from what I see it wasn't designed for that (the iWork apps are ill suited for that task). When it comes to content consumption, the iPad is glorious, and in a class of it's own.Pros- drop-dead beautiful device- killer touch interface. Currently nothing comes near in terms of usability- App store- incredibly long battery life- unbelievably crisp screen- best mobile web browsing experience around (flash incompatibility notwithstanding)- Can use iPhone/iPod Touch apps (albeit some only in tiny or enlarged 2x mode)- Apps like Photo, Maps really come into their own with increased screen size- 802.11n networking and bluetooth (latter with ad-hoc networking)- SDKCons- no webcam, GPS only for GSM enabled iPads, no removable storage (SD slot), no direct USB support- 64 GB limit- battery built in- no Adobe Flash support in Safari- can't connect to shared iTunes libraries, no wirelss synching- no headphones (some may say this is a feature)- single-user mode only- no printing- worst filesharing ever- screen glare- must sync to iTunes
I know that I need to put a more detailed review of my iPad into this forum. I am just a little angry about how bad and good this product is. Before deciding to buy, Google iPad sync problems. There are many problems and they are real. I have had to restore my iPad at least 6 times to get it to work and right now it is a paper weight. It does not synch with my latest edition Dell laptop. No music. No apps. I will update this review at a later point and hopefully it gets better at some point in the future.Beware. Their are issues that are major with syncing with iTunes. When it does work it's great. Right now it is not working.
Five years ago I didn't believe that Apple had anything more significant to offer than a fancy MP3 player. Apple computers are still a novelty to at least some degree,  and I fully accept that. The iPhone is what led me to believe that Apple had the potential to change the landscape if mobile computing. The iPad is something I have been waiting for since I unwrapped my iPhone. The idea of a larger screen mixed with a seductively beautiful and wildly simple user interface made me ready to throw my laptop out the second the iPad was announced in San Francisco. The iPad is not perfect, but in my experience no computing product has ever achieved that distinction. Upon unwrapping the device the customer is struck by the familiar face of an iPod Touch enlarged to dramatic proportions. This visual has become one of the most harsh criticisms which the iPad has had to endure. Apple has a knack for innovation wrapped within the familiar. Upon a quick sync with iTunes the home screen opens with the sparse series of apps most familiar to owners of the first generation iPod Touch: Settings, iPod, Photos, iTunes, calendar, YouTube, mail and contacts, maps and the app store. The look and feel of each of these apps is considerably more expansive and longtime owners of iPhones will instantly fee an almost palpable sense of freedom as their fingers have space to explore, to touch the giant virtual buttons Apple presents.  When connected to Wi-fi the user is able to begin expanding their library of apps through the App Store. Thus brings me to one of my primary concerns with the iPad, price inflation. My first purchase was Angry Birds HD, an app which slides in at a wallet-crunching 6 dollars considering the gameplay is nothing more than flinging little birds against large structures to destroy little green pigs. One finds that 90 percent of iPad apps suffer from this rampant price inflation which will leave most users groaning. I have hope for the iPad app store, however despite the rampant sales of the iPad it is at best a niche product, thus the so-called "gold rush" for ipad exclusive apps might be somewhat overplayed.  From a hardware standpoint the iPad is just as capable and well-developed as any piece of Apple hardware. The touchscreen is responsive and the screen is bright and vivid. The keyboard requires a learning curve and if you have never used a touchscreen Apple product you have a long road ahead of you. I personally had little problem with it (I composed this review on my iPad). Finally, a note about iBooks. The iBook store has a beautiful format an reading is a pleasure. The major issue arises from the lack of selection at the time of this writing. This problem can be fixed with the Kindle app from Amazon which brings the robust library of Amazon to an equally attractive and comparable E-Reader to their flagship Kindle device. The battery life allows for a vast amount of tasks to be performed on a single charge, including games, video and other tasks which would typically be considered very draining on battery. As I have already mentioned, e iPad as a device is not perfect, but it makes an excellent companion and you'll soon find your laptop collecting dust.
This tablet did not live up to all the hype for me to be completely happy.  I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.  I am looking into the Gigabyte M912x Notebook Umpc 160g 8.9" Touchnote Mr or the Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook (Black).  They're around the same price point and have  touchscreens that swivels to fold into a tablet and then fold back into a netbook for protection.You buy an Apple product for the cool apps and this device is no different.  I love the concept of the gadget but need it to perform more work to justify the purchase to myself.  I do not need another media device.  I have my fingers crossed that the 2nd generation will be better.
First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips.  I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc.  What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user.  I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices.  There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for.  I purchased a game "Super Monkey Ball 2" for iPad and it looks and plays great!  I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good.  Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me.  Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie.  Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads "Safari Cannot open page  because the server stopped responding". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection.  Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem.  Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release.  It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection.  It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads "not charging".  I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem.  I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users.  The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read.  It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger.  If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection.  When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in.  The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from.  The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol  I have also used the internet radio while in the shower.  You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast.  Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations.  I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest "Batman" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off.  I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed.  However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it.  Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad.  You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens.  I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual.  the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting.  You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button.  The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change.  If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop.  Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook.  For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are.  Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing.  Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed "OMG" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted "OMB".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word "gay" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.  If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.
First if you want the quick sumery here it is. Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.The good...- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.The Bad...- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.Overall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.
I received my new iPad this past week and have been exploring the capabilities. I have to agree that the iPad is a very impressive device. I've only used my iPad with my home wireless network, but I anticipate that will I use it for casual browsing and reading more than my laptop. For more detailed browsing, correspondence, etc., the iPad is not really a practical alternative to the laptop. The iPad is well suited for the social networking functions with some nice apps for accessing Facebook, Twitter, etc. For those who are considering purchasing an iPad, I recommend it for entertainment use though it is not an essential product for the average computer user.
**this is my first Apple product to own** I purchased the 32GB wifi version of the Apple Ipad. I did not purchase it for any other reason than for entertainment purposes, and for that it fufills everything I expected of it. I'm happy that I did not purchase the 3G version, because it was simple to tether to my 3G cell phone for free. Simple couple steps that saved me a couple hundred dollars. Also purchasing a ton of apps, and putting almost a thousand songs on the built in Ipod I haven't needed to think twice about the memory. Unless you download tons of movies, I wouldn't suggest to anybody purchase anything bigger than the 32GB version. I've come to realize most of the complaints that you hear about the Ipad are easily worked around (multi-tasking, flash player, etc).Pros:(1) the USER INTERFACE(!!!) is something that no "ipad-killer" (which by the way, you know you're with the right company with every other companies product is advertised as a "Ipod killer".. "Iphone killer".. "Ipad killer"..) haha, I mean lets be real, no consumer cell phone has ever "killed" the Iphone, Ipod, nor will any consumer product kill the Ipad nor come close.(2) the WOW FACTOR(!!!) everytime you're in public with this bad boy you'll get a ton of "ohhhhs" and "ahhhhs" which is definitely cool.(3) fast, responsiveCons:(1) expensive, but the cool factor helps(2) expensive(3) kind of stuck to the Apple world of Apps unless you jailbreak your device. not suggested, but i've never had any issues with my jailbroken device.(4) 70% of App Store apps are paid versus 30% of Android Market appsAll in all, I love my Ipad. Wouldn't take it back for the world! ENJOY!
I love the iPad, but I bought this using a gift certificate thinking it was the 64GB Wifi 3G. It was priced just a little bit more than the one on the apple store, but be careful.  This one is not 3GGGGGGGG, but its $130 MORE than Apple sells it! I should have been paying more attention, but this is the first time Amazon was soooo far over the price elsewhere. I was stunned. Learned a very good lesson.
I cant help but think the Ipad is a glorified Iphone but love its ability to play media and be used as a book reader.  The big negative for me is the inability to see any Flash product and all those web sites that run FLASH. I know Apple hates FLASH but really if you cant see thousands of web sites and the product is designed to browse the web I cant help but feel the customer has been placed into this fight and for $700 dollars I think it serves to only upset apple customers. I wish they would fix this and quick.  I don't want a $700 book reader or DVD player.
I travel several times a year and have wanted something significantly lighter than my MacBook Pro. The iPad easily fit in my shoulder bag for the flight. Very useful for a nine hour flight. The UI is excellent.The apps that I need are available and work quite well.Any drawbacks that I might mention are that many of the iPhone app developers have yet to configure theirapps for the iPad. So, we use iPhone version apps on the iPad. As far as functionality is concerned, there is no difference. The graphics aren't as crisp as the ones made for the iPad though.Next, is the keyboard. If you already have an iPhone, there's nothing to this. It's actually a bit better than the phone'skey board. My one request is that it be a bit bigger.Lastly, Flash will come in handy when it finally arrives on the iPad. There are rumors that a generic Flash softwarewill appear soon.I am very happy with my purchase. My iPad works well in cafes, the train, planes, hotel rooms, anywhere. You cancache a lot of web content on it so it isn't terribly necessary to have the 3G connection. The games are great as wellas the Kindle and iBook apps.
First, as some background, I am not a so called "Apple" person. I think I might be the only person that does not own an iPhone or any other Apple product. However, I was looking for a netbook and was intrigued by the iPad. I checked it out in the store and then went to a friend's house to play around with his. I was sold when I saw the Netflix app whereby you could stream your instant queue. I also thought the user interface was incredibly easy. So easy that I am planning on getting one for my mom who has never used a computer.I have been using it for 2 weeks now and the device is doing everything I would want from checking email to surfing the Internet. I am also watching television and movies on it and trying out the different apps. I have actually taken it to the store now because the epicurious app is great and I just shop for the recipes in the store. The only downside and the loss of 1 star is the lack of a front facing camera. I would have like to be able to use Skype on this device and most netbooks have this capability. I am sure Apple will put this in the next version and will certainly upgrade when that happens.
I've been playing with my iPad for about a week and am very satisfied with it. As people here have noted, it's not a replacement for a laptop, although the ability to download iWorks in an iPad version does help there. For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me. Other user's experience may vary. Whichever way you decide, good luck with decision!
Guess I'm not the only PC-loving fan that bought the iPad.  Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable & light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music & moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.  It does the job fine.
Ive had both Kindle 1 and 2, and the 'Pad as I call it, blows them away with reading.  iBooks has adjustable brightness, so it is every bit as easy on the eyes when done right.  I am now reading all the time!  Reading is the tip of the iceberg though, the Apps make this thing soooo awesome!
As with many Apple products, the form factor of the iPad is amazing and what is does, it does incredibly well. There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros: -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking "Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99."  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a "go back to your previous app" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.  Takes practice and a good aim!
FIRST, THIS IS A PERSONAL  "USE" REVIEW.  IT IS NOT A "SPECS" REVIEW. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "SPECS" REVIEW, THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR YOU.  THERE ARE A LOT OUT THERE.Having said that, ..........I love my IPAD!!!!!!It is so much smaller than a notebook and so much thinner than a netbook.On top of that, I use my iPad alot for web surfing, emailing, watching movies, and reading while on the elliptical at the gym.  Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.No other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone.I'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. Ijust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close toipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having saidthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.
Steve Jobs states that 'FLASH crashes and is buggy on the iPad'. Instead of blaming Flash, Steve, just admit that the problem is with the iPad not being able to handle Flash, and not t'other way round. The processing power of the iPad is just fine for most things, but it's just too slow for full-on Flash applications and movies. Don't blame already proven and successful technology for not working on something you've made that is technically inadequate. It reminds me of when children say, 'I can do that too, I just don't feel like doing it!'What Steve Jobs doesn't want to utter, is that the iPad just isn't powerful enough to do everything we want it to.Let's also not forget that such decisions are driven by the need to protect Content Revenue. Instead of delivering a product that you'd fully enjoy using, the only thing on Steve's mind is 'How much can we squeeze out of the punters on this one?' Okay, he's in business, and profits must be made, but if the profits are more important than user satisfaction, why should anyone feel any kind of loyalty to such a brand?If you've already bought the first-version iPad, you may love it, but there will of course be countless others who'll feel cheated not far down the line, when a much more powerful version is launched. Apple play the same trick time-after-time. Release the Basic Version, and when all the hype and sales start to slow, release a much better version that should and could have been released in the first place. This is because Apple knows that those who bought the basic version are so in love with Apple, they will happily fork-out for the better version too. One user - two sales. Cunning.In my opinion, Apple are happy to take advantage of almost fanatical loyalty and snob-factor in it's users to make an extra buck. Some may be proud to be an Apple Nut, but they're being taken advantage of in a very clever and cunning way. Style over Functionality.Steve; beef-up the processor, include a camera, memory slot and I/O ports, and stop this childish excuse for an excuse for not including Flash. Just be honest about it - your iPad isn't capable of running Flash. Not yet..
I do miss FLASH sometimes but all in all this is the best device from Apple. Mine never leaves my side :) I bought the WiFi version and three days later upgraded to the 3G. I like to have the option to use it when I choose and because of the GPS function. I could careless about the absence of a camera. Originally I was going to wait for the second generation but I am so happy with my device.
Apple, as usual and with the help of every single media outlet in the world, produced a whole lot of hype around the iPad. I was one of those who wasn't really into getting one, because it frankly looked like an oversized iPod Touch with no other purpose than to browse the web and get email. I already own an iPhone and a BlackBerry, as well as a MacBook Pro. Why would I need an iPad for?For a lot of things, it seems. Thing is, iPad is just a medium in development and we are still not fully certain of its whole potential. But there are several things which come to mind:- Netbook killer: You would really think of writing a 2100-word essay on a netbook? Not unless you want to develop a severe neck strain and a bad back; so netbooks were originally designed for light web surfing and email, you know, the kind of stuff you don't really need high horsepower for. Now, let's say you have a product which will help you in getting to the Web, using your email and twitter without the hassles of turning on a PC.- Media center: iPod helped us in getting music everywhere. iPad is for helping us get our content everywhere, such as movies (it's great for flights), TV shows and videos. After you get an iPad, you will think that turning a laptop on to watch an episode of Mad Men you downloaded from iTunes will be silly.- Magazine and newspaper delivery: Looking at what organizations such as the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have done with iPad, this is a very serious contender for becoming the de facto way of distributing content currently on paper. I don't think Kindle (sorry Amazon) can match it.- Casual internet use: You just want to read [...] on your lap while you're waiting to aboard your plane, or just want to relax on the sofa or on the bed reading stuff online. iPad is perfect for that, and it also makes you wonder why people bring their laptops to bed.- It will help many senior citizens get acquainted with technology and will make them lose any fears or intimidation they might have about computers.çI don't think iPad is by any means a substitute for a laptop, but it will inspire users to confine them for mere productive activities. I think of iPad as the middle ground between a smartphone and a laptop, and I believe, just like with the iPhone, that Apple gave developers a white canvas so they can develop their work and ideas giving this device new uses and possibilities.
I wouldn't be without my iPad.My wife liked it so much I had to buy her one of her own.Now we both would not be without our iPads.It has even changed the way we both read and buy books as well as magazines.I am a personal trainer and I take it with me to the gym and record my clients workouts on one of the many fitness apps.
I got the iPad for Christmas and I am completely addicted now.  My only complaint is the fact that it is not compatible with Flash, which really degrades the web surfing experience.  Apple - get with the program and add flash compatiblity!  That would have gotten you 5 stars from me.  Aside from that issue the iPad rocks.  Solid battery life, great e-reader, and perfect for gaming and watching movies.
I just bought my 64gb Ipad.  Setup was extremely easy, and I must admit it exceeded my expectations.  I bought this through Verizon and got the mi wfifi.  I will update after a month to let you know if I still love it.
Actually I got this as a gift from my lovely wife. I love it.Kids:Warning, your kids will try and steel your iPad. My son is addicted to YouTube and my daughter loved the Dora Coloring app. We also play games together. I have to remind the kids that the iPad is actually dad's.Books:I wasn't so into reading books on a Kindle because of the cost. I didn't think I would like reading on the iPad as much as I have. I got the Kindle app, which has all the Kindle books that you can get for your iPad. I'm reading a lot more because of it. This is mostly becasue I have these books with me all the time and sometimes I wouldn't thing to bring a book and them would be in the mood to read.Games:There as some really fun games on the iPad. Some of these I played a lot on the iPone but are so much better on the larger screen. Civilization is one of them. It is great. I also like the Plant vs Zobbies.Music/Movies:Just like the iPhone, it is great having all your music/movies at your disposal. The iPad is great on a plane.
This was an early Christmas present for my family and we all love it already.  My wife and kids are already asking when the one with the camera will come out, but it is as easy to use as the iPhone for a luddite like myself.  I thought I would find the popup keyboard annoying but it really does give you such a Star Trek sensation that it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.  You know how to use it because you've seen Spock use one a hundred times himself.  I have only downloaded a couple of free apps so far (including the Kindle app as, just like the commercial, it means I can read books I downloaded on my Kindle to it) and bought a book from the iBookstore to test the reading.  I know the Kindle is supposed to be better on my eyes but I really liked the full-color display and the page-turning function as it was a real novelty.  Twenty pages in, I found it a little annoying and missed my "Next Page" button on my Kindle, but I'm sure I'll grow accustomed to it.
Awesome tablet! I was skeptical at first, because I've never been an apple fanboy. This is only my 2nd apple product. But needless to say, this definitely won't be my last. It will not replace my laptop/desktop for big tasks, but when I leave the house this iPad always goes with me. I got the wifi version, so no 3G experience, but the wireless signal is almost always great. I can't type quite as fast on this as I can on my laptop, but I can bring this anywhere and battery life is awesome. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about it. Awesome product, and I am typing this review on it right now.Thanks for reading. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask.
This is a great device for browsing the web (non flash pages of course), emailing, listening to music, playing games, watching movies, etc. This is not intended to replace a desktop or laptop. I personally have an iMac and iPhone and needed something in between without spending $1000 on a macbook. For $500 i have a device i can travel with and use for all of the above functions quickly with ease. Ive had an iPhone from the very beggining and one thing i can say for certain is that apple will always push out updates to improve their products. rumors of the next update promise a printing feature (which you can do now with an app) as well as folders to stay organized :) can't wait! Bottom line, it is what it claims to be.
The only Mac I have ever owned was a lipstick.I am afraid of the Ipod, I own the cheapest phone because I lose my phone about twice a year.August 12, 2010 I received a gift that changed my life... My Ipad!I have no idea what the other reviewers are saying?  All I can say is that this is amazing!  I cruise the internet check email and now spend a ton of money on "apps".  My only complaint is that I can not see some videos on "you tube".  If you have the money and you are curious buy one.  Surprisingly my 4 yr old loves using the iPad and there are a bunch of educational apps.  I am not a video game parent my kids dont even watch main stream TV and I am in love with the activities available.  For some reason my 4 yr old figured out how to use the iPad with out much guidance.
ok first things first, if you say that the ipad is just a jumbo ipod touch you ave probably never used one. it has awsome picture quality, its fast, and easier for children to use and have them enjoy it because of its size and not worrying about them droping it because its too big for them to hold, so they'd have to lay it down to use it. i let my little brothers use it and they have never droped it and they love the size of the screen, they like using it more than their ipod touch's. i use it for email, texting and phone calls, yes phone calls, you just need skype or a phone app like i use, plus you wont look rediculos because it uses the microphone and the speaker so its like a conference call. sound quality is great, i love watching my HD movies with my friends and its real HD not like the fakey HD the ipod touch has. my parents and my old folks like to lay it down on their laps to use it because they complain that they cant hold it because they cant grip it (they are 85 years old of course they cant grip anything). my friends like that you can change the background if you want unlike the ipod touch where its the boring black all the dang time, mine is the family reunion photo. which reminds me you can put real photos on the ipad like old photographs from way back when. and there is no wrong way t hold it, even on the menu screen, just tilt it in the direction you want and it'l adjust for you, it comes handy when you have a group of people and you don't want to pass it around. this ipad is definitly worth the money, because it has internet, movies, music, tv, phone, text, email, games, your photos, your videos, books, and educational things for the little kids.(PS. excuse my spelling i have a C+ in english >:( i cant spell word i never use)
The iPad lives up to the hype. I was a skeptic myself, but after owning apple products the past two years, I knew the company would live up to my expectations.  It is in no way just a large iPhone.I purchased the iPad 32gb wifi version and quickly began loading apps and movies. I also jail broke my version and am writing this review on the iPad itself!So far, I've noticed that the iPad is extremely efficient.The safari pages load quicker than my iPhone 3G and the apps open very fast.The clarity is unbelievable.  I think it's even clearer than my MacBook!The battery life is impressive.  I know it will withstand my 5+ hour flights from Boston to LA.  I watched a two hour movie this evening and played around with it for an additional few hours and my battery is at 56%.I was surprised at how great the volume level actually is. I expected it to not be that great, but when I was watching the movie earlier, I did not use headphones and found the sound quality perfect.  Additionally, the iPad does not emit any noise when processing.Apps:I just dropped a lot of cash on my iPad so I am not willing to spend money on apps yet.  I've explored the free ones exclusively.iBooks has me wowed.  Apple offers an array of free novels to meet anyone's taste.  Classics are my liking and I've loaded at least 15 of them.  You can bookmark your pages and skip chapters or browse.  I was impressed by how easy it is to read on the screen as well. I've never been a fan of reading on a computer, but this app opened my eyes to another world. I like having the ability to change the font size to meet my needs.Bloomberg did a great job of creating an app that offers financial news and personalization. I can track my stocks, track indices, and listen to podcasts.  I can't think of a more informative app out there.Installous. Everything your little hacker heart desires.  If you like installous on your iPhone, you'll appreciate it on your iPad.***********Edit:  Downside found!  Charging this device can be a pain.  I just hooked it up with a USB to my work computer (PC) and, the top right hand corner reads "not charging."  Apple's website states the following:"Some USB 2.0 ports and accessories do not provide enough power to charge iPad. When this occurs the message "Not Charging" appears in the status bar next to the battery icon."Be that as it may, other websites are claiming the Ipad still charges even though the screen states otherwise.  I haven't tested it out myself.  This link provides further details:[...]
The iPad 16 gb wifi only is the best value for money in the iPad series. The screen display is absolutely gorgeous as well as the overall finishing quality of the product. Internet browsing, checking multiple mail accounts, watching videos and pictures, listening songs or just spending loads of time playing games and trying out loads n loads of fun filled applications is just an out of this world experience. Ofcourse you can't compare the ipad to a regular pc or a laptop (when it comes to heavy document or graphic processing) but for everything else specially while being on the move there's the iPad.
I have the 16 GB Wifi iPad, and I absolutely love it! It's amazing what you can do with it! I have photos, music, mucic videos, games, Pages, Keynote, iBooks and more on it, and I still have over 12.5 GB of free space left! It's awesome! A must buy! This is way better then any netbook, and I'm a HP fan! And the volume on here is really awesome too! The only thing that isn't so awesome about the iPad is the price. I think it should be $400.00. But still, don't let the price stop you from owning this amazing device!
I have spent more than a week using the iPad and have found many pros and cons which should be considered before purchasing one.Pros: -The opening and closing of applications is very fast making the device very responsive.Watching Youtube video is very much better and clearer than on a PC or iMac.  Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook & internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called "DocsAnywhere" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.Conclusion: -For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible. The brightness overcomes this issue while the device is on.  I have certainly enjoyed using the device and will for the foreseeable future.
When these first came out, I could not decide if I was going to get one. A friend showed me theirs and I was hooked. Have had mine a few weeks now and have to say I love it. But, I love my iPhone, so why wouldn't I. I really see the iPad as a big iPhone. The only thing that I don't like about my iPhone is the size if the screen... well that has now been taken care of. But there is more... I am finding I can use this in meeting and I don't have to take my laptop in. Reading books is great because they are in color, something my wife's Kindle cannot do. I can watch videos to and from work as I ride the bus. For someone that commutes, this is a dream come true.Now there are issues and a new product like this will always have some. I have not had the issue with the wifi problem. It needs a stylus. I want to be able to write notes and this is not going to happen with my finger. Camera would have been nice and when the multitasking comes around this fall, that will be a nice addition. More drive space or a slot for some kind of memory card should have been there, this is a real issue with me, but other than that, I am very happy and really enjoy my iPad.
I don't understand all the negative reviews commenting on connectivity. My husband has no problem with staying connected with his iPad. I on the other hand cannot keep my less than 3 year old MacBook connected in the same room as his iPad. It is driving me crazy. We are using Airport. I had this problem before the iPad came into the house. Anyway my husband loves his iPad and says there is not one thing he would change about it, at least not now.
Caution: Ipad does not support Video playlist of any kind (music video/ podcast/ tv shows), means you can not configure to play 10 video clips to play one after another(it works just fine on Iphone) which also means when you are playing video forward button will never work...Got it on first day and usually using it every day, have iphone too, other than most of the usual known issues and features here are some which will help you to make a right decision...Ipad is perfect to watch a video...a video looks way better than any laptop you have...Speakers are low yes its true, I was expecting it to be little louder than iphone but it seems its just marginalFlickr/facebook all works so beautifully, this is a perfect device to show your picture portfolioused Slingplayer (iphone edition) and can say it works awesome with dishtv and slingbox solo, very clear...I use google newsreader for news and it works just fine (i dont like other newspaper apps very little content)Calender is looking good though event detail opens in very small screen which means not using the full screen available to display appointment better(iphone does)...appointment forward feature is not supported (iphone has same issue), any link (say for attending webmeeting) is not supported to click, means you have to copy the link test and open in safari to start webmeeting (iphone supports clicking http links directly) last snooze feature is not supported (iphone does not do it either and i hate iphone for not doing it, not sure how many times i missed a meeting because of that)Jump app is perfect for remote desktop...I would say just superb, I usually attend all my web meeting (ofcourse on flash) with that...audio transfer to IPAD works just fine, use it to access all office documents as wellOutlook mails do not get auto refresh, probably to save battery life (bad move from apple and I hate that)Netflix works superb though crash sometimes if you try to move fingers on screen when movie is playingMoving apps from iphone to ipad is breezeyoutube works very fine though playlist is still not supportedI am not looking to get 3G edition cause dont want to be bound by single carrier and 3g limitation (will buy cradlepoint PHS3000 travel router and use any usb modem with it to create wifi with 4G bandwith, it will save ipad battery life and allows 16 wifi devices, make sure you go for 4G version (hardware rev2 cost around $140))Ibooks/kindle both works very fine no issues here(well i am not a bigtime reader as well)Comics are just superb on IPAD...
Since the day I have received my iPad, I have yet to dig out my 17inch HP laptop to use.  I have also cut down on the use of my quad intel core Dell pc desktop, which I use to use everyday like clockwork.  It is far more handy and quicker to activate and get online than my old laptop or pc, which take far longer to startup and go, the iPad is a punch and go device for me and very convenient to use, it has a few drawbacks, like the lack of flash but to me that's no biggie anyhow, flash is mainly for the poor Porno geeks who can't get laid anyhow.  All in all, I love it, get one today!
I can't say enough good things about this!I received this as a birthday gift, and really didn't think I would have much use for it. I was so wrong. It has been wonderful, even if you just consider the entertainment value.  The apps available have been wonderful, and have provided hours of entertainment for everybody in the family.Last week I was using it in the kitchen.  I had a recipe up on the screen, and when I wasn't sure exactly how to chop up the fennel, I put on a youtube video.For work, I am able to access and read documents, and make changes/highlights on them. Very useful for lugging around files to meetings. If there is wireless available, I can check email, do web research, all fairly unobtrusively (esp. great for meetings that have gone off track!).I like the ease of use for travel--very good size for using on a plane. I will admit that I don't really like to edit documents with this, it is more of a reading tool for me, although the productivity apps seem to be getting better over time.
The iPad aka Giant Ipod Touch was known the be the iPhone's prototype prior to the iPhone's release. I don't feel like searching this truth, so believe it or not.I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and have been using my iPad since i purchased it 3 months ago. I am 2 months into deployment and all the while I was flying to arrive here, I have been using it on a daily basis. Continue 8 hour movie watching, music listening, and game playing. While there are modification options (ie. Jailbreaking), it will do the simple and basic tasks of execution, but ONLY to your liking and with the dependency of other software to achieve such goals.I was unable, and still am unable to update my OS to 4.X because of internet related issues overseas. However, with what I have now, I can only say I am satisfied. My screen has been scratched with the dust development in Shindand; I have used it in 105 DEG. F. while here and no issues! This is an outstanding piece of hardware to own, seeing the possibilities and modifications can be endless, despite what Apple INTENDS.I recommend the iPad for people who are familiar with Apple products and who want to be familiar with Apple products. I am an Apple lover and eat them when I get the chance. Good luck in your future purchasing!
I use a laptop every day, all day. When traveling, lugging around the laptop bag was a PITA. So, got the iPod Touch. Though it is sweet, it's just a bit too small for weekend travel fun.I bought it because I wanted a bigger screen than the touch and did not want a 5 minute boot up that a laptop has.iPad fills the bill...perfectly. Bigger than the touch, instant boot up and a fantastic, intuitive, easy interface. And it fits in my travel bag. Fits perfectly in between a laptop and a Touch. Love it. No regrets whatsoever...
I won't repeat what other reviewers already mentioned.  I would've given the iPad a 4 or 5 star except for the crippled Bluetooth.  The iPad CAN'T connect to a Bluetooth GPS nor your cellphone using dialup networking.  Why?  So you would buy a 3G version and pay monthly fees to AT&T; instead.  Big BOO to Apple for putting AT&T; ahead of it's customers.  Of course, if you have a cellphone that can act as a wifi router (like Win mobile, symbian with joikuspot, android 2.2) you can have the iPad use it, but this drains the battery significantly, unlike Bluetooth that can last the entire day.
I expected the iPad to perform an order-of-magnitude better than its contemporaries just as the iPhone did.  I was not disappointed.  The feel of it in my hands and the speed with which it responds when web-browsing are perfect.The big surprise came from the Apps.  The Wall Street Journal App works so well that I now still retrieve the paper WSJ from my sidewalk out of habit, but I set it aside and read it on the iPad instead.  Pictures on the iPad are also substantially better than viewing them on the iPhone (and most of mine were taken with the iPhone!)  But the biggest surprise was Netflix.  When Netflix first starting streaming movies using Flash on the web, that one application would bring my $3000 notebook computer to near melt-down temperature as the processor screamed.  Eventually it would crash before I finished watching a movie.  Many people decried the decision by Apple to avoid Flash on this device, saying it wouldn't be a player in the streaming market.  Well I can honestly tell you that the Netflix App works fantastically well on iPad - better than their web version, and better than the version that streams to my blueray player.  I've watched Netflix every night for the first time ever.The wifi range is no better, and maybe even a little worse than my iPhone on my current network - but that could be because of the router.  The wifi speed on the otherhand is fanstastic.  I've reached upto 4mbps on speed tests.  Maybe if I get a better router it will be even higher.Reading is a pleasure on my iPad.  The action (page turning or otherwise) is smooth and natural.  Some others have said they prefer the Kindle.  I tried the Kindle just the week before I got the iPad and I was shocked to find that it couldn't do many simple, obvious tasks like searching or definitions - let alone copy and paste into a browser for a wider websearch or to quote the text in a paper.  iPad does all of these things fantastically well.  I've had no trouble with eye strain/fatigue thus far and that's a good sign.In sum, the iPad fully lived up to my expectations and that's saying alot considering my discriminating taste when it comes to engineering; just see my other reviews if you don't believe me.  Apple in recent years has consistently delivered while their competition uses up goodwill with customers by delivering crap. (I'm looking at the tablet PC people here - as well as the cell phone and other 'gadget' companies.)  While they make 'smart phones' and 'gadgets' Apple delivers iPhones and iPads.  It feels good to believe in a company's reputation again.  I earnestly hope that continues.Drew LoPucki, Gainesville FL
The 3G looks the same as the wifi except for a black, plastic bar visible on the top and in the back of the device. Before buying the 3G, visit the apple site for the additional monthly data plans that you need to purchase. There are performance issues (restrictions) when the units switches from wifi to 3G so you might want to consider other options ... like getting the wifi version with other options out there like MiFi, MiWi or tethering.If you like the tablet and don't have to have an Apple, then there are also competing products that are coming into the market soon -- like the wePad and products from HP, Toshiba and Google.
The iPad has been the talk of the town since it's Apple created it however, it does not deserve the credit that most consumers give it. The iPad is a somewhat new Tablet computer that virtually serves no purpose with netbooks and compact notebooks. It is just another innovative idea that all Apple fan-boys and Bandwagon jumpers can rave about. While the technology is convenient on an iPod touch, once you double the size you would expect more. The iPad runs at a processor speed of 1.00ghz, which is the same speed my phone runs at. Another big disappointed is the iPad's incapability to run flash websites. It has the same apps as the iPod Touch and iPhone. The hard drive size on the iPad is also very disappointing, having the same size hard drives as the iPod Touch. The WiFi is faulty at times, but that is not to terrible of a problem. The price is also ridiculously high for what you're getting. Similar tablets, such as the Archos 5 lack the apps, but can do much more that the iPad can. Why pay around $800 for a tablet that can barely handle the tasks you would expect it to, when you could purchase a netbook, at less than half the price with a much large hard drive, much faster processor, and can do almost everything you would expect it to do? Well, I guess you have to pay for the name.
I expected the iPad to perform an order-of-magnitude better than its contemporaries just as the iPhone did.  I was not disappointed.  The feel of it in my hands and the speed with which it responds when web-browsing are perfect.The big surprise came from the Apps.  The Wall Street Journal App works so well that I now still retrieve the paper WSJ from my sidewalk out of habit, but I set it aside and read it on the iPad instead.  Pictures on the iPad are also substantially better than viewing them on the iPhone (and most of mine were taken with the iPhone!)  But the biggest surprise was Netflix.

I Bought it for my son who was two and a half when he got it.  He loved it from day one and the app store has so much to offer for the whole family specially for the children.  This product will save you allot of money and will help your chilled with computer use, reading, math,  other educational games which are free or very inexpensive.  I read the news in the morning using it.  I use it with my apple tv which is another great deal.
I love the iPad.It's such a versatile device that my wife, who hates tech grabs it, and my 3 year old crystal if she see's me taking it to work.I've used the Bluetooth keyboard with it and created documents with up to 30 pages of content.
This product is very intuitive and easy to use.  It is a great device and the portability makes it a must have.
I'm not a MAC user.That said, I realize the fervent, almost religious, zeal that those who have followed Apple technology have proselyted their virtues. (Some of the moments when releasing a product before engineering was done with it, notwithstanding.)However, I see the iPad as an offering where Apple attempted to get back to basics and fully accomplish a "design cycle." I'm impressed with the power and options of this machine. The clarity of the display and the intuitive nature of the touch screen were drawing qualities. I was up and running, and I mean effectively, right "out of the box" with just a few probing "trial and error" type checkouts. The "pop-up" touch screen keyboard is very good, for the size of the unit. I was pleasantly surprised at that. I got the iPad case, turned it sideways at an angle, and find I can type with relative speed (not as fast as a full size keyboard, but very quickly and adequately for the light, quick notes and composing I am doing on it.) As I've played around, I have seen other features come up, asked myself "what does that do?" and figured those out as well. One day I'll go back and review the instruction manual.But, where the notebooks were designed to fill a niche of portability, lighter than a laptop, but still with internet access and some minimal functionality, I see the iPad coming from the other direction, filling that same market segment.It's an iPod on steroids!I do see it replacing a couple of my devices. My calendar and contacts are going on, and I can see myself retiring my PDA. The music and media features will replace my iPod. And, the 3G feature I activated and found to be very useful on a recent vacation trip to stay connected, so no lugging my laptop through security on business trips.Nope. No speaker phone. I'll still need to carry a cellular phone. Otherwise, this would be the one-stop shop. As it is, that is notable to me as a drawback and a slice where a blackberry or other access-enabled device might still be a viable alternative.Just downloaded my first movie. Maybe I'm premature in writing this review. But, I expect that to be impressive as well. So, overall I rate it positively. A winner.
Devices like this make so much sense for the kind of light computing most of us do when we're away from the office.  And for reading, looking at pics, doing email, etc. this thing rocks.But it drives me crazy that Apple has waited so long to update this to iOS 4.  The iOS 4 features - which have been available for *months* on the iPhone - will finally bring multitasking, the ability to resume applications where you left off, and folders to the iPad.  These updates are merely small conveniences on the iPhone - which you use as a computer only for short periods when you're out running around or whatever.  They're extremely important to the iPad's credibility as a device which you'd like to use as much as possible instead of lugging around a laptop or being chained to a desk.  I still use the iPad a lot if I'm going to be focused on one application for a long time.  But life is often messier than that, so I actually end up switching to my much-too-teeny-tiny iPhone more than I'd like because it's got more flexible functionality.Devices like the iPad are definitely the way forward for light computing, and Apple has done a great job on developing this product.  But it's not quite done - it's pretty freakin' irritating that Apple has taken so long to meet this obvious need to update to the greater flexibility of iOS 4.2.p.s.  The only other thing I'd change is to up the resolution of the screen to iPhone 4 levels.  Don't get me wrong, the iPad's display is gorgeous.  But the nature of the device is that you hold it *closer* than a laptop.  Resolutions that would be really great at laptop screen distance are a bit grainy at handheld distance.  Which means that you feel like you're reading on a computer instead of looking at something that looks like a printed page.  I've noticed that although the iPhone 4 has too small a screen to read really long books comfortably, the crisp text resolution makes it more comfortable than you'd think for reading.p.p.s.  I couldn't give a bleep about a camera/facetime.  Kind of a cool concept, but until our nation has much faster broadband, it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Yes, my experience is that AT&T; is the pits - slow 3G, slow home broadband, and truly stone-age customer service.  Just what you'd expect from a de facto monopoly service provider!
I did a lot of research and even played with a few iPads before making my purchase, so I was not too surprised by its performance. I mainly got this because I can't wait another 2-? years for my job to decide how they're going to let us carry electronic publications. The iPad works great for that function, especially using GoodReader which I find to be superior to iBooks in a number of ways.So far I haven't been disappointed using it as an internet device in my home and offline in most other places. Overall it is basically what you expect: an oversized iPhone with similar features. Web pages look much better than they do on the iPhone, but there's still no built-in flash support. Angry Birds is a lot more fun on the iPad's big screen.One thing I don't like is the email presentation. It basically uses the same iPhone-sized strip overlayed on a full screen message display. There's no way to just be looking at your inbox or other folder; you have to always be looking at an email. It's a minor annoyance, but different than I have my email setup on every other system including the iPhone.I was also surprised to learn that the iPad is still on iOS 3 (so much for my research). I spent over an hour trying to create app folders on the device and in iTunes before I realized the iPad doesn't have that ability yet. I'm disappointed with the number of apps that expect you to re-buy just to increase the resolution enough that full screen looks good. Most apps like that I continue to use in the small, iPhone-size window that opens by default or I put up with pixellation and hit the 2x button. I didn't realize how quickly I'd gotten used to iOS4, but now it's annoying when I click a link on one website that opens a new window, and upon returning to the original site it has to completely reload instead of saving my previous position. Hopefully iOS4 will be out this month for the iPad and it will function more like my iPhone.If you're going to throw your iPad in a flight bag, I recommend the Otterbox Defender case. It was covered by the tax savings I enjoyed by purchasing from Amazon instead of Apple. The case offers a lot of protection, but like its iPhone cousin makes the ports less accessible. You have to remove the back panel to access the charging port, and not all headphones are able to reach into the headphone jack. My wife and I wanted to watch a movie together using a y-cord, but it wasn't able to fit without me removing the top half of the case.Overall I'm pleased with the unit so far. I could have waited for another solution (Google Pad, maybe?), but as Apple's already big in our lives and my work is likely moving to this unit, it was the best choice for me. If you're thinking of buying an iPad, I don't see why you'd buy anywhere but Amazon. Their list prices match the Apple store, but they add no tax or shipping charges. Tax in my area is 10% so I saved $70 buying from Amazon instead of Apple.
Good points:It looks great. It's operation is immediately familiar to anyone that owns or has owned Apple products before and is completely intuitive.  It is fast, is ideal for watching films, browsing the net, reading ebooks and even playing games.Bad points:No Flash! I know all the arguments and the reasons why Apple do not support Flash but, seriously, this is a huge drawback, particularly now that Samsung and Toshiba have entered this market with their Android devices and that the HP Slate will have Windows 7. Lack of Multitasking as also a real pain in the neck.What it's not:It is not a substitute for a laptop.  Anyone thinking that it is and buying it to perform laptop functions is going to be disappointed.Screen size:I'm not sure whether the screen size is optimal.  The Samsung Tab has a smaller screen which still seems good for viewing films and for browsing but is not so 'in your face'. I can't decide for the moment which size is better.I'm not concerned about cameras and so forth. For me, they are mere fripperies on a device like this.Overall, it is an impressive product, but I wonder whether the 2nd generation will mark a significant advance on this, early adopter, model.
Got it 3 days ago, any minute with it is a wonderful experience.The only things that makes me frustrated is the file management- it is so not intuitive how tomanage PDF files and others (even photos) thats it makes the experience annoying sometime, and required some internet inquiry beside that, everything is just perfect.(I hope they will add camera, enable the voice call and (but I understand that only in dreams) slot for SD cards/USB
I bought an iPad today and I think it is going to work for me pretty well. It is not going to replace my laptop (MacBook) in work related activities, but it is going to replace it in fun-related activities. After working on my laptop all day long, when I want to relax and do some casual internet browsing, reading, watch my photos, etc I want to move away from my desk without carrying my 5 lb laptop with me (and also unplugging it from an external monitor and bunch of other cables). iPad allows me to do exactly this. 1.5 lbs vs 5 lbs (MacBook Pro) is a big difference. Instant on makes a big difference as well. I used to use my iPod Touch for these purposes, but it is too small to browse the Internet comfortably, and overall its 3.5" screen is too tiny pretty much for antything. (It worked as a e-reader to me pretty well though).I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice netbook, but after looking at one that my friend bought I realized that this is not going to work - these are just small (and therefore inferior) versions of laptops. I gave Kindle a try, but did not really like it. I gave MacBook Air a really close look, but that thing is twice as heavy and three times as expensive. iPad is conceptually new device and it seems to fill a niche that Apple is trying to fill pretty nicely.Some people say iPad is just a big iPod Touch, and this is true - it is a larger and better iPod Touch. This is why I like it. Its screen is 4-5 times larger, and it is less than twice as expensive (as I recall the cheapest iPod upon its release was priced at $299). I would say this is how iPod Touch was supposed to be from the very beginning. I always felt that my iPod touch was too large for an mp3 player and too small for an internet browsing device. May be without knowing it, I became an Apple geek - now I have a Macbook, an iPad, an iPod Touch, and iPod Nano. Probably I will get rid of my iPod Touch, but the other three devices complete each other perfectly: MacBook is for work, iPad is for casual browsing, reading, and checking email, and iPod Nano is for music and audiobooks.I got my iPad, keeping this 14-days return policy in mind, but I am pretty sure I am going to keep it. A lot of critical things that were mentioned here are true: I wish the screen was not glossy, and I wish it was lighter (but lets be realistic - it is way lighter than all laptops and quite a bit lighter than most notebooks), and I wish it could play Adobe flash videos. This is pretty much it - I don't see anything else that bothered me about this device. And there are tons of things that make me happy about it: a beautiful screen, quick response, external speakers (I really missed them on m iPod Touch), and as mentioned before - instant on.Looking back, I really feel that a lot of negative reviews that I've read did not make much sense - this device should be judged for what it is, not for what it could have been..
Just putting in my two cents, but this thing is amazing. I have been working with computers since cpm days andI have never had so much fun.  Some of the reviews I have read hear don't make any sense (the iPad is not heavy!)Having used this now for two weeks, there is no going back.
I've had my iPad for about a month now.  I use it several times a day.  I have used my netbook twice in that same time period - once to set up the iPad the other to transfer some pics.  The desktop is gathering dust. It doesn't get much better than this.
iPad is a bit intimidating at first.  However once you master the device, iPad becomes your second nature.
Amazing, a big iPhone with no USB port and no Flash!With many thousands of website developers integrating Flash into their websites and applications it is a sad thing to see Apple escalate their petty feud with Adobe by not including Flash in their hardware. Rather than hurting Adobe, Apple is instead hurting their customers web experience as well as showing their lack of respect for the millions of on-line business's that use Flash with this childish omission of a popular and long running web application.Once the darling of the computing world, with this ugly act, Apple has alienated millions of people who use the web. Apple is only hurting their own users and potential clients, as well as their reputation. Apple is soon to become the next disliked big company going the way of Microsoft.A company as big as Apple is expected to show a more mature attitude and lead the community as well as the world. It is a shame to see Apple become just another greedy company using it's power to hurt and destroy others. As long as Apple can settle a score with Adobe, it does not matter who else they trample underfoot along the way, or how much their interfere with their clients enjoyment of the web.
Be careful, this is the WiFi version for the WiFi+3g price.  Misleading and Amazon should take off!
It took me 30 minutes to get tired of the iPad. Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information.2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text. - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch.Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over.
iPad is one of the best devices I purchased ever ... it is really going to be the next generation of mobile computing ... with 3G and App store I got all I need to do my job as a university teacher
I no long use my netbook since I got the iPad. This device is totally awesome.
No flash, too heavy to read books, no webcam,,therefore no Skype, can't just view all those videos your children send you by email, screen too touchy, no USB port, apps are too expensive and most are inferior, too heavy to carry around in a large handbag or tote, 3G is ridiculously expensive and the price of the iPad is way too expensive for just a pretty face. As for support, forget about it. I spent months downloading library books and my own CD music. Then one day it was all gone. I called Apple and they said I could pay for assistance but I was past the 3 mos mark for free help. Are they kidding. Hours upon hours of downloading was lost and they do not care. One day a new tablet will come out to blow them out of the water. The kindle and Nook already blow them away as to ease of reading and weight. Any tablet that is lightweight will be better. Their apps are a joke. This is like the childrens story about the Emporer who has no clothes. There is no substance, it's just about more money for music, books, audiobooks and videos. Limited compatibility with free library content on purpose. Foolish purchase!
I was hoping this would be able to stand alone as a computer should, more so as a portable device. I was hoping not to need another device to bring along to my Acer netbook. it was on a recent trip to Puerto Rico that I was able to compare the two.In terms of reliability, as a travel computer, the netbook wins. My hotel, Sheraton, only uses wired connection (Ipad was pretty much useless). Also, web pages load differently in the Ipad and I'm always wondering if I'm missing information I would have seen on my PC. Videos are always hit or miss. Imagine pulling up a video and 50% of the time it won't work.However, the things that it does do, it does well. it shows pictures remarkably well. it has much more decent battery life than my netbook and it shows web pages (those that it can handle) easier for me.On my next trip however, the netbook will be my companion and the IPAD stays home.
I purchased this iPad w/ 3G  for family use when in the car, travelling, etc.  However, many of the educational sights and many shopping sites require Adobe Flash Player to be installed.  Apple has seriously crippled the effectiveness of the device without Adobe Flash Player.  Apple should be up front about this limitation but is not.  I'm totally disappointed that my children can not even use their school site b/c Adobe Flash Player is missing. While the graphics driver is great, it is not useful without the programs I, as the consumer, would like to use.
Android and WebOS tablets are coming, so why buy now when the next version of the iPad will have to have more memory, a higher screen resolution and multi-tasking to compete.  Apple products are innovative, but they only become worth the premium Apple charges when competition forces them to refine their offerings.  I'll wait until the iPad2 emerges, or until someone else offers a price competitive product that gives me what I want: instant-on web browsing in a tablet.
I bought an Asus Netbook that I tried for 2 days.  In my opinion, netbooks are worthless gimmicks.  The iPad is hands down the best portable computing device ever.  It is fast, easy to use, good looking, and the battery seems to last forever.
I for one was excited when the announcement came out about the iPad. Unlike friends and colleagues, I looked past the funny name and lack of camera and saw something big coming. Once I had the device in my hand I knew it was a winner - could anyone doubt Apple? Sure there are some missing pieces, but this is the beginning of something really great. I can't remember the last time I was enthused about technology.Now I'm addicted. I carry my iPad back and forth to work, to meetings, and I'm prone to checking the iTunes store for new apps every few hours. Its like Christmas almost every day. There are so many wonderful apps already out, more on the way, and those that are out now are improving with updates constantly.I don't think the iPad (or similar copy-cat devices) will be for everyone... I'm sad for those who don't see the potential or will never find a good use for something like this. Love or hate Apple, this is honestly the game changer it was billed as - it will change your life for the better.Its not a large iPod, its not a netbook, its not a laptop replacement.. or is it all of these things. Thats for you to decide. Once you try it you will know, and the uses will grow every day.I didn't see the iPhone coming, but this one was obvious. Just watch out because your life will change.
It's fun ... it's ok ... it's not amazing. I already have an iPhone, so it's really just a big iPhone. If you don't have an iPhone, though, you will love it.
Now that i have the iPad I only use my iPhone for calls, I rarely use my laptop, I'm always on thisAmazing science fiction magic iPad. Play the piano, produce lovely paintings, play games, watchmovies, read books! A USB port would be nice, but the iPad is a lovely bit of imagining.
I won a 64G 3G iPad from Rush Limbaugh several weeks ago, and since receiving it I have been absolutely satisfied with handy devise.  I now have a reason to put digital copies of movies on an Apple product, surfing the internet while mobile much easier, it's easier to carry around than a laptop... The list goes on and on.My only complaints so far has been the need for Leopard software on your Mac computers.  I only have Tiger so I am forced to use my PC's iTunes.  The other is the price.  This thing is friggin expensive! Yes I got mine for free, but I wouldn't have paid basically 900 dollars for this tablet.All in all this things is awesome! I would advise waiting a year or two when they become more common place and cheaper.  anyway I give it a 5 out of 5!
I love the ipad sure their are some needed updates like a usb port... but still love it. wishful thinking on my part that such updates do occurs we can get discounts... eh, not gonna happen? i know. so are you looking to by a ipad, I got a brand new one :)
It's a terrific toy when I am connected, but unfortunately I purchased the wrong ipad.  I deeply regret that I did not purchase the one with G3 capability.  It would make a great GPS; maps on the ipad are much easier to see than those on my iphone.At home where I have wifi, it is very convenient to use it for reading email, surfing the web and watching utube in my "reading chair."  However, for text only books, the Kindle is much easier to hold. It is slower than my desktop which is on the same wifi, but I tire of setting at my desktop all the time when I use a computer.  Sometimes I read on my Kindle and look up places and characters on my ipad.Frederica Shockley
Well, I just received an iPad as a present. Initially, I wanted to return it for a refund and get the Kindle, but it sounds like my wife may want the iPad. So, I decided to open it up and play with it and possibly get the Kindle for myself. I will have to wait until I get home however, because you cannot use the iPad without first connecting it to a desktop/laptop and going to iTunes. This further reinforces my desire for a Kindle over the iPad. I do not like iTunes and its many restrictions to begin with, and the only reason I wanted something like this was to read books. Something it appears the Kindle excels at.The iPad weighs nearly 1 pound more than the small version of Kindle which I am interested in (this makes a difference when I go backpacking); has a backlit LCD display which will fatigue my eyes (although this would be nice to read in the dark with); needs an available wi-fi to have functionality on the go (which is an additional charge in many places); runs through batteries in a fraction of the time; and basically has a lot of neat features, but features that I will rarely use once I check them out and when I would use them, I am already near a desktop/laptop that has them.On the other hand, Kindle is light, has a long battery life, is easy on the eyes, and connects free to cellular networks when needed. Amazon, you have it right. Keep Kindle a reader and only add features that support and enhance reading, and you will have no worries in "competing" with iPad.This is a bit like comparing a pen and paper to a computer. They are two totally different things that have something in common, but neither is better than the other in general. The Kindle is designed for a specific use and seems to do that well. While the iPad is confused about whether it is a notebook/ereader/desktop. What's funny, while the iPad tries to make itself the everything device, it fails to include a camera. Even my cell phone has that. Oh well, I guess I'll have a small device to take on vacations and road trips with me to watch movies and check the web, but it will not substitute for an ereader.
ok let's see, the iphone already does 90% of the tasks featured here. you can play a game, read a book, browse the internet, play mp3's and look at pictures. only here it's just bigger. minus the phone. and it doesnt even have a USB port or flash support (or wireless sync). and it's not a computer either . for this price why not buy a netbook? at least a net book has the ipad's features and more (even if you wont be able to 'enjoy' clicking on glass instead of a keyboard): it's actually a full computer.if you favor attitude over functionality, the ipad is your next best gadget to buy. it's thin, shiny and attractive.it's somewhere between the iphone and a netbook but misses crucial functions the iphones and netbooks (and laptops, in short) already have for a smaller pricetag.everybody wants the ipad. but do people actually need an oversized, overpriced and brainless browsing board?now if Apple manages to put a cpu into this, i'll be the first to buy one, as i work in heavy graphics (and carrying an electronic drawing pad/computer is also a great ecological alternative to paper), but for now, the ipad's functions havent convinced me to set myself back 600-800$.
I bought iPad because of I am tired of carring my textbooks. The screen is too small for figures and diagram. I was tired of using my finger moving the screen. Also hard to take note. I am a student and it is no way a replacement of actual textbook. So I sold it and bought a tablet PC with Windows 7 premium. The tablet PC configuration is better as a textbook replacement. Granted, it is also twice as much as iPad.To be fair, iPad was never developed as a textbook replacement. Web browsing, email and leisure reading are ok.
The iPad has a very nice display and is very responsive but it is hampered with its tie to iTunes! It's great for displaying video and photos but awful at getting the photos and video to the device. You cannot even use this device OUT OF THE BOX without FIRST syncing with iTUNES!!!  ARE YOU FREAKING Serious!!!  Practically EVERYTHING you have to do to add content to your iPad REQUIRES an iTunes account and you must sync with iTunes all the time!  Are you serious??!! You cannot simply connect the iPad to your PC and add content via USB, you have to do everything via iTunes sync [ick].  Folder creation for photos is awful!  Do you want to attach something to an email...nope...you can't do it!  You can download apps but MOST of the apps are $$ while the same apps for Android devices are FREE!!! You are VERY limited on what you can do with this device!  Don't be fooled by the commercial.  My HTC-EVO phone has a smaller display but it can do loops around what the iPad device can do!  NO WEB FLASH SUPPORT!!!  REALLY!! Mark my words....Apple devices won't be around much longer...Android devices will swallow them up.
Lack of Flash support presents a web experience full of holes, and lack of multitasking is a real killer.  Although color is nice, it's much heavier and less comfortable than the Kindle, and the Kindle can go weeks without a charge.  I regret this purchase.  While using my iPad I often pull out my $200 dollar netbook when I get too annoyed.  It's a device that serves no real purpose.
First off its an inanimate electronic device nothing more.Save your passion and love for the PEOPLE in your life should you be so blessed.No USBNo SD SlotNo Security softwareNo Camera or VideoNo Tethering to anythingNo Voice RecorderNo CalculatorNo WeatherNo FlashNot a true user configurable tablet PC nor is it a true user friendly portable device (Room to Room) does not count.It is a considerably dumbed down, denuded and stripped down iphone, iguess with no phone......wow.......how inovative.Curious, how does it feel to be an unsolicited beta-tester ?It is also a huge content pig providing considerable additional profit for apple by driving up the cost of ownership skyhigh........ca-ching.App. buy ins could potentially soar into hundreds of dollars again rasing the cost of ownership...........ca-ching.USB was specifically excluded to prevent users from connecting 3G broadband devices from providers other than at&t.........can; you spell verizon ?Any well configured HD notebook will leave this Gen-1 tablet in the dust and for similar dollars.A failed attempt at being the first on the block with the newest thing mentality by Obi-Wan Jobsand this from the same genuises who brought their customer base the NEWTON.You apple weenies got seriously hosed.Read and weep......"Engadget also suggested said that the next-gen Apple TV will essentially be an iPad without a screen, using the SAME HARDWARE, including the CPU OS, and 16-Gbytes of flash memory.

I'm very disappointed with Amazon as I just placed an order for the ipad 64GB (without 3GS) and the lowest price showed was $848 plus shipping. Few minutes after placing the order I received an email that the order was already shipped. I happen to check the apple website just to be shocked that the selling price with free shipping is just $699.. To make things worse I'm not allowed to cancel the order..
Why would anyone want one? I would love for my mom to be tech savvy, to be able to wipe and reinstall her system software, to backup her hard drive on a regular basis, to upgrade and install RAM into the motherboard of her computer, to run the terminal to ping IPs to see why she can't get through somewhere.Is it going to happen? No. I'm not being pessimistic; she really has better things in her life to do. She's 76! I can't even adequately explain the concept of windows and menubars in a way that makes sense to her. Not to mention she has tremors and has a difficult time holding and accurately directing a mouse. I could get her an iPod Touch. I love mine, by the way. But with her near-sightedness and hand shaking, good luck touching the correct tiny little icon.With all that said, mom is getting a nice iPad w/ 3G for her birthday. I may not need one -- though they are awfully pretty and would be a wonderful lightweight companion while traveling -- but I really think my mom does. Besides, she loves games and this is a great way for her to keep her mind active while also being able to check her stocks, her email and whatever else she wants to do.And me? I will have saved countless hours of PC support time. Time that I can use enjoying time with my elderly mom rather than beating my head against a wall.
i bought an ipad from the net seller , after 6 days . i got a cancelation from the net seller becuase they don;t have it in stock.HOW CAN YOU SELL SOMETHING YOU DOON'T HAVE ??and i bought the screen protector and the skin with it as a bundel so i eneded up having the skin and cover and without the ipad it self ,This really sucks , i will never buy from the netseller .and i have no trust in amazon that they allow such companies to work from there website .
First of all you need to read the product features on Apple to have facts.* I Book totally new and not on I Touch.* 3G totally new* Price start at what I Touch started at with 8gig a few years ago* Support for playback of closed-captioned content* VoiceOver screen reader* Full-screen zoom magnification* White on black display* Mono audioMine is pre-ordered now and form other reviews on the web I am sure this is going to be a big success and step forward!To ALL the nay Sayers and Sauer grapes responders:  I NOW HAVE owned the I Pad for two weeks and stand by my positive pre-order post 100% and then some!!  The image sharpness is better then I imagined.  The speed of the new processor is a big improvement over the I Phone.  The sound of the on board speaker is a vas improvement over the I Touch.The only thing I would say is disappointing is how slow some of the previous app developers are making the change to the I Pad format i.e. Facebbok & EReader.
The bad:.Can't do flash because Jobs doesn't like it. It's your device and he made the decision for you. WTF?.The device is too heavy..ITunes sucks. I'm an IT professional for 15 years and I think ITunes is THE worst application ever.The good:.Apple store applications. But looks like Android's Market Place is going to win, sooner or later.
This product will prove to be as big a hit as iPhone. Even though it lacks a few features right now, knowing Apple next versions will totally nail it. It brings so much content to you with the right interface that this is going to become the primary device of multimedia and internet content access.
I'm a product design student and the following is my experience of Apples, so called magical ipad.Worked out of the box(both of the ones I've had), Into a recovery mode loop after updating, even when I replaced an ipad!!! And it was updated by apples own software, with itunes 10 whatever. The fact of the matter is, Apple are selling defective products to whoever gets them at high prices, even my ipod classic has been acting funny, and the iphone 4 is a showcase of how they want to manipulate people and take peoples money, whilst they build their empire. The high reviews are most likely from people who's ipads are working, please take my advice and avoid apple, products, my brothers ipod touch also got returned to the apple store more than 3 times, from what I remember.Your risking your money, when you buy one of their products, will you get what works or not, that's what should be in your mind. It aint magical it's a pain!!! I've wasted over £500 with a case, I will get my money back/sort something, pc world!!!Don't buy Apple products, if your upset about what I wrote, go into an Apple store and check for the customers returning defective/non working products and count how many throughout the week if you can.Very upset with a rubbish piece of engineering, don't buy North American products if you can.
Yes, it actually works if you willing to waste your time. Very unfriendly tablet. No paperwork. As I compare this tablet to regular PC this tablet worth exactly  10 bucks. The only valuable future is Internet access. Its not really fast either. Other strange thing is everybody told me Apple protected against viruses--nonsense. In first 10 minutes some program attacked tablet and luckily for me I was fast enough to shut tablet down. If I have question and I do I have to drive to Apple store and ask.Avoid.after having this toy for some time i realized anything i want to do i need second computer like printing or word prosessing and they always trying sell me music and install upgrades on my regular PC so finally i shut it down. useless toy. now i am planning buy Toshiba with 4G.
Now I'll admit I dont own one, just played with it at a store. I own an Iphone so am familiar with general approach. The Ipad is a great device, and I applaud it, but here's why I hesitate to buy one, unless just for an ereader device (and these things were amazingly not mentioned in the leading negative review)-I cant back up my Iphone onto it. I can on a netbook. duh-I cant backup my camera chip on it. Can on netbook.-netbook runs photographic editing sware (picasa - free from Google)-netbook has usb ports-netbook baterry lasts 10 hours.-netbook costs $300 with 160-250 gb hd mem-netbook has keyboard and office swWith that kind of competition, I think Apple has to carefully position themselves as an ereader.Just my 2 cents.added 8/4i bought one, and above comments are true. it also doesnt print, you gotta email or sync the file to your Mac/Pc  and print from there.I like the gizmo, though. Its just that the reader should br aware this is a beta, rushed product whose main advantage is its a tablet with nice form factor. ,I reach for my ipad over my laptop every time.
Well its like (exactly like really) the i phone...bigger screen is the only difference. I would rater given my money for anything else, including 600 mcdonalds double cheeseburgers (at least then I would have eaten)....I can't say this does not function well, it does, but then again so does my iphone. It's ver awkward to type on, does not make phone calls (granted neither does my iphone (thanks AT&T;))....why did i feel this was needed????
First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips. I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc. What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user. I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices. There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for. I purchased a game "Super Monkey Ball 2" for iPad and it looks and plays great! I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good. Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me. Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie. Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads "Safari Cannot open page because the server stopped responding". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection. Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem. Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release. It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection. It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads "not charging". I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem. I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users. The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read. It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger. If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection. When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in. The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from. The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol I have also used the internet radio while in the shower. You sit the iPad on the counter and turn it full blast. Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations. If your bathroom has a fan, you won't hear it while showering. I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest "Batman" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off. I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed. However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it. Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad. You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens. I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual. the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting. You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button. The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change. If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop. Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook. For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are. Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing. Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works. If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing. The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word. For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed "OMG" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted "OMB". I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off. It fills the screen with the sheer blue coating that prevents you from doing anything until disable it which I have to exit from the page and return.Most apps or pages allow you to enlarge the font on the screen or do the finger stretch thing but some don't and if you don't have the greatest vision could be hard to read.  Mostly I find this on the iPhone apps I installed on the iPad.The search function on the iBooks app leaves a lot to be desired.  You can only search exact titles or authors. If you want a subject matter like "gay", the results will not bring up books on that topic. You have to know the specific name of the book or author.It has one speaker so watching movies with the speaker on won't give you stereo but if you plug in headphones, viola! stereo sound.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer. If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws. If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.
I've never bought anything on the first day it was available, but I was off to Venice on the 5th, so I got an iPad on the 3rd.  Even though I'm a Mac-only person, I never had an iPod or an iPhone, so I think that many of my problems arise from that and will probably go away in time.Right now I'm not sure how to answer the great Wizard of Oz question:  good witch or bad witch?GOOD WITCH:~light, small, and I didn't have to play the whole "how many books in my purse?" game for the transAtlantic flight~beautiful screen~great battery life -- I read the new Maisie Dobbs all the way across the pond~holds a massive number of books and movies, and I've got just the 16gb model~gets you into many interesting conversationsBAD WITCH~hard to keep it turned off when not in use and that's bad for draining the battery~steep learning curve if you don't have an iPhone or iPod-touch~pages on book-mode turn too easily unless you keep a perfect grip on it~hard to prop up on a table to read while eating~no substitute for a real book when standing in line, sitting in bright sun, falling asleep ...~no way (yet) to directly up-load pix from camera~no real photo software~hard-to-use documents software~wireless connection not all that enthusiastic compared to my laptop~sloooooooooooow to charge up, which is a real issue when there's only one outlet in your hotel roomSo am I glad I bought one?  Well, sort of.  If I weren't traveling, I might be more grumpy, but the book/movie thing alone is certainly sufficient reason for getting an iPad.PS/News from the front on 4/15::~the Netflix thing -- which doesn't work in Europe, so I hadn't tried it when I wrote the review -- is AWESOME.  Netflix has really stepped up the available offerings, too.~there's a KINDLE app now and you can get books from Amazon that the iBookStore doesn't have.  The special effects aren't as cool, but it's still fabulous to be able to get a book in 10 seconds.  And this _does_ work in Europe.PPS 3 weeks in (4/24)~I'm much happier with this than I was the first week, but that doesn't mean that it's entirely perfect.~Nooooooo, it's not a lap-top substitute, nor was meant to be, but if it's gonna offer document software, it would be great if it worked better.~I very much wish there were a way to batch delete mail messages, rather than having to select each one individually.  It takes a significant period of time to clear out a day's worth of messages.~A SAVED box would be great, too.~the worst thing, really, that it DOESN'T have is a camera -- so you can't Skype~there are lots of apps in the App Store, but it's hard to sift out the ones just for the iPad.  More deceptively, there IS a filter for that, but it still gives you iPhone apps, which don't look as cool or work quite as well on the Pad.~I'm very very very glad that there is a Kindle app, because the bookstore is low on new releases, at least in mysteries and thrillers~I still worry constantly about dropping it and eagerly await the arrival of the Apple case.~The wireless problems I grumped about are now famous and no fix in sight.Summary?  still glad I have it.
Here's an update to my original review.  I bought the iPad on April 3rd (first day it was available).  Best gadget purchase I've ever made.  The iPad is my first Apple purchase. Prior to the iPad, I didn't feel that Apple's products were worth the money.  With the iPad however, not only did Apple make a great product, but they priced it quite competitively. I'll list below first what I love about the iPad, then where I feel the iPad falls a bit short.Here's what I really like about the iPad: 1.  Instant on capability to the Internet.  With the iPad you don't have to wait long for it to boot up.  When the iPad is completely off, it takes  about 15 seconds to start the device.  There is also a "standby off" which uses virtually no power and  allows "instant on" capability.  2. Superb web browsing experience.  The iPad comes with Safari, an excellent web browser.  I'm especially impressed with the way I can zoom  in on a page at any size.  (Text size is completely variably-sized, allowing you to fit web pages and text  perfectly with the screen.)  Pages render very quickly (faster than on my many PCs) with no problems.  True, there is no support for Flash but I've found that to be a very minimal "hardship" as the iPad has  other free apps (like YouTube) that compensates for lack of Flash.  4. Bright, easily readable and navigable screen  Though not perfect: (I wish it were not glossy), the iPad screen is excellent.  It's 9.7" size seems  just right and the multi-touch interface works flawlessly.  The way I can intuitively scroll down on  a page makes web browsing and other document reading a real pleasure.  Font support is not extensive but  what fonts are available render beautifully.  The iPad can be read easily indoors or outdoors provided  you are not in direct sunlight.  5. Decent speaker sound and wonderful headphone sound.  The iPad can generate reasonably loud (if not high quality) sound from its built-in speakers.  Of course  it sounds wonderfully if using headphones and/or you choose to feed its audio into a home stereo system.  In addition to the built-in iPod music player application, there are several "streaming radio" apps  available that allow you to use your iPad as an "internet radio".  6. Huge library of new and existing applications.  There are already thousands of applications written specifically for the iPad.  The iPad also does a  decent job of playing 95% of existing iTouch/iPhone applications.  With over 150,000 programs available,  there are applications already available for just about anything you can think of many of which are free.  My application list includes, streaming internet radio, video players, card games, and news/weather  sites. I've also downloaded the iBooks application which is an excellent book reading program.  Many  free books are available as well as a good selection of current titles.  Another great built-in app is "Maps". "Maps" is incredible, not only in its ease-of-use but in its ability  to show your current location.  True, the WiFi only iPad has no GPS but via WiFi signals the iPad can  often compute your approximate location.  7. Great battery life!  Even if you use it to play movies constantly or listen to non-stop internet radio, you'll  get around 10 hours or more use per battery charge.  With the lastest software update from Apple, battery  life seems even better.  Even after several months of regular use, I'm getting 10 hours or more of use  per charge.There are some ways the iPad could have been made better.  Here are the not-so-good aspects about the iPad:  1. Glossy screen has its drawbacks.  My #1 concern before buying the iPad was, "Will I be able to put up with the glossy screen?".  Indeed, now  that I have had my iPad for 3+ weeks, my #1 complaint is the glossy screen.  Under certain lighting  conditions (outside in the shade or watching dark movie scenes indoors or out), the reflections on the  iPad's glass screen become a real annoyance.  A matte like finish on the glass (like what you would find  on most high quality computer monitor screens) would be a huge plus.  2. Awkward to hold without a case.  When I bought my iPad, I also picked up Apple's $40 iPad case.  Glad I did as, without the case,  the iPad is not very comfortable to hold and can easily slip out of one's hands.  With the case, the  experience is entirely different.  Apple's rubberized case makes the iPad comfortable and very easy  to hold onto.  It also provides the iPad with excellent protection and allows you to prop up your iPad  when at a table.  If you buy an iPad, buy it with a case like Apple's that allows you to use the unit  without having to remove it from its case.  The $40 Apple case seems pricey but I wouldn't take my iPad  anywhere without it.  3. Not a stellar "WiFi performer".  I've had no difficulty using my iPad around the house or at work.  But compared to my Acer laptop, the  iPad's overall WiFi performance is weaker than I'd like it to be.  The number of hotspots it can detect  at any given location is only a small fraction of what my laptop can detect. Also, occasionally I'll go to  a restaurant (say McDonald's) that has free WiFi and for some odd reason I cannot get my iPad to connect  even with a strong signal present.  Overall though, I've found the iPad to have a very reliable (if not  very sensitive) WiFI capability.  4. On-screen keyboard a bit disappointing.  Though I feel there is plenty of room for it, the on-screen keyboard does not have the number keys on the  same display as the alphabet.  One has to constantly toggle back and forth between keyboards when entering  alphanumeric data.  I hope Apple fixes this in a future software update.  5. Kind of a heavy unit.  1.5 pounds may not seem like much.  But prolonged use (several hours at a time) of the iPad can cause one  to have sore wrist/hands just from holding the unit.  The longer I've had my iPad the less it's weight has  bothered me.  Perhaps one day, with newer screen technology, Apple can move away from using so much glass  and lower the weight of this unit to under 1 pound.I've had my iPad for 3 weeks and have been using it extensively for web surfing, TV viewing, PDF reading, music listening, and game playing.  The performance of this device is amazing.  Almost every operation and function responds instantly to your command.  This truly is a versatile device that I'll be using for years to come.I've been waiting many years for an affordable tablet PC that could do what the iPad does.  My wait is over.
We bought the 32G Wifi and been using it for about 10 days now.  This is a review of what the iPad actually IS.  It's not a lot of other things so it's kind of silly to complain about that.  Don't buy it if you want to do something it currently can't do.  Hardly a reason to trash it. We are a mixed Mac/PC family with 3 students scattered from elementary school to high school.  This was bought as a gift instead of a Macbook with the enthusiastic consent of the 13 year old who will be the primary user.  It is still probably riding the initial rush any new "toy", but I can tell you I'm seriously contemplating buying another when the 3G version comes out.  The second would be a pure luxury purchase admittedly.  This first one though is definitely going to be over subscribed for the foreseeable future as far as I can tell. To begin- It's a fascinating piece of technology.  It would probably make a great primary computer for someone who doesn't really need a real desktop or laptop most of the time.  (Grandparents, etc.) Going forward I'll recommend this instead of the Mac minis I've steered people to over the last couple of years. So far we've only gotten the black cover from Mac as an accessory.  It synced easily with our existing iMac and iTunes and immediately uploaded the existing iTouch apps.  I also bought the Pages and Numbers apps for 10 bucks each.  I downloaded both the Kindle app and iBooks to compare.  I also added NPR, Netflix, The Weather Channel app, and the 14 dollar Elements Book/App.  I synced his playlists and tossed on about 500 pictures from last year and this year.  I'll delve a little deeper into most of these.The Screen- The screen is very impressive.  It really makes the device what is it obviously.  Then again it sucks up fingerprints to an amazing degree.  Cleans up easily though and you adapt pretty easily to the change.  I can't see how to avoid this problem when you're touching the screen constantly and still expect a flawless picture.The E-readers-  iBooks wins on the pure look and feel aspect.  It may just be a temporary effect, but reading in iBooks just felt more like reading a real book.  Kindle wins on the amount of books and cross platform compatibility.  I think I trust Amazon more at this point to keep any purchased books in a format I can count on for a longer period of time.  I have to admit, I'm not fully confident in either company's willingness to port this format 10 or 15 years down the road.  I'll probably stock up on any free books in iBooks for now and purchase anything I need from Amazon's Kindle store.  I haven't sat down and read a full book "cover to cover" yet, but I've done some lengthy stretches with both apps.  Please don't hate me, but I found reading on this to be more enjoyable than reading on a Kindle.iPhoto-  Pictures look amazing on this.  I was very easily able to set up slideshows and pair them with tunes from iTunes.  Most of the shots I used were a little over 5mb originally and ported with the ability to zoom in close quite clearly.  I included 1 shot of us standing next to the 20th Maine monument at Gettysburg.  While not really in view in the original shot, I was able to zoom in and read the individually inscribed names very clearly.  This app really wows people with the clarity of the screen/photos.  The sound is pretty good for the size of the device but not amazing.Safari (Browser)- I'm familiar with and use Safari regularly at home so I found the web experience to be normal for the most part.  I noticed occasional blanks where I guess flash apps would be, but I'm more of a news reader.  I haven't spent a huge amount of time surfing on it, but it seemed fine when I did.  No complaints from the other family members.Netflix - This was a surprise.  I didn't realize how well this would work.  We were watching The Office within a couple of minutes and the screen is big enough that two can watch and still have it be an immersive experience.  Of course not everything on Netflix is available for instant view, but it's a free app and we're already members so I can't complain.  This was very easy to setup and I'd recommend trying it to anyone.Pages- this the Apple version of Word and on the iPad it's the light version to boot.  That said, it a pretty nifty little word processor that he's used to do homework already.  You have to sync it to iTunes and then open the doc with the full version of Pages or Word.  Here I have a pretty big beef with Apple.  I've got Pages 08 which I bought in late 08 as part of iWorks.  To sync you have to have Pages 09?!  Word 97 is supported but not Pages 08?  I happen to have Word for Mac so it wasn't a big deal but I was really ticked off at the time.  You might even be able to export as a .doc and then load into Pages (didn't think of it at the time) but I don't know for sure.  Either way I can't believe Apple wouldn't support this out of the box.  Anyway, it worked out fine even if it wasn't terribly intuitive.  Going forward he can do it on his own with no problem.Specialty Apps - NPR/Weather Channel - I can easily see people getting a little out of control in designing their own apps for no real reason.  Both of these were free and pretty well executed though.  There are many of these out there but I had read reviews on both of these so we started with them.  I imagine we'll add and delete apps frequently over time.The Elements: A Visual Exploration- A very impressive educational e-book app that was highly recommended and that I spent a lot of time playing with and reading.  This was a little pricey for an e-book, but it was also rebuilt as app to take advantage of the iPad video capabilities including 3D (haven't gotten the glasses yet).  It's really another wow factor app when showing the app to people.Pro's.  Undeniable cool factor right now (that will fade, I know). Beautiful executed form and basic functionality. Reasonable cost factor for the level of functionality COMBINED with the ease of use and intuitive UI. No wifi connectivity issues so far. Light weight.Con's  The things it doesn't have - camera specifically. The Pages 08 incompatibility. Learning curve for some basics functions Printing more cumbersome than it needs to be.This is the longest review I've written by far for Amazon, especially considering I didn't even buy the iPad here.  I thought it was important though to get a fairly evenhanded review (yes, I know I like Macs) out there from someone who has actually paid for and used an iPad.  It is not for everyone.  If you have a Kindle already there's no reason you shouldn't keep it and continue reading with it.  If you're an Apple hater because of their DRM/closed garden, I totally understand.  If you're a power PC or Linux user you'll probably have something you can tool around with to your heart's content shortly.  For a pretty large group though, I think this is a very viable option to do a lot useful/fun things without traumatizing your already overworked friend/relative who's also your IT guy.
I purchased an iPad for my wife who loves the instant on, the very portable form factor and the many uses for this device provided by the multitude of varied Apps that you can purchase for iPad.I had heard about the scuffle that Apple and Adobe were going through around Flash support for the web browser but didn't think the issue was of much consequence.As my wife and I have been using the iPad it is becoming very apparent to us just how much Flash is used on the internet. It infuriates me that this device can't perform such a basic function (simple internet browsing) without stumbling over Flash and forcing me to go to my home computer to finish the task.What was Steve Jobs thinking? I am so upset over this issue I am hoping that Google, Cisco, Microsoft eat his lunch until he gets some sense knocked into him.STEVE! Support Flash on the iPad! We have paid too much for your device as it is and to not support something so basic like Flash is unbelievable to me.

 Length:: 9:40 MinsI thought this video might be helpful for those considering getting the 3G model.Other than the 3G part, this review is fine for the Wi-Fi only version.----------Hopefully my video shows you most of everything you needed to know.If not, please feel free and ask. I will try to respond.The iPad is an amazing entertainment tool. It will soon be muchmore than that.For those with iPhones and iTouch iPods, you will not be as dazzledas those who have been deprived (I have a Blackberry, trust me, I know).All will love this device, but the is always a price. I mean literally, a big price :-)It is worthy of 5 Stars due to the vast things you can do. Video, music, pix.But not like every phone or iPod. This is completely different.This is nearly perfect.
Like many others, I too was faced with the delimma of buying a netbook v. an iPad. I spent a lot of time researching the products and spent my $ buying both an iPad and what I consider to be the very best netbook on the market today - The Sony Vaio X (unfortunately, Sony has just stopped selling the Vaio X!).Let me clarify up front that the iPad simply blows away each and every netbook you see in stores like Best Buy in the sub $500 range. Whether it is design, performance or build quality you'll regret buying one of those netbooks for an iPad. So here is my Sony Vaio X v. iPad comparison.1. Cost:iPad 64 GB wi-fi: 699 (3G wasn't available). But equivalent pricing for features would be + $130 (for 3G) + $ 40 (case since the screen on the ipad is exposed) + $30 for VGA connector + $30 for SD card + usb adapter = $930 (still missing camera).Sony Vaio X(64 GB): $1299 (includes Verizon 3G inbuilt)GAP: iPad Appox $300 cheaper2. OS:iPad: iphone OS - instant on, app store, multi touchSony Vaio X: Windows 7 Professional - powerfulAdvantage: Depends (personally I prefer Win 7 for most things)3. Design: Surprisingly in terms of weight and thickness both are about the same. However, the carbon fiber body on the vaio x is gorgeous! The Vaio X is NOT like any other netbook in terms of how it is built.Advantage: Tablet v. traditional notebook. Again, tablet is better for media and web browsing. Traditional for productivity software like MS Office.4. Battery: The Vaio comes with a standard 2 hour battery which is blown away by the over 10 hours on the ipad. However, the Vaio also includes a 12 hour extended battery. But this battery increases the weight of the Vaio to 2.5lb, making it about an inch thicker (at its widest) and a pound heavier than the ipad.Advantage: Slightly to the ipad, unless you don't care about the extra 1 lb weight added by the XL Vaio battery.5. Features: Vaio wins this hands down with much better array of expandable memory slots, 2 usb ports and ethrnet cable slot and included VGA port, front facing camera and ability to connect an optical drive if needed (I have a super slim usb powered dvd drive). The ipads biggest advantage is the app store, which is more of a software rather than hardware feature.6. Screen: ipad's IPS LCD wins this one hands down. On paper the larger, higher resolution LED backlighting Vaio looks more impressive, but the better viewing angle and high quality glass on the ipad screen makes it much easier to read text and watch movies etc.7.Performance: The biggest advantage of the ipad is that you don't have to wait 60 seconds before you can start using it. Also,the ipad is much faster at connecting to a wifi network.8. Others: While the iPad gets a lot of attention, so does the vaio x. The fan on the vaio x can be a little distracting when it is on. Overall if I think of the intangibles such as the variety of apps on the app store, the speed at which you can turn on the device and start browsing the web, the email client, the photo viewer app etc etc...the ipad is just a much more compelling device. Last but not least the ipad simply destroys the Vaio or any netbook when it comes to gaming! The ipad is an amazing gaming device. If you haven't tried it....you're missing something.MY FINAL ANALYSIS: If I didn't have an iphone or ipod touch I'd say this would be a no brainer. The quick access to email and the internet when compared to a netbook like the vaio x is just too great of an advantage for me. When you have to wait for a device for 60 seconds to wake it up from hibernation and remember to put it to sleep so that it does not drain the battery it's just not as convenient as the ipad. Also the screen on the ipad is just amazing....However, I own BOTH an iphone and an ipod touch. Therefore for me the Vaio X is a more useful device. I also have an ebook reader, so while the ipad is a fantastic ebook reader it would be duplicating another device that I already have. I have decided to return my ipad (I am a day away from the 14 day return period) and it will cost me $70 for re stocking and another $50 or so I spent on ipad apps. Hopefully, I'll be able to use some of these apps when I upgrade to iOS4 in the near future. But $120 was the price I had to pay to know for sure that I don't need an ipad (right now). Of course IF my Vaio X were to die, I'd get an ipad in a heart beat :)
I received my iPad in May so this is a 7 month review.In general, I dislike Apple for the restrictions that they place on their hardware, interfaces and software (especially iTunes).  Loyal PC/Windows user since 1985.  I generally subscribe to the open-source mantra "If you can't open it, you don't own it."  I have only personally owned one other Apple product (the clip iPod shuffle which I liked for its size, simplicity and durability).  I have never owned an iPhone and though my wife has an iPod Touch I was never a big fan of that.  I have heard reference that iPad is a big iPhone or Touch...possibly as I never fully explored either of those two options.With all that said, I absolutely love my iPad.  I did not think I would and was looking towards a Kindle or Sony E-Reader when I got the 64g/3g as a gift from my wife.  I will not rehash the specs or the features...instead, this is what I like and dislike:What I use it for:- Time Wasting: #1 use.  This year I had to spend lots of time in hospital waiting rooms.  This was a Godsend!!  Movies, books, games, Facebook and email.  It kept me from being too bored anywhere I know I will be waiting : Airport, DMV, Dr Office, Parole Board, Parent-Teacher meetings...- Reading: In bed at night, at the gym on the elliptical, on the plane.  The reader is a good one.  I have lots of ePubs and it handles them very well.  Magazine PDFs look great.- Web Browsing: I prefer Atomic vs. Safari and the browser works well.  Miss Flash, but not terribly.- Facebook: Using the Friendly app due to lack of Flash conflicting with the picture uploader FB uses.  Easy to use and quick.- Games: At $0 to $5 (for most game apps) the iPad is an ever changing game platform.  I probably have bought 50+ of them by now.  Get bored?  Get another cheap.  Sure a PSP functions better, but try cycling through 50 games in a PSP...big $$$ and trips to the store!- News: USA Today, NPR, CNN, SkyGrid and Instapaper are my primary news apps.  I review them in the morning on the elliptical at the gym...no way to do that easily with paper.- Travel Apps: Flight Tracker, Weather, GPS, Maps, UrbanSpoon, Goby, etc.  All useful when traveling.- Crossword Puzzles and Words With Friends: hooked on both these apps.What has it replaced?- Calendar/Contacts: Synced to my online and Outlook calendars it acts as a planner substitute.- GPS: in the car using the $3 Motion X Drive GPS.  I like it better than the one integrated into my car (that I paid more than $3 for).- Books & Magazines: Like going on vacation with a library without the bulk.- HP 12c Financial Calculator: Expensive app ($12) but one less thing to carry.- Laptop:  Not a true substitute but pretty close for much of what I used it for - especially for traveling (browsing, email, picture storage, etc).  I have not fired up the laptop since I got the iPad.- MP3 player: I use it, but I am not wowed by it.- Smart Phone: Possibly...not sure on this one yet.  The phone can do most of what the pad can do but it is SO small!!- VCR/DVD: We have a TV connection cable and it becomes a portable video player for travel.Like- Build quality:  It's heavy and well finished. It feels solid and looks sleek.  The Kindle, E-Reader, and other readers do not measure up.  Even the Galaxy (which I view as the closest substitute) does not "feel" as good.  Not very scientific...but it is what it is.- App Store:  With 300,000+ apps, the app store seems to have at least one app to do whatever I am looking to accomplish.  THIS is the key to the iPad (and probably iPhone and Touch as well, though I confess ignorance here).- Size:  I am 47 and now need glasses for reading.  The screen size is great.  Can't imagine squinting at a SmartPhone screen for some of these functions.  Typing is very easy compared to a smartphone though not as easy as a PC.  About the same as a small laptop.- User Interface Experience:  Smooth, seamless, instant response.  Very, very well polished.  Have played with Android devices (Galaxy Tab and Droid X) and don't see the same polish.- Camera Interface: Basically an SD card reader for the iPad.  Backs up my camera easily.Dislike- Size:  Need a "man-purse" or "European Should Bag...it was a gift!" to carry it.  Most of the time I keep it tucked under my arm.  It is also pretty heavy to hold and read a book.  I keep it propped up somewhere to do read extensively.  But...heavy = build quality.- No Flash:  Should play it.  No reason not to.  I personally have not experienced a lot of problems with this but I do not frequent youtube or gaming sites.  I see it on maybe 15-20% of the sites I visit and generally can work around it.  I am told HTML5 is the cure...we'll see.- No Camera:  Should have one (or two) and should shoot video too.  Bad oversight.- Charging:  Though battery life is OK (I must charge mine every night), the 10Watt charger is annoying.  Wish the standard 5W USB would work.- Cases:  Yeah.. you will want a case.  2 options - minimalist or protection.  I use the Apple minimalist case and like it, but it does not offer much protection and the viewing/display options are limited.  With more options and/or protection, size becomes even more problematic.- Photo Album:  I can move my videos, TV shows and Books around...why can't I organize my pictures!?!?!  More of an oversight than a flaw but annoying.What to buy?- Want an eReader?  Look at the file formats they can handle and the hardware quality (controls, viewing, etc).- Want a tablet (I think this is the genre)?  Look at the apps and the ability of the hardware to handle them well.  This is the key to the whole experience!!  Software that works well with the device, which can be downloaded on demand and managed in modules. Apple appears to have done this well.In summary, although not previously an Apple fan, I really am impressed by my iPad.  I liken it to my first digital camera (a gift device that I also did not want) which changed the way I viewed and used photography.  The iPad fills a gap in lower end mobile computing that I didn't really even perceive was there until I got it.  The Apple control/oversight is both restrictive and enhances the user experience.  So far, I have found it to be more useful than detrimental.  Like my pocket digital camera, I take the iPad with me most everywhere.Hope this helps.
I am a German customer and my English is not perfect so I apologize for that in advance. I have bought the English version of the IPod 64GB. Well, a lot of things have been said about the product's features and how great it looks and all. Time to point out some negative facts and reasons why i would not buy an Ipad again.I noticed that people praise the product based on their first impression rather than on actual every day experience.Here are some disturbing facts about the all new and shiny iPad.-Overpriced! If you consider that you can buy a netbook for half the costs, which outperforms the iPad in just about every way this latest Apple toy is clearly overpriced. Ok, it's not a netbook and it's not a laptop. But hello? One wonders why Apple's profits have skyrocket in recent months! A retail price of (maximum) 500 USD would just about be acceptable. But 800 USD for a product that offers less features than the late IPod 4th Generation is a joke.Unlike the iPod 4G, the iPad has no still camera and no video camera. It's also impossible to do Skype calls at this time. The obvious benefit over the iPod is obviously is  the big screen and as a result from this, the better resolution and picture quality.-Another major drawback: Apple does not allow iPad/iPod users to view flash content. Yes, that's right! If you want to watch a video on the internet that requires Adobe's Flash Player, your outta luck! And since 75% of all internet videos use the Flash Player, this is a major setback!According to Apple, the use of Flash Player would lower the performance of the iPad/iPod and also would lower resources to a rather low level. Excuse me? If am i paying 800 bucks for a so called "premium product" i get to decide which content i want to play and not Apple!Here we go again, with the comparison to the cheap but solid netbooks of today! All the netbooks can play Flash content, not to mention the other countless applications users have become to appreciate such as Skype or web bases games. Netbooks have more disc space to offer, you get to decide what programs/applications to install and so on. They also offer a real keyboard and countless plugs which are essential today. What does the iPad have to offer?Obviously no USB, no HDMI, no mic, no firewire etc. And again, for double the price over a modern netbook that is!But the list of flaws goes on even further. Many of the apps that you can download from the apps store and iTunes are loaded with bugs! I recently purchased an eBook and after it finished downloading i tried to open it only to get the following message thrown into my face: "failed to load book because the requested resource is missing".That was it for my first reading experience. I am still unable to open the book and i now have to contact iTunes for further assistance.If Apple wants to sell Computers to the mass, they need to re-think their price strategy. If you want to buy a protective hard plastic case, or a similar  nylon cover, you end up paying between 20 and 80 (!) USD. That's insane, knowing that the production costs for an iPhone/iPad plastic shell are in the range of 25-40 cents!Wake up Steve Jobs, success is one thing but endless greed will always keep you under the wings of big Bill Gates, who remains to supply 90% of all Computers to consumers around the world. Ever wonder why?I wonder no longer...
First, the good: - It's nicely responsive most of the time - has a good selection of apps - the touch interface is fantastic. - It's my go-to device for quick web-surfing, kindle reading, etc. - Individual apps are often unstable, but the OS itself is quick solid.The bad: - iTunes for PC is without a doubt the most bug-ridden POS my computer has ever been saddled with.  Every other app is rock solid but this one.  It's also slow, confusing yet primitive, and crashes and errors constantly.  I cannot gripe about this enough.  Unless you are running a mac, steer clear of this product! - Very slow web-browsing speed compared to even the lowest end laptops.  Total lack of caching means flipping back a page forces a reload of the page from the web.  Slows things down further. - Lack of flash hurts more than I expected - Slow wifi makes streaming video watching a crapshoot.  Sometimes works great, other times abysmal - Touch interface not so great for content-creation of any kindBottom Line:Good for content consumption, not so good for content creation.  Can't currently replace a real computer.  If they would remove iTunes from the picture and fix the sub-par web browsing this would be a nice little device.
I have never used an Apple Product before.  I am a software engineer but have never worked on a MAC. I was looking for a device to read text books in pdf format. I was looking for a device with at least 9.7" display. The Plastic Logic device doesn't seem to be coming out any time soon and I wasn't sure about the Iliad. I was on the edge  between the Kindle DX and the Ipad. I checked out the ipad and looked at some pdf's and was concerned about the display size, practicality of zooming in every time and prolonged reading on a back lit screen.After much deliberation (and research) I bought the Ipad. I unpacked the box at around 4pm. I couldn't put down the device until 2 am! It took all of 5 minutes to connect to my 802.11B Linksys router (it negotiates the WEP/WAP, key number and simply expected the Password/Key that I had used for security). I have worked on many high end LCD monitors but I have never seen a display so plush! My jaw literally dropped when I saw Magazine covers on zino (its a free app). The choice of applications on iTunes is mind boggling. At first I was sceptical about watching movies at this size. But the Netflix app rendering is so smooth, I felt like I was watching at 1080p on some high end SONY Bravia. Wall Street Journal , although expensive, is laid out so well that if other papers followed suit, it will bring the demise of their physical circulation immediately.Battery life is another thing that is so surprising. I had the device on, almost constantly, for almost 10 hours, and the level fell barely to 80%.Finally what really blew me away, is the finger swipe movement. I have never used an Ipod touch or Iphone before, so this was new to me. It is extraordinarily accurate and smooth and beats 20 years of Mouse development! The virtual keyboard is perfectly sensitive.Oh, and yes, I downloaded the GoodReader app and finally got around to reading my pdf text books. The screen is a bit small for reading text books with tables and network diagrams, but the pdf reader has a great margin-crop feature. Using this feature in landscape mode, with constant zoom, reading the most complex pdf becomes a breeze. The screen is so sharp and bright that eye strain is minimal.This is definitely the Ferrari of electronic devices.
I am a PC user, a grad student and professional accountant. I have a nice PC, and an iPhone, but I have never owned a laptop. I needed something with some portability that would allow me to have a good e-reader, do some light Excel and Word document editing, and some internet browsing around the house. I have an infant son and it is not convenient to always have to be in the office doing things that I can now do downstairs on this unit.This is amazing. I have a router that is at least 5 years old and I haven't had any problems with the iPad (or my year old iPhone 3GS). It works remarkably similar to the iPhone, except it is obviously bigger. I have PDF textbooks for class and it was simple to email them to myself, open and save them in iBooks. There were no formatting errors, nor was there any for .doc files that I converted into Pages. It was much simpler than I imagined. Actually, until I looked closer at buying this, I didn't even realize I had the option to convert .doc and .xls files into usable files on any Mac unit, so that was the clincher for me. The internet is very fast and easy to navigate. I synced it with iTunes, had my PDF's, a few .doc files imported, email set up, some music and photos transferred within 30 minutes and I did some homework on it.As an afterthought, I have a huge collection of sheet music that I am going to scan into PDF format and transfer to the unit. I can just set the unit on my music stand; the back light will serve me well.This is a near perfect unit. I got the 16 gig wifi unit because I already have a big music archive on my iphone, I don't need my entire photo archive with me everywhere I go and if I am going to watch something while traveling, a few good episodes of the Simpsons will be fine. I will probably just read on it anyway. If you have an ipod or iphone I don't understand why you would need 3G and a huge storage space. This is a great supplementary computer for me and having used it for a little bit I know a MacBook will be my next purchase.Also, the bluetooth keyboard works great. Wall Street Journal app is incredible too. The only problem with Apple are the huge lines and wait times while at their retail stores.I read a lot of reviews and I have not yet experienced the Wifi connectivity problems that others have complained about. Like I said I have an old rabbit ear style router, and it is upstairs. I have been using the iPad downstairs, on the far end of the house and I am getting full bars. It is heavy to hold, but I have found that there are many convenient spots to prop it on. I'm afraid to say that there isn't much to dislike on this. This does seem like the Wii for computers though. Very easy to access for all ages and technical ability.
My wife and I both own ipads. She got hers in November and I got mine recently. This device rocks. It reminds me of my Iphone 4 on steroids with a much bigger screen. I started to go blind playing games on my iphone. The ipad seemed like a logical choice. I am very happy with it in most areas. Feels good to the hands, light, easy to tote around. Very easy setup and a breeze to use especially if you have an iphone and or ipod touch. I was using it within minutes right out the box. Web browsing is easy. Very handy for checking e-mail. A ton of programs of course through the Apple app store. So why not 5 stars. There are two things that bother me about this device. It has major issues with downloading games from the ipad app store app. Why that is I don't know. I have tried and least 3 games and ended up just downloading them on my main laptop and syncing. Easy enough but why the extra step?. I never had problems with iphone like this. Second of all it does not do flash video. Apple stupidly made a decision not based on customer needs but based on a stupid conflict with Adobe. Flash is still widely used throughout the internet and its a pain to not have this capability. You can use Cloud Browse app as a work around but its clunky and not worth the hassle. On the positive side the battery life is great. The ipad is the beginning shift to major laptops having touch capabilities and I would not be surprised to see lets say a macbook air with  boot capabilities to run both ios an mac os as well as windows 7. Stay tuned Apple has some tricks up its sleeves but for christ sakes get flash to work on this device. At over 600 plus dollars there is absolutely no reason it can't. Steve Jobs is stubborn. Com'on Steve loosen up. Flash will not destabilize the iOS operating system. How come Android OS can do it with no problem. Can you say Android tablet coming soon.triple
At first I was excited to get this "magical" and "revolutionary" gadget. Then reality crept in, and for a while it seemed like I had purchased a very overpriced netbook without a keyboard. But with the Kindle app for reading and Netflix for movies, it was really great for those two uses. And then more apps came on board, iTalk for recording meetings, Goodreader for opening all those different file formats, Atomic web browser with all the features missing from Mobile Safari, plus more. And the games. All those games. My PS3, Wii, Xbox, and PSP are collecting dust. Games on the iPad are great, getting better, and relatively cheap, usually under five bucks, compared to fifty or sixty for console games.There came a day when I realized that I hadn't touched my netbook or laptop for weeks. I still lugged the netbook around, mostly out of habit, but I never used it. Things were easier on the iPad. And faster, overall--I could turn on the iPad, load an app like Mail or Facebook or weather and be done with it, and have the iPad back in the bag in the same time it would take my netbook to completely wake up (not just for Windows to show up, but to get to where I could actually run a program). Plus, the iPad seems to have endless battery life. Plug it in every few days, and it's fine. I've become used to seeing 5% battery left and not instantly saving everything and looking for an electrical outlet. 5% is plenty of time. Also, if I have to type something long, which the iPad is pretty poor for, you know what? I use my desktop computer. There isn't really a use when my laptop is a better choice than either the iPad or my "real" computer. But I have big fingers, so I find the keyboard on my netbook to be only slightly less useless than the iPad's virtual one, and my laptop to be a poor substitute for the full-sized keyboard on my desktop.The only things I don't like about the iPad after using it for these many months are: The weight. About half the weight would be good. And the AT&T; 3G. It is essentially useless where I live. I unsubscribed and turned it off for good after about a month of frustration. If and when there's a Verizon 3G iPad, I'll think very seriously about getting one.Overall, I love it. I use it constantly. I've heard similar stories from other people: neat toy for a few days, then buyer's remorse, then it just sneaks into your life and the next thing you know, you can't live without it.
i bought the ipad for my husbands birthday. he uses it around the house and for his college work. im so jealous! i want my own now. not only can we play games on this pad-i can window shop online to my hearts content, email my friends n family easily and in a more fun way. i can download millions of pdf's and other ebooks, store them on the pad and read whenever i want. my husband uses it for making notes about his classes, applications galore for math, homework tracking and so many other little things i have yet to peek at! ive since given up my old laptop to share the ipad and our desktop until we can afford MY ipad. we seriously love it and its cute to watch my husband get all excited and show me something new the ipda can do for him. right now im watching him play Angry Birds on the couch as i write this. we're getting ready for bed. we added netflex to the ipad so we can snuggle up in bed and hide under the covers like kids while we watch movies. tonight is my night- i want to see The Nutcracker Ballet. lol
I am in sales, in home sales with home improvement products. Originally, I purchased the iPad to use for this purpose.I have multiple power point presentations,that also have videos linked to several slides, the iPad handles all of this very well. The biggest benefit for me is not carrying a laptop around,and not having to carry cords and all the delays from booting up and then waiting on p point to load.it has been absolutely a wonderful tool.As a bonus the games and navigation apps are incredible on this.After having mine for 2 weeks, my wife decided she needed one for herself. She uses hers for educational apps for our grandchildren. She has been amazing, helping them learn and they are really enjoying it.The iPad is a wonderful tool , no telling what the future of these will lead to.For e mail and online activity, you can not beat the speed and the ability to use it anywhere.The only downside is....you have to buy one, no one offered to give me one. That's the only way it could be any better.
As I am writing this from my iPad I strongly recommend that you purchase this product.ProsLarge screenLoud speakersLong battery lifeConsCannot run applications over others( although this is true for all apple products)If you are debating between an iPhone 4 and an iPad I suggest the iPad.I say this because one can get 3G coverage and use Skype to call people.This will essentially make the iPad a phone.
I'm a wedding photographer, and I find the iPad to be a great device to always have my portfolio with me - and have a wider variety of images with me than a printed album would. I can also show videos and a plethora of other things. It's not without it's flaws, and at $500 it's not cheap, but if it's going to help your business and pay for itself in revenue and profit then it's a wise business investment. (at least it is for me :)
The iPad is one of the amazing devices I have ever purchased. The quality of the software and apps is excellent and using the iPad is a joy. The multitouch interface makes using the iPad so much fun and there are so many things you can do with it. Although the iPad is fun, there isn't much use for it if you have an iPhone or iPod touch. If you have both devices, you tend to play favors on one making the other device useless. The iPad is really more of an entertainment device then something that you would use for productivity. Reading books on the iPad is a fun experience, but the weight of the iPad can be quite annoying. Watching movies on the iPad is like having a movie theater in your hand due to the vibrant IPS display on the iPad. iPad games are super fun and I really enjoy playing games on the huge touch display.FINAL VERDICT:I recommend the iPad to anyone who wants a high quality tablet to use as an enertainment device.
So for what it's worth you get what you pay for. the iPad is truly an incredible device but it does have it's flaws.Pros:-Very fast and responsive device.-Excellent 720p graphics.-great apps and features.-Tons of things to do with it.-great way to quickly view mail and surf the web.-awesome Book reading device-not as heavy as you thinkCons:-apps are more expensive than their iPhone counter parts--price is fairly big-does not support flashIt can be considered a big iPod sometimes but really it's so much more and honestly a big iPod touch is not a bad thing.
When the iPad was first announced in January my reaction was ho-hum. I thought it was just another uninteresting gadget. Then, in April after they were released I tried a couple of them at a univerity and immediately felt that I must have one.This is the kind of device I have long waited for, a fantastic tool for reading technical manuals and books, access to internet, weather radar, GPS information, e-mail, etc. Having communications available anywhere anywhere I can get wifi or AT&T; cellular is more than just a novelty for me, it has become important and useful. iPad is a surprisingly good tool for writing. Some really excellent apps, like the iAnnotate PDF reader, which is vastly better than the Adobe reader (and it allows you to create your own bookmarks and annotations in the PDF.) In summary, the iPad redefines what a personal computer is for me.Addressing some concerns I and others have had:1) It requires you to have a PC or Mac so you can initially set it up, and you need to connect to your PC to perform some kinds of operations, like setting up some e-mail accounts.2) Eye strain has not been an issue for me, and I use it mostly for reading. The display is fantastic.3) The keyboard seemed at first glance like it would be horrible. This is not the case at all. I am surprised at how good it is, and I can touch type with it efficiently when using the wide screen, or use it in Blackberry fashion when using the narrow screen.4) There have been some usability issues on web sites because not all of them support the iPad yet, at least not fully. There seems to be an effort afoot to replace Flash with a new standard, but meanwhile many videos cannot be viewed because the iPad does not support Flash.5) Magazine subscriptions are not widely available for the iPad.6) I am a life-long "book person", and have had bad previous experience with electronic books and PDF documents. I must honestly say that reading with the iPad has been superior to using a physical book in all ways but one: the ability to pre-read the book quickly, and as I use it more, I think I will find ways to approximate the value of a good preread. It's truly amazing. I have not tried the latest Kindle and similar devices, but I assume they are comparable to the iPad in readability and responsiveness. If you are a book person and resist these electronic gadgets, as I did, I recommend you try one out at a time when you can spend at least 15 minutes with one. It may sell itself when you become familiar with it.
For everything I do on the web--this is the right device for me. It is beautifully crafted and exceeds all expectations of what a powerful portable should be.At times I think it can be a bit faster and the Cellular could be a lot more robust. But in the end, I would highly recommend this device instead of a laptop ifyou browse the web, listen to music, watch videos, do email and play games. I would like to try this with a regular keyboard one day. It IS magic---and it ishundreds of times superior to an iTouch (which I love too).  And as I get older, I appreciate the crisp screens, the vivid colors, and wonderful portability of this device.It is a WOW if I ever saw one!
At work we have been exploring making pod cast. I felt I couldn't understand the process without reviewing so I decided to purchase this ipad. I contacted Apple 3 days off and on to get set up and 80% of the time techs had patience and understanding as we problem solved and reached some understanding. I have taken it from DC to Orono Maine in the few weeks I have used it and I find it protable and useful for taking notes, checking email, surfing and I gotta admit playing doodle and manging photos. I am just begining to understand the 3 g wifi differences I have blown through my monthly $25 dollars worth of data time in 2 weeks and I am trying to decide if I need a bigger plan or to manage my access differently.
The iPad is full of the promise for the future and when you buy it, that's what you are banking on - that things will be awesome in the future. I purchased the 64-Gig Wi-Fi version on day one and immediately had problems with it. I arrived at my hotel from my business meeting at about 5pm and wanted to play with my new toy. It took 3hrs to sync my 50 Gig iTunes Library because it kept crashing, it was nightmare because it kept finding "corrupted" files during the sync process and crashing - these are files I purchased in iTunes and had to DELETE before the sync would work and to make matters worse I can't re-download those files, so if I want another Digital copy of Terminator - that work, I would have to buy it (even though it had always synched fine before). It's why I loathe DRM. The hotel that I was in only used a hard wired connection, so I had to go down to the lobby to use the WiFi and set up all my apps which wasn't cool. Due to the lack of multi-tasking it took almost two hours to set up my apps like the Kindle, Marvel, etc. Because I could only download one book at a time and I had to sit there and watch the download progress bar. It was almost 11pm by the time I finally got everything setup.At the Airport, I didn't want to pay $10 for two hours of WiFi (another reason I hate WiFi only devices, most places charge too much money for it and it rarely works well), so I tried to watch a couple of movies and the screen completely washed out in the "bright" light. I couldn't see any movies that were "dark" like Harry Potter, Xfiles, etc.  After one day of minimal use this thing had Smudges all over the place, it looked ugly when turned off. Luckily the smudges don't really show when it's turned on.The real trouble started when I got home. The thing refused to stay connected to my Verizon Fios network. Every time it woke from sleep not only did I have to reconnect but I had to re-enter my Network ID, reading web sites became an exercise in frustration because it disconnected literally every 2 or 3 minutes. And a lot of Apps simply "crashed" the second the connection was lost. So it failed miserably at it's most basic function. I found it to be too big, heavy and uncomfortable to actually read in Bed, I actually had to lay it down in landscape mode with a little prop stand provided by the iPad case to read it. If I had to do that, I'd might as well use a laptop. I'm assuming I would have gotten used to holding if I had more time to play with it, but I only had an unreasonable 14 days to return it.When Apps work, they were beautiful to look at and use - Plants Vs. Zombies, Marvel, Comixology, ABC, Yahoo (surprisingly amazing free app), Kindle, Zinio, etc. The Apps is why you get this. The problem is a lot of these apps are way too much where they are .99 or 2.99 on the iPhone, they are inflated to $10 and up on the iPad. The price inflation is ridiculous, especially considering most of these apps won't work on your iPhone. I'd be willing to pay $7 or $8 if they worked on both.For a device that's $900 (it's only worth purchasing the 3G 64 Gig Model - you will fill up the 16 and 32 gigs quickly when the apps are averaging almost a gig), it's damn difficult to actually get my files onto the device. I have a bunch of Comic book .jpgs, word docs, etc. that I would like use, but have yet to figure out how to actually get them on the device. I broke down and bought the Pages App because that was supposed to make it easy, but it did nothing to help me get my files over. So that was a waste of money. Apple just screwed over iPad users by delaying the release of the SDK 4.0 that brings multi-tasking until this fall.So yes, I returned the WiFi version, I'm tempted to get the 3G version but $900 is just too much for a device that's only based on potential, and not what it actually is today. It also kills me that I kind of miss having it and I would be rewarding Apple for making the WiFi version so Gimpy that I'm forced to purchase the 3G when I already know how bad AT&T;'s 3G is.
I bought my iPad a few weeks ago, and I absolutely love it.  I do not have an iPhone, but I do have an iPod touch.  The iPad is almost like a large-scale iPod Touch or a small netbook computer that has really inexpensive, fun, and practical apps - the apps are the game changer for me.  Yes, there are other options out there that have apps, but not killer apps like those created for the Apple products.  The ebook viewer is exceptional, and movies are beautiful on the iPad.I hardly ever use my personal laptop anymore - instead I use my iPad to access all of the sites that I used to view with my laptop.  I travel a lot for work, and the iPad is like carrying my own laptop with me, but without all of the weight and bother (I already have a laptop for work).  If you like your iPod touch or iPhone, but want a bigger screen and a product with functionality that is between your iPhone and a laptop, then the iPad may be a good option for you.
Some people write insanely long reviews.  I have been guilty of it before.  Here's my not so short review.I had a hard time justifying this purchase.  I have a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet, a 24'' iMac, and 2 PCs I built for gaming.  This computer ABSOLUTELY fills a niche.Good:Easy to lug around in a bag, or in my car, or into a store, to a meeting, wherever.  Very light and portable.I can VPN to my MAC, use it as a remote control for my TV, read PDF books on it (love doing that), play games, and I am finding new cool stuff everyday.  Just today I learned to use it as an emergency GPS!Battery lasts forever.Internet everywhere.  Everywhere there is AT&T; that is.  It is nice to have a computerish device with connectivity anywhere, like at a store where you want to do some price exploring.Best:  Screen.  Unbelievable.  I put a few movies on here in case I fly or use the netflix app and it looks great.Bad:No multitasking.  Apple needs to speed it up, but it's coming. You shouldn't do any heavy multitasking but one thing that is annoying is I had a timer going and logged into another app.  Forgot about it and expected it would still go off when I logged over, but it didnt.No Flash.  Hasn't been very inconvenient yet.  Anyone who has taken any course in web design is taught that you design two sites - one for awesome computers and one for those people who replace a computer every 10-15 years.  Most sites have non-flash, but I have seen a few video/game sites that don't work.  Hopefully Adobe and Apple will rebuddyNo file system.  You need outside apps or cloud storage to save stuff.  Again, I don't expect to do heavy word processing or productivity on here, but would be nice to have a little "fake" drive to save stuff on.No camera.  You can hook up your flash drive or camera through 3rd party devices.  Not ideal Overall:  I love this thing.  I take it everywhere.  I bet the 2nd gen will be even more amazing.  If you are debating, don't hesitate.  Just visit the app store or a "top apps" site and check out the things you can do.  As people raise issues and innovative app designers have fun with newer features, this device will just get more awesome.
I bought this for my wife and its one of the most useful product I ever bought.  My wife loves this things and is constantly on it when she has any free time.  Our family basically fights over who gets to use it.  We are planning on getting another one.What we love about it--Long battery life - somestimes you can go for days with constant use.-Smooth touch screen interface - Its the most responsive touch screen of any device I ever use, everything is smooth, feels natural and polish.-Easy to use, great user interface.  I tried to teach my dad how to use a PC to do basic web surfing, it is almost impossible.  But he seems to OK picking this up and knowing how to use it.-Reading Books - (tip) you can convert (using Calibre) any book format (lit, doc, html, pdf, etc.) to epub and sync it using itunes to the ibooks app.  Also, you can send the epub file as an attachment to your email.  As long as you have iBooks app installed, you can open the attachment on your email using your iOS device and it will automatically put it into the iBooks app.-Internet - is great for web surfing.  Its instant on when ever you want to look for something on the web, very convinient.  Fun when you are watching tv shows, you can look up trivia or information.-Online Shopping - Amazon has an app and many other retailers as well.-Find reviews - example we use the Yelp apps often to find reviews of resturants in our area.  Much more convinient than booting up a computer.-Online Banking - I would rather trust the iPad banking app than using a PC to do banking.  I know a few people who lost money to fraud when they use the PC for transaction.  Too many virus these days.-Watch TV shows - One of the best Apps is the ABC network app.  We love watching Modern Family on it.-There is over 300,000 apps and games.  Many are either free or very low cost ( 99 cents).  My wife loves bejewel bliz on it and she can score higher on it than on computer because of the touch screen.  She also loves all the "dash games" like Diner Dash, etc.  Though I generally don't play video games, I found myself addicted to many of ipad games as well.  Right now I am playing Plants vs Zombies.  Very addictive.  There are also many education app to help children learn math, reading, etc.  Its so easy to use even my 2 year old nephew seems naturally know how to use this thing.  There is truely an app for anything.-email - its has a geat email app, you can set it up with Yahoo, Google, Hotmail, Exchange from work, etc.Cons: We are worried we might not get enough sun anymore because of this device ;-)
If you own an Iphone, it's basically a bigger version, without the camera and phone. Fast start up and great for internet browsing, ebooks, movies, games, youTube, mp3's, slideshows. Everything else you will need to use your macbook.  You won't be taking it out around town, it's too big. If you're traveling in a plane great for movies.
I got the Ipad 32gig unit on day of release. I would love to tell you a nice story of all the fun time I had waiting in line talking to all the people waiting to get one. But my Apple Store in Atlantic City had no one waiting for it I walked in picked mine up paid and walked out no line at all.Well jumping ahead 8 months to today my Ipad goes every where with me, to work, shopping to the doctors out to eat it is like my new best friend (gee I may need to get a real life). At first everywhere I went people were like "is that really an ipad I have yet to see a real one in person". They were amazed as I showed off my Ipad my sister was in awwe and was second guessing buying her daughter a nook until I told her the cost of the Ipad.The unit melts into your life you find your self reaching for it to do everything. If I am in the kitchen cleaning or cooking I watch shows from netflix on it. Sitting on the couch I scan the news while watching TV. In bed before going to sleep I play some quick games or read a book. It really fits nicely into your life allowing you to do some many things so quickly and easly.With the latest upgrade the added combined email mailbox is great reading mail is quick and easy. some of the apps I use each day are:PandoraEmailApp AdviceSafariTodoABC NewsABC PlayerYahtzeeScrabbleGoodreaderAnd belive me there are many more in fact this holiday EA put almost all of thier titles on sale for .99 each. Now that beats a PSP or GB game price hands down. Battery life is outstanding I use it all day and it stays charged.Now some of the downside of the Ipad. Keeping the screen clean can be a full time job. Storing shows or movies on the ipad quicking fills your Ipad up. If I am on a long trip and need to have a lot of videos with me I take my Archos 7 which has 5 times the storage space of my ipad 160 gigs. I had my Tivo transfering tv shows directly to my Ipad and it quickly was filling up. Syncing is another issue it takes a while to sync your unit in Itunes and working with phots on your unit is not easy if you sync folders with your pc then you cn not delete any photos from your ipad. You can also not really take notes on your ipad unless you can type really fast on the touch keyboard handwritting notes has a very long way to go on the ipad.And again we are back to my pet peve WHY IS THERE NO VIDEO PLAYLIST ON THE SYSTEM. Before the update there was a work around but now that is gone you like watching music videos you get to listen to them one at a time. If you read any of my other reviews of products like this you will know I hate when a simple function is left out like this.So yes even with these short commings I love my Ipad and no I am not sorry It does not have a camera on it I have a phone that has a camera. I will use my Ipad first gen at least until the Ipad 3 or 4 is out but only if it ofers something really great.
This device is great for business and just sitting at home and doing the internet, playing games and just having fun. This product is really functional for school, and everyday things. It is like having your computer in your hands or in your lap, everything there at your fingertips. It is good for traviling, just put in the case and go! Just so simple, right there at your fingertips! You can do PowerPoint, documents, and sprend sheets (you have to get the apps 9.99 each). When you are ready to type, the keyboard just pop up from the bottom of the screen. It is amazing to hold you document, your spredsheet or anything els in your hands, ready to go, just hit the powerbutton and go. The iPad has multi-tasking, just double click the home screen button and the home screen appears at the bottom of the screen while what you are woring on stays there. It is very thin. The iPad can run ipod and iphone apps too. The iPad comes with a wall charger, to set it up, you do need a computer, it comes with an instruction packet along with stickers.The battery is 10 hours long (I believe so). It has accessories you can buy from the apple store, or any other store. The keyboard is basicly the size of a laptops keyboard. I do recommend this product. When I first got it, I didn't like, now I LOVE IT!!!!I typed this on the iPad(I'm using my moms account)
I use this tablet for just about everything and love it.  I don't use it for reading books. I prefer paper. The only problem that I have Is that it does not support Flash. That has proven to be a great inconvienience at times.
Love my ipad. I have the 16gb wi-fi model, and I absolutely love it. As an adult student headed back to college, it's been a life-saver for me in class. Taking notes, annotating my notes, keeping organized, the calendar, checking email, it's able to do everything I need it to do and more. Thanks for the revolutionary product apple, and thanks for the opportunity to tell my side.Apple iPad in any size, I give it 5 starts. Best thing I could have bought for my college career, bar none.
Overall this is a good device. Lack of flash support, ability to save webpages and manipulate files makes it annoying if your are trying to do anything other than surf the web or play around. Not a serious business tool. Apple really should mend bridges so as to install flash support on these.
you can save $30.00 if you buy this on apple's website or best buy.  i don't know why amazon jacked up the price.
The iPad is a wonderful device that will meet some users needs, but not others. It is running a more powerful version of iOS 3 made specifically for the iPad, making this device very, very quick and snappy. The iPad is great for reading books or things like gaming, but it could not replace a laptop. Sure, it has things like iWork, mail, calendar, Safari; It already sounds like a mac, right? Wrong. The iPad isn't a mac, but it isn't an oversized iPod touch. It's right in the middle.Hardware:The iPad has a large 9.7 inch display, which is multitouch, can display HD video, and will not disappoint. The majority of the front of the iPad is the screen, so you get the best experience possible. The iPad comes in WiFi or WiFi+3G flavors, which both have options for a 16, 32, or 64 GB hard drive. One major flaw is the lack of a camera, on the front, or back. If they had one (which will most likely be added in the next iPad), they could have "Facetime" on the iPad so you could video chat with other iPhone, iPad, or possibly iPod touch users. The iPad is also equipped with a 1GHz Apple A4 processor, a built-in speaker, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. All the Apple standards.Software:The iPad is running iOS 3.2 (iOS 4 this fall) which is a customized version of the OS found on the iPhone and iPod touch. The experience is very similar to that on the iPhone, and that's a good thing. The iPad can run all the iPhone apps on the app store, plus all the iPad apps. That means that the iPad could do 225,000 and counting things. You can expect to see everything you've seen on the iPhone on the iPad, just blown up with more features (note: there are a few apps missing on the iPad, such as Weather and Clocks).iBooks:iBooks is an app by Apple that allows the iPad to be an e-reader and view books, magazines, newspapers, and pdf documents. The advantage of the iPad's e-reader is that it can display color photos, newspapers, magazines, and pdf files. The advantage of something like the Kindle 3G Wireless Reading Device, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6" Display, Graphite, 3G Works Globally - Latest Generation is that you can see the screen as if it were a real book; no light comes out of the display. They both do the same thing, its just that the iPad does 225,000 more things plus a bigger color touchscreen. You decide what the better choice is.Overall, the iPad is a great device. It is made for many things, not just one, but it does them all well. The iPad is great for use of someone such as a mom, who loves reading books or needs a little help in the kitchen (Hello, Epicurious app!). I've used the iPad for quite a while now, and am not disappointed. Just remember not to expect a laptop, but more of a new type of device. I would recommend it to anyone.
This is an amazing product. But it is not a netbook, or even a computer, exactly.I use it to read/view web stuff, pdf's, kindle content, tv shows, ect on my sofaand in bed. Sounds unambitious--but its a great convenience--easily worth theprice. If your used the itunes sync set up you'll have no problems getting contentonto the ipad. There is no file system per se--everything is organized through theitunes browser. Also available at itunes are huge collection of apps--small softwareapplications. Some are truly great--like the autodesk sketch app, the kindleapp, and the marvel comic app. The device is very fast and seamless; and thedisplay is stellar. If your intent on doing  work on the ipad--you willbe frustrated by its form factor and lack of a true file system. If your lookingfor a portable content browser/reader--you will find the ipad is revolutionary.PS--get the apple case or similar product.
Wow is all I can say about this device. The first thing  noticed from opening the box is the built quality. It is superb. It is very sturdy and had a nice heft to it while you are holding it. It only had four buttons (screen lock,home, volume rocker, and screen orientation lock). It fits very nicely in your hands and is made from very high quality materials. I would definently recommend a case though because if you drop it then you are screwed.The screen on this thing is amazing. Watching movies is a pleasure. I have a couple 720p movies on here and they look absolutely fantastic. Normal definition movies also look very nice. The bad side to the screen though is it gets many fingerprints. They are not very easy to wipe off but with a lightly damped cloth they come off easily and the screen looks brand new.The internet browsing is very fast on this. Pages load quicker than my net book. The multi touch is great when needing to zoom in. You can have numerous web pages up at once. For some reason though every no and then the Internet starts to preform very slowly but fixes itself after a couple of minutes, but this is most likely my router causing this. Typing is very good and I got adjusted to it easily. I prefer typing in landscape because it is easier as in portrait mode it is a little awkward. By the way this whole review is being typed on the iPad without the Bluetooth keyboard attachment. The lack of flash player is not a big letdown to me because YouTube still works fine and I do not go on many flash websites.The speakers on this are very good. They are surprisingly loud but the sound quality is not lost much when cranked up all the way. When played at normal volumes or through headphones you will be amazed at how well they preform. The only problem is when you start to turn up the volume the device starts to vibrate a bit, but it is most likely no big deal.The apps are very good. Gaming is great, although most of the good games you have to pay for. They're are a couple good free games like tap tap radiation and air hockey but besides that not many. Some good paid games I would recumbent are x-plane, nova, real racing, touchgrind, need for speed, and plants vs zombies. Although these games are great they come at a cost. All of them combined are over 50 dollars. These games though will keep you entertained for hours and most are redisigned for the iPad while adding new features. Also they're are many good apps ranging from some similar to word to others for keeping baseball box score. One very creative app I enjoy is magic piano which is very fun to play around with. There are also apps like netflix and abc player which are very cool also.The battery life is insane. It lasts forever. I have gotten 9-10 hours on this with extremely heavy use. This includes hours of YouTube videos and playing very graphic intensive games like x-plane and real racing. Video playback time will easily be 13-14 hours at half brightness.It take about 3-4 hours to completely charge it. And also right out of the box it comes completely charged.The Only cons would have to be-Fingerprint magnet-Lack of flash( but only a con for some)-Apps are expensive and not many good free ones-Connection problems(but most likely only my router)-Apps take up a lot of memoryI would recommend getting the 32 or 64 gb version(like mine) because memory on this will become very limited with 16 gb. Most apps or games are between 100-200 mb.Also adding movies and songs will take up a lot of memory. My iPad had over 25 movies and more than 120 episodes of family guy,  more than 400 songs, and with about 20 apps and games installed and it takes up about 40 gb of space. I would also not recommend buying movies from iTunes as they are very expensive and take up more space. A normal 2 hour movie is 10 dollars and takes up 1.5gb of space so download them online for more space saving.
I can truly say that out of all the devices I've owned, this is the COOLEST!  I am absolutely in love with the iPad. I do all my readings on it since I got it. I read books, pdfs, documents.. etc. The gaming experience is MUCH better than iphones and ipod touches. I use it a lot so sometimes I get into a state of "ergonomical fail" (if that's a word) and it could get heavy on my hands and it hurts a bit. But other than that I am absolutely fine with the product I think it's sleek and advanced. You could do a lot with it and it's much more practical that a laptop, given it's weight. I once used it as a GPS for an hour and a half drive -WiFi model. So you could do a lot of serious work with it. Hands down, the coolest device I've ever owned!!!.oO..If only it had the iphone 4 camera and facetime, ohhh it would be heaven!..Oo.

 Length:: 9:22 MinsYou can thank me later.  For summary judgment skip to the very bottom.  I'll add a video review once I get settled.I bought an iPad just so I could review it.  Figuring that it would be one of the more popular reviews out there, I decided that it would be in my best interest to take the time to run it through its paces.  And you know what I've discovered?  It really IS an oversized iPod Touch.  No, I'm serious - right down to the functionality within, the navigation, even the Settings menu, it's clear that they took the iPod Touch (or rather, the iPhone OS) and tweaked a few settings, enlarged some others, and slapped it onto a form factor reminiscent of, as one person put it, an iPod Touch ran over by a steamroller.  For crying out loud, the iPad even runs iPod Touch and iPhone apps in their native resolutions, it's like looking at the apps on those devices!But, I digress.  The first thing that I noticed about this device was the fact that everyone seemed to want it, yet really didn't know why.  I and a colleague spent weeks trying to identify a single use case for the iPad; I even went out on a limb long before I laid hands on one and said that the iPad is effectively a toy.  Now that I've used it, that's exactly what it is: a toy.  It's not for those who want to get things done.  It's for those who want a pastime.  Now mind you, there's nothing wrong with that - but that's a fact.  I also like to say that it's a jack of all trades yet master of none, which is also a factual statement.Next thing I noticed was the blatantly excessive setup steps which are more the fault of iTunes than the iPad.  See, if you're a MacBook owner, you're asked to sign up for iTunes when you first set up the laptop.  That's the same process for any Apple device that runs iTunes even if you don't plan on using it on a regular basis.  The problem is that iTunes is not smart enough to detect and merge duplicate accounts.  Obviously, if I've got two accounts with the same email address, it's probably a good bet that they belong to the same person unless the name is different, which it isn't.  iTunes registered my email address from when I owned an iPod Touch, yet used my username from my MacBook, even though the email address is the exact same.  The problem is that iTunes attaches your download history to the username, not to the email address.  This wouldn't otherwise be an issue, but for the fact that you can't even start using the iPad until you attach it to a Mac and connect via iTunes to activate it.  The problem is the account that it uses to do said activation vs. the account that has the stuff you wanted.You can probably see where this is going.- I had bought a number of apps on the iPod Touch, and thought I could download them again at any time (email address);- I had created a number of podcasts on the MacBook (username, or so I thought);- I tried to get iBooks, Kindle, Amazon Mobile and Netflix on the iPad along with all of the above (email address, or so I thought).First the iPad wouldn't sync properly.  It gave me a list of everything (both from the email address and the username) but wouldn't download content from either.  Then it told me to activate the MacBook for access to the apps.  Did that, and tried again.  The iPad still wouldn't sync the apps.  I tried to download them directly from the iPad; it attempted a download, then sat there.  I had to clear out the iTunes account on the iPad (which was the username), log out of iTunes on the MacBook (which was the username), then log back into both with the email address, which then allowed me to get the apps, though slow.  But then I couldn't get the podcasts or some music I had bought.  Had to repeat and log in with the username to get those to sync.  After much futzing I got everything set up - 2 hours of my life wasted to set up.  Probably not an issue if you'd never owned a MacBook or an iPod or an iPhone or anything like that.  Basically, if you'd never used iTunes it would probably go smoother as you'd not have anything to transfer.Let's get down to it, shall we?  I approach this review in terms of use case, so for you, find the use case that applies, and see if the statement is enough to deter (or encourage) you.My first thought:- THIS MIGHT BE A GREAT DEVICE TO HAVE AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE PLANE, AT THE HOTEL, ETC!...this was hard to debunk, but I managed to do it.  First of all, it IS a fun device for those places, but the limitations hold it back from the greatness that it could have been if it were to have a full flavor of Snow Leopard rather than an iPhone OS derivative.  Let me explain:  Most important, the device is too heavy to be carried and held for extended periods.  Because the entire back is aluminum, and because the screen is so thick, nevermind the battery, it doesn't lend itself to being held for a long time.  Yes, I know there are docks.  But if you're going to just dock the thing you might as well bring the laptop along.  Additionally, there were minor issues with the WiFi - I didn't have the "refuse to reconnect" issue.  What I experienced was unusual slowness from two different hotspots: my Mobile Hotspot, and my home wireless.  My Mobile Hotspot has run GoToMeetings.  It's not a slouch.  Yet, for some reason, iTunes struggled to open and was unbearably slow, as was Kindle.  Yet, on a netbook that I recently sold, on the same hotspot, Kindle was reasonably quick and snappy.  I know why there was a difference...the apps on the iPad are very graphics-rich and it's clear that it wants at least medium (3Mbps down) speeds on the WiFi for an optimal experience.  It works, but it's just not fun to wait 20 minutes for a book to download, I mean really.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- THIS COULD BE A GREAT DEVICE FOR RECEIVING AND SENDING DOCUMENTS TO CO-WORKERS!!...except for one small problem: interacting with Microsoft networks is nigh impossible, and file management is non-existent.  The only way to get a file on the device is to have it emailed to you or otherwise sent through MobileMe or iTunes.  If the data is sensitive there's no way to get it securely to your device (unless you have secure email screening services), since the iPad does not have any exterior ports for storage devices.  What's worse, since it's not running Snow Leopard, it means no VMWare, no Office 2008, no Office Online.  As much as some would hate to admit it, Microsoft Office dominates the workspace, and if a device cannot interact with those documents, it makes it hard to justify.  Even if the device can do other things, it's yet another (heavy) device to carry along with the user's regular computer/books/etc.My next thought (initiated by a co-worker):- COLLEGE STUDENTS COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS!!...I did read the Seton Hall announcement about giving all of their students iPads and MacBook Pros.  It must be nice to have so much money to throw around - and I suspect they're taking it out of the loans that the students are ponying up to attend, but I'm guessing that this one depends.  I mean, on one hand, yes, the convenience of being able to pull out a device and research something really quick might be a boon.  It also might be convenient to be able to listen to broadcasts or see webinars that have been posted on iTunes.  On the other hand, some colleges might not care much for the potential cheating that the iPad seems to encourage by its open access.  Of course, "guns don't kill people", but you see what I'm getting at.My next thought:- WOW!! A COLOR TABLET EREADER!!...and yes, it is this, and does it fairly well, but then you run into the problem of cost-benefit.  Some would justify it by saying "yeah, but it can do other things!!" which is true, but I don't look at it that way; if all I wanted to do is read books, I would get an eReader (I actually bought a Kindle a while ago.  Great device).  In order for me to justify a purchase, it has to be spot on with what I intend to use it for.  If I can't find a viable use case, I can't justify its price.  In truth, I couldn't justify buying it this time, but for the need to actually review it and attempt to help others with my experience.  But back on topic, the big issue with the reader is threefold: first, iBooks is terrible.  It screams "gimmick" from the moment you launch your first book.  Looks extremely well made, but there were some bad framerate issues when flipping pages, and I found myself wishing I could disable the animation.  Then there was Kindle, which thankfully didn't have the page flip animation, and what's more, Kindle showed how much more evolved it was than iBooks by virtue of it giving you freebie books and userguides along with the software, unlike iBooks which let you stare at a blank bookshelf.  The second thing to decide is whether or not the backlit LCD works for you.  Some are sensitive to it and prefer the eInk display.  I'll tell you this much - if you're trying to read outdoors, the iPad automatically loses!  It also loses in battery life AND multitasking, believe it or not ( the Kindle allows you to play music while reading while still managing to pull out days of use without the need to recharge ).So on and so forth...try as I might, I could not find a viable use case for the iPad.  It does so much and yet so little.  It's a very specific market that could truly benefit, but at that narrow of a market target, the price is a bit steep.  It's not way out there on this model, but definitely on the 3Gs.In other words readers:-=- What the iPad does RIGHT -=-- Convenience.  Powers on quick, ready to use at your beckon call.- Navigation is smooth, no real hickups on the interface that I could tell.- Tight integration with iTunes allows you to get books, magazines, movies, trailers, games, etc. at the push of a few buttons.- Decent speaker volume for watching movies or trailers, even has an equalizer to adjust the output quality.- The screen is brilliant and vibrant and easy on the eyes (but see WRONG below).- The 16GB model isn't that overpriced considering the technology (Which has been measured to cost about $250 to make).-=- What the iPad does WRONG -=-- Weight.  It's a heavy device, a VERY heavy device not meant to be held for long periods of time.- Glossy screen - just like the MacBook Pros, they just don't believe in matte or at least polarized screens; this thing is a straight up mirror in broad daylight.  Might consider an overlay.- No external ports i.e. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB, etc.  Yes, there's a dock port, but you know what I mean.  A DisplayPort would not have hurt Apple.- Initial setup is cumbersome if you are trying to add all of your previously purchased content.- iPhone/iPod Touch apps are stretched with no optimization or smoothing.- Because it's based on iPhone OS and not Snow Leopard, or at least a slimmer version thereof, it's extremely limited in productivity; not quite feasible for a workplace replacement device.- WiFi seems extremely slow; there are reports of WiFi issues across the web, so it may be an antenna problem with the first gens.  As we all know, Apple likes to use first adopters as guinea pigs and then release the good stuff later.- It truly IS an oversized iPod Touch.  The look, the feel, the navigation, the limitations, all are identical to those found on the Touch.  The only difference is the larger screen, which for some is more than sufficient, but I consider this a negative, because it doesn't stand apart much from the Touch, and it should.So...in summary, do I recommend it?  Well...depends.  The answer is an emphatic "NO" if you're looking for something to replace your PC entirely.  It's not happening.  It's a soft "YES" if you accept that the device is a fun add-on that is not going to replace anything - something to pass time, or accompany you on your travel or something.  As long as you are ok with that then it won't disappoint you.  But don't expect a laptop out of this thing.
A few months ago some people said it was the laptop killer.  I just received my iPad a few days ago and I am somewhat disappointed.  This review is as a first few days impression and I have yet to unlock all the changes that the developers at Apple had to do from the ground up.  Let me start with the pros.Pros:1. beautiful, and sleek display.  if you are accustomed to the iTouch or iPhone you will like the large display2. battery life says up to 9 hrs while surfing the web3. portable, slim, and lightCons:1. so far it feels like really just a big iTouch or the same as the iphone minus texting and phone2. does not have the capabilities to attach photos or files in emails3. moving your fingers across a large screen is much more work than using a mouse4. no flash or java applets capabilities5. pay another $30 monthly for the data plan eventhough you already have an iPhoneThough the iPhone remains my favorite device, the iPad will not kill the laptop anytime soon.  Once Apple figures out how to address the attach photos/files in emails, flash/java, and costly service data plan then it shall be given 3 stars.  Can I do without an iPad...yes...but having one around is more fun.
Great device. Does exactly as advertised and more.What I love:1. VideoNetflix, ABC, iTune transfered movies, and an amazing app called AirVideo that allows me to play video from my iMac or PC directly on my iPad without transferring it to my iPad.Stunning smooth video, no complaints.2. emailI've got 7 email accounts on this thing and it functions flawlessly.3. Internet browsingI'm very happy with the browser, especially the speed and finger gestures. It's intuitive and fast.4. Work appsI'm an IT admin and this thing is a great tool for admins like me.VPN is built in.VNC and RDP function nicely for remote access to my work environment.Dropbox keeps my files synced.And a little app called TeamViewer lets me fix my family members computers remotely.5. Planning and keeping track of my daily activities is easier with the multitude of To-Do apps, calendar, and Notes Pro app.  Everything is in one place.6. Kindle/iBooks are great. Super convenient in a way that's got me reading books again.7. KAYAK Flights is a fantastic app to check flight pricing whenever I want.8. Keeping up with the latest news on USA Today, SCI FI Wire, TUAW, DVICE, Ingadget, as well as Twitter, Woot, eBay, Newegg, and Craigslist couldn't be more convenient.9. Blogging, Cooking, weather, games, music on Pandora, movie times, tv guides, Yellow and White pages, writing pad (handwriting recognition), millage tracker, etc are just a few of the "useless" apps people complain about and I use every day.As far as the iPad shortcomings, we all knew what they were before it came out.  So why buy it if it's not what you want?I'm good with no camera.  I've got a camera on my iMac and video calls are uncomfortable and unnecessary.  Why would I want it on my iPad?People complaining about the lack of high-def video-out kill me.  It's a portable device, not a 50 inch plasma screen!  Use it for what it's intended for and get over it.Lack of Flash can be annoying, but that shortcoming wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I don't miss it.I own a netbook. It's been sitting on my desk for months, unused. Video stutters, internet is difficult to use, audio is terrible, battery life is weak.  And that's after upgrading to 2gb of memory.In other word, it's not better than my iPad and I'm selling it.The biggest plus of my iPad is convenience.  It's always on and ready.  I rarely use my computers anymore.So, if you do some due diligence and actually find out what an iPad does, you should be able to make an educated decision on whether it's for you or not.I don't believe a windows based tablet can come close to functioning as nicely as an iPad. An Android tablet might.I don't think I'm the only one happy with these, close to 1 million have been sold.  And that's before the 3G models have hit the shelves or sales outside the US have started.Ya, Steve Jobs really messed up with the iPad.  Guess the stock holders should get rid of him before Apple stock hits 300 and makes them more money than they can count...
Well, I got the iPad a week back directly from Apple (Barclays offers 12 month interest free financing) and bought some accessories from Amzn (my favorite website ever)Getting to the point - do we see this as an enlarged iPhone replacement or a *Victoria Secret* ASUS EEC PC replacement? Well, I have to draw upon my teenage kink and say - it depends :)As a phoneThe iPad can load Skype and so one can buy a wireless bluetooth headset..I have made quite a few calls using Skype and the reception quality is acceptable. Without the headset, the mic and steereo quality is superior. Most important of all- the speaker *does not burst* like my google phone.As a laptopThe iPad can load Windows for (Word, Excel and Powerpoint). Need to purchase additional software. The keypad is sensitive enough and superior to the Google phone. BTW I have emails from 7 email accounts coming into one inbox.As a GPSGoogle maps comes preloaded.Big screen, superior resolutionAll in AllPls. use Cntrl F and search for the keyword "superior" in my review. I have to say that any experience on the iPad is nothing short of superior quality. I have an ASUS eec PC, a Nexus One phone and now the Ipad. With all three devices sitting on my desk - given a choice, I would prefer to call upon my iPad to make phone calls, browse the web, check emails and navigate.Vitamin MiPad plus accessories - $700 (16GB + Wifi + 3G)Yearly Operational cost  - $420Opportunity cost (phone plus internet) - $960Monthly interest free payment for the iPad et al - $58Monthly savings on getting rid of the dubious phone bill - $45Break even - 15.5 monthsVerdictIf one spends time / most of the activities in a sitting position as opposed to walking / running, not obsessed with picking up every incoming phone call, enjoys reading in-depth articles on the Wall Street Journal and NY Times, enjoys Mozart,Beethoven et al  playing in the background and enjoys people starring at you as if you are a homo-erectus descended from a far off goldilock planet - get an iPad messenger bag (with a strap) and hey - don't forget to get the iPad :)Disclaimer: The above review is based on certain assumptions. Furthermore, it does not take into account time value of money. Pls. examine your options carefully before making a decision
I truly have no need for a laptop anymore after purchasing the iPad - gave mine to the wife.  The gap between what you can do (and realistically would do on the road) on a tablet vs. a laptop is closing rapidly.  I do use my desktop at home for a few programs (photoshop, illustrator) but even at home I often find myself reaching for the iPad before using the computer.  It is excellent for reading (Amazon books and PDFs for professional material).  I also use it for language studies, finance, news etc.  I type on the screen just as fast as on a keyboard.  And drawing on the iPad (takes a little getting used to) is a lot of fun.  I can print on the WiFi too but the printer list that is supported is not a long one yet (do some research if you intend to use it for this) The battery life is phenomenal.  Tablets really are the best way to go and the iPad is a great choice!
I am surprised at how much I am using my iPad.  I expected to use it mostly for movies, pictures and email, but I have had it for a 3 weeks and am using it all the time.  I also have an iPhone and some have call the iPad a glorified iPhone.  In some ways it is, but it does much more, although it still can't make calls.  I find it easier to use, and of course easier to see, than my iPhone.  I downloaded an application that allows me to view and edit Microsoft Office Exel and Word which now has made my old computer start to collect dust.Yes, there are some websites I can't view completely due to not having Flash but so far, it's been a minimal issue.  The iPad is easy to turn on and off and to set the airplane mode when flying.  I bought a few extras to go with my iPad, such as a case with an adjustable stand and a bluetooth keyboard.  Both are necessities to me.  And of course the apps are plentiful and useful.  My only caution about the "free" apps is that many aren't really free.  They might be a 30 day free trial or you need to upgrade (for a fee) to make them work best.  They often don't tell you that in advance, or at least I didn't read far enough in the description.  I did download a hidden object game and really like how easy it is to enlarge the picture on the screen. I haven't uploaded my iPod yet, but it will be nice to have my music on my iPad when I'm traveling. I can also download books from the Kindle onto the iPad which will save me from carrying another device.Overall, the iPad is getting used much more than my laptop computer.  I just got back from a 3 day camping trip, and the only electronics I brought was my iPad.  I have the $25/month plan from AT&T; so I can either use the AT&T; 3G or any public wireless to connect.  I highly recommend it.
I already loved the iPad before iOS 4.2. It is the perfect device for the consumption of content. (I don't read books outside in open sunlight.) I am happy now to store tons of magazines and books, without the requisite piles of paper in my home, and the ability to take those books and magazines with me. I love to watch movies via the Netflix app and TV programs via the ABC app, in addition to iTunes rentals and purchases. (I tried the Hulu Plus app but the Hulu library for the iPad app differed from the library available if you watch on your computer. That was unacceptable for me.) As a graphic artist and photographer, the iPad is a perfect device to display images/designs to clients and some photographers are able to wirelessly transmit images directly from the camera to the iPad, allowing clients to view images as they are being taken. Amazing.I have not had the wifi or syncing problems cited in other reviews and I have owned both a wifi version and a 3G iPad. (I prefer the 3G device for its hardware GPS. The wifi version is able to give you your approximate location but "close enough" was not satisfactory for my usage. If you're traveling and need the GPS function in say, a moving car, you'll need the 3G data plan unless your car is equipped with wifi, which is unlikely.) Some complain about the lack of an SD card slot but I have no problem with the optional Camera Connection Kit, which provides both a plug-in SD card reader as well as an USB port (which can be used with your own USB card reader or even USB headphones or mics).While I use the onscreen keyboard when necessary, I prefer to use the Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard. I do not miss Flash on websites. (I usually click through flash intros anyway.) I don't miss the lack of a camera because, as a photographer, I've never been happy with the results of a camera with the optics/resolution limits required to install it on a phone/mobile device. I find the device's attempts to correct my spelling annoying (if I don't watch, it will change both my first and last names). And while the iPad response is snappy, no multitasking or ability to run programs in the background made using the device just a bit inelegant, having to always end one app to start another.The lack of multitasking changes with iOS 4.2. While not yet available to the general public (it is slated for release this month), I couldn't wait and installed the Golden Master release (almost ready for prime time) and it has transformed my device into something more along the line of "magical." Switching back and forth between open apps speeds up the process completely. A double-press on the iPad's home button reveals the multitasking menu, screen orientation lock, screen brightness and volume sliders and play/pause controls. While I don't have a new AppleTV, I can send audio items to my Airport Express with speakers attached through AirPlay. I have not been able to preview AirPrint (where you'll be able to send iPad documents to some printers) as it requires a Snow Leopard update for my desktop computer that is not yet released. In the meantime, I had no problem emailing items I wanted printed to a computer but look forward to seeing if AirPrint will have the same effect on printing what AirPlay has on streaming content.While other tablets can claim to be more capable (a Windows tablet can run full-fledged Windows applications and this able to do many more things) none will be able to compete with the elegant interface and ease of use that the iPad presents. Apple's iOS is designed for mobile devices, taking full advantage of the Apple multi-touch interface, making the iPad the most intuitive tablet you'll ever find. If you're interested in video chatting (and using Apple's Facetime), I would wait until iPad 2.0, which will likely be announced in the first quarter of 2011. For myself, I'll leave the video chatting to my phone or laptop. The iPad is perfect for my use as is.Printing, which also comes with iOS 4.2, is still not available to me to preview as it requires a pre-release Snow Leopard update to my laptop computer. While it poses no problem for me once the SL update is released, I might be upset if I found out, after the fact, that in order to get the full function of the iPad, I need the newest Mac OS release. That eliminates anyone still using PowerPC macs, since Snow Leopard only works on Intel-based Macs.
I know that I need to put a more detailed review of my iPad into this forum. I am just a little angry about how bad and good this product is. Before deciding to buy, Google iPad sync problems. There are many problems and they are real. I have had to restore my iPad at least 6 times to get it to work and right now it is a paper weight. It does not synch with my latest edition Dell laptop. No music. No apps. I will update this review at a later point and hopefully it gets better at some point in the future.Beware. Their are issues that are major with syncing with iTunes. When it does work it's great. Right now it is not working.
Five years ago I didn't believe that Apple had anything more significant to offer than a fancy MP3 player. Apple computers are still a novelty to at least some degree,  and I fully accept that. The iPhone is what led me to believe that Apple had the potential to change the landscape if mobile computing. The iPad is something I have been waiting for since I unwrapped my iPhone. The idea of a larger screen mixed with a seductively beautiful and wildly simple user interface made me ready to throw my laptop out the second the iPad was announced in San Francisco. The iPad is not perfect, but in my experience no computing product has ever achieved that distinction. Upon unwrapping the device the customer is struck by the familiar face of an iPod Touch enlarged to dramatic proportions. This visual has become one of the most harsh criticisms which the iPad has had to endure. Apple has a knack for innovation wrapped within the familiar. Upon a quick sync with iTunes the home screen opens with the sparse series of apps most familiar to owners of the first generation iPod Touch: Settings, iPod, Photos, iTunes, calendar, YouTube, mail and contacts, maps and the app store. The look and feel of each of these apps is considerably more expansive and longtime owners of iPhones will instantly fee an almost palpable sense of freedom as their fingers have space to explore, to touch the giant virtual buttons Apple presents.  When connected to Wi-fi the user is able to begin expanding their library of apps through the App Store. Thus brings me to one of my primary concerns with the iPad, price inflation. My first purchase was Angry Birds HD, an app which slides in at a wallet-crunching 6 dollars considering the gameplay is nothing more than flinging little birds against large structures to destroy little green pigs. One finds that 90 percent of iPad apps suffer from this rampant price inflation which will leave most users groaning. I have hope for the iPad app store, however despite the rampant sales of the iPad it is at best a niche product, thus the so-called "gold rush" for ipad exclusive apps might be somewhat overplayed.  From a hardware standpoint the iPad is just as capable and well-developed as any piece of Apple hardware. The touchscreen is responsive and the screen is bright and vivid. The keyboard requires a learning curve and if you have never used a touchscreen Apple product you have a long road ahead of you. I personally had little problem with it (I composed this review on my iPad). Finally, a note about iBooks. The iBook store has a beautiful format an reading is a pleasure. The major issue arises from the lack of selection at the time of this writing. This problem can be fixed with the Kindle app from Amazon which brings the robust library of Amazon to an equally attractive and comparable E-Reader to their flagship Kindle device. The battery life allows for a vast amount of tasks to be performed on a single charge, including games, video and other tasks which would typically be considered very draining on battery. As I have already mentioned, e iPad as a device is not perfect, but it makes an excellent companion and you'll soon find your laptop collecting dust.
This tablet did not live up to all the hype for me to be completely happy.  I went to the Apple store and this was the only one near my price range.  I loved all the apps Apple provides but the 16 GB limit, work document limitations and the steep price forced me to return it.  This is not to say that I wouldn't be back for the next generation because I will, hoping that the price comes down and the features are improved.I loved the book reading option (comes in handy for trips) and viewed movies looked  great.  I did not find the screen too glossy for viewing as noted by some but then I added a protective skin to the screen.  Playing games on this device was fun for this novice.  The ipad does not allow for multitasking so listening to music on this device is not really an option I would use.  The iwork application needs lots of improvement, it was slow and did not always work for me.  The battery life was good, it allowed for weekend use (a little more then 7 hours?) before having to recharge.  It was easy to use but I had a hard time connecting it to my printer.  The ipad is slim and lightweight, easy to carry around but invest in a protective sleeve.  It was slower then I'd like to adjust after turning on its side (comparing it to my ipod) but that's getting picky.I think this tablet is a great media device but touting it as an all-in-one is over reaching.  I have yet to find the gadget that has the perfect blend of media, portability (with healthy battery life) and document functions.  I am looking into the Gigabyte M912x Notebook Umpc 160g 8.9" Touchnote Mr or the Lenovo S10-3t 0651-37U 10.1-Inch Multitouch Netbook (Black).  They're around the same price point and have  touchscreens that swivels to fold into a tablet and then fold back into a netbook for protection.You buy an Apple product for the cool apps and this device is no different.  I love the concept of the gadget but need it to perform more work to justify the purchase to myself.  I do not need another media device.  I have my fingers crossed that the 2nd generation will be better.
First let me start off by saying this review is from MY experiences. With that said, I was thinking of getting a netbook b/c I have a 17" notebook which is heavy and difficult to carry around on long or short trips.  I decided to get the iPad instead knowing the flaws like no Flash websites, no USB port etc.  What I have found is that 100% percent of the reviews I read prior to buying failed to mention a lot of small detail left out for the average user.  I don't own an iPhone or iTouch so I may mention features that are already familiar to people who own these devices.  There are many apps but only a few are any good and most of the good ones you have to pay for.  I purchased a game "Super Monkey Ball 2" for iPad and it looks and plays great!  I tried the Netflix app and to my delight I was able to stream a movie and it looked really good.  Now keep in mind that these new TV/Blu-ray players that have netflix streaming, you have to have an unlimited Netflix acct to stream movies and I have the 2 at a month plan so this is A+ for me.  Now I can sit on the sofa or in bed and stream a movie.  Sometimes the wifi signal is not strong when using the net and you will get a timeout msg that reads "Safari Cannot open page  because the server stopped responding". Also, for those of you who haven't heard some of the iPads have connectivity problems when re-connecting to an already established wifi connection.  Apple says only 2% of iPads have this problem.  Either I have really bad luck or Apple is low balling the percentage as I have this problem with my iPad and I purchased it on day of release.  It's really annoying and you either have to wait like from say 10mins to 2 days to re-establish the wifi connection.  It's unpredictable.Now for PC Users, you can NOT charge this device from your computer while syncing. You will get a message next to the battery level that reads "not charging".  I went to the Apple store to complain and the workers had never heard of this problem.  I had to investigate and figure out that the iPad users I spoke with in the store were Mac users.  The employees at Apple really don't know jack about the iPad except for what you've already seen and read.  It's very frustrating and I fault Apple for being over-kill on the secrecy (sp?) of the products. Finally I read the manual and it specificly states that the iPad must be charged from the wall charger.  If you are like me your wall outlets are filled to the max. I was going to return it and was told that a 10% restocking fee would apply which is $50 so I kept it.LIKES:I like the Google maps app. I got directions and put the device in the car and it holds the map/directions even though I lost the wifi connection.  When I got lost, all I had to do was drive to Micky D's and get a free wifi connection and even though there isn't GPS in the wifi model, it will map to your current location which is great. I found I was only 6 blocks away from my destination. I have a problem reading the small type in Thomas Guides (CA residents know what this is) so being able to enlarge the map made reading the streets a pure joy.The iBook store will let you sample read any book you have an interest in.  The sample comes in the form of a download to your bookshelf. You can enlarge the font but you only have two sizes to choose from.  The backlit is great b/c I sat on the sofa reading a book without the need of extra light and the room was completely dark. The page turning is very fluid and instead of swiping you have the option of just tapping the screen and the page will turn superfast.It's great for using in the bathroom on the toilet and I know some of you do this, I've seen the photos online! lol  I have also used the internet radio while in the shower.  You sit the iPad on the toilet seat and turn it full blast.  Full blast is not distorted but it has it's limitations.  I was driving to work on the freeway and was listening to an audiobook with the iPad in the passenger seat with the windows rolled down since I don't have air conditioning. It was a lost cause b/c traffic drowned out the volume of the audiobook.I downloaded the digital copy of the latest "Batman" movie and it looked and sounded great!Though you can't multi-task yet, you can listen to songs you've preloaded on your iPad from the speaker and still browse the net at the same time.It's great using the iPad at the dinner table instead of lugging and proping my 17" laptop on the table. Hardly takes up any room on the table.I love the calendar as it has an alarm that goes off even when the iPad is powered off.  I totally forgot an appt I had until I heard the alarm on the iPad and read the msg.The iPad fell off the counter about 3ft to a carpeted floor and did not break and still works 100%! Not on purpose mind you, I'm not that stupid. lolWhen you remove the iPad from the box it has a think plasitc wrapping around it. Keep this! As I found that the iPad doesn't resist fingerprints as claimed.  However, I found that keeping the plastic sheet on the iPad will protect it from fingerprints and it's still fully functional. You could also buy a screen guard but this is the ghetto screen guard as I like to call it.  Hey, I saved money. Plus you can easily remove it and put it back on when needed.DISLIKES:I do photography so I was excited to find you could load photos on the iPad. What I don't like is that you have to do it from iTunes and sync the folders to your iPad.  You cannot delete photos directly from your iPad even though you can click on a specific photo and a delete button will appear but when you touch it, nothing happens.  I read the manual and it confirmed you cannot delete from the iPad itself.The manual itself is not included with the iPad, you have to read the manual from the Apple website for which the iPad has a built in fav link to the manual.  the thing is if you are having a problem and don't have a wifi connection, forget reading the manual.There is a youtube app and videos stream really fast with hardly any waiting.  You cannot rate vids using the youtube app even if you are logged into your acct. Everytime I would press the rating, nothing would happen but I notice the youtube website has been revamped to only include a like or dislike button.  The youtube app hasnn't been updated to reflect this change.  If you go to the youtube website and login, it took me 10mins to load and play a 2min HD video.Even though it is also an eReader, the iBook app has to be installed. It's free but what it doesn't do is sync ibooks you have purchased from other sources so don't think you'll have a one-stop iBook shop.  Also, very few books on iBook. Don't think just b/c a book is popular or from a known author that you will find it on iBook.  For instance, they have no iBooks by noted author, Maya Angelou who wrote and read President Clinton's inaugural poem.The keybooard takes some getting used to. While it is QWERTY you have to keep your fingers in the air like pretend typing and extend each finger to the letter you want but eyes must be kept on the keyboard or you'll easily type the wrong letter as a standard keyboard you can feel where the keys are.  Also, there is something called predictive text where you will start typing and a word will pop up underneath your word it will show a word it thinks you are typing.  Luckily the people at the Apple store explained to me how this works.  If the word that pops up is the word you are typing, then you hit the space bar and it will insert or complete the word you are typing.  The thing is if you are abbreviating a word and not looking it will insert the wrong word.  For instance I was leaving a comment on facebook and I typed "OMG" but when I hit the space bar the iPad inserted "OMB".  I didn't notice until I left the comment.This device has a copy and paste function which I understand is on the newest iPhone, well this function is annoying b/c it pops up all the time when I'm not trying to copy anything and I know no way to turn this off.The search feature in iBooks is not as comprehensive as Amazon.  For example, you can only search exact titles or authors of books.  You can't search by subject mattter.  If you search the word "gay" it will only bring up books or authors with that word. Where as Amazon it will bring up books that fit the subject matter as well as titles and authors. So you have to know the exact book you are searching for.In summary if you are on the fence, wait for the HP Slate or 2nd generation iPad which will have built-in multitasking which should arrive mid-summer.  If I like the HP Slate then I will sell the iPad but I find the more I use it, the more I like it despite it's flaws.  If you live near an Apple store go try it out for yourself.
First if you want the quick sumery here it is. Take the iPod Touch give it a big screen and remove the camera and you have an ipad. That's all this is for better or worse, a giant iPod Touch. Now don't get me wrong, that has it's pluuses but it's obvious iOS was designed for smartphones and ipods, not tablets.The good...- A large screen, great for playing games and watching movies.- The WiFi + 3G version can use the web on the go.- No viruses unless you jailbreak it, even then the chances are small.- Responsive screen, that has the same scratch and fingerprint restive coating as the iPhone.- Pretty fast, though in reality we have nothing to compare it to. The only comparison comes from the Galaxy Tab, and I can't find one yet to test.The Bad...- You are restricted to the app store. Thus it won't be able to use software that Apple doesn't approve. IOn general the iPad app store is more expensive than the iPhone one as well. The App Store is fine for a phone, but is too restrictive for a tablet.- No Adobe Flash. Say what you will about Flash, but it is a vital part of many websites. Until sites move to HTML5, this missing feature will greatly limit your web experience.- Limiting browser. Mobile Sufari may be the best mobile browser, but on a tablet designed to display the full web, it's failing become obvious. Simply put many websites look messed up or don't display at all on it.- No external ports. All you get is the iPod connector port. You can't expand the memory, use USB devices. This is another carry over from the iPhone, but it just doesn't cut it on a tablet.- Not all apps are desgned for the larger screen. While many devs have adopted their apps to fit the larger screen, many still don't work or are poorly implimented. Trying to run an iPhone app on the iPad looks horrible and is very awkward to use. Thus your selection of apps is actually much smaller than Apple claims.Overall I think this was a good starting point, but I suggest wating for the next iPad or looking at one of the comepting Tablets coming in 2011.
I received my new iPad this past week and have been exploring the capabilities. I have to agree that the iPad is a very impressive device. I've only used my iPad with my home wireless network, but I anticipate that will I use it for casual browsing and reading more than my laptop. For more detailed browsing, correspondence, etc., the iPad is not really a practical alternative to the laptop. The iPad is well suited for the social networking functions with some nice apps for accessing Facebook, Twitter, etc. For those who are considering purchasing an iPad, I recommend it for entertainment use though it is not an essential product for the average computer user.
**this is my first Apple product to own** I purchased the 32GB wifi version of the Apple Ipad. I did not purchase it for any other reason than for entertainment purposes, and for that it fufills everything I expected of it. I'm happy that I did not purchase the 3G version, because it was simple to tether to my 3G cell phone for free. Simple couple steps that saved me a couple hundred dollars. Also purchasing a ton of apps, and putting almost a thousand songs on the built in Ipod I haven't needed to think twice about the memory. Unless you download tons of movies, I wouldn't suggest to anybody purchase anything bigger than the 32GB version. I've come to realize most of the complaints that you hear about the Ipad are easily worked around (multi-tasking, flash player, etc).Pros:(1) the USER INTERFACE(!!!) is something that no "ipad-killer" (which by the way, you know you're with the right company with every other companies product is advertised as a "Ipod killer".. "Iphone killer".. "Ipad killer"..) haha, I mean lets be real, no consumer cell phone has ever "killed" the Iphone, Ipod, nor will any consumer product kill the Ipad nor come close.(2) the WOW FACTOR(!!!) everytime you're in public with this bad boy you'll get a ton of "ohhhhs" and "ahhhhs" which is definitely cool.(3) fast, responsiveCons:(1) expensive, but the cool factor helps(2) expensive(3) kind of stuck to the Apple world of Apps unless you jailbreak your device. not suggested, but i've never had any issues with my jailbroken device.(4) 70% of App Store apps are paid versus 30% of Android Market appsAll in all, I love my Ipad. Wouldn't take it back for the world! ENJOY!
I love the iPad, but I bought this using a gift certificate thinking it was the 64GB Wifi 3G. It was priced just a little bit more than the one on the apple store, but be careful.  This one is not 3GGGGGGGG, but its $130 MORE than Apple sells it! I should have been paying more attention, but this is the first time Amazon was soooo far over the price elsewhere. I was stunned. Learned a very good lesson.
I cant help but think the Ipad is a glorified Iphone but love its ability to play media and be used as a book reader.  The big negative for me is the inability to see any Flash product and all those web sites that run FLASH. I know Apple hates FLASH but really if you cant see thousands of web sites and the product is designed to browse the web I cant help but feel the customer has been placed into this fight and for $700 dollars I think it serves to only upset apple customers. I wish they would fix this and quick.  I don't want a $700 book reader or DVD player.
I travel several times a year and have wanted something significantly lighter than my MacBook Pro. The iPad easily fit in my shoulder bag for the flight. Very useful for a nine hour flight. The UI is excellent.The apps that I need are available and work quite well.Any drawbacks that I might mention are that many of the iPhone app developers have yet to configure theirapps for the iPad. So, we use iPhone version apps on the iPad. As far as functionality is concerned, there is no difference. The graphics aren't as crisp as the ones made for the iPad though.Next, is the keyboard. If you already have an iPhone, there's nothing to this. It's actually a bit better than the phone'skey board. My one request is that it be a bit bigger.Lastly, Flash will come in handy when it finally arrives on the iPad. There are rumors that a generic Flash softwarewill appear soon.I am very happy with my purchase. My iPad works well in cafes, the train, planes, hotel rooms, anywhere. You cancache a lot of web content on it so it isn't terribly necessary to have the 3G connection. The games are great as wellas the Kindle and iBook apps.
First, as some background, I am not a so called "Apple" person. I think I might be the only person that does not own an iPhone or any other Apple product. However, I was looking for a netbook and was intrigued by the iPad. I checked it out in the store and then went to a friend's house to play around with his. I was sold when I saw the Netflix app whereby you could stream your instant queue. I also thought the user interface was incredibly easy. So easy that I am planning on getting one for my mom who has never used a computer.I have been using it for 2 weeks now and the device is doing everything I would want from checking email to surfing the Internet. I am also watching television and movies on it and trying out the different apps. I have actually taken it to the store now because the epicurious app is great and I just shop for the recipes in the store. The only downside and the loss of 1 star is the lack of a front facing camera. I would have like to be able to use Skype on this device and most netbooks have this capability. I am sure Apple will put this in the next version and will certainly upgrade when that happens.
I've been playing with my iPad for about a week and am very satisfied with it. As people here have noted, it's not a replacement for a laptop, although the ability to download iWorks in an iPad version does help there. For me, it's fine because I tend to use it late at night or in the morning, and on the weekends when I can sit in my overstuffed easy chair with my favorite microbrew or glass of wine, read my email or browse the web, and feel both decadent and efficient at the same time. :-)Here are the pros and cons:1. Absolutely drop dead gorgeous screen.2. Screen has an oleophobic coating to repel fingerprints, although I've read that wears off over time.3. Very fast switching between apps, minimizing the need for true multitasking.4. Great battery life, up to eight hours, although I haven't ever run it down in a single user session more than to 75%.5. Wifi seems to work just as well as my laptop in terms of range and speed.6. The ability to upgrade to 64 gigs of internal RAM, which I did, although I'm not sure I really needed it.7. Powerful cut and paste feature which I'm still learning how to use correctly. But tapping the screen in various places selects text and graphics in different ways which I haven't totally figured out.8. Even if you don't have iWorks, I found you can cut and past webpages into Notepad. It won't import graphics but you get the text, which is all I need most of the time. The nice thing there is that you can edit the documents at that point, although I doubt I'll be doing much rewriting of anything I grab off the web, but it's useful for making your own notes and comments.9. Standard DVD-R and MPEG-2 videos that I've compressed from about 4 gigs down to about 1 gig MPEG-4 H.264 files to save space look great on my iPAD. You can see some interleaving artifacts of course but they don't look grainy. They still look fine and they take up 1/4 of the space.Here are the cons:1. Although the screen is great, there's about a one inch margin of wasted space around the outside of the screen. Hopefully Apple can eliminate that with newer models.2. Some people may find it heavier than expected. That's because it has two beefy internal batteries which provide the long battery life. But holding it up and trying to read with one hand could prove tiring for some users for any length of time. I usually just prop it in my lap in my easy chair so it's no problem.3. Recharging is a little slow over the USB cable but since the battery life is so long, I haven't found that a problem yet since I can usually use it all day and recharge overnight.4. No true multitasking, but as I said, it's not a serious problem because loading and switching between apps is very fast. Plus the screen size would make having multiple windows open less practical anyway since it's still not as big as a typical laptop, which is fine, because otherwise it would be almost as heavy.5. I bought the Travel Kit Plus case to store and protect the unit. It works just fine, but my only complaint is the price, which is [...] for a case that is basically sort of like one of those padded, zippered book protectors that you can buy which are more like [...]. But the case is certainly fancier than one of those and worth more than 12 bucks. But [...] is a but much.6. A minor point here, but the Travel Kit includes a plastic travel stand, which is a nice feature, but it's too big to fit easily into its zippered pocket. The fit was so tight it was very difficult to get out and you can't get it back in very easily either, and you wouldn't want to for fear of tearing the webbed pocket material. Fortunately you can just store it in the one big pocket.7. Some people have mentioned the lack of a camera, but I don't need or want one so that wasn't an issue with me.All in all a very cool, fun device with only a few shortcomings but with enough power, speed, and utility so that it works fine for me. Other user's experience may vary. Whichever way you decide, good luck with decision!
Guess I'm not the only PC-loving fan that bought the iPad.  Like others, I've also never owned a single Apple product.Before the iPad came out, I was in the market for a portable laptop (not netbooks).  In fact, I bought a 14" Win7 laptop with a blu-ray drive & hdmi output.  It was a great laptop.  However, within a week...it was taking longer & longer to boot-up.  In addition, when I bought it...it was advertised at 4.5 hour battery life.  When I used it, even after fixing all the settings, I was only getting 3 hours at most.  To me, it was too much of a disappointment so I returned it.Later, someone told me that a macbook has 7+ hours, so I figured it was worth checking out.  However, when I got to the store...I ended up getting the iPad.  Why, you might ask?  Well...here's what I was looking for:1.) Long battery life2.) Portable & light-weight3.) Fast boot-up time4.) Can connect to the internet via wi-fi G+N5.) Can play music & moviesYes, the Macbook can do all that...but being so used to the PC interface, I didn't like the Mac interface.  The iPad was completely different all together & everything was very intuitive.  So far, the iPad hasn't disappointed me in any of those categories.  I love being able to turn it on & connect to the internet within a minute.  I love not having to charge it after watching 1 movie.  I love how light it is.  I love how fast it responds.  I love it's small footprint.  I love how highly-customizable it is.  There's a lot of things I love.However, there are a few things that I didn't love (though not enough to make me want to return it).1.) It does not play flash --> meaning it cannot play hulu, cwtv, or even the subtitles on youtube. I knew it didn't play flash, but I didn't realize how many sites actually used flash to play their video content.2.) the max size it comes with is 64 gb, with no way to expand using a microSD, etc.  This is barely enough if you have a lot of movies.3.) The external speakers sound terrible, though I'm thankful they even came with some.4.) Glare is terrible, especially when there is a light right behind you.  I know most monitor these days uses a glossy, vibrant display...but my old laptop didn't so I wasn't expecting so much glare.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase & would easily recommend it to others.  It's a great device for checking e-mails, facebook, news, blogs, etc. & for watching movies.  ITunes is fairly easy to use too, much better than Windows Media Player for syncing devices.Btw, the iPad does feel durable so I didn't feel the need to get a case & screen protector.  At most, maybe I will get a case so it's not so slippery to hold.Also, don't get the iPad dock.  Instead, get any normal book holder.  It does the job fine.
Ive had both Kindle 1 and 2, and the 'Pad as I call it, blows them away with reading.  iBooks has adjustable brightness, so it is every bit as easy on the eyes when done right.  I am now reading all the time!  Reading is the tip of the iceberg though, the Apps make this thing soooo awesome!
As with many Apple products, the form factor of the iPad is amazing and what is does, it does incredibly well. There are other products that do similar things but not the way the iPad does. It is a beautiful and amazing media machine, and it will only get better over time.  It may become a constant companion.  Thankfully it is relatively light!What really separates the iPad from other computing devices is the App store.  The incredible selection of applications and the ease of downloading them is unmatched.  IPhone users already know the wonders of the App store, but the iPad takes it to another level.  The Pages word processor or the Keynote presentation program for $9.99 each?  Games and productivity apps for free or for a couple of dollars?  Unique piano simulators for free or next to nothing?  NY Times or USA Today for free?  Netflix at the tips of your fingers?  UTube fast and easy?  Obviously I could go on and on, but visiting the App Store is like being a kid in a candy store.  So much and so cheap.  And you know the number of apps will continue to grow.  Apple's tight control over the apps had a good and bad side: the good being the quality of the apps, the bad being someone else deciding what can't be sold for the iPad.  In this case, the good outweighs the bad.I read an article saying that you had to lie to yourself about what you were going to use the iPad for to justify its purchase.  No lead to lie, just find it at the app store!  If it isn't there yet, it probably will be.  What are the killer apps?  Time will tell.  But more than anything it is the incredible combination of inexpensive applications available that makes the iPad unique.Sure people have had a field day over what they consider to be the shortcomings of this device.  Personally I feel they have blown them out of proportion.  The lack of flash is a temporary problem since many sites are moving to html5.  Can't say that I would mourn the demise of flash.  It has created as many problems as it has solved.  Sure a camera would be a nice addition, and it will probably arrive in the next generation.  Multitasking is definitely coming in a few months.The iPad will have a bigger impact than even most of its optimistic supporters realize.  And the reason is simple.  It's all about the Apps.UPDATE MAY 14, 2010:From several weeks of use, I stand by what I said about the apps.  Things I have noticed that I did not mention above:Pros: -- Instant on.  No waiting for a computer to go through all the start up process to start using it.  It makes me want to reach for it and turn it on more often than a laptop or desktop.  It's right there when you need it! -- Speed.  Surfing the web is incredibly smooth and fast.  There are a few web sites where I have noticed the lack of flash support, but for the most part surfing the web has become a real pleasure. -- Games.  Amazing.  Even solitaire is fun again.  But games like Labyrinth 2 HD and Sparkles HD really bring out the best graphics and features of the IPad.  I own practically every dedicated video game machine made, and this beats them all for puzzle and arcade games. -- Newspapers and magazines.  Instead of the morning paper, I now enjoy my morning IPad.  Reading the latest news on this machine is a new and exciting experience.  Once you have done it, you don't want to go back to plain old paper. -- The mail client is so easy to set up and to use.  Well designed and a real complement to a desktop system. -- I continue to be amazed by the brightness and clarity of the screen.  A definite wow factor even after weeks of use.Cons: -- Lack of a true file system.  There's no finder to sort through and find your files.  Even though there is an app for reading pdf files, it should be a lot easier.  The only way to find files is to open the app associated with them. -- The instant gratification of the App Store can be addictive.  Even though I've downloaded a lot of free apps, I have gone through a good chunk of change on paid apps, thinking "Oh, it's only $4.99 or $9.99."  Believe me, they add up! -- All right, I give in on the lack of multitasking.  Should have been there from the beginning.  Although the instantaneous switching between apps almost makes up for it, along with the multi-page display of web pages in Safari.  I wish there was at least a "go back to your previous app" button. -- Yes, the constant wiping off finger prints from the screen.  No way around it. -- The tiny buttons on some web pages are hard to hit exactly with your finger.  Takes practice and a good aim!
FIRST, THIS IS A PERSONAL  "USE" REVIEW.  IT IS NOT A "SPECS" REVIEW. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "SPECS" REVIEW, THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR YOU.  THERE ARE A LOT OUT THERE.Having said that, ..........I love my IPAD!!!!!!It is so much smaller than a notebook and so much thinner than a netbook.On top of that, I use my iPad alot for web surfing, emailing, watching movies, and reading while on the elliptical at the gym.  Soon my gym  will go wifi, but right now I use my  sprint overdrive wifi hotspot to connect to the Internet. I can do the elliptical now without ever being bored. And with the os upgrade in the summer, it will be even better.No other gadget at this time is big enough or small enough for this use alone.I'm losing weight so much easier. An hour and a half of workout is no big deal now. In fact, the time just flies and I sometimes go way beyond. I have to restrain myself!Also, I have heard that an iPad is just a glorified version of iPod but it is so much better than that. It is lightening fast and very responsive.People who say their notebook is just as good or good enough  are kidding themselves. Why? Because iPad is so much smaller. Ijust slip it in my purse with my overdrive wifi hotspot and go.  Boot up time is almost instant, so I can get on the Internet anywhere.Also, netbook is not the same either. Why? Because iPad is so much faster and with the iBook and all the iPad apps, there is no comparison. On top of all the above mentioned things, the battery life is awesome. No notebook or netbook can come close toipad's battery life. My uses of web surfing, netflix movie watching and emailing gave me about 8 hours of use and I still had about 30% of battery life left.Sure, it doesn't have the battery life of kindle ebook, but kindle does not do all the stuff that the iPad does, so iPad is the winner here as well.So, while I love my iPad, I only gave it 4 stars  because it does not have  sd card slot, USB port,  camera, etc. But having saidthat, I don't even miss those functions at this time for my uses.  iPad is not replacing my laptop, it just adds to my life experiences beautifully.
Steve Jobs states that 'FLASH crashes and is buggy on the iPad'. Instead of blaming Flash, Steve, just admit that the problem is with the iPad not being able to handle Flash, and not t'other way round. The processing power of the iPad is just fine for most things, but it's just too slow for full-on Flash applications and movies. Don't blame already proven and successful technology for not working on something you've made that is technically inadequate. It reminds me of when children say, 'I can do that too, I just don't feel like doing it!'What Steve Jobs doesn't want to utter, is that the iPad just isn't powerful enough to do everything we want it to.Let's also not forget that such decisions are driven by the need to protect Content Revenue. Instead of delivering a product that you'd fully enjoy using, the only thing on Steve's mind is 'How much can we squeeze out of the punters on this one?' Okay, he's in business, and profits must be made, but if the profits are more important than user satisfaction, why should anyone feel any kind of loyalty to such a brand?If you've already bought the first-version iPad, you may love it, but there will of course be countless others who'll feel cheated not far down the line, when a much more powerful version is launched. Apple play the same trick time-after-time. Release the Basic Version, and when all the hype and sales start to slow, release a much better version that should and could have been released in the first place. This is because Apple knows that those who bought the basic version are so in love with Apple, they will happily fork-out for the better version too. One user - two sales. Cunning.In my opinion, Apple are happy to take advantage of almost fanatical loyalty and snob-factor in it's users to make an extra buck. Some may be proud to be an Apple Nut, but they're being taken advantage of in a very clever and cunning way. Style over Functionality.Steve; beef-up the processor, include a camera, memory slot and I/O ports, and stop this childish excuse for an excuse for not including Flash. Just be honest about it - your iPad isn't capable of running Flash. Not yet..
Firstly, you have to be able to appreciate the device for what it does.  It isn't meant to play WOW or Diablo II.  There are thousands of games in the App store that are quite cheap and quite fun.  It isn't meant to try to work with clunky flash plugins that destroy a pleasant internet experience.  I don't miss flash at ALL.  On my MacBook I have an extension that blocks flash unless I want to see it, which usually is only done on YouTube.  Most of it is internet advertisement anyway.This thing is easier to carry around than a laptop, more intimate than a netbook, easier to manipulate than an iPod touch or iPhone, and just more FUN than all of those devices to use.  The battery life is great.  The body is just sexy.  Wi-fi never loses signal and the connection is never interrupted.  The only main reason I can see people not liking this device is adherence to old devices, or a bitterness towards Apple for its "walled garden".  If those things don't sit well with you, just move on to a clunky android device and be done with it.  Otherwise, you will LOVE the iPad.:)
The iPad does what Apple says it will do. [...]It is not perfect.  The screen is weak in sun light (Amazon Kindle ads make sure that you are aware of this weakness).  For prolonged usage, the iPad begins to feel heavy, and it could have better connection to other devices for data transfers.It is the very best Netflix portable viewer.  It is a fine eBook reader.  The browser is fine for almost any web activity except for Flash videos.  This is a minor through noticeable irritation.  The photo application is a great way to share images to one or two other people.Do not buy the dock.  I use a Belkin Grip Sleeve to protect the iPad around home. [...]  The dock does not work with protective sleeves.
The topic of my review says it all ,,, I simply can do anything with the iPad, I'm a sys admin and programmer and use vnc and ssh to connect to my datacenter, it's simply awesome. Highly recommend the 3G version, I got a data plan from my carrier in costa rica and adapted the sim to fit the mini Sim slot ... All perfect! No hassles and i got my iPad to work everywhere.I'm delighted with this device
I am NOT an apple fanboy.and I love using the ipad.  the biggest plus is being able to surf the web while lounging in a couch.try to do that with a clamshell netbook.
After having used my iPad for two months now, I can definitely recommend this product without reservation.  While it will be interesting to see what tablet computers will come from hp, Dell et al in future months, for now the iPad definitely rocks!  Download an ebook check, download music/movies check, surf the net check.  The only downside so far is the battery life.  You will definitely not get more than an 8 hour charge but I suspect Apple has that covered once Ipad 2.0 arrives
Got the iPad after checking it out at Best Buy. Just to be clear it is not an iPhone, it is not a laptop, it is a new device that has instantly been a hit for our family. We use it to check email, watch video, and surf the web. The instant on feature and the large screen make it a fundamentally different device than any product we've used before. The interface just seems so intuitive. We have a MacBook Pro and several iPhones and an iPod touch in our family and but this feels more useful than any of these devices for common tasks as mentioned above. Oh and my wife loves the games, most of which are free on the iTunes App store.Is it perfect, no. It is a bit heavy and don't try to read it outside. But for nighttime reading and viewing the internet, it rocks! Top apps so far are ABC, Netflix, and iBooks/Kindle. I suspect it will only get better as more useful apps are released.
The iPad is an unbelievably cool product!  I've had it for a week now, and it has exceeded my expectations in every area but one.It is such a pleasurable experience to hold it and interact with the machine.  It is a very intuitive, tactile, and personal interaction with the web.Having a touch screen to interact with the web is a very different experience than using a mouse.It is NOT supposed to be a netbook, so reviews which compare what it doesn't have, miss the point.This is a whole new computing device to accomplish perhaps 80% of what most people use computers for.For all the basic uses (email, websurfing, music, movies (the Netflix app rocks!), games, ebook, magazine reading (Zinio is great), and the news (the USA Today app is a joy to use) it is great.I have already been finding myself on my laptop much less often than before.The iWork apps are a pleasure to use.  The one area that seems to be more convoluted than it should be, is printing.  You can't print directly from it.  You have to either email it to yourself, or transfer the file over when you sync with iTunes.  But it looks like the 4.0 version of the operating system is going to provide a lot of fixes which people are looking for.A few years from now, tablets like this will be everywhere, and those who are on computers are mainly using them for work.I knew the iPad would be a big hit when my 70 old mother, after seeing mine, decided she was going to get one too!Dr. Bill, [...]
MS had a tablet in the early part of the 21st century and I really wanted to like it, but even after years of work it was unusable. When I first used the iPad at the Apple store I realized this was what I wanted. Simple, elegant, easy to use, and the battery life is amazing.I know most MS fanboys will tell you to wait for the new windows version, the problem is they were ahead of this market for years and still its unfit for my needs ( besides simply web browsing a light device to take notes, run spreadsheets and do email on, lightweight is the key here) I think at this price it is an easy decision to buy ( I work for a living so I actually have some disposable income to spend on decent products, price ISNT everything, but this being one of the cheapest options so far helps)And I didn't realize it when I bought it but the ereader options are great. I may never buy another physical book again. Kindle for the iPad, iBooks, and BandN work really well.
I know I'm a kid but I know a lot about tech stuff and please listen to me. The iPad is a great tool for e-mail, web browsing, and games. It has got a 1GHZ custom-designed CPU, 16MB of onboard RAM, and a dedicated 256MB GPU. However, there are a few downsides to the products. It lacks a webcam, can't run Adobe Flash videos and applications, has a virtual keyboard (not too bad on landscape-mode), and runs a smartphone OS. Overall, this is a great tool, but it can never replace a laptop.
This is probably the first time I ever did this, but I stood on line about 1 1/2 hours, day 1 & got an iPad when it first came out. I've had it 12 days now & I can honestly say it rates 5 stars. I've got an Ipod Nano, but haven't ever used a iPhone or iPod touch, but was able to feel comfortable using it immediately.I sold my laptop on ebay after I got the ipad and although it doesn't do everything the laptop does it covers most of the bases, and does it better. For example, if I wanted to use the laptop it would take 3 or 4 minutes to boot up (Windows Vista) & another minute or two to find the wifi connection in my house. The iPad takes literally about 2 seconds to turn on & I can  be on the internet within 5 seconds of turning it on, it always has the wifi connection. The battery does last about 10 hours as advertised, my Acer laptop would never last much over 2 hours.The ipad is extremely fast, just a little slower than my 2 year old desktop. Using your hands to get around on it is natural & Apple's touch screen works so much better than my Samsung cell phone.The keyboard is easy to use to hunt & peck, I don't think you can do touch typing on it, but it works fine for most purposes, e-mails etc. The biggest negative I can find is sometimes you hit the wrong thing with the touchscreen, it's just not as accurate as a mouse, somtimes it's just lazyness I don't want to enlarge the choices before I make them & hit the wrong one.Overall I'd sell my laptop & buy the iPad again in a heartbeat.
This is a wonderful device. I'm barely using my laptop anymore (only at the office.)I did an experiment and tried to spend the entire day with the ipad without resorting to my macbook pro.Things I did that day:1- checked my mail, replied to messages, forwarded messages2- Opened excel sheets, power point presentations3- opened video attachments, viewed pictures4- edited excel sheets, modified presentations5- browsed the internet (atomic is a great browser that has tabbed browsing and which is free.)6- chatted on skype, had voice calls and conf calls7- facebook8- had msn conversations and chatsThe only things I couldn't do with the ipad was power usage things such as convert video files, etc...Highly recommended, and brings unlimited freedom!
There has been a lot of hype about iPad being a Kindle killer. There are three reasons why the iPad will not make a good book reader. You should be aware of these reasons if you are buying the iPad expecting to read books on it.Reason 1) You will want to read outside and the iPad will not look good outside. Lets face it. Readings a novel is relaxing. Reading outside on a beatiful day is really relaxing. An ebook has to address reading outside. iPad has an LCD screen which will wash out in sunlight. Devices like Kindle and Sony Reader use e-ink technology, a completely different rendering technology, that actually looks better in daylight.Reason 2) iPad is too heavy. The iPad weighs 1.6 pounds. That's about 26 ounces. A Sony Reader and Kindle weigh about 9 to 10 ounces. The iPad weighs almost three times as much. You should be able to hold an ebook with one hand suspended in the air. This will maximize the number of comfortable positions you can achieve with the device. At 1.6 pounds, you will find you cannot hold it up for long with one hand and will have to rest it on something. This severly limits the ergonomic possibilities for the device. You may think this is not important, but you should not overlook how important this is for the reading experience. As matters go, the iPad is not a good device to watch a two hour movie on. Since it is heavy, you will tend to rest it on your lap. That will force you to look down on it. Two hours of doing that, your neck will be sore.Reason 3) Battery life is too short. Ten hours seems like a long time, but for an ebook, it is a hassle to keep it charged to just read, especially when you are on the go. When you toss a small 10 ounce Kindle in your suit case before leaving for a week vacation, you will not have to take the charger, and you will not have to be concerned about plugging it in at the hotel. Devices that use e-ink use power to render the page and to say on standby, but do not use power to leave the page displayed. E-ink devices essentially sip power compared to LCD technology that has to constantly backlight the screen and constantly render the screen. This takes much more power.In iPads defence, iPad could be the better device to read a newspaper. You generally don't read the paper for very long, and you don't read a newspaper linearly like a book. Beautiful layout, color, and multi-touch input could lead to a better newspaper experience. Plus a newspaper is updated daily. An easy way to get daily editions is essential to reading a paper. I think iPad wins out for reading a paper, but not for reading a book.
If your computer doesn't have an Intel chip in it, DO NOT BUT AN IPAD! It will not sync with your computer. I have been a lifelong Apple fan, and this has upset me so much that I will never buy another Mac product. I have a perfectly good Mac G5 desktop with a PowerPC chip in it. It's a bit older, but it's in great shape and I record all of my music on it. I bought the Ipad for my wife the day before our 3 week vacation, assuming it would be plug and play just like all my other Mac purchases. Not only was it not plug and play, it doesn't sync at all with my computer and it never will. I called the Apple help line, and they told me I basically have to buy a new computer that has an Intel chip in it. Nice trick Apple - if you want to lose customers. My wife loves the Ipad, but we are hugely disappointed in Apple for doing this to us.
There are many things about this that I would LOVE to change but this is the best tablet out there right now even though it isnt perfect it does what its supposed to do and it does it well.I got mine the first day it came out I was 6th in line ..It can be VERY awkward to hold .. that is probably the biggest complaint that I have about it.apple tries to "revolutionize" EVERYTHING and they always forget .. or just do not include the simple things that the cheap crappy tablets have which can be very annoying and a turn off in many cases.the lack of flash IS NOT A BIG DEAL .. flash was designed and ment for a use with a mouse, ex. "mouseclick, mouserelease, mousehover" flash is not needed and does not play nice with touch screens .. html5 is amazing and works 100 times better then flash would ever work on a tablet.many apps are very useful but with the devs having a limited use of api's and not being able to use private api's and the fact that ios is not open source gets annoying .. in which jailbreaking can come in handy .. but does not have a wide or as well trained devs and does not make as much money .. but all in all the ipad is great and will probly be only getting better and betterDO NOT GET THIS IF you want it just for a ebook reader , the kindle is much better for that, if you want it for a combo book reader and cus its amazing then you should get it but for just reading books get the kindle you will be much happier.
Having purchased the Apple iPad I am very satisfied with the purchase. As soon as Apple gets off of their horse and uploads the version 4 firmware to allow multitasking I will be more happy.Also a few things the iPad needs are a camera, a USB port (or two) to add storage then it will be almost perfect.
I've decided to tell you my thoughts on the iPad instead of listing technical specifications. Those are available on the Apple website.Physical and Visual Attributes (Snobby sounding, huh? Maybe the statistics that say most iPad owners are stuck up are right...)Firstly, it's just a big black and silver rectangle. It's not really what I would call beautiful, but it is pleasing to look at. Oh, who am I kidding! It's beautiful! Uhem.The brushed silver back is nice. It doesn't show fingerprints or scratches as much as the chrome or plastic that backs most portable Apple products. It's also cool to the touch, which I like.It isn't too heavy to hold, but it's going to be set on my lap most of the time anyway.iPod, Videos, and Photos (or, to go in chronological order, Photos, Videos, and iPod)The Photos app is actually incredibly nifty! When you open it up, granted you have put pictures on it, you're greeted with folders. Each one looks like a couple pictures laid out on a table.You can peak into one of them by pinching slightly or open one of them by pinching a lot. This is awesome and has to be seen to be fully appreciated. If you're not a fan of pinching, you can also just tap on a folder to open it right up.There are a few other interesting things that you can do with this app, but mostly it's for viewing all of your captured memories. Flicking from one picture to the next is fast and smooth.I really like the new look of the Videos app. It's much more...muchier. The bigger view of the DVD and TV show covers and the effect that happens when you click the play icon are both great. Oh, and I love watching stuff on the big screen!The iPod is a lot like iTunes. Instead of cover flow, there is a grid view of your music library. Other than that, everything is pretty much the same.Web Browsing and YouTubeAll of the people out there that don't like the iPad wish that Safari could view flash. That honestly hasn't been a problem for me, but maybe that's just because I don't make a habit of viewing flash-intensive websites.I think browsing the web on an iPad is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  Sliding your finger to scroll down a page and tapping or pinching to zoom both feel really natural.  I'm really happy that it doesn't take long to load pages and that I don't have to zoom much.YouTubeAs I've said before, the big screen on the iPad makes watching stuff really enjoyable.  The YouTube app adds tons of videos to it without taking up much space at all.  (Yes, I actually got a 1,000...GB iPad!)Using the app feels like you're on the actual website, but at the same time much better.  The quality of the videos are great, and searching for a particular one is...fun.That's one thing I think is really cool about Apple's gadgets.  They make doing everything fun!  How do they do that?GamingPlants Vs. Zombies HD is the best game app there is! Alright, now that I've got that out of my system, let's me just say that playing games on the iPad is a blast!Racing on it is like having a Wii in your hands.  However, I don't think the iPad could replace a Wii or DS.  Apps can really add up, so make sure you watch how much money you spend on them.Mail and KeyboardThe Mail app that's on the iPad is much more better than the one that's on the iPhone and iPod touch.  In portrait mode you see one of your e-mails, and in landscape mode you see a split screen view of one of your e-mails and a list of any others you've gotten.When you want to compose an e-mail, all you have to do is tap on an icon in the upper right hand corner.  A box will then pop up that you can type in, and so will a keyboard.  If you're in portrait mode, the keyboard that pops up will be smaller than if you're in landscape mode.They keyboard is much easier to type on than I thought it would be!  I can type almost as fast on it as I can on a physical one.ConclusionI'm not sure how Apple managed to make such a great tablet computer!  One of the things that's great about it is that you can add to the things it can do by getting apps.  Maybe that's one of the keys to it, the iPhone, and the iPod touch's success.  I'm very happy with mine.
Loved the flatness, the portability while traveling, the endless apps and all the free book downloads (mostly of the 'classic' variety).In the end, I returned it to the Apple store even paying the 15% restocking fee. I didn't find it appreciably better than my netbook except for size, and it had disadvantages even: no easy way for a non technical person to save photos, incredibly awkward while lying down - which is the way I often use my laptop/netbook, semi reclining.I know there are nice accessories that allowed it to stand up, and accessory keyboards, but in the end I just found it a gimmicky little toy. I heard a better version was coming this fall so I will look for that.If I were not a lover of physical books I would rate it higher, because the bookcase /library feature was cool. I just can't dive into the virtual books with the same interest -- perhaps I'm a dinosaur but there it is.
I know I'm a kid but I know a lot about tech stuff and please listen to me. The iPad is a great tool for e-mail, web browsing, and games. It has got a 1GHZ custom-designed CPU, 16MB of onboard RAM, and a dedicated 256MB GPU. However, there are a few downsides to the products. It lacks a webcam, can't run Adobe Flash videos and applications, has a virtual keyboard (not too bad on landscape-mode), and runs a smartphone OS. Overall, this is a great tool, but it can never replace a laptop.
As a professional photographer, I do see iPad as quite an useful tool for my portfolio presentations. I mean, be honest - if you get a photographer to bring you 10 lbs book with 50 prints inside and one that would give you this cool little gadget for preview of his photos, which one would leave better impression in this age?Resolution isn't the best of the best but it is above 99% of other devices of similar nature and combined with 10" screen and 10 hours battery life, I think I'll be buying one of these soon.But not from Amazon though. I've seen them in Apple store in Portland's Maine Mall and they're $499.95, which is already far below what you pay here. This is one of rare times that Amazon has disappointed me - I expected competitive prices and instead got outrageously different thing.I gave it 4 stars because of price on Amazon but mostly because it doesn't play Flash content. Everything else about this device makes it a rising star. I just wish it could hold charge even longer so I can read books, but what the heck, I have my e-book reader for that. ;)Gadget guy, out! :D
I bought an Ipad in June and have had a chance to use it extensively since then.  My evaluation?  An outstanding device.  I use it in three principle areas; a book reader, entertainment i.e. games and for work.  I'll talk about each in turn.As a book reader.  Very easy to use and easy to read. I downloaded the Kindle and Barnes and Noble apps so I have access to three separate bookstores and can download books from all of them.  The Ipad thus is much more flexible than dedicated readers that allow access to only a single bookstore.As a game machine.  If my grandkids are around, I can't use my Ipad because they are queued up to get a turn.  I have apps that the three-year-old can use, the four-year-old can use and other apps the older ones can use.  The amazing thing about the younger ones, is that the apps are educational and they love use them.  I enjoy the apps the older kids use, namely Doodle Jump, Angry Birds and Plants vs ZombiesFor work.  This is where the Ipad really shines.  I'm an author.  I spend hours each day chained to my computer in my office writing stores or revising them.In addition to writing/ revising stories, there are other business aspects of writing.  A brief list includes creating new characters and plots, writing blogs, marketing work, email responses etc.  In the past I had to stay at the computer or use a pad and pen if I worked away from the computer. Now I use the Ipad and I'm freed from the desk and computer.  It makes writing and creation a pleasure.  I'm writing this review while sitting in a recliner in the TV room.  Earlier, I worked on a different writing project outside on the porch.Overall, I have to say that the Ipad changed my work habits and improved them.  It fitted  almost seamlessly into my work.  How seamlessly, is amazing, but then I'm an Apple fanatic and I expected nothing less from the Ipad.  To be clear, the Ipad doesn't replace my computer; it is an adjunct to that computer, but one that gives me a large measure of freedom.As you might suspect, I give the Ipad five stars out of a possible five. With the Ipad, my Iphone has been downgraded to a cell phone, for the most part.Tales From Gundarland: Eight humorous stories from the land of the incongruous
Of all the negative press I have herd, the only one I can agree with is the 'Over Priced eBook' and maybe it is, but I have tried the Sony ereader, and I have a nook, but the ipad trumps them all for one reason, I can read in bed...I can also read PDF's off of Drive By RPG and others.I cant beat that.
Well what else can be said that already hasnt been said.Lets get the negatives out of the way: the Ipad is overpriced, and has no flash support.Now anything else is just a positive.
This iPAD makes a giant leap in ease of use, simplicity, speed, entertainment, battery life, functionality, instantaneous on/off, screen, ergonomics (sits on tummy in bed), reliability, durability, productivity...I've explored the world through Utube and Google Earth, learned about everything I want to know about, joined Facebook, bought real estate (killer deal), kept up on email, Fixed my boat, mind mapped our strategies, enjoyed addicting games, read the Bible, watched great movies on long trips, use it as control panel for Netflix, use the global clock for planning trips, puts me to sleep, wakes me up, makes me $ in investments, slide shows, a compass for positioning HD antenna, etc. And most apps were free.Only issues are my home network occasionally bogs down, I get less sleep, and my eyes can get tired.My favorite non-transportation device product of all time.
I bought this Ipad for my wife and she is absolutely in love with it, if your considering another notebook you should consider what you will be doing with it, if your like us and only need it for home use and like to play games and go on facebook and check your mail, then you will definately want to consider this Ipad. The screen quality is perfect and it's so easy to navigate around on the Ipad. We are still trying to figure out how to upload photos from our camera, but I'm confident we'll figure it out. The battery life is great, my wife charges it at night with her cell phone and it lasts all evening with constant use. One more worth while points is that our grand daughter is only 7 and she has no problem getting around on the apple ipad.
I got a chance to hold and play with the iPad that one of my student brought to me. I am not an apple fanboy, I just evaluate gadgets and buy what works for me. My first impression when it was announced is that it would be nothing but an iPod touch on steroids. After evaluating the iPad and playing with it for an hour, I still have that impression. The iPad has an upgraded processor and memory. It is faster, it has a good battery life. For the one hour I used it, I only lost about 5% of battery. It does not feel awfully big or heavy, but it is not something you carry in your pockets.At $499 for the 16GB/Wifi, there is a great potential offered by the bigger display of the iPad when compared to Touch screen netbook. Please note that 16GB on this iPad are solid state with no moving parts.The only reason why I would buy or recommend such a product is to use it to take notes during classes for students. If you can get a stylus and proper software to take notes, the iPad would really shine at a great value. I would recommend the cheapest iPad if you are on a budget.The screen is clear, and feels nice to browse the web. I reviewed the 64GB/Wifi model and I picked up a decent wireless signal while I was in the university's lab, which was placed in a basement. I heard complaint about signal quality.The virtual keyboard passes with A+. I tried to use it like a normal keyboard and I typed a couple of random sentences with no errors. It sure won't feel like a normal physical keyboard, but I think it is possible to hook wireless keyboard to it (which beats the purpose of getting the iPad)PROS* Virtual keyboard is very usable with minimal mistakes.* There is a great potential of the bigger screen. The possibilities are endless: Drawing, sketching, note taking. I actually I got to impress my student with a quick anime-style drawing.* It is not only a toy. You can use it for education. Children can learn in a fun way, and also adults may use it for note taking. Provided that apps would be available for those purposes.* Battery life is great. I read reviews saying that it even exceeded Apple's expectation.* More apps and things to do than Amazon's kindleCONS* The lack of a camera on the front really cripple the potential of the iPad (and the iPhone, iPod touch as well). You can not make video chat session using an iPad (nor iPhone or iPod Touch). Imagine if you can make Skype calls using the iPad!* Connectivity with other devices requires iPad dock.* I only use this for an hour, but I believe using it for too long will strain one's hand. One could consider using it on a table instead of holding it with one hand.FINAL THOUGHTSI advise people to only buy this if they think they will make a good use of it. Please keep in mind that you are buying a tablet computer. I wouldn't buy it in a heartbeat. I would still keep evaluating its uses that best serve me.
Product arrived as described and in good order. iPad was in proper Apple Box and sealed. Trustworthy buy and reliable.
I have had the Ipad 64g 3G for a little over two week and I'm still just as addicted to it as I was the first day. I was familiar with most of the features because I have the Ipod Touch and iPhone 3G. With the Ipad you get the best internet experience on any mobile device period. Of course what would the Ipad be without the actual Ipod which plays music, video, and podcasts. You get wifi but I recommend spending a little more for the iPad 3G which means you can use your iPad anywhere besides wifi spots courtesy of At&t.; The price of their data plans for the ipad are very affordable when compared to most other data services. The 3G models have GPS for location-based services, which means you get more accurate directions than the wifi only version. The App Store turns your Ipad in to a entertainment powerhouse. With the app store you can add apps that fit your needs. From games to business you're bound to find something that you will like. You get an amazing book reader with the ibook store, and if you download the amazon kindle app you get another great ebook reader app with many more books to choose from. It is still kind of bizarre to think I can watch a movie, listen to music, surf the internet, play games, read a book, write and read email, get GPS directions, watch you tube videos, check the weather, and even use the iPad as a phone over wifi with the Skype app. My favorite iPad apps are Netflix, abc player, pandora, Amazon kindle app, shazam and a few others. The apple iPad 3g is truly magical and is light years ahead of the competition with its ease of use and versatility. Sure there are things that can be improved (add a camera, add more internal memory and support adobe flash), but that's with anything. When apple finally releases it's update for iPad this fall which will include the ability to multitask (among many other cool features) it will bring a whole new functionality in to the iPad. I cant wait to be able to listen to pandora in the background while i surf the net or read a book.Like it or not the iPad is a revolution and created a whole new device category and will do for tablets what the ipod and iphone did for mp3 players and cell phones.
I got this as a gift and I am very grateful and happy for the thoughtfullness of my boss.Video and photo displays are great. But, flash videos, I.e. Adobe, etc. will not work, it is very frustrating because I love watching news and documentaries via Internet such as the National Geographic, Hulu, my friends' website with flash, etc. Hulu and Youtube needs their apps to be downloaded to watch their videos but I wouldn't download every website's apps just to watch their flash videos. And, btw, snagfilms.com the documentary website does not have an app for Ipad. Their is an app called Frash but I need to Jailbreak my Ipad but that would void the warranty. I'm switching back and forth with my laptop because I love to read using my Ipad because of it's great graphic quality, but I have to use my pc to watch videos and to download documents from my emails.As of now I do not recommend Ipad for productivity. I consider it as pc accessory.The reason why I gave 3 stars is because it is great for gaming and reading books. Browsing the Webpages is also great.
I'll try to make this review quick...The good stuff:> I dont't open my laptop nearly as much now that I have the iPad.  I have access to the same files, and can do most of the same things.> Links up perfectly with a bluetooth keyboard.> Instant on.  No waiting to boot up.> The screen size is perfect.  Jobs is correct that anything smaller would be problematic.  I can just read all web sites, emails, etc.  Perfect size.> The touch screen is very accurate, responsive, and smooth.  I can touch a very small link at ht it right 99.9% of the time.> 3G reception is better on my iPad than on my iPhone 3GS.> Kindle books look great.> Tons of apps.  I can write a full proposal, create a spreadsheet, and develop a presentation all in Microsoft Office format.> Pages, Keynote, and Numbers now export to Office-compatible files, so these nice apps make the iPad even more useful.> Free cloud-based file storage via DropBox.> FTP/LAN server access to all my office files via GoodReader.> PDF reading, storage, and mark-up.> Store PDFs in iBooks.> Incredible screen for watching movies.> Battery life is as-advertised.  I get 10 hrs of good use out of each charge.> Wireless printing coming in November!The not so great:> No wireless printing, but that is coming in November 2010!  Still, would be nice to be able to hook up to a USB printer via the camera kit.> Glare is significant, but I bought an anti-glare screen protector.  Problem solved.> Hard to carry around with that open face.  The Apple cover is a nice accessory so you can carry the iPad around like a notebook.> On-screen keyboard is okay, but not for prolonged, heavy typing.> A tad on the heavy side.  I'll bet the next generation will be lighter!> I'm not using my iPhone nearly as much, so it might be going away.  :(
I purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it! It's easy for an 11yr old to learn to how to operate, search for books and read samples prior to purchasing.
I am a huge critic of Apple products and when I heard about the iPad and read the stupid words "Magical" and "Revolutionary"  in reference to the device, I wanted to puke.  I also own a lot of Apple devices, and my complaints about them are few and petty.  Still I wanted to hate this device from the day it was released.A month after it was released I bought my mom one so she could surf the net from her couch, watch movies, read books, play games, etc.  Buying her one was an experiement of sorts.  I wanted to know what she thought about it since she's not computer savvy and had never heard of the iPad before she owned one herself.  She seemed to really like it.  She has since bought games for it, which she had never done with her desktop computer.  She hasalso watched some Netflix movies with it. Judging from her experience, I went out and bought one for myself after my laptop died.It is awesome.  I use it to surf the net, play Soduko, control my Sonos music system, check email, etc.  I don't use it to type a whole lot so I don't have any complaints about the virtual keyboard.  I also don't own any accessories for it;  I don't see the point in tethering it to a keyboard, external monitor, camera, or anything else.It's a simple device that can easily be hauled around town, on trips, or wherever. I can't wait to take it with me to Italy next year.
This is a great device for browsing the web (non flash pages of course), emailing, listening to music, playing games, watching movies, etc. This is not intended to replace a desktop or laptop. I personally have an iMac and iPhone and needed something in between without spending $1000 on a macbook. For $500 i have a device i can travel with and use for all of the above functions quickly with ease. Ive had an iPhone from the very beggining and one thing i can say for certain is that apple will always push out updates to improve their products. rumors of the next update promise a printing feature (which you can do now with an app) as well as folders to stay organized :) can't wait! Bottom line, it is what it claims to be.
The only Mac I have ever owned was a lipstick.I am afraid of the Ipod, I own the cheapest phone because I lose my phone about twice a year.August 12, 2010 I received a gift that changed my life... My Ipad!I have no idea what the other reviewers are saying?  All I can say is that this is amazing!  I cruise the internet check email and now spend a ton of money on "apps".  My only complaint is that I can not see some videos on "you tube".  If you have the money and you are curious buy one.  Surprisingly my 4 yr old loves using the iPad and there are a bunch of educational apps.  I am not a video game parent my kids dont even watch main stream TV and I am in love with the activities available.  For some reason my 4 yr old figured out how to use the iPad with out much guidance.
ok first things first, if you say that the ipad is just a jumbo ipod touch you ave probably never used one. it has awsome picture quality, its fast, and easier for children to use and have them enjoy it because of its size and not worrying about them droping it because its too big for them to hold, so they'd have to lay it down to use it. i let my little brothers use it and they have never droped it and they love the size of the screen, they like using it more than their ipod touch's. i use it for email, texting and phone calls, yes phone calls, you just need skype or a phone app like i use, plus you wont look rediculos because it uses the microphone and the speaker so its like a conference call. sound quality is great, i love watching my HD movies with my friends and its real HD not like the fakey HD the ipod touch has. my parents and my old folks like to lay it down on their laps to use it because they complain that they cant hold it because they cant grip it (they are 85 years old of course they cant grip anything). my friends like that you can change the background if you want unlike the ipod touch where its the boring black all the dang time, mine is the family reunion photo. which reminds me you can put real photos on the ipad like old photographs from way back when. and there is no wrong way t hold it, even on the menu screen, just tilt it in the direction you want and it'l adjust for you, it comes handy when you have a group of people and you don't want to pass it around. this ipad is definitly worth the money, because it has internet, movies, music, tv, phone, text, email, games, your photos, your videos, books, and educational things for the little kids.(PS. excuse my spelling i have a C+ in english >:( i cant spell word i never use)
The iPad lives up to the hype. I was a skeptic myself, but after owning apple products the past two years, I knew the company would live up to my expectations.  It is in no way just a large iPhone.I purchased the iPad 32gb wifi version and quickly began loading apps and movies. I also jail broke my version and am writing this review on the iPad itself!So far, I've noticed that the iPad is extremely efficient.The safari pages load quicker than my iPhone 3G and the apps open very fast.The clarity is unbelievable.  I think it's even clearer than my MacBook!The battery life is impressive.  I know it will withstand my 5+ hour flights from Boston to LA.  I watched a two hour movie this evening and played around with it for an additional few hours and my battery is at 56%.I was surprised at how great the volume level actually is. I expected it to not be that great, but when I was watching the movie earlier, I did not use headphones and found the sound quality perfect.  Additionally, the iPad does not emit any noise when processing.Apps:I just dropped a lot of cash on my iPad so I am not willing to spend money on apps yet.  I've explored the free ones exclusively.iBooks has me wowed.  Apple offers an array of free novels to meet anyone's taste.  Classics are my liking and I've loaded at least 15 of them.  You can bookmark your pages and skip chapters or browse.  I was impressed by how easy it is to read on the screen as well. I've never been a fan of reading on a computer, but this app opened my eyes to another world. I like having the ability to change the font size to meet my needs.Bloomberg did a great job of creating an app that offers financial news and personalization. I can track my stocks, track indices, and listen to podcasts.  I can't think of a more informative app out there.Installous. Everything your little hacker heart desires.  If you like installous on your iPhone, you'll appreciate it on your iPad.***********Edit:  Downside found!  Charging this device can be a pain.  I just hooked it up with a USB to my work computer (PC) and, the top right hand corner reads "not charging."  Apple's website states the following:"Some USB 2.0 ports and accessories do not provide enough power to charge iPad. When this occurs the message "Not Charging" appears in the status bar next to the battery icon."Be that as it may, other websites are claiming the Ipad still charges even though the screen states otherwise.  I haven't tested it out myself.  This link provides further details:[...]
The iPad 16 gb wifi only is the best value for money in the iPad series. The screen display is absolutely gorgeous as well as the overall finishing quality of the product. Internet browsing, checking multiple mail accounts, watching videos and pictures, listening songs or just spending loads of time playing games and trying out loads n loads of fun filled applications is just an out of this world experience. Ofcourse you can't compare the ipad to a regular pc or a laptop (when it comes to heavy document or graphic processing) but for everything else specially while being on the move there's the iPad.
I have the 16 GB Wifi iPad, and I absolutely love it! It's amazing what you can do with it! I have photos, music, mucic videos, games, Pages, Keynote, iBooks and more on it, and I still have over 12.5 GB of free space left! It's awesome! A must buy! This is way better then any netbook, and I'm a HP fan! And the volume on here is really awesome too! The only thing that isn't so awesome about the iPad is the price. I think it should be $400.00. But still, don't let the price stop you from owning this amazing device!
I have spent more than a week using the iPad and have found many pros and cons which should be considered before purchasing one.Pros: -The opening and closing of applications is very fast making the device very responsive.Watching Youtube video is very much better and clearer than on a PC or iMac.  Sound from the speakers is only OK, however the use of headphones would be recommended. As one who has not the best eyesight, I have found the screen size and quality far superior to that of the iPod or iPhone and a whole lot easier on the eyes.  The visual quality while looking at photos is excellent.  The iPad has freed me to do the basic things I enjoy doing e.g. Facebook & internet browsing without tying up the family's iMac. This has certainly lead to peace of mind in that quarter.Cons: -The device cannot have multiple applications running concurrently, therefore you cannot switch between them with any ease. The lack of Flash support has been somewhat irritating and should be taken into consideration.  As a business tool, the iPad should not be considered a replacement of a notebook or laptop.  A PC, iMac or laptop would be far more preferable.  I have used an app called "DocsAnywhere" and imported files via iTunes, which I found useful.  I was able to review said files while traveling by train to a meeting.  Of course, I also brought my laptop along for the journey.  I would prefer to use the iPad to control syncing with iTunes rather than the other way around, other than having to change the settings in iTunes to forestall this happening. Battery life is as promised although recharging is rather slow while connected to a PC or iMac, however recharging will halt if the parent machine goes into power down mode.Future: -The iPad table may well be the forerunner of a technology which will replace portable computers for business use, but that day is not here yet and will not be for some time to come.Conclusion: -For the casual user, I would say that the device is useful for email, Facebook, Youtube and internet browsing. The screen is brilliant while it is turned on. It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle, however, when turned off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible. The brightness overcomes this issue while the device is on.  I have certainly enjoyed using the device and will for the foreseeable future.
When these first came out, I could not decide if I was going to get one. A friend showed me theirs and I was hooked. Have had mine a few weeks now and have to say I love it. But, I love my iPhone, so why wouldn't I. I really see the iPad as a big iPhone. The only thing that I don't like about my iPhone is the size if the screen... well that has now been taken care of. But there is more... I am finding I can use this in meeting and I don't have to take my laptop in. Reading books is great because they are in color, something my wife's Kindle cannot do. I can watch videos to and from work as I ride the bus. For someone that commutes, this is a dream come true.Now there are issues and a new product like this will always have some. I have not had the issue with the wifi problem. It needs a stylus. I want to be able to write notes and this is not going to happen with my finger. Camera would have been nice and when the multitasking comes around this fall, that will be a nice addition. More drive space or a slot for some kind of memory card should have been there, this is a real issue with me, but other than that, I am very happy and really enjoy my iPad.
I don't understand all the negative reviews commenting on connectivity. My husband has no problem with staying connected with his iPad. I on the other hand cannot keep my less than 3 year old MacBook connected in the same room as his iPad. It is driving me crazy. We are using Airport. I had this problem before the iPad came into the house. Anyway my husband loves his iPad and says there is not one thing he would change about it, at least not now.
Caution: Ipad does not support Video playlist of any kind (music video/ podcast/ tv shows), means you can not configure to play 10 video clips to play one after another(it works just fine on Iphone) which also means when you are playing video forward button will never work...Got it on first day and usually using it every day, have iphone too, other than most of the usual known issues and features here are some which will help you to make a right decision...Ipad is perfect to watch a video...a video looks way better than any laptop you have...Speakers are low yes its true, I was expecting it to be little louder than iphone but it seems its just marginalFlickr/facebook all works so beautifully, this is a perfect device to show your picture portfolioused Slingplayer (iphone edition) and can say it works awesome with dishtv and slingbox solo, very clear...I use google newsreader for news and it works just fine (i dont like other newspaper apps very little content)Calender is looking good though event detail opens in very small screen which means not using the full screen available to display appointment better(iphone does)...appointment forward feature is not supported (iphone has same issue), any link (say for attending webmeeting) is not supported to click, means you have to copy the link test and open in safari to start webmeeting (iphone supports clicking http links directly) last snooze feature is not supported (iphone does not do it either and i hate iphone for not doing it, not sure how many times i missed a meeting because of that)Jump app is perfect for remote desktop...I would say just superb, I usually attend all my web meeting (ofcourse on flash) with that...audio transfer to IPAD works just fine, use it to access all office documents as wellOutlook mails do not get auto refresh, probably to save battery life (bad move from apple and I hate that)Netflix works superb though crash sometimes if you try to move fingers on screen when movie is playingMoving apps from iphone to ipad is breezeyoutube works very fine though playlist is still not supportedI am not looking to get 3G edition cause dont want to be bound by single carrier and 3g limitation (will buy cradlepoint PHS3000 travel router and use any usb modem with it to create wifi with 4G bandwith, it will save ipad battery life and allows 16 wifi devices, make sure you go for 4G version (hardware rev2 cost around $140))Ibooks/kindle both works very fine no issues here(well i am not a bigtime reader as well)Comics are just superb on IPAD...
The iPad has been the talk of the town since it's Apple created it however, it does not deserve the credit that most consumers give it. The iPad is a somewhat new Tablet computer that virtually serves no purpose with netbooks and compact notebooks. It is just another innovative idea that all Apple fan-boys and Bandwagon jumpers can rave about. While the technology is convenient on an iPod touch, once you double the size you would expect more. The iPad runs at a processor speed of 1.00ghz, which is the same speed my phone runs at. Another big disappointed is the iPad's incapability to run flash websites. It has the same apps as the iPod Touch and iPhone. The hard drive size on the iPad is also very disappointing, having the same size hard drives as the iPod Touch. The WiFi is faulty at times, but that is not to terrible of a problem. The price is also ridiculously high for what you're getting. Similar tablets, such as the Archos 5 lack the apps, but can do much more that the iPad can. Why pay around $800 for a tablet that can barely handle the tasks you would expect it to, when you could purchase a netbook, at less than half the price with a much large hard drive, much faster processor, and can do almost everything you would expect it to do? Well, I guess you have to pay for the name.
I Bought it for my son who was two and a half when he got it.  He loved it from day one and the app store has so much to offer for the whole family specially for the children.  This product will save you allot of money and will help your chilled with computer use, reading, math,  other educational games which are free or very inexpensive.  I read the news in the morning using it.  I use it with my apple tv which is another great deal.
I love the iPad.It's such a versatile device that my wife, who hates tech grabs it, and my 3 year old crystal if she see's me taking it to work.I've used the Bluetooth keyboard with it and created documents with up to 30 pages of content.
This product is very intuitive and easy to use.  It is a great device and the portability makes it a must have.
I'm not a MAC user.That said, I realize the fervent, almost religious, zeal that those who have followed Apple technology have proselyted their virtues. (Some of the moments when releasing a product before engineering was done with it, notwithstanding.)However, I see the iPad as an offering where Apple attempted to get back to basics and fully accomplish a "design cycle." I'm impressed with the power and options of this machine. The clarity of the display and the intuitive nature of the touch screen were drawing qualities. I was up and running, and I mean effectively, right "out of the box" with just a few probing "trial and error" type checkouts. The "pop-up" touch screen keyboard is very good, for the size of the unit. I was pleasantly surprised at that. I got the iPad case, turned it sideways at an angle, and find I can type with relative speed (not as fast as a full size keyboard, but very quickly and adequately for the light, quick notes and composing I am doing on it.) As I've played around, I have seen other features come up, asked myself "what does that do?" and figured those out as well. One day I'll go back and review the instruction manual.But, where the notebooks were designed to fill a niche of portability, lighter than a laptop, but still with internet access and some minimal functionality, I see the iPad coming from the other direction, filling that same market segment.It's an iPod on steroids!I do see it replacing a couple of my devices. My calendar and contacts are going on, and I can see myself retiring my PDA. The music and media features will replace my iPod. And, the 3G feature I activated and found to be very useful on a recent vacation trip to stay connected, so no lugging my laptop through security on business trips.Nope. No speaker phone. I'll still need to carry a cellular phone. Otherwise, this would be the one-stop shop. As it is, that is notable to me as a drawback and a slice where a blackberry or other access-enabled device might still be a viable alternative.Just downloaded my first movie. Maybe I'm premature in writing this review. But, I expect that to be impressive as well. So, overall I rate it positively. A winner.
Devices like this make so much sense for the kind of light computing most of us do when we're away from the office.  And for reading, looking at pics, doing email, etc. this thing rocks.But it drives me crazy that Apple has waited so long to update this to iOS 4.  The iOS 4 features - which have been available for *months* on the iPhone - will finally bring multitasking, the ability to resume applications where you left off, and folders to the iPad.  These updates are merely small conveniences on the iPhone - which you use as a computer only for short periods when you're out running around or whatever.  They're extremely important to the iPad's credibility as a device which you'd like to use as much as possible instead of lugging around a laptop or being chained to a desk.  I still use the iPad a lot if I'm going to be focused on one application for a long time.  But life is often messier than that, so I actually end up switching to my much-too-teeny-tiny iPhone more than I'd like because it's got more flexible functionality.Devices like the iPad are definitely the way forward for light computing, and Apple has done a great job on developing this product.  But it's not quite done - it's pretty freakin' irritating that Apple has taken so long to meet this obvious need to update to the greater flexibility of iOS 4.2.p.s.  The only other thing I'd change is to up the resolution of the screen to iPhone 4 levels.  Don't get me wrong, the iPad's display is gorgeous.  But the nature of the device is that you hold it *closer* than a laptop.  Resolutions that would be really great at laptop screen distance are a bit grainy at handheld distance.  Which means that you feel like you're reading on a computer instead of looking at something that looks like a printed page.  I've noticed that although the iPhone 4 has too small a screen to read really long books comfortably, the crisp text resolution makes it more comfortable than you'd think for reading.p.p.s.  I couldn't give a bleep about a camera/facetime.  Kind of a cool concept, but until our nation has much faster broadband, it just isn't worth the aggravation.  Yes, my experience is that AT&T; is the pits - slow 3G, slow home broadband, and truly stone-age customer service.  Just what you'd expect from a de facto monopoly service provider!
I did a lot of research and even played with a few iPads before making my purchase, so I was not too surprised by its performance. I mainly got this because I can't wait another 2-? years for my job to decide how they're going to let us carry electronic publications. The iPad works great for that function, especially using GoodReader which I find to be superior to iBooks in a number of ways.So far I haven't been disappointed using it as an internet device in my home and offline in most other places. Overall it is basically what you expect: an oversized iPhone with similar features. Web pages look much better than they do on the iPhone, but there's still no built-in flash support. Angry Birds is a lot more fun on the iPad's big screen.One thing I don't like is the email presentation. It basically uses the same iPhone-sized strip overlayed on a full screen message display. There's no way to just be looking at your inbox or other folder; you have to always be looking at an email. It's a minor annoyance, but different than I have my email setup on every other system including the iPhone.I was also surprised to learn that the iPad is still on iOS 3 (so much for my research). I spent over an hour trying to create app folders on the device and in iTunes before I realized the iPad doesn't have that ability yet. I'm disappointed with the number of apps that expect you to re-buy just to increase the resolution enough that full screen looks good. Most apps like that I continue to use in the small, iPhone-size window that opens by default or I put up with pixellation and hit the 2x button. I didn't realize how quickly I'd gotten used to iOS4, but now it's annoying when I click a link on one website that opens a new window, and upon returning to the original site it has to completely reload instead of saving my previous position. Hopefully iOS4 will be out this month for the iPad and it will function more like my iPhone.If you're going to throw your iPad in a flight bag, I recommend the Otterbox Defender case. It was covered by the tax savings I enjoyed by purchasing from Amazon instead of Apple. The case offers a lot of protection, but like its iPhone cousin makes the ports less accessible. You have to remove the back panel to access the charging port, and not all headphones are able to reach into the headphone jack. My wife and I wanted to watch a movie together using a y-cord, but it wasn't able to fit without me removing the top half of the case.Overall I'm pleased with the unit so far. I could have waited for another solution (Google Pad, maybe?), but as Apple's already big in our lives and my work is likely moving to this unit, it was the best choice for me. If you're thinking of buying an iPad, I don't see why you'd buy anywhere but Amazon. Their list prices match the Apple store, but they add no tax or shipping charges. Tax in my area is 10% so I saved $70 buying from Amazon instead of Apple.
I bought my iPad shortly after it came out.  I thought it would be good for traveling and it was an interesting toy.  I got to take it on a trip to Vancouver in August.  It worked out great.  I got Zinio so I could get a bunch of magazines to read on the plane.  The screen is good (would have said very good before the iPhone 4 came out) for reading and the magazines came out sharp.  Watching a movie on the plane with an iPad is great.  The large screen and the smallness of the iPad overall make it easy to leave on the tray.  The trip was adhoc and we had a rented car to drive around the area.  I had TomTom for navigation but it didn't seem to work on the iPad.  Luckily I had TomTom on my iPhone.  I don't know if it is something wrong with the iPad or the software.  I had a hotel for the first two days of our trip.  After that it was always easy to get on wifi at the hotels we stayed at.  I got data roaming for the trip.  Had no problem using Roger's network in Canada.  The iPad makes it easy to change travelling plans.  For instance I hiked along a river to see a fall when a jet boat went by running the rapids.  Looked like fun and after thinking more about it looked it up at a park bench.  We found the company running the boat and took it the next day.  We went to Victoria and it was nice even waiting for the ferry to look up what we should have done before waiting for an hour for the ride.  Wifi and cellular were great in Canada.  Flash was an issue for only one site and that was for WestJet checkin the night before leaving.  I thought luckily the hotel had a internet kiosk but it was running Linux and Flash wasn't running on it.  At the airport I literally saw some display for the flight times running Flash displaying errors.  I cracked up.  WestJet did end up being easy to get around.  They actually have a mobile site and you can check in there without Flash.  I did that though on my iPhone.  Don't know if I could have gotten to it with the iPad.  I didn't try.  1Password with Dropbox is a great combination to keep passwords around so that you can check things on your trip.  I take a ferry to work every day.  I use iAnnotate to read pdf documentation after checking out the WSJ.  I use it every day during the week.  It's a great device and seems quite able to grows into new tasks.
The i pad is a great machine with terrific versatility although the lack of multi-tasking is starting to irritate me a little. But if you are going to use it as an e-reader, be careful. The backlighting is great for reading in bed but it can, in my view, damage your eyes. I became very tired using the i pad to read both at night and during the day, and started getting  headaches ( I would typically read 50-100 pages of a paperback in one sitting). I find the kindle much better for reading and I can do so for two or three hours continuously without any fatigue The only downside is that a separate light is required to read in a dark room (for example, when you in bed).

Did not purchase next day service, but seller got the product out the same day.  Arrived the following day, excellent customer service!!!!!!
Thinking about getting one, but what's up with the price? Why in God's name this one is 300 more than what Apple has to offer? Very very confused.
I don't own one but I have played with one in the store and read about it. So if I am wrong about something then forgive me. This is basicaly a big itouch. In my opinion it is great if you want to do some web browsing or read downloaded books on it. Size makes it good to take on a trip so you can browse the internet or watch movies. Wrong! It doesn't have a stand that can pop out so it can be propped up so you can watch a movie. Imagine holding this thing while watching a movie for 90 minutes or laying it flat to type on the onscreen keypad and staring straight down on it. Or you can hold it with one hand and type with the other. You can buy a case that doubles as a stand which makes it bulky and it is not adjustable. You need a case for this because it doesn't have a lid like a netbook. Imagine this big screen unprotected as you carry it around. They hype this up with it's ability to look at photos and watch movies on. Well you have to buy their cables to load pictures or movies into it. There are no ports of any kind or memory card slot. Just their propietary port for their cable. And what good is having your pictures loaded in it if you can't print them or transfer them easily.I would strongly suggest you to take a look at the Acer aspire 1410-2497 11 inch netbook (anything smaller will be a pain to stare at)and weigh out your needs and usefulness of something like this. An adequatley equiped netbook can do everything the ipad can and a whole lot more. Can you do your Microsoft word documents, spreadsheets, print, etc. on an ipad? No. And also when in keypad mode the keypad takes up like half of the screen. With a netbook you have a dedicated screen. You can get a Netbook loaded with features for less and it is a real computer. Add up the costs of adding the optional case/stand, keyboard, business apps, etc. How much is your ipad now.Gripes I have with Apples i devices is that you can't just pop out a dead battery and pop in another one and be on your way. No memory card slot so you can upload or download content. And the kicker is they do this on purpose because they don't want you to have the ability of more memory. Like the iphone, itouch, ipod they will market a device with unbelievable little memory. The following year they will market their newer model with a little more memory and charge you more and so on. What kind of scam is this.If you want one to take on vacations and to be able to look up places to eat or just to take to the coffee shop and do some web browsing then just get an itouch. It will serve it's purpose less expensive and you can carry it in your pocket and have with you all the time. On vacation it can come in handy. Most places have free wifi now. And if you have kids, just whip it out when they drive you crazy. Sure it's smaller than an ipad but your not going to carry an ipad around with you everywhere on vacation.So great for lounging, web surfing, read digital books. Heavy typing or business or school work, no. Netbook little more bulky but can do everything and more. It does have it's place in the world but unless they make a built in stand, put in a usb port, and a memory card slot don't bother. Some argue that it is great for presentations. Yeah but you have do all the work on a computer first and then pull out the cable to load it onto the ipad. You can't make any changes or print anything so now you have to go back to your computer again. Unless you use the ipad apps. And I believe the apps are limited on what you can do. I can understand the iphone and itouch with limited potential because they are meant as pocket media devices. But what makes the ipad such a leap forward besides its bigger screen?Everyone is allowed to agree or disagree. I am just trying give some thoughs for people to think about before buying. Some may be fine for what it does, but some might expect more. Ask a lot of questions and verify.
My after-one-month review:I think this thing will end up being kinda big. It's not perfect (typing at length without a keyboard attached, for example... but at least you can bluetooth a keyboard to it) but there will be a large number of interesting apps and games (there are already a number of eyebrow-raising apps out there such as virtual touchscreen music controllers, board/card game simulators, and streaming media consumption apps). It is in fact not merely a "giant iPod Touch," although to be sure that's some of it. Huge pluses are the interface responsiveness at all times and the long battery life coupled with the size/weight. (Hate it or not, that's what you get when 1 company designs the chip, the OS and all the other hardware.) It does not have a really powerful CPU, though, but you won't notice unless you attempt a heavy data-processing task such as running HTML5 Javascript Canvas demos. 3D games work surprisingly well. When OS 4 comes out, the multitasking will make this even more killer. The games coming out are really cool, for what that's worth.Completely unexpected benefits: 1) For years I was looking for a way to attach a laptop to my treadmill. The iPad fits PERFECTLY on the treadmill shelf. 2) Long car rides with passengers? This could be the ultimate kid pacifier slash map/directions device (with the 3g version). 3) You do in fact start using it more than your laptop, especially for "couchsurfing" and "bedsurfing" (and, uh, "poopsurfing") 4) AirVideo + your movie collection (in any formats) + available anywhere on the internet = amazing.Basically, this fits the bill better for anything that is not serious working or serious gaming.I see a lot of reviews here dinging bad wifi or the lack of this or that feature (sd card reader, camera, etc. etc.) I have not had any wifi problems with my Linksys router. Also, you may want additional features in this device but they would 1) add cost and 2) reduce simplicity, battery life, etc. This is a device of compromises, and I think Apple picked them well even as I know future iPads will probably add more features. If you are looking for SD card readers or USB ports (camera kit notwithstanding) or better data processing then you are really missing a netbook or a full fledged laptop in your life. If there's one feature I wish it had, it would be a camera on the back side to make possible even more amazing "augmented-reality" applications.Lastly, one review talked about an attempted iPad trojan on his setup. I'm sorry, but perhaps it is time to place part of the blame on your attack-vector-infested operating system ::cough:: Windows ::cough:: before you criticize the iPad for trojan attempts. ;) As usual, the situation could probably be improved but Apple stuff still ends up working much better with other Apple stuff.
If you are used to dealing with Amazon, and then you start dealing with Apple, pray that you never have a problem with the product. Amazon stands behind their products and gives the customer the benefit of the doubt. Apple is very difficult when you have a malfunction. I had to go to small claims to get my money back for something that was not my fault,after dealing with Apple service for two months. read their return and repair policy carefully.
I'm liking my iPad a lot more than I thought I would. Reading on it is a pleasure, especially on a crowded train. The New York Times free app has enough stories to get me to and from work, and the ebook reader is quite easy to use. There are a ton of free books out there, mostly books in the public domain, but that's fine with me since I like to read old literature. The music and game apps are numerous and very good. The web is extremely fast and the pad "just works".On the downside, the iPad doesn't come with a clock or alarm clock utility. You can buy apps written for this purpose, but, since there's no multitasking, you can't depend on them to work. For example, if you have a meeting scheduled, and your alarm clock app set, the meeting notice will pop up and prevent the alarm on the clock from ever going off.Magazines look awesome on the iPad, particularly Wired and Time. The downside is that you can't buy a subscription and have to pay a very inflated price. Hopefully, this will change in the near future. I wish more magazines were available, and I wish I could get the entire New York Times delivered to the iPad in one fell swoop since I don't have a wifi connection on the subway I ride (the workaround is to go to all the articles before leaving the house, which puts them in a cache for reading later).Another downside is that you still have to sync the pad to itunes to do any kind of backup or file transfers, and the sync HAS TO be done via cable. At this point, with such a poweful technology, I cannot believe Apple doesn't just automatically sync/backup the ipad wirelessly when it gets near its "mother" computer. Likewise, there should be some way to map the free space on the pad as a drive to transfer files to and from the device.The glare problem is bad if you're trying to read in bright sunlight, but I read mostly at night in bed and on the subway so it's not an issue for me. The backlighting is actually very nice for reading in bed.Overall, a very nice device. The screen size is just right to watch movies and TV on the go. Lots of apps are available. The word processor and spreadsheet app (sold separately) are very nice, even if syncing back to a PC or Mac is a bit of a pain.I've been taking my iPad on trips instead of my laptop PC--it is a good device for travelling and lets me get basic work done (e-mail, web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets).I'm sure the device will only get better over time.Please note that amazon's price for the 64-gig model is higher than buying it at the Apple store, even after tax.
I'm no nerd, so something that's basically self-explanatory is great for me. Ease of use is awesome. The thing's gorgeous! Love the screen quality. I have an iPod touch and iPhone 4, this is perfect to use in bed or on the couch. It's just the right size - bigger than iPhone, which is nice when you're writing longer emails or watching a movie, but not as clunky as a notebook. I love mine :-)
is a good toy device . is easy to use and connect and all. the shiping was fast and in the tome that saw to me the seller. excelent
It's just what I wanted for my birthday. I use mine everyday. It's wonderful to have. I love playing the Tap games on it as well.
It is a great device on days you can find uses for it. Unfortunately On days I can't find uses for it it goes unused. On days like that you feel awful. It is very snappy and a pleasure to use.Bottom Line: A great device if you can find uses for it.
I purchased this product at amazon and since I am not in USA now, I got it shipped to another country. The package arrived well before the estimated time and in good shape. I have been purchasing from amazon for a long time now and their brand reliability is legendary.
I love my iPad but the only drawback (and it's really starting to bug me) is that Adobe flash does not run on it. So many websites use Adobe and I'm getting tired of seeing the "flash player needed" message over and over. Apple really needs to sort that out. Everything else about the iPad is perfect! Love it!
I bought this iPad back in June and I must say I was very excited.  I've watched to keynote with Steve, but was quite disappointed the lack of features like a camera & 512mb Ram like the iPhone 4, (iPad has only 256mb of Ram).  But that didn't stop me from wanting one as a travel companion.As soon as I opened it up, I was just amazed on its beauty, 9.7" display was oh so gorgeous, OS ran smooth like silk.  I couldn't wait to download many many apps. I use this thing every single day, take it everywhere I go, for email, internet, reading, Netflix/video, games, notes, music, GPS, the list goes on!!I am pleased with my purchase, and I hope you future iPad owners are as well. :):DP
This product has such great potential but yet again Apple has been too cheap to properly test it before release. I don't know what's causing it but the ipad goes crazy every now and again where the screen "thinks" you are resizing it and trying to copy and paste even though you aren't even touching it. It gets so stuck that I have to reset it and prey the problem does not come back...which it always does. I think Apple has become too smug in their sleek products and advertising that they have forgotten about actually testing these products before release.The iphone 4 is another example of Apple's poor attention to detail. Try to get one fixed and you will find out about their PISS POOR customer service.
Do not listen to the people who suggest that this is a large iPod touch.  It does have the potential to be a laptop replacement for the majority of people.  I would say it is a glimpse into the future of laptops.  Laptops have been outselling desktops for awhile now. This should change that.  Ideally I would like a home desktop, iPad and smartphone, with no need of a laptop.  Anyone who reads, this is a must have.  I would even say if i have to do without... i would do with out the smartphone and have a simpler phone. Think about it, i use my iphone more for the apps than its phone by far.  It does surf the web, email, manage photos better than laptops.  Laptops had been desktop replacements, which should change because of this device. Current features that it lacks are complainants from the small minded.  Especially when we know exactly when we would receive the features.  It is a game changer,  with iPhone software worked out for a few years this does not have risks of most early adopter situations. Get use to it.
This is my first Apple device, and for the most part, I love it.  I don't find it heavy (I'm a woman), even to hold for an hour or so; the screen is easy to read from and easy on the eyes, etc.I bought it primarily to use as a reader.  After waiting for the two major competitors to introduce all of the functions that I was waiting for, I thought the iPad would be the answer, and, as a device, it is.  My huge problem is that ~3/4 of the books I've been waiting to read are not available!  Well this stinks; I've got a gorgeous new device and no where to go...  I was also looking forward to reading periodical content, and like the idea of the latest issue of whatever awaiting me when I get the opportunity to read a bit.  As of now, however, very few periodicals have iPad apps available (paid or free).  I hope this changes soon, otherwise my Used device is going to be for sale here.  So much potential - but it's just not delivering (yet?  I hope!)...I have to amend my review - this is added later.  There's a Kindle app!  The books are available, they were just hiding :)
For the same reason you cant compare a laptop to a desk computer (the desk computer for the same price will always be stronger and better)Don't compare the ipad to laptops (If you want a bigger hard drive, or more ram, buy a laptop and end the conversation)And very important read the specifications on the box, or the store description page on the web before you buy something, so you don't have to go crying about things that it doesn't have afterand the most important thing to know is to NOT BUY the ipad at amazon.com, so you don't have to pay about $60 or more, then the apple store
I love my iPad but can't believe the price Amazon and its vendor is selling it for.  Apple has plenty in stock.  This makes no sense.
I was going to buy the iPad tomorrow. I started looking up information on it and then I found out that the unlimited data plan was removed for new users after June 7th. This is the biggest load of B.S. I ever heard. The whole point of the ipad is that you can have unlimited data, for web, apps and VIDEO!!!. Be prepared to pay exorbitant prices to watch video on the iPad. This plan is the iPad killer.New plans are250 MB $14.992 GB $25.00Steve Jobs, your propaganda about an unbelievable price is all lies!
I originally purchased this product as a replacement for my netbook.  While I agree that the screen is as everyone else says it is, not being able to charge the iPad from my notebook is a major disadvantage.  Taking away the unlimited data plan makes me feel betrayed by ATT and Apple.  I am returning the device and going back to my netbook.
Easily one of the most versatile and user friendly computer tools on the market today.  Competitively priced with all the "e-book readers" and you get so much more.  And the Apple brand ensures it will be a qualilty product for years to come.
Good points:It looks great. It's operation is immediately familiar to anyone that owns or has owned Apple products before and is completely intuitive.  It is fast, is ideal for watching films, browsing the net, reading ebooks and even playing games.Bad points:No Flash! I know all the arguments and the reasons why Apple do not support Flash but, seriously, this is a huge drawback, particularly now that Samsung and Toshiba have entered this market with their Android devices and that the HP Slate will have Windows 7. Lack of Multitasking as also a real pain in the neck.What it's not:It is not a substitute for a laptop.  Anyone thinking that it is and buying it to perform laptop functions is going to be disappointed.Screen size:I'm not sure whether the screen size is optimal.  The Samsung Tab has a smaller screen which still seems good for viewing films and for browsing but is not so 'in your face'. I can't decide for the moment which size is better.I'm not concerned about cameras and so forth. For me, they are mere fripperies on a device like this.Overall, it is an impressive product, but I wonder whether the 2nd generation will mark a significant advance on this, early adopter, model.
Got it 3 days ago, any minute with it is a wonderful experience.The only things that makes me frustrated is the file management- it is so not intuitive how tomanage PDF files and others (even photos) thats it makes the experience annoying sometime, and required some internet inquiry beside that, everything is just perfect.(I hope they will add camera, enable the voice call and (but I understand that only in dreams) slot for SD cards/USB
I bought an iPad today and I think it is going to work for me pretty well. It is not going to replace my laptop (MacBook) in work related activities, but it is going to replace it in fun-related activities. After working on my laptop all day long, when I want to relax and do some casual internet browsing, reading, watch my photos, etc I want to move away from my desk without carrying my 5 lb laptop with me (and also unplugging it from an external monitor and bunch of other cables). iPad allows me to do exactly this. 1.5 lbs vs 5 lbs (MacBook Pro) is a big difference. Instant on makes a big difference as well. I used to use my iPod Touch for these purposes, but it is too small to browse the Internet comfortably, and overall its 3.5" screen is too tiny pretty much for antything. (It worked as a e-reader to me pretty well though).I spent a lot of time trying to find a nice netbook, but after looking at one that my friend bought I realized that this is not going to work - these are just small (and therefore inferior) versions of laptops. I gave Kindle a try, but did not really like it. I gave MacBook Air a really close look, but that thing is twice as heavy and three times as expensive. iPad is conceptually new device and it seems to fill a niche that Apple is trying to fill pretty nicely.Some people say iPad is just a big iPod Touch, and this is true - it is a larger and better iPod Touch. This is why I like it. Its screen is 4-5 times larger, and it is less than twice as expensive (as I recall the cheapest iPod upon its release was priced at $299). I would say this is how iPod Touch was supposed to be from the very beginning. I always felt that my iPod touch was too large for an mp3 player and too small for an internet browsing device. May be without knowing it, I became an Apple geek - now I have a Macbook, an iPad, an iPod Touch, and iPod Nano. Probably I will get rid of my iPod Touch, but the other three devices complete each other perfectly: MacBook is for work, iPad is for casual browsing, reading, and checking email, and iPod Nano is for music and audiobooks.I got my iPad, keeping this 14-days return policy in mind, but I am pretty sure I am going to keep it. A lot of critical things that were mentioned here are true: I wish the screen was not glossy, and I wish it was lighter (but lets be realistic - it is way lighter than all laptops and quite a bit lighter than most notebooks), and I wish it could play Adobe flash videos. This is pretty much it - I don't see anything else that bothered me about this device. And there are tons of things that make me happy about it: a beautiful screen, quick response, external speakers (I really missed them on m iPod Touch), and as mentioned before - instant on.Looking back, I really feel that a lot of negative reviews that I've read did not make much sense - this device should be judged for what it is, not for what it could have been..
Just putting in my two cents, but this thing is amazing. I have been working with computers since cpm days andI have never had so much fun.  Some of the reviews I have read hear don't make any sense (the iPad is not heavy!)Having used this now for two weeks, there is no going back.
I've had my iPad for about a month now.  I use it several times a day.  I have used my netbook twice in that same time period - once to set up the iPad the other to transfer some pics.  The desktop is gathering dust. It doesn't get much better than this.
iPad is a bit intimidating at first.  However once you master the device, iPad becomes your second nature.
Amazing, a big iPhone with no USB port and no Flash!With many thousands of website developers integrating Flash into their websites and applications it is a sad thing to see Apple escalate their petty feud with Adobe by not including Flash in their hardware. Rather than hurting Adobe, Apple is instead hurting their customers web experience as well as showing their lack of respect for the millions of on-line business's that use Flash with this childish omission of a popular and long running web application.Once the darling of the computing world, with this ugly act, Apple has alienated millions of people who use the web. Apple is only hurting their own users and potential clients, as well as their reputation. Apple is soon to become the next disliked big company going the way of Microsoft.A company as big as Apple is expected to show a more mature attitude and lead the community as well as the world. It is a shame to see Apple become just another greedy company using it's power to hurt and destroy others. As long as Apple can settle a score with Adobe, it does not matter who else they trample underfoot along the way, or how much their interfere with their clients enjoyment of the web.
Be careful, this is the WiFi version for the WiFi+3g price.  Misleading and Amazon should take off!
It took me 30 minutes to get tired of the iPad. Having owned an iPod Touch for 2 years (until it was stolen last fall), the iPad felt routine and commonplace. The bigger screen is the only major difference, and I found it to be a negative one (but I recommend you try one out for yourself at your local Apple store):1. The iBook app text was too spacious. Studies show that we prefer to read narrow, 5-6 word columns so that we have minimal use of eye muscles. The iPod Touch is closer to this; The screen is only a few inches across, so there is automatically minimal eye movement for a streamlined reading experience. The iPad however, I could tell quickly would be much more tedious on the eyes than even a regular book. When the iBook is in the 2 pages orientation, not even one paragraph will fit the whole screen (on the smallest font). Your eyes and brain will be tracking greater distances for less information.2. Safari web browsing has additional issues on top of spacious text. - The iPad has about an inch-wide border between the edge touching your hand and the scrollable screen. So when scrolling, your thumb has to reach across a bit, adding a little awkwardness that may get tiring, and I found immediately annoying. Also, since the thumb is extended out, it will tend to be swiped up and left, which pulls the text you're reading out of alignment, and will need to be further adjusted. With the iPod Touch, the screen is a few millimeters from the edge, so scrolling is easily accessible, and the thumb is swiped completely vertical, keeping the text inline. Try it right now and see for yourself the difference of your thumb's movement when extended vs. not. - Depending on how zoomed in you are on the larger screen, you may also have to be more dramatic with your gestures, moving your hand across the whole screen if you want to scroll down a website. In fact, in general the ipad requires more muscle, if not to span across the screen as you interact, then just in holding the heavier device. The ipod Touch is much more leisurely in this regard. - Both devices have the double-tap feature that will automatically zoom a frame of a website to fit the screen, however doing this on the iPad gives you large, spacious text that spans the whole screen and is more difficult to read. This can be fixed with manual zoom, but thats one hassle I don't get with the ipod Touch.Lastly, the iPad's size makes it non-pocketable. Part of the iPod Touch's charm is that it is always in your pocket available to your fingertips and curious brain. Can't say that about this awkwardly-sized device, however.After I submit this, I'm going to purchase the 3rd gen, 8GB Touch for 180 bucks and get a better experience than I would with the iPad. I say check it out for yourself though (including a ipod Touch if you haven't yet), but keep these things in mind, because they are issues that I think usually only get noticed after the honeymoon is over.
I was hoping this would be able to stand alone as a computer should, more so as a portable device. I was hoping not to need another device to bring along to my Acer netbook. it was on a recent trip to Puerto Rico that I was able to compare the two.In terms of reliability, as a travel computer, the netbook wins. My hotel, Sheraton, only uses wired connection (Ipad was pretty much useless). Also, web pages load differently in the Ipad and I'm always wondering if I'm missing information I would have seen on my PC. Videos are always hit or miss. Imagine pulling up a video and 50% of the time it won't work.However, the things that it does do, it does well. it shows pictures remarkably well. it has much more decent battery life than my netbook and it shows web pages (those that it can handle) easier for me.On my next trip however, the netbook will be my companion and the IPAD stays home.
I purchased this iPad w/ 3G  for family use when in the car, travelling, etc.  However, many of the educational sights and many shopping sites require Adobe Flash Player to be installed.  Apple has seriously crippled the effectiveness of the device without Adobe Flash Player.  Apple should be up front about this limitation but is not.  I'm totally disappointed that my children can not even use their school site b/c Adobe Flash Player is missing. While the graphics driver is great, it is not useful without the programs I, as the consumer, would like to use.
Android and WebOS tablets are coming, so why buy now when the next version of the iPad will have to have more memory, a higher screen resolution and multi-tasking to compete.  Apple products are innovative, but they only become worth the premium Apple charges when competition forces them to refine their offerings.  I'll wait until the iPad2 emerges, or until someone else offers a price competitive product that gives me what I want: instant-on web browsing in a tablet.
I bought an Asus Netbook that I tried for 2 days.  In my opinion, netbooks are worthless gimmicks.  The iPad is hands down the best portable computing device ever.  It is fast, easy to use, good looking, and the battery seems to last forever.
I for one was excited when the announcement came out about the iPad. Unlike friends and colleagues, I looked past the funny name and lack of camera and saw something big coming. Once I had the device in my hand I knew it was a winner - could anyone doubt Apple? Sure there are some missing pieces, but this is the beginning of something really great. I can't remember the last time I was enthused about technology.Now I'm addicted. I carry my iPad back and forth to work, to meetings, and I'm prone to checking the iTunes store for new apps every few hours. Its like Christmas almost every day. There are so many wonderful apps already out, more on the way, and those that are out now are improving with updates constantly.I don't think the iPad (or similar copy-cat devices) will be for everyone... I'm sad for those who don't see the potential or will never find a good use for something like this. Love or hate Apple, this is honestly the game changer it was billed as - it will change your life for the better.Its not a large iPod, its not a netbook, its not a laptop replacement.. or is it all of these things. Thats for you to decide. Once you try it you will know, and the uses will grow every day.I didn't see the iPhone coming, but this one was obvious. Just watch out because your life will change.
Like it, miss webcam but who can beat touch n feel of  apple. Had little apprehension about how the browsing experience will be on this, but it turned out to be easier than a laptop. This d not have multi tasking so u can't browse and use an app at the same time , but u can download/listen to music and browse at same time. But in 15 days, there is an update for real multitasking and printing etc. Not a replacement for ur laptop but a gr8 browsing/app device.  4 stars for lack of camera
am grateful for amazon and mobileshark who allow the people who lives out of USA to get what they want, this is not my 1st time for ordernig items from amazon but its the 1st time i spend over $800 with trust that i will get what i want, thanks again for amazon and mobileshark who offer ipad in good prices and good shipment.about the ipad, i don't have to say anything, its ipad :)
I tried taking the IPAD on a few biz trips, but since you cannot save and manipulate files very easily, its causes challenges.. Overall, my son watches yo GABBA on it and it has saved us on long flights and car rides.. Better than DVD player in a car since it can be removed after.. Giving it 5 stars only because its an awesome toy/gadget for my son and family.
This is the most I've seen the ipad go for. It is cheaper every where else.
I bought the product at Best Buy and had it for about a week.  In the store, it seemed so sleek and sexy that I didn't pay attention to its major downfall.  Namely its sleek and sexy without substance.  While you get 10 hours of battery life, you are stuck with the battery because it can not be replaced.  What happens in a year or two when it only gets 8 hours of life and then less and less.  Essentially you get a giant ipod touch that can not be taken apart, upgraded, or have any other modification done to it (not really a computer in my book).  No peripherals such as a USB input or any other way of connecting to anything other than another computer (which by the way you will need to sync or even start the thing initially) unless you want to fork over more money.  At first, the on screen keyboard was OK but progressively, I realized that it was next to impossible to write even moderate sized emails in any span of time consistent with a modern lifestyle.  Nor can you do any sort of actual work on the thing: no multitasking and when I attempted to work on a couple of google docs it toke me forever to make even small changes.  Some counter that you can just get the additional keyboard dock but that's another $80 and isn't practical for everybody to carry around.  While I very much enjoyed web browsing in the touch screen format, I must admit that it was a different web.  Without Flash support, many of the sites I normally visited were not the same.Now for the good parts: it is really fun to use for media consumption, playing games, reading (inside not outside), and it makes people jealous that you own it.  Also, the app store are releasing many really innovative apps for the iPad.  After a week, these pluses were not enough to outweigh all the minuses above and I returned it.  I think the next generation of iPads may improve on these points but if they don't, I foresee netbook/tablet hybrids kicking the poop out of this product in the long run.
ipad doesnt support flash-- incredible! what are they thinking? will have to return mine, knocks out half my usage right there. really love apple products, their compatibility but all of a sudden their isolated- why?
The good:This thing is so cool in so many ways that I could not list them all.  Great battery life.  Good sound.The bad:This thing is so bad in so many ways I could not list them all.  The shape is not good.  No camera. The price! Needs better connectivity.  Lack of FLASH support a total deal breaker.  I was sitting in a restaurant showing this thing off when it started to rain.  I went to Intellicast to get the weather radar.  No joy.  Intellicast uses FLASH.  More sites use FLASH for more things than I ever knew.Bottome line:This thing is a very cool toy that can be usefull but is not well conceived.  Just wait, there will be better things out there.  Maybe the iPad II?
So i went out and bought this brand new Apple iPad on the very fist day. I am very satisfied, but have decided to attempt to return it. Ill explain that.For the stuff it does (apps, ebooks, games, music, pics, videos, etc) it does it all flawlessly and i couldnt possibly complain about any of it. Beyond expectations actually!The problem is it is BIG! I figured i would use it to watch movies or shows on my boring train ride every day. But what do i do with it when im not using it? If i carried a briefcase this wouldnt be an issue, but i dont. I can leave it on my lap, but then i risk either dropping it or being targeted by some thug who wants a new $700 toy for free.The other issue is that its DELICATE! Anyone with an iphone or ipod knows just how delicate these screens are ... and this one is even bigger than those! You can tell its made well, but a single drop will break the screen guaranteed.So while i do think its an amazing device, i think i can easily live without it. Maybe it would have been an easier decision to keep it if it hadn't cost me $700 ($499 + tax + replacement insurance which you MUST have!!)That's all. Good luck with yours, enjoy.PS, im not happy about spending $700 on something and it doesn't even come with a case or protective screen?? Common apple seriously!!! And then they boast the HD screen for movies ... but the movies cost $20 EACH!! They boast the ebook reader, but the good illustrated books are expensive!! Common how much money do i have to have so i can enjoy this thing??
2 days after buying the iPad, it started to make a click sound on every tap or slide independently from the volume settings or if the sounds for specific events was turned on or not. I am very disappointed since I expected a higher quality standard from an Apple product like this one, and I will change the iPad tomorrow.
The Product is very nice , thanks for quick transport.I appreciated to Amazon Company.I am always buying electronic product from Amazon.....
I recently bought an Ipad 64 gb Wifi. I didn't bother getting the 3G version because I am able to tether my Ipad wi-fi to my 3G phone. My 3G phone can act as a wi-fi hotspot which the Ipad can use to access the 3g connection; and with an unlimited plan on my 3G phone, I can surf 24/7 without worrying about usage.Although I am PC user, all my portable devices are Apple products, from the old first gen Ipod, first gen Itouch, to first gen Ipad- which isn't really portable. I like my Ipad. Interfact is very similar to the Itouch. The screen is HUGE, it's faster, the audio is much crispier and louder, a bit heavy but all in all, it's a very solid product. A lot of people say it's a big version of Itouch. In a way, I would say yes but performace wise, it's way way different. There's that sense of speed and stability that goes with the Ipad. It just runs so smoothly. Even downloading apps is just a two-click process.I have downloaded quite a few free and paid apps, mostly productivity apps. There's a new patch coming out soon for the Ipad OS so I'm holding off on getting all crazy with every apps the catches my eye.Together with the Ipad, I purchased a wireless Apple keyboard. It pairs with your Ipad in a snap. I suggest getting a keyboard if you're typing intensive. The virtual keyboard on the Ipad is responsive but I wouldn't use it so much. Sometimes I am heavy handed with my typing, I'm afraid I might crack the glass.I've noticed a lot of people giving Ipad low scores in Amazon review; and most of these low-scorers have never owned an Ipad. I own one and I am loving it. I'm going to buy the wife her own Ipad.
very great and entertaining product, but you can think of as big ipod , but can't fit in a pocket and have HD, wich i didn't use yet, but great for strategy games.
The title says it all.  The price tag of the iPad is way to high for what it is capable of.  As others have stated before me:-screen is glossy (very hard to read outside; unlike the kindle)-storage capacity is low-wifi connectivity issues that apple refuses to admit too-and you don't see the features on it that you expect for paying upwards of $600.-issues with connecting to other products, i.e. printers, wifi storage devices, but then again.. it's a Mac product, what do you expect?For $600 you can buy a netbook and a kindle and have WAY more capability.
Why would anyone want one? I would love for my mom to be tech savvy, to be able to wipe and reinstall her system software, to backup her hard drive on a regular basis, to upgrade and install RAM into the motherboard of her computer, to run the terminal to ping IPs to see why she can't get through somewhere.Is it going to happen? No. I'm not being pessimistic; she really has better things in her life to do. She's 76! I can't even adequately explain the concept of windows and menubars in a way that makes sense to her. Not to mention she has tremors and has a difficult time holding and accurately directing a mouse. I could get her an iPod Touch. I love mine, by the way. But with her near-sightedness and hand shaking, good luck touching the correct tiny little icon.With all that said, mom is getting a nice iPad w/ 3G for her birthday. I may not need one -- though they are awfully pretty and would be a wonderful lightweight companion while traveling -- but I really think my mom does. Besides, she loves games and this is a great way for her to keep her mind active while also being able to check her stocks, her email and whatever else she wants to do.And me? I will have saved countless hours of PC support time. Time that I can use enjoying time with my elderly mom rather than beating my head against a wall.
Received the iPad in record time.  It was everything I expected it to be.
Loved the screen, but had problems from day 1 with loading from a European SD card. Apple shop spent over 2 1/2 hours trying to sort it out, but finally I transferred items to my Windows PC and then via the ITunes app onto the IPad. Stupid. The Apple store's Geniuses were worthless. Once working it lost the Economist magazine which I downloaded after two days!! Each time I hooked up the same pc it wanted to verify it was approved, but I needed to be on the internet to do this - and I was travelling.  Apple IPad is more of a sour apple to me. Wish I never bought it, and waited until they sorted out the kinks.
This is an amazing product!!I am just shocked that Amazon is charging $907 for it when it is on Apple.com for $829!!All the accessories seem to be cheaper on the apple website as well!
iPad doesn't take you beyond more than half a step. Battery is too weak, resolution is too low. Next gen will be something to consider. This is just a bigger iPod. Some do say it can replace Kindle: actually I do not think so. It is something different, but definitely not a suitable ebook reader. To sum up: An iPad? I bought one, tested for a week and then resold. And guess what: I don't miss it at all.
The iPad is very responsive, is very fast, and has a nice display. It is nice for recreation, but that's about it. It in no way can replace a laptop or desktop. Also, as many people have mentioned, it really is just a larger version of the iPod Touch. I really expected more from this device, but what I got was less than I thought would be mandatory. There's a video editor for the iPad, but there's no camera? And then you have to be near a public wi-fi to surf the internet unless you want to shell out an extra couple hundred dollars for the 3G edition which you have to buy a 3G plan to use which means even more money.If all this wasn't bad enough, the iPad pretty much lost most of its portability. Sure it can fit in your backpack better than a laptop and can fit in a manila envolope (not sure why you'd want to put it in a manila folder, but you can), but if you don't have a backpack it's kind of a pain to lug it around. You can't put it in normal pockets and it's awkward to just hold all of the time. It can be used for all of your media, which is a plus, but why would you want it too? You might as well just get an iPhone (not an iPhone 4 though since they're still having issues with that, but that's for another review).I'm sure that there will be plenty of people who will love this device since it is an Apple product and it does have a few traditional dazzling Apple features, but I think that this device is a waste of money and you should only buy it if you have absolutely no need for several hundred dollars. If you buy this to replace an MP3 player or a laptop, then you're in for a sad surprise. Who knows though? Maybe I expected too much with thinking that the iPad would be technologically on par with other modern electronics and that Apple would have some better way of carrying it that a cheesy pouch or in a backpack. If my review were based on any of these I'd give one star, but the iPad does a good job with its interface and it still has the large app database that Apple fans love so I gave it one more star. I know Apple can do better and chances are that the iPad will probably be another Apple series where they make very small changes in between each product and make a fortune. The next iPad will probably have a camera, but won't shoot video. Shame on you Apple.
I bought the iPad on the 28th May when it got released in Australia and just returned it yesterday.In my opinion, I don't see any point of this device. I already have a laptop and the laptop can do everything that iPad can do.On the positive iPad is cool and magazines really come to life in it.However, it is heavy, does not have a camera, is not a phone so I cannot see the point!I paid almost $1000 for this device and I am glad I returned it since I could find any value in it!
Why does the basic iPad cost nearly $100 more on Amazon than it does on the Apple website?!?
I dont write long reviews, only short and fast to read ones.Super sleek, battery life is a little bit beyond amazing (never had to charge it twice a day) and finally, you wont understand how seamless  its touch gestures are until you try an imitated device.Thank you.
This I pad is great I have not even touch the serfic of what it can do
The service from this dealer was very good and quick.  I, however was not as bright.  I bought the wrong one.  After several hours of frustration I finally got help from a "computer guy" and he told me I had the wrong one for what I needed.  So now I have 2 of them - the one I needed in the first place and the one I need to resell.  I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about this dealer.
Apple again did a very good marketing. I saw many people rushed to buy it because they saw good reviews and they though it was cool, but not thinking as an adult whether it is really useful. I posted my review on ASUS netbook when it was out at $399, saying it worth $199. That is the price of it in 6 months. For iPad, the cost to produce is about $250. So $350 should be a reasonable price. Note that you have to pay for wireless providers. It is not even close to a laptop, for sure. Will I get one? Probably, but not at this price. Oh, I am sure Apple's CEO is happy that you pay for his dinner. He did a really good job, though. I actually likes a color digital device to read magazines/books, but not that small. I bet either Apple, or other company, will release a better device at the size of a real magazine soon.
It's interesting that Amazon sells the iPad indirectly so as to make it too expensive to consider. Is it because just one of the myriad features of the iPad alone is a Kindle killer? Yea, that's gotta be it! Man-up Amazon, you're supposed to be a "Marketplace". That sort of infers a democracy of products.
If you are waiting to buy one because your friends told you to wait for gen 2..DON'T...Your friends don't even own an Ipad or they are jealous and bitter...This is technogology at its finest..and it's tons of fun....but keep your laptop...******UPDATE*****.***have been very happy with Ipad 1st gen...but had to have 2nd gen.......Battery life is the same...thinner,  whatever....Camera....whatever.....Faster  YES!  The gen. 2 has double the memory and a faster processor ..I am using a samsung 4G wireless hotspot thru Verizon and ipad 2 is very fast......BUT I could have lived with ipad 1... For those of you that are finding good deals on generation 1 pads...Get them!!!  I sold mine in one day for $300.00 to a friend...Buy them  without 3g...Instead try Verizon with  4g personal wifi device (mine is By samsung)  It makes both ipads FLY!!!
What is going on here with apple Ipad.  Jacking up the price to 600 plus when you can buy it brand new from the dealer the apple store for $500 plus free shipping for the exact same thing 16 gb Ipad.  Do not buy it on amazon from these dealers unless they lowere there price to 500 you are wasting your money and being ripped off.
With a shortage of IPADs on the market at the moment we were grateful to find a vendor who would ship one on a rush basis.Can't say anything about the IPAD itself yet but at least we got it in time for our presentation.  We would buy from Venture Bridge again.
IT'S REALLY FANTASTIC FOR ALL THE REASONS EVERYONE ELSE WROTE BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE FLASH THAT'S THE ONLY STUPID THING TO ME.
i bought an ipad from the net seller , after 6 days . i got a cancelation from the net seller becuase they don;t have it in stock.HOW CAN YOU SELL SOMETHING YOU DOON'T HAVE ??and i bought the screen protector and the skin with it as a bundel so i eneded up having the skin and cover and without the ipad it self ,This really sucks , i will never buy from the netseller .and i have no trust in amazon that they allow such companies to work from there website .
First of all you need to read the product features on Apple to have facts.* I Book totally new and not on I Touch.* 3G totally new* Price start at what I Touch started at with 8gig a few years ago* Support for playback of closed-captioned content* VoiceOver screen reader* Full-screen zoom magnification* White on black display* Mono audioMine is pre-ordered now and form other reviews on the web I am sure this is going to be a big success and step forward!To ALL the nay Sayers and Sauer grapes responders:  I NOW HAVE owned the I Pad for two weeks and stand by my positive pre-order post 100% and then some!!  The image sharpness is better then I imagined.  The speed of the new processor is a big improvement over the I Phone.  The sound of the on board speaker is a vas improvement over the I Touch.The only thing I would say is disappointing is how slow some of the previous app developers are making the change to the I Pad format i.e. Facebbok & EReader.
The bad:.Can't do flash because Jobs doesn't like it. It's your device and he made the decision for you. WTF?.The device is too heavy..ITunes sucks. I'm an IT professional for 15 years and I think ITunes is THE worst application ever.The good:.Apple store applications. But looks like Android's Market Place is going to win, sooner or later.
This product will prove to be as big a hit as iPhone. Even though it lacks a few features right now, knowing Apple next versions will totally nail it. It brings so much content to you with the right interface that this is going to become the primary device of multimedia and internet content access.
I'm a product design student and the following is my experience of Apples, so called magical ipad.Worked out of the box(both of the ones I've had), Into a recovery mode loop after updating, even when I replaced an ipad!!! And it was updated by apples own software, with itunes 10 whatever. The fact of the matter is, Apple are selling defective products to whoever gets them at high prices, even my ipod classic has been acting funny, and the iphone 4 is a showcase of how they want to manipulate people and take peoples money, whilst they build their empire. The high reviews are most likely from people who's ipads are working, please take my advice and avoid apple, products, my brothers ipod touch also got returned to the apple store more than 3 times, from what I remember.Your risking your money, when you buy one of their products, will you get what works or not, that's what should be in your mind. It aint magical it's a pain!!! I've wasted over £500 with a case, I will get my money back/sort something, pc world!!!Don't buy Apple products, if your upset about what I wrote, go into an Apple store and check for the customers returning defective/non working products and count how many throughout the week if you can.Very upset with a rubbish piece of engineering, don't buy North American products if you can.
Yes, it actually works if you willing to waste your time. Very unfriendly tablet. No paperwork. As I compare this tablet to regular PC this tablet worth exactly  10 bucks. The only valuable future is Internet access. Its not really fast either. Other strange thing is everybody told me Apple protected against viruses--nonsense. In first 10 minutes some program attacked tablet and luckily for me I was fast enough to shut tablet down. If I have question and I do I have to drive to Apple store and ask.Avoid.after having this toy for some time i realized anything i want to do i need second computer like printing or word prosessing and they always trying sell me music and install upgrades on my regular PC so finally i shut it down. useless toy. now i am planning buy Toshiba with 4G.
Hello,  I have the unique blessing of owning one of these extravagant HP Touchsmart TM2T tablet laptops.  I bought mine back in May, 2010, and I bought mine brand new via Ebay store.  I disagree with this seller's price, however, because my TM2T has almost the exact same specs as his does, and I paid only $800 for mine.  Actually the price was $780, but with S&H;, it came to the $800.  The only thing mine doesn't have that this one has is the ATI dedicated graphics.  I did some research on this switchable graphics option on this TM2T tablet laptop, and to be honest, unless a person is a dedicated gamer or does some very serious graphic arts or someting like that, having the ATI switchable graphics will not make much difference. Plus, it drains the battery life.  I got the basic Intel integrated HD graphics on my TM2T, and I can play and do the same high end games and the same extreme graphics as one with ATI can do. Instead of burning my cash up on something that I probably wouldn't ever need, I decided to spend an extra $300 shortly after I got my TM2T, and I bought me the full 8 GB brand new memory.  Now the memory to me is very useful because I am a Netflix/video buff.  With the 8 gigs of memory, my TM2T and Netflix run everso smooth.  I have watched the most action-packed and most graphic enhanced movies, and they played without flaw, without lag whatsoever, and were bright, sharp, and clear.  I'm not saying to Not get the ATI graphics.  I love my TM2T so much that I am planning on getting a second one in a month or so, and I do want it to have the ATI dedicated graphics, just for bragging rights.  But I know that that is all I will find use for them for.  Anyway, the HP Touchsmart TM2T is just dynamitely awesome; it is built with some very high quality, and the speakers, finally, are elegantly placed right where a laptops's speakers should be placed.  And the audio quality is the best I have ever heard on a tablet laptop. The keyboard, webcak, dual mics, Bluetooth, connections, and everything else in my TM2T work absolutely flawless and have amazing performance.  What I don't understand that some of the people that are selling the TM2T, really jack up the price on it, and they don't even have the highest end processor on theirs.  There is no way anyone is going to pay $1500 for a near-base model TM2T tablet laptop when they can go right to Ebay or even to HP's site, configure one with everything plus the latest and greatest processor type, ATI graphics, and everything else and pay much less for it;  and with special pricing and coupons and student discounts, they would pay even lesser amount for one brand new and with the highes of every spec available.  So you people, such as this seller here, that is selling a near-base model TM2T for a jacked-up price, you need to do some research, and then make your prices quite a bit more reasonable.  I got everything on my TM2T that is on this one here Except for the ATI graphics, and I even got the 8 gig of memory recently, and I also bought a super slim super fine HP external DVD Burner which works Extremely well and is the clearest DVD player I have ever saw, and even getting all of this, I paid a much less price than what is being charged here.  These people charging like this, really need to compare their prices with others, and come way down,a s I have said!  Still though, the TM2T is the absolute best deal for a tablet laptop that is going today.  HP has a real winner on their hands with it!  Thanks for listening!
Edit 20110314: I no longer recommend this to anyone. This product is Version 1 running Android 1.5. The new 7HT is Version 2 running Android 2.1.[...]The 7HT is the fourth Archos product I've owned. Aside from the Gen 1 Jukebox, 5IMT amd 5IT, I purchased three 7HTs.  Two as gifts for friends. Both my friends are technical types, not your average Home Owner to whom Archos markets the 7HT.Personally, I am very pleased with the 7HT.  It does everything I wanted it to do.  However, I'm a retired techie and I found workarounds for flaws which would hamper the average Home Owner.  I'm also a moderator on the ArchoFans Support Forum and focus on the 7HT forum.Flaw 1:As delivered the Archos 7HT cannot create new folders.  This flaw prevents using the 7HT as a Digital Photo Frame with the supplied App - Photo Frame.  Photo Frame treats folders as "albums" for displaying slideshows.--Workaround: Install an App like ES File Explorer which can create new folders.--Conclusion: Works fine for me now.Flaw 2:Archos provides the Aldiko eReader.  I downloaded two books before I installed an 8G microSDHC card.  After I installed the 8G card Aldiko "lost" the books I downloaded previously.--Workaround: Don't use Aldiko before you install a microSDHC card.--Conclusion: Works fine now and I have over 100 epub formatted eBooks in Aldiko now.Flaw 3:The Archos 7HT has an Unexpected Wake from Suspend every two hours.  I had a drop from 81% battery charge to 18% after 4 hours and 36 minutes when I had the Screen Timeout set to Never.--Workaround: Installed FastBright app to switch to a minimum 5% screen brightness and set the Screen Timeout to 1 minute.  With these settings I've experienced only a 3% to 5% battery decrease.--Conclusion: Works ok now. Only a firmware update will eliminate the Unexpected Wake from Suspend.Iffy:Out of the box Video playback did not work for all the videos I tried which did play on my PC under VLC and on my Archos 5IT. Some folks at the ArchoFans forum have no problems and others have plenty of video problems.--Workaround: Convert videos via a PC program. I've found one group of settings which work and am still searching for more.--Conclusion: Works ok for me since I'm more interested in eReading and less in video playback.Note 1:The 7HT does not support video out despite what you may read at Amazon or elsewhere.Note 2:A USB adapter, micro A male to A Female, is required to use the 7HT as a USB Host for thumb drives, USB keyboards, mice, and powered USB hubs.  These adapters are difficult to find as not even Amazon has any.  The USB receptacle on the 7HT is micro AB and the supplied USB cable is micro B for USB client mode.Note 3:Out of the box the 7HT has no support for WiFi file copies.  An App like ES File Explorer provides this.Note 4:I doubt if Archos will provide additional firmware updates to correct the "flaws" I mentioned above. They outsourced the Android development and are working on the new Gen 8 software.Note 5: (Update 20100923)In mid-September Archos did update the firmware. While I've seen no corrections for the "flaws" AF forum members and I have found the touchscreen to be more responsive and satisfying.Conclusion:If you're an average Home Owner and want the 7HT to "work" out of the box, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.  If you have a gadget or Android or techie background the 7HT should work for you and at $200 is a great value.  I recommend you join a forum like ArchoFans to get the most from your 7HT. For example, recently one of our ArchosFans members got the Google Android Market working on the 7HT.Allen
As others have said, it's a good value for $200.  But I take that a little bit further and say that I'd rather have this gadget than the $500 iPad.  Why?  Here's why.-It is smaller and almost half the weight.  This makes it comfortable to hold and view with one hand, which is difficult with the iPad.  I plan to hold on to it and watch videos while stationary biking at the gym, which would be difficult with a bigger tablet.-The screen is matte.  It has much less glare than the iPad.-I use it mainly to watch videos.  In this capacity, it excels, supporting more video formats than the iPad, and coming in a widescreen format instead of 4x3.-It does most things as well or nearly as well as the iPad.  Aldiko is a great ebook reader, you can download Swype to make typing super fast, videos and music play great, etc.-It plays youtube and flash videos if you use the Skyfire browser.Of course, there are drawbacks.  I wouldn't give it a low rating though because it's missing features that only come with $500 tablets.-The screen is resistive, and occasionally doesn't register your tap.  This improves with time, if you turn on the click-on-tap sound setting.-The Android marketplace doesn't work from the device.  To get apps beyond the basic ones, you must either install another marketplace (like Slideme) or search around the web.-The chip is supposedly slower to lower the pricepoint.  I haven't noticed this much.So for a student, or younger working type without much cash, this is an insane buy.  Tons of tablets will be coming out this year, but this one works perfectly fine and may still be cheaper than anything else coming out for a long time.  7 inches is a perfect size right in between small phones and big iPads, and I've enjoyed using it in various situations during the week I've owned one.Enjoy!
I got mine last night and I am very happy with it.  I gave it five stars, not because it does everything under the sun, but because it is a great value for $200.  Some things I write below compare it to expectations from smartphones and tablet standards, but they should be taken with a grain of salt because of the low price tag.Likes: I love the form factor.  Archos has provided a proof of concept and I can't wait for the 7" Android tablets to flood the market later this year and next year.  It is very light weight and awesome for laying in bed or on the couch while surfing, reading etc.  The form factor is just so much more enjoyable than a 10" iPad.  The video quality is just stunning and will make an excellent travel companion just for this feature alone.  Typing on the device (with Swype) makes this a great tablet for writing short emails and getting on facebook.  The attached kickstand is very convenient and I'm sure it will get tons of use.  I just hope that it won't break since it is plastic.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the system very snappy and responsive since I was expecting a little bit of lag time due to the specs.  I would have liked to see more processing speed and more memory, but who wouldn't?Dislikes: Of course the resistive touch screen is the top of the list.  I would have liked to see capacitive, but market limitations just didn't make that possible.  I'm sure there will be a lot of 7" tablets with capacitive screens released later this year.  I would have liked an accelerometer, but I haven't missed it yet.  I'm sure that I will run across an app that will make me miss it, but nothing so far.  I don't have to worry about the orientation changing unexpectedly when laying down, so that is a plus.  The 1.5 version of Android was a terrible mistake by Archos and, in my opinion, inexcusable.  1.6 should be a bare minimum at this point and I am going to run into a lot of apps that won't work.  I would have also liked the ability to charge the device over USB (you have to use an outlet).Other Thoughts:  If you are in the market for a great 7" entry level tablet, this is a great buy and you won't be disappointed.  If you must have top of the line and can't see yourself happy downgrading services from your Android phone, then you might want to hold off until later this year.  I am part of the [...] community and that is making this device much more enjoyable because we have a wiki of confirmed supported apps along with other information.  Some people have reported defective devices, but it seems like a small portion of the population, so that is nothing out of the ordinary.  Archos has already released one firmware update, and I hope more come in the future.  With the limited memory and processing speed, a task manager is an absolute MUST have.
At first, I got this device and felt like returning it.  But after using it for like 2 days, I have found that you can view YouTube, other video sites (even porn, just goto the mobile versions) by installing the SkyFire browser.Also, I own a Nexus One, which runs Android 2.2.  The Archos 7 streams videos flawlessly than my Nexus One, I believe that's due to its added GPU processor.Other than that, this device is great because you can simply load avi, mov, even DivX files and you can play it back in crisp 720P HD.The resistive touchscreen was sorta cheapish at first but for the price you pay, I rather have the cheaper resistive than capacitative since you can browse websites without any pinch-and-zoom due to its large 7-inch LCD.Anyways, I hated it first when I just got the device but after using it couple days, I am lovin' it as it's replacing my internet browsing on my smartphone.Also, internet radio is great too since I can literally put the device anywhere in my kitchen, all while browsing the web too.  Multi-tasking is pretty good, although not super fast.Seriously though, this is the best Android Tablet you can get right now for the money.  I know there's a bunch of larger 10-inch android tablets coming out later this year but the price isn't going to match up with Archos 7.Even my kids love it since I can put some Spongebob videos and they can watch it without asking me to boot up my secondary laptop, then play it.One thing I really love about the device is its fast boot-up time and sleep mode.  There's virtually none so it's really great portable media player.
I have read and agree with the criticisms..and I still really like it because it does what I want to very well.I was initially looking for an e-book reader for my wife, but then I came across this product.  Having not owned an e-ink e-reader, I cannot make direct comparisons.  But on its own merit, the archos 7ht is a very functional e-reader.  I easily loaded my wife's ePub books and I can control things like font, font size, portrait or landscape view, multiple bookmarking, and the best thing for me is reversing the colors so that the text is white on a black page.  This makes reading in the dark very easy on the eyes, and probably extends battery life as well.  It also allows changing the brightness, which is helpful in various lighting conditions.In addition, I get a versatile movie and music player and a decent web browser!Pros:great form facturegreat battery lifegood screengood e-readerdecent web-browserversatile movie and music playerdroid marketplace is a bonus, as this isn't something my wife would even look atCons:touch screen inaccurate/insensitiveglitchy firmwareold techalthough it advertises playing movies at 720p, it cannot play a high bitrate movie smoothly.This is not a hassle-free product, but I wasn't expecting it to do everything really well.  If it did, it wouldn't be $199.  Screen tapping twice every so often isn't a big deal.  Doing some research [...] will really help minimize/avoid frustrations with this product.  After becoming familiar with the product, I am very satisfied with what it does.
I was highly anticipating the arrival of the Archos 7 Home Tablet.  Since having it for almost one week, I have tested just about every feature it comes with.  Like most reviewers, the touch screen is a little picky, but I like that feature as compared to my HTC phone which is hypersensitive and I make many mistakes.  The WiFi feature is really above my expectations and connects to my internet immediately.  I have done a lot of surfing with it and it never fails to impress me.  What I really like is the quality of the videos...simply outstanding. The music system is also very good and I like not having to deal with iTunes (all systems should be drag and drop).  What was most impressive was the bookreader.  It comes with a couple of books for you to load and the quality is really good.  I have loaded a couple of apps games for my grandson and the unit really delivers.  I don't want to forget the photo feature and the slide shows you can do with it. What Archos has delivered is really outstanding, especially considering the price.  If I want an iPad that connects to the internet, try $650 or more and the cost of a data package.  Archos really hit a home run with this one, especially going with the android OS.I recently had a company, named Boxwave, manufacture a screen protector for my Archos 7 Home Tablet.  I had tried several screen protectors, but the best one out there is made by Boxwave.  Unfortunately, they told me they did not have one for the Archos. However, they said if I would take the measurements and send to them, they would manufacture one for me. I have used their screen protectors on my phone and they are outstanding.  Also, I did not like the reflection of the Archos screen or the other screen protectors.  Boxwave manufactured one out of anti-reflective material.  I just received it last week and put it on.  What a difference it makes and the touch screen appears to be more sensitive than without it.  That makes a big difference to me.  I highly recommend Boxwave for the screen protector.
The Archos 7 Home Tablet is a decent surfing device if you're looking for something with a larger screen but don't want to spend a lot of money.  I have an iPod Touch and was looking for something larger for surfing.  This device is by no means an iPad and I knew that going in.  You are able to multi task such as streaming Pandora or iHeartRadio while surfing the web.  I use the Touch for some games (which I haven't played on this) and apps, but found myself more often than not wanting a gadget for surfing the internet that had a larger screen.  This device is also an excellent e-book reader and has an app where you can download a TON of free books!You can play Youtube videos if you install Skyfire.  The video quality is excellent and speakers sound good.  The app library is not the full Android Marketplace and it would be nice if it were able to access it.  You can find apps around if you're patient and don't mind messing around a bit.  I upgraded the firmware to a newer version first thing (it will erase any apps you had that didn't come with it so do it if necessary right away before downloading too many apps.)I wanted to experience Android and for once get in as an early adopter of a tablet rather than waiting.  The resistive touch screen interface can be tricky but you get used to it and can swipe, just not flick like the i devices can do.  If you buy it (and for the price if that's what you're willing to spend I say do it) just give yourself a few days with it before deciding if it's for you or not.  Engadget said you get what you pay for and I tend to agree with that statement.  I was willing to spend what this gadget cost and I'm good with it feeling comfortable that I have a nice surfing and media device with a larger screen.
Considering that the Archos 7 costs less than half of what an iPad costs, this tablet is a great value.  It surfs the web, grabs your email, has apps and can do Flash.  The built-in Wi-Fi is easy to configure and can pick up signal easily.  The screen is bright...very bright...enough for outdoor use with ease.The only drawback would be its touchscreen.  It is older technology and not as sensitive as the iPad, but again - less than half the cost of an iPad.Watch out Apple!UPDATE 06.25.2010I finally had a chance to install the Skyfire browser.  It immediately doubled this tablet's value.  I now can view Flash videos, including Youtube and news site videos - i.e. CNN.The Skyfire browser was a little hard to find especially since the Archos does not have access to Android Market.  I had to search and download the .apk file from my desktop computer, copy it to a mini-SD card, and run the install on the Archos.
So, I have used Archos products for the last 8 years, I used some of their first hard drive based MP3 players and later the PMA-400, which in 2006 had wifi, audio, video, etc.  I've never been very impressed with their operating systems on their media players, so I was excited when I saw they decided to go with Android 1.5.Android 1.5 seems to work very well on this system, at least relative to their prior OS.  It's not as fast or as smooth or perhaps as stable as an iPad's OS, but in my opinion it's a small sacrifice to save $300+ (to upgrade to an iPad).  One of the best features of this device is its use as a book reader.  Literally within 15 minutes, I had downloaded an .EPUB file from Barnes and Noble's website to my desktop and then copied to the Archos mounted on my PC.  The preinstalled book application, Alkido, was able to easily import the file and within minutes I was reading.  HOWEVER, the only .EPUB files you can view through any Android based ebook readers are ones without DRM (digital rights management).  The samples from B&N; do not include DRM.  The actual books when purchased, however, do.  This means you CANNOT USE THIS TABLET CURRENTLY TO READ ANY .EPUB BOOKS DOWNLOADED FROM SITES LIKE BARNES AND NOBLES.  There are thousands on non-DRM books available for free which are easily accessed within the Alkido application, however, and this is enough for me.The screen size on the Archos is just about perfect.  The iPad is too big, the iPod/iPhone too small, this is just right for videos, web surfing, and certain book reading.  Speaking of web surfing, the interface is a little awkward at first, but you get used to it.  It's also maybe a tad slow surfing the web, though the appslib and slideme android application browers run fine.The video and audio playback seem to work well too, though I haven't tested any 720p media. The one final thing I want to mention here is the touch screen -- it's not close to the quality of the iPad, which I have used fairly extensively.  It's crucial to carefully calibrate it at startup or you may have typing issues.
Bought this device, so that I could watch music videos on youtube, or anime (mkv files) while I work out. I wanted to love this thing, but I just couldn't make it work!Pros: Nice big screen, clear and crisp, speakers decent, fairly light weightCons:Shoddy design - I've seen a couple reviews that mentioned this, but it happened to me too. The back panel is made of thin, reflective metal. With 1x use, the heat from the unit actually WARPED the panel. There was a palpable space underneath the panel, so every time I handled the device, it made an audible snapping noise as the panel flexed. Super annoying, and I imagine eventually the whole panel would have simply fallen offCupcake - I've read this term on a few reviews as well, from the more advanced users. I didn't quite understand at first, but basically, it comes with an older version of the android OS. You have to be willing to MOD the hell out of this device to get it to do anything advanced (and the tech/geek forums were great resources). However, even after hacking/installing the free marketplace, I found that half the apps didn't even run reliably.Freezes - multitasking sucks, very slow between screens and frequent freezing. Once I spent 40 mins staring at this useless device while on the cross-trainer; I was unable to unplug my headset from the device because it was frozen on the Pandora app, but still blasting out 1-2 second segments of a song every 3-5 minutes - I didn't want to disturb the other people in the gym. The device wouldn't turn off.The reset button has a very tiny access - most large paperclips wouldn't fit into it, I needed to eventually use a safety pin.Movie player sucks - when I read that it could handle MKV and other popular video formats used by my favorite fansubs, I was stoked! The device failed at everything else, I thought at the very least if it could play my anime, I'd forget all the pitfalls. No go - supports mkv, but no subtitle functionality. Fail.Hot Hot Hot - this thing gets hot...Browser capability - couldn't get the youtube app from hacked Market Place, so i was stuck using Skyfire browser to attempt to watch videos online. More often then not, it did not recognize that there was a video on the page I was viewing. It's an ongoing issue, as youtube continually change the flash features on their site; skyfire just doesn't keep up with the updates timely enough...but hey it's a free android market app - that's expected. Access to the youtube app would have fixed this.Touch screen - not a big deal to me, but it was quite difficult to use at times with the slow and sluggish responsiveness. I have to re-calibrate almost with every use.So...I ended up returning it. I would definitely purchase the next version if they updated the OS because that would fix almost 99.9 % of the issues I encountered. The device itself has potential, but right now, my Droid 2 does more...
Nice packaging, acceptable build quality (for the price).  On usability, a resounding "no".The CPU is acceptably fast, the screen is nice and bright... butSCREEN.  Here's the big problem.  I had only used capacitive screens until now, and I figured that resistive screens probably got too much of a bad rap... but it's deserved.  Not only do you have to press the screen with determination, I found sometimes I had to repeat the press two and three times... and then the machine gets confused between a regular press and a long press (like a right click with a mouse). VERY annoying...!BROWSING.  The resistive screen makes browsing the web next to impossible.  Flipping the screen up and down, because of the need for pressure, usually ends up being interpreted as a press, switching to a different page.  THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST ANNOYING FEATURE. If you're getting the Archos 7 to browse the web. DON'T...!MARKET.  The Google Markets is not accessible, only the Archos market.  Being quite adept at modding my Android phones, I can overcome the lack of apps easily with some extra work, but unless you're technically able and prepared to do this, forget about this tablet.SIZE.  This is personal.  I thought the 7" size would be ideal because of weight and portability, but I found web pages too small to display it in landscape mode.  I'll be returning this tablet and getting the Archos 101.
First, some background: I purchased this tablet as an experiment to see whether I might want to invest in a better one later, or whether I need the power of a regular tablet computer.  I'm primarily displaying books that have *lots* of graphics, and scrolling and/or page turns have to be fast.  I normally use my netbook for this, but it doesn't open flat, and thus can't sit on a music stand.The first one I received kept shutting off randomly, sometimes before it even finished booting.  Installing the latest firmware and keeping it plugged in didn't help, so I exchanged it through Amazon.  The replacement works much better.The battery life is good.  I generally leave it suspended most of the day, with some reading, audio, and occasional wifi use, probably a total of 3-4 hours/day.  I haven't gotten the battery down to 50% yet - the only time I've even come close is when I was using wifi extensively.The touch screen could be better, but for the price it's quite reasonable.  I haven't had any significant problems using it - I have more trouble with the one on my phone.  There are occasional glitches where it will pop up the notification screen or the volume control, but I'm pretty sure that's the software, not the screen itself.  I've never had it do that while turning pages in a book, for example.The screen isn't too glossy, and doesn't seem to need a screen protector as long as you aren't doing anything likely to scratch it, like using a stylus.  The case I bought came with a free screen protector, which made the touch screen much harder to use.The clock ends up way off if you leave it suspended.  I found a reference to an older firmware update for the Archos 7 Internet Tablet that fixed this problem, but the latest firmware for the Home Tablet doesn't fix it.  Tech support didn't know when this might be addressed.  There doesn't seem to be any way to remove the clock from the status bar, so I have to try to remember not to take it too seriously :-)  And, of course, using the alarm clock is out of the question.The built in photo frame and photo viewer sort by file write date.  If you know what a shell script is, you should have no trouble working around this.  If not, this is part of the "not for beginners" stuff :-)  I have found that the photo viewer can be useful for reading short books that are mostly graphics where high quality is important, e.g. music - represent each page as a picture.  There is a limit on how many pictures it will read, but I haven't bothered to pin it down exactly.  There is a slight delay while it draws the next picture - I haven't decided yet if I could get used to using it this way for anything other than practice.If you have the brightness turned all the way down in the built in ebook reader, the backlight may not get turned on when resuming from suspend.  If you have configured it to allow you to adjust the brightness while reading, you can use that action to turn on the backlight.If you are using a file manager that allows you to open files, you can import .epub files into the built in ebook reader by clicking on them.  They are deleted from their current location once the import is finished.The pdf readers I've tried have been painfully slow - I'd be ready for the next page before the current one is finished drawing.  It doesn't look like pdf is a viable format for anything serious on this platform.Page turns in the built in ebook reader are pretty quick, but opening a chapter can take some time, particularly if it is large.  Navigating via the table of contents is awkward - you can't just open it in a side pane like you can on a normal computer, even though the screen is wide enough to support it in the default landscape mode.The built in html viewer works ok for continuous scrolling, although I wish I could put it into portrait mode.  Scrolling can also be a bit tedious with the resistive touch screen.
Got mine last night from Amazon (Amazon Prime rocks!), pretty happy so far. I knew I would have to manually install apps that aren't in the Archos AppsLib application, since Google doesn't support this through the Android Market. Also, it's currently running Android 1.5, nowhere near the upcoming release of 2.2 for Android phones. They'll hopefully upgrade it to at least 1.6 soon, anything past that may be beyond the capability of a firmware upgrade.Other than that the only really sucky thing is that it can only recharge using the 'wall wart' power adapter, it doesn't recharge via the USB cable. So I'll pick up an aftermarket adapter and a compatible car charger so I can keep it juiced up at work and on the road.The resistive touchscreen doesn't respond like a capacitive touchscreen, you actually have to tap or push and drag to make things happen. Engadget whined about this quite a bit, but it's no big deal and you get used to it quickly. As a previous owner of old-school Fujitsu tablets, no big deal to me.Video quality is very good, displaying 720p and keeping up with a variety of video codecs. Audio quality is actually quite good as well, but don't expect anything resembling bass response. The two built-in speakers do an adequate job for their size, and connection to external speakers greatly improves things. There are multiple preprogrammed EQ settings, and the capability to customize your own.Enough for now, gotta go play some more. I'll update the post in the next few days with additional observations. Check me out at my new site, [...] or on Twitter as ThatGeekGuy.
I got this tablet a few days ago. I knew what I was getting into because I had read the early reviews of this product. I got this mostly for using it on the go when I want to use the internet. I wasn't disappointed until I tried Youtube and Facebook via the included web browser. I had to do research online to understand the tablet better before. I also told myself "It's only $199 so if I don't like it..I'll send it right back".Two days ago, I installed the Skyfire browser which DOES use Flash and allows youtube viewing. (Take that, Apple!) This made a huge difference for me and it's one of the best web browsers I've ever seen. I have not tried everything yet but as a media tablet...Its GREAT! I just wish it used a different memory card but I can live with it. With my psp, I used my neuros memory card reader connected with my tivo to transfer my TV shows. I'm still experimenting with the tablet to see how I can best transfer my TV shows to it without a computer. As for a computer and TIVO, using TIVO Plus software or connecting it to the PC works extremely well. It would be nice if the tablet had a captioning feature but I'm not complaining.I can use Facebook just the same as on a computer with all the flash games via Skyfire browser which is great.  You can't do this on an Ipad. One Ipad owner I know is actually taking back his Ipad to get this tablet this feature alone.As for the screen, you get what you pay for. You can watch HD quality movies and there's great screen brightness control too. One reviewer said he gave up on the screen calibration and wanted to send it back. That's coming from a person who doesn't seem to have much patience. I use a smart board as part of my job and have to do screen calibration several times too, It's not perfect but it gets the job done.Thanks to the helpful tips that the previous reviewers of this tablet had written in their reviews, I use Skyfire, Slideme and other apps to make this tablet a far more useful one. I haven't gotten around to using the e-book reader that's includes because I still don't understand how to get e-books yet. The upcoming Kindle for Android is a BIG deal as I'd definitely would use it as soon as it's available.The wifi connection is pretty stable and good enough for everything I've done online. I haven't tried it on the road yet.My six year old already loves using the tablet to watch some movies and play some games. That's pretty good considering he has access to my PSP.Some cons: I know the tablet just came out but the tablet's Android OS is 1.5 which should be upgraded. I DEFINITELY think the tablet should be connected to the Android market so are you hearing this, Archos? There's no bag or protective covers out yet so I'm waiting for it. I also want to have a way to copy tv shows directly to the tablet as I can connect it to my HDTV via USB so far.If I can do all of the above in just a few days of owning this tablet then I'm impressed and am definitely keeping this tablet!
bought the unit because of what you got for the price; however, got frustrated w/ the poor performance of the touch screen, and had to reset the unit a few times in order to start it, battery life was not as expected.  It is, however, a great browser and video player, and a great e-book reader.  Ended up returning it though because of the unresponsive touch screen and having to reset the unit too many times.  It may have been defective.
Perfect video player, audio player and e-book reading device...I can even change the orientation of e-books in the menu.I am installing some apps....but for the price, righ now, to me it is PERFECT.
I purchased a wifi nook when the price dropped to $150.  While I waited for it, I found the Archos 7 home tablet.  I returned the nook after playing with it for 15 minutes and ordered the Archos 7.  It makes an awesome ebook reader  and - unlike nook and kindle - it has a backlight so you can read in the dark.  The touchscreen is fine:  After the reviews I expected it to be terrible.  I found video playback to be a little choppy, but only watched a little of the two videos that come with it.  Web browsing with it works great as well.  Most popular web pages have mobile versions that look great on the 7 inch screen.  I'd recommend this to anyone considering an ebook reader or a netbook.
The Archos 7 Home Tablet is an entry-level product, and it offers fantastic value for the price.A gadget snob may feel* the RAM or flash memory is inadequate.  Hey!  This thing multitasks!! Take that, iPad!  And micro SD is so cheap!* the selection of Apps is limited by the hardware.  It's true that most Android apps are written for phones, which have control buttons, while the 7HT is controled completely from the touchscreen.* the Android version is outdated.  The most recent firmware is 1.5, and Archos probably won't update anytime soon.  I understand that 7HT hardware won't support the most recent versions of Android.This product does everything I wanted: web surfing, e-books, music, videos, photo-frame, social appsFor the price, I could not get a dedicated e-reader.  My 7HT is a splendid e-reader in landscape or portrait mode.  I am using e-reader software for Android to read my .prc files, and Aldiko to read e-pub files.  Note that Mobipocket format cannot be read on the Android platform!Internet surfing is fast, and pages load full width.  The Sk*f*re browser plays Flash Video, so you can visit Youtube.The default music player is VERY limited functionality.  However, I am enjoying Pandora Radio.  Video files look crisp and brilliant.Photos are gorgeous, and there is a "random shuffle" mode so I have a photo-frame that plays internet radio [due to the afore-mentioned multi-tasking.]I had some problems learning how to use the touch screen and the operating system.  I've become a zealous reader of the forums at [...], and I loaded up the recommended file and app management apps.The investment that I made on this product has been paid back in great enjoyment and happiness, which is my definition of VALUE.
Chances are you came across this product while searching for a viable alternative for that IPad you have been lusting after (Like I did).You reach this page and start to get this feeling that this tablet just might be exactly what you need; The product details read like a dream and the price seems almost too good to be true, but you will need just a bit more info before you actually shell out any of your hard earned money. That's where product reviews come in and hopefully this one may help you make a decision.Let me start off by listing the good things I found about this product;- The Price: At $300 less than the cheapest Ipad the low price is probably the tablet's biggest selling point... and it's not like you'll have to give up a whole load of options to buy this.- Appearance; it looks cool (to me at least), the screen size is great and it FEELS nice. Make sure you carry a cleaning cloth to wipe away  all the smudges.- Nice multimedia options: you can read about the video/audio player/ web browser/ photo frame options above; I just want to make sure I mention that it  also comes with a nifty little ebook reader. Although not fantastic, these multimedia apps are quite decent and make this a good buy.- I'm going to say this as delicately as I can; I'm not saying you are BUT if you are the kind of person who prefers NOT to pay for your multimedia content (hint, hint, nudge, nudge), then this tablet is certainly right for you; I was impressed on how easy it was to transfer different types of movie, audio and text files (all perfectly legal, of course) and then getting to enjoy them moments later. See how long it would take you to do THAT on an Ipad!- Not enough storage space for all those files? How about this: a slot for a micro SD card! Still not enough? a USB port! I mean, really, how can you even think about offering a product like this WITHOUT even one of these options? Can you hear me, Apple?- Leg Stand; I'm being completely serious here. Even though it's cheap and plastic and will probably break off soon, I just love being able to prop up my tablet... in fact, add another half a star to my review!Looking good, eh? Now the BAD news;- Battery life? Not so good. Turns out that for some really weird reason it will wake up every couple of hours while you are sleeping and drain your battery. There are ways to reduce this drain but you cannot switch this feature off, ever...(pause for effect)... WHAT?!?!- I've heard a lot of good things about the Droid app market and about how it will eventually leave the Itunes version crying in the dust but I can't say I'm much impressed... I'm aware this tablet only offers a 'Light' version of the market but still, Itunes does not have much to worry about at this point.- The Touch Screen; ugh, what a nightmare. I spent half an hour the other day trying to download and install an app, knowing exactly what to do but being thwarted at every turn by this awful, awful system. And check this out: I decided to use it in bed and when I touched the screen, it stayed dark and one of the crappy songs that was included started playing with no way of turning it off! This machine has a mind of it's own and it apparently hates everybody. Anyone else find it ironic the Archos company is french?Good things, bad things, but is it worth buying?Let me put it this way: this is perfect for a teenager gets all his/her multimedia content from torrents and can it stuff into one of the pockets of his/her baggy slacker shorts. Anyone else? Hmmm, let's face it, you (and by you I mean we) would rather go with the Ipad and all the cool things an ipad entails... like how Apple products seem to just work... Well,  ask yourself this: Is reliabilty worth the extra 300 dollars for you? That's something only you can decide. In my case, I think I am perfectly capable of enduring some hardships for that amount of money!
Yea, so I figure what the hell...$200 for an android tablet!  I'll just go down the list:Cons:* Not the most responsive screen* Not full Google experience (no Market, Maps, etc)* Ability to work with tether to phone via wifi was nonexistant...it wouldn't see the SSID (this is a big con for me)* No accelerometer (would make things easier when using it as an ebook reader* No youtube (although apparently someone has been able to get the Skyfire browser on it)* Included Appslib "market" app is not very intuitive and freezes up when installing apps* Not really a con since this has to be done for most media players, but I'm lazy and don't want to have to convert my video files...many of my files are in AVI format and won't play.* No Pandora app in their "market" (but hopefully I can get it somewhere)Pros:* Plays music* Plays video* Has browser (when wifi works)* Has ebook readerI just got it yesterday, so I'll give it a week (got a ton of files converting today) and will tweak this review if anything changes.[Edit] Was able to get the Youtube app onto the tablet and working, but so far no other Google apps are working.
All I really wanted was a great video player I can take along, and this one is amazing... Throw any format and it plays perfectly.. But what I got was a great device where I can browse the internet, read books with the included app, play mp3 , write notes. I also download a free app where I can open and view my PDF files. I owned a ipad few weeks back and sold it because of the headache of converting videos files all the time and  going to the itunes software to transfer, and limited space, 8GB for 499$ + tax = almost 550$.. Yeah this unit have some issues like its a  slow, touch screen a times don't respond properly BUT really for the cost, I paid 169$ from Amazon, how can one complain.. Its my 4th day with it and I have learned to use it properly, once you get use to it, its a great device... I added an 8GB micro SD card now I have 16GB of storage, bought a awesome cover for 20$ from amazon and 1 small stylus... I have loaded movies, my F1 races, educational video's, mp3 music, pictures, just drag and drop, takes seconds... While backberry, Samsung and HP are still demoing there 7 inch tablet, I am having fun with this for only 169$... Yes it has little flaws as I mentioned above, but all in all, I love this little thing....  Thank you Amazon...
My husband wanted me to get this instead of a netbook. The touch screen is very poor. It is very slow to get on the internet and difficult to use. The home and menu buttons are in the edges of a poor touchscreen. Not worth the money.
I just bought one of those for my wife to watch her downloaded soaps during her workout. I have read some negative reviews but honestly, I don't know how you could not be thrilled with it.The touch screen is definitely sensitive enough, I connected to my (encrypted) WIFI network in 20 seconds, web browser is nice and fast. But best of all: it so far plays EVERY kind of video file I have, and I have a lot. It even plays back a 720p HD video!The microSDHC slot holds your memory card (I guess up to 32Gb, mine is 8 Gb), which is already more than the iPad can do, and all that for ... 169.00 USD!The widescreen display looks great and with the included USB chord you can drag and drop your media files from your computer to the tablet.I couldn't be happier with it - anyone who's whining about it, please go ahead and spend 600.00 on an iPad (which will NOT play back all your video files)
I bought this for my wife from Best Buy, it's pretty barebones. We set it up pretty easily, it connected to our wireless flawlessly. This thing is pretty low quality, the touch interaction is poor at best, pressing on button elements work fine but trying to scroll a web page or any scrolling on this thing is torturously slow, and unresponsive. My EVO 4G is way better than this and faster, additionally because of fragmentation in Android, Netflix streaming service is not going to work for a lot of Android devices.The app service is very limited, it doesn't use the Official Android store. I ended up buying my wife an iPad, I can't see how anybody can say this is even close to the functional level or quality of the iPad, it's not. It is way cheaper but a waste of your money, wait for Android 3.0 which will be made for the iPad experience.There is nothing with the ease of use, quality, and reliability of the iPad. This is a perfect fit for the old adage you get what you pay for.The Blackberry Playbook looks to be the closest competition, and HP/Palm is going to release a tablet as well early next year. In my opinion Palm has the best interface and usability even more than the iOS devices. They just currently lack compelling hardware. If you hate Apple wait for one of those devices.
Well, suffice to say, this review is later than it would have been as after a week or so of enjoying this unit it had what my non-techy self would call a "meltdown"....it got hot and shut itself off, never to reboot again.  No hard reset, no amount of coaxing or cursing would make it come to life, so off it went back to the company for a fix/replacement.  In about a week or so we had a new unit, which my husband swears is a refurb.  This unit seems to lose the internet connection when the whim strikes (did not have this issue at all before).  So, here, are my pros/cons for this little unit....Pros: nice compact design, great to download my vacation photos and take to work or have with me, downloads music, plays movies, I can surf the net when my home computer is in use...perfect for me as I sit in bed.Cons: drops the internet connection for no reason that my techy sidekick husband or I can figure out, touch screen sometimes just sticks, though usually works ok.Overall if it worked consistently I would be happy with the unit, but I am often found cursing at the screen, so I give it a 3 star....I enjoy it when it works and when it doesn't, well, I have visions of a sledgehammer.....
The Archos 8Gb Home Tablet is a promising product. However, I am sure people here aren't willing to dole out 200 dollars (more or less) based on potential only.A few of the really big drawbacks have been outlined here already. The Android Marketplace is unavailable and apps currently on the tablet are limited and kind of lame to be frank. To date, I have yet to successfully install Skyfire onto my tablet in order to use Adobe Flash 10 items such as Youtube videos even though I am usually more than capable of such tasks. (update 3/11 - I got Skyfire, then had to d/l youtube player from the marketplace. I now have youtube) Surfing is awkward. The product manual is lacking in detail and Archos leaves you to attempt to figure out way too much of this tablet, and not all of it is intuitive. The touch screen is responsive, yet sometimes clicks the wrong item or over/under responds to touch. A stylus isn't a bad idea.The battery life is good, the antenna for Wi-Fi is mediocre and hardly picks up reception in my house where my laptops perform with ease. The speakers are good and the screen resolution is satisfactory. The screen gets muddled up quite easily and requires constant wipedowns. Sometimes, the player wakes up for no reason and drains the battery!Some here have mentioned custom upgrades and firmware. These changes to your tablet can render it useless. I tried one and my tablet now hopelessly freezes everytime I allow it to power off, which causes me to have to redo the install, then lose all my data on the tablet. Not cool..One major flaw is the flimsy power and headphone jacks. I had to replace this item (shipping 10 dollars at my expense) after the power jack broke internally without warning. The plug does not completely insert into the jack and it appears it leaves the jack prone to being snapped off leaving you with no way to charge the tablet. It is not a problem that can easily be avoided so far as I can tell. As a result, my new Archos is perched on a table, not to be handled when it has items plugged into a port.Another negative is the inability to service or replace the battery in this device. So when the rechargable battery no longer functions you will be at the mercy of Archos to replace it, which will set you back 10 dollars for shipping to Archos plus repairs. A USB charger would have been a definate plus rather than relying on the wall outlet adapter.In conclusion, the Archos 8Gb HT is a sharp looking tablet which could have been executed so much better. At this price point I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere. In my opinion, the web surfing capabilities of this device have been hampered and do not justify recommending this as anything other than a high end mp3/video playback device.If you want an IPad like device RUN away from this one as you will be severely disappointed. I should also mention that I was given this item to review through Amazon's Vine program. If I am not happy with it- being given this for free in exchange for a review- then it speaks volumes to the quality of a product.
1. Touch Screen ***This is a touch screen ONLY device, the only hardware button is the power button. The touchscreen does however have good response for a restive (sp) screen. It is perfect for page turnswipes and taps. Initial configuration is a little finicky though, it took two tries to get calibrated.2. Storage ****Ok, so this is an 8gb device, but you can only read ebooks off of Android sd card, which makes no sense to me. However sd cards are dirt cheap nowadays, so that was not a huge problem. Not to mention that the 8gb can be used to store mp3s to listen to while reading...3. Battery Life ***** (outstanding!)(Wifi On and searching, but not connecting) The archos website touts 7 hours video and 44 hours music, I get about 6 hours video, but only 15 hours while just reading, so nowhere near eink, but a lot better than most other color screen devices. On the downside, the unit will NOT charge via usb, you must use the included multinational charger. Charge time is just over one hour.(Wifi on and connected)  When the wifi is connected to my home network, this device gets about 30 hours battery life for ereading - still about the same 6 hours for video though; I have not tested this device with wifi turned off yet.4. E-reader ****The device comes preinstalled wit Alkido which is an excellent ereader, though figuring out how to transfer. ebooks. may take a little getting used to. There ae great brightness settingsas well as nighttime color schemes for easy reading weather in bed or outside.5. Video & Music ***** (outstanding!)This is really where archose shines, The multimedia functions of this device are outstanding -- not to mention as i stated before, 6 hours of battery life for video - this is perfect for a plane ride, or even to catch up on newsclips on the commute (metro ride!) to work.  The speakers are excellent for being such a small device, very nice, crisp and loud - at least for video, slightly better quality than many laptops i have used.  For music I would reccomend headphones.6. Operating System **This device uses android 1.5 - and not the full version, the app store is not included, though a bastardized version run by archose is, what this means is that 90% of android apps will NOT install automatically, including Opera and Skyfire.  There are a few websites around that offer alternatives to android market of which about 75% of the apps that i have tried on the alternative sites will work.  Even in the archose supported Apps Lib, there are still some (mostly games) that will not run correctly on this device.  There are some major memory issues with the operating system - it is ESSENTIAL that some sort of memory management app is installed such as "kill" which will allow running apps to be stopped on the fly as there is no native way to end a program that is running.  There are also some programs that will store (temporary?) data in the app space of the archos which is only about 20 megs to begin with, such as the app "funny joke" (installable from apps lib) which after a while will have built up a 6+ megs cache which makes the unit incredably slow (the ereader will crash due to not enough memory at this point) untill the user enters the settings screen and deletes the cache for the funny jokes app - which can be a pain, especially when the device is already slow...7. Design ***While this device seems to be designed fairly well, there are two large flaws -- 1.) this unit CANNOT be charged via USB, you MUST use the included wall adapter, and 2.) the headphone jack and the power adapter plug are the same size - i shorted out the headphone jack the day i received the device by plugging the power into the unmarked headphone jack by mistake.  It would not have been difficult to include a different sized power jack...8. Durability **After 1 month of using the Archos, it will occasionally die and need to be reset (there is a reset button on the back if you have a pin or needle), not a huge problem, just more annoying than anything else, this seems to happen when the screen will automatically turn off sometimes when the feature is engaged - probably about 10% of the time the screen auto turns off.  The power switch will sometimes get activated without touching it, causing the Shutdown screen to display repeatedly untill the device is reset (happened 5 times to me now)Overall, I would rate this product 3 stars -- For a company that built such a good device, there are some fatal flaws that should have been resolved before release such as the shoddy engineering on the durability of the device as well as support for android 2.0 at the very least - if it would cost more money, I would have happily pad an extra $50-100 for a better product.To sum up -- this is a cheaply priced Devuce, if  you dont want to spend to much monney, this device is great, but you do get what you pay for!
I really like it for what it is. I did not buy it to replace my cellphone, computer, pda, or what have you. I bought it to display pictures and videos, to store a book or two and to have access to the internet while I wait for my wife to get off of work. For all of these things it is great. Initially it was frustrating training it (or me) so that I can use the touchscreen, but now that I am used to it I like it but it is not as responsive as my wifes Ipod Touch the screen is way bigger and like I said when you get used to it, it works great. I especially like that it holds so many pictures and they look so good even when they are saved with high compression. I will say it again it is not a netbook, Ipad, Ipod, computer, or anything except an Archos and that is good enough for me.
At $199 this is a great unit to tide you over until the marketplace has settled down a bit.  With tons of new tablets being introduced it seems a bit risky to spend $500 knowing that whatever you buy will be out of date almost immediately; the Archos 7 works well enough and is inexpensive enough that it's not the end of the world if it's lost or broken by the kids. All in all this unit works best if you see it as a video-music player with some light web browsing possible.Pros: Light weight, good battery life, enough applications that you can probably find what you need with a little searching, ok performance, not subject to a complete lock down like Apple products.Cons: Android takes a bit of time to learn to use (if you haven't used it before), the screen is not as clear as more expensive Archos products and is subject to the quirks of being a resistive screen, Android 1.5 and the lack of the Android Market makes you work a bit to find applications, like every Archos product I have owned expect some strangeness - occasional shut-downs, slow to update, things of that nature.All in all it may sound like I am down on this unit but for the price it really is a great Jack Of All trades and unlike people who buy an expensive iPad and have to deal with it being outdated when the next version is introduced, the cost of this makes it easy to upgrade.
We were disappointed with the Archos 7. Perhaps it is a generational thing as we are in our sixties. But the screen was not particularly sensitive, the battery seemed to deplete faster than one might expect and, most importantly, we kept losing wireless connection cutting us off from the internet. We returned the Archos 7 to the vendor, along with the accompanying scan disc (never used) that we had purchased, but have received a refund only for the Archos. We went out and bought an Acer netbook for about $100 more and it has met all our expectations. Not once has it lost wireless connection with the same router we had used with the Archos 7.
Mainly, I bought this tablet as an ebook reader as well as a news reader with my morning breakfast and commute.  However,  I had another immediate need for a tablet for a long trip -- otherwise I would have waited for a device running Android 2.1 or 2.2 with a faster processor.I had considered the Kindle, but it seemed too limited for such an expensive device.  I had also considered something cheaper and less restricted, such as the Moonse APAD E7001  or the Eken M001, but was concerned about their battery life and warranty.As an ebook reader, the home tablet works well.  However, I almost returned my tablet because of frustrations with the screen, OS, and the lack of online video functionality.  With some patience and tips from other owners, I was able to resolve most of my issues.The tips that worked best for me.Use a stylus to calibrate the touchscreenOnline video: Download and install Skyfire 2.0No Market app:  Install apps directly from developer's site or use an alternative such as SlideMEAudiobooks: Install AstroplayerOverall, I expect many better Android tablets to be released soon in the same price range that have more current OS versions, faster processors and capacitive touch screens.  My recommendation would be to wait.
I bought this for a Christmas present so I just sat down and tried it today...the 30th. I was not happy when I found out that the market app was missing and you are unable to download it. You need this in order to download alot of other apps. I did some research on the internet and I see alot of people have the same problem. Also you need the 2.0 or more operating system in order to download the kindle reader for android. Also the touch screen is all over the place when working on it.Needless to say after I read everything on different web sites I returned it and I am now searching for a new tablet.I would not recomend.
I really tried to like this little tablet as I purchased four of them for myself and my children.  It had an incomplete and very basic owner manual and customer service was unhelpful and untrained.  The most frustrating thing is that if you want to download something, you are not able to download something like "updated firmware" or the "AppsLib" applications from the device itself.  You must first download and save them to your computer, then drag and drop into your plugged-in device.I maybe could have lived with this, BUT not if they are having server issues, which apparently is quite a lot.  I spent hours trying to get this device up and running.This is a very flawed product and I do not recommend it to anyone.
I'm now satisfied with my Archo's 7 Home tablet. After many hours reading helps and hints on the Archo's 7 Home Tablet Forum and installing some of the programs they advise downloading to beef up the weak and clumsy operating system, I got my android tablet just where I want it. Sept 15, 2010 Archo's posted new firmare that makes the touch keypad a little easier to work with, but you still need a stylus to get best results. If you like to try out this very early version of the Android operating system this sure beats buying a phone.
While I and my spouse enjoy this tablet, it definitely isn't for everybody. In fact if I didn't have my computer genius husband around it wouldn't be something I could easily use and I'm constantly on my netbook, Ipod Touch, smart phone, ect. This is because this tablet is glitchy as heck and has a somewhat outdated version of android on it.There's about to be a glut of android tablets on the market. This one has led the way but a lack of updating isn't going to make it user friendly. The built in software is adequate but there are a number of flaws. There are two music players on it, the better of which does not contain a random play/shuffle. The screen calibration never seems to calibrate correctly. The wi-fi is glitchy at best, dropping connection at random. The built in app store is not the default android marketplace but a custom built Archos exclusive which results in a lot of android apps not being available to the Archos tablet. The sleep doesn't function properly on it, either refusing to go to sleep or waking randomly and startlingly, sucking the battery dry. The only real way to conserve the battery is to turn it off. It does not charge from USB.On the positive side there is a good fan user base which can be employed to remove the restriction to get the default android marketplace and put Google apps onto the tablet. The browsers adequate which makes it a good portable internet device. It's solidly built with a nice kick stand. The built in speaker is decent if you want to listen to music without attaching speakers to it, although at louder volume it can be a bit tinny. Video is good quality picture. Played a 480p xvid avi file without difficulty or stuttering.You'll want to download a task/ application killer to close out applications easy if you get this tablet.
I returned the Archos after a 2 week trial. It didn't do what I understood from the Amazon description it was supposed to do. I did not like Android, it wouldn't play my movie clips, it wouldn't load my contacts...too many things it just wouldn't do. I ended up buying an Ipad although I really did not want to. However it (Ipad) does load my contacts, my email, my pictures...paid a fortune for it though.
I've had my Archos 7ht for a little over 3 weeks.  The first unit I received wouldn't calibrate although I was able to use it some.  It got worse over the next 48 hours so I asked Amazon for a replacement unit and had it the next morning.If you buy one, do a firmware upgrade from the Archos site after charging the battery and initializing.  It improves the battery life a lot!  As everyone noted, it doesn't have the Google Market app, but I haven't cared yet.  Everything I've wanted to download has been available somewhere on the web.  There are also several other web sites that offer library apps.I downloaded Google docs which works like a charm.  I downloaded Skyfire to get flash capability.  I downloaded Astrid to get a to-do list that syncs with Remember the Milk.The pre-installed apps work very well.  I have about 50 ebooks loaded into Aldiko.  I also have about 20 videos and about 4 gig of music loaded.  On the Archos 7ht user forum I downloaded AppManager and Advanced Task Manager.  ATM also acts as a task killer so there's no reason to have a separate app for that.When you attach the USB cable to your pc, you get a device called Archos 7.  If you also have an installed SD card, you get another device with only a letter identifier.  They work well enough that I never remove the micro SD card.There are times that the touch screen is difficult to use.  I've kept a 3-color ballpoint pen with one ink barrel replaced with a stylus for years.  When I use it to navigate, I get a lot of precision and don't have to press very hard.  I don't use it at all for basic music playing, video watching, ebook reading, etc.  Just on apps that have a lot of data in small areas.There aren't enough business apps available yet, but that's an Android issue, not an Archos one.  I'd love to see an outline note taker, but it just doesn't exist yet.  I'm making do with a Google Docs document.
First the negative.  I would not suggest this product as your first computer or even your WiFi connected gadget.  You have to be able to figure out how to problem solve because this product is not as consumer friendly as an IPad.  It runs the Android Operating System 1.5.  If you don't know what that means, then I suggest you look for a product with a more familiar OS.  Won't play CNN or Youtube movies.  No camera, No G3. WiFi only.  It's not the fastest machine out there.  As a matter of fact, it's a bit on the slow side, so don't expect too much from this 7 inch tablet.Next I suggest you read a little bit about the product and its limitations.Now the good.  It plays videos really well and they look very good on the screen.  If you want to play home movies on the tab, I suggest you bump up the color saturation, but for most Hollywood movies they will look very good.  I play mostly divx encoded AVI movies.  Photos too need a bit more saturation to look good on the tab, but once you find the right amount, the photos look really good. Web browsing is fairly fast and most websites load properly.  I mostly use the tablet to read forums and read articles off of the internet.  The 7 HT is a really good ebook reader. It will display any non DRM epub book, so if you like to read the classics, there are a lot of books that you can download off of the internet for free.  The ebook really was a nice surprise.  It can also stream music with an app called Deezer. The speakers are just adequate for listening, but the 7HT has an earphone jack.The 7HT is a really nice machine if you can live with a couple of limitations.  One thing I could live with is the price.  It is $360.00 less than the cheapest IPad, and it will do about 90% of what an IPad can do.  Cruising the internet is fast and relatively easy with the 7HT and I find it to be the right tablet for me.  I will update this review if I find I have any serious problems with the HT.
I bought the Archos to use as a small/lite ability to access the internet both here at our summer lake place, and at my office in the Twin Cities.For five months out of the year, we are here at the lake place and I need the device to work.  Our resort has WiFi and my desktop, portable, and my iPhone have no trouble linking solidly to the WiFi, but the Archos seldom can link at all and for sure will drop after a very short time.  Because this is the use most important to me, it is almost valueless here at the lake.I will be returning to the Twin Cities in a few days, and will see if it can do better with my WiFi in my office (a much stronger signal).But even if it works better there, it is almost wothless five months out of the year to me.So if anyone has less than a very strong WiFi signal, I would avoid this device.Bud Jay[...]
Bought this at Best Buy and it sucked. Not able to put on the Kindle App after several attempts. would turn off at night and it would discharge itself. rebooted itself several times - returned within 3 days. Now have the Archos 5 with 500 gb and so far liking it much better!
I got this from my huisband for my birthday. I was very excited as i had been bugging him for an ipad so i figured this could be a decent replacement. I was right and wrong.right out of the box i was able to access internet and was pleasently suprised with how good videos that came on it were viewed. i liked that it has a spot for an SD card becuae lets face it we could always use extra storage.I was however dissappointed when i quickly realized that even thought this is android based the marketplace was NOT the same as the google android one.let me preface this by saying i am NOT a techie by any means, i'm just an ordinary mom who likes a challenge and is not afraid to ask for help in tweaking devices(safely...no electrocutions please)So off to google i went and found a site androidfans.com (i think) and i found some very helpful people there as well as ways to make this more "workable"some downloads later and now i have a tablet with skyfire (great for viewing youtube vids)and the full google android market. without having to give up memory.This was NOT by any means a hard accomplishment and very do-able and like i said i am NOT a techie and don't uinderstand all the lingo but i managed to do this and the tablet works perfectly.
I like the Archos 7 8gb allot! Its fast and the movies play better then my netbook. The only drawback is you cant lock it incase its stolen or lost but other then that its great. The touch screan works great with out any problems. I havent found out how or if I can hook it up to my broad band modem from cricket yet but if not there is the wifi. Also no one seems to have the adapter to hook up regular usb male plugs to it. I did find out that you can hook it up to your HD flat panel to play movies etc which is great! All in all a great buy for the price! Its not a IPAD but I dont want an IPAD!
The thing (or feature) that made me buy this thing was the "video output" feature mentioned on this website but for my surprise It does NOT have any video output feature, there is no cable that enables video out, and it doesn't seem that Archos has any intention of developing an app or an update that will allow you to output video from this device. So beware if you think you're gonna be able to hook up this thing to your tv and watch videos, is not gonna happen. Anyways, I'm still keeping it cause it does all the other things I was looking for. It's a light, easy, portable way of surfing the internet around the house plus the music and being able to watch videos on the go on a 6 inch wide screen for $200 dollars made this a little neat handy device that I must keep. Ok, now for the review:1) You should know that the default keyboard is impossible to use because when you press a letter any letter around THAT letter is pressed but the one you pressed... got it? It doesn't click where you click... but you can download an app with a different keyboard with bigger keys and problem solved.2) You should also know that there is not a single internet browser (from the ones that are available to download plus the default browser) where you can watch flash sites or any kind of flash content on this device, the ONLY browser that allows you to play videos in flash format (only videos-you won't be able to see ads or content in flash format) it's called Skyfire and it ONLY works with some websites. If you visit a website with flash content you will see a gray screen, gray square, rectangle or whatever instead of the flash format. If there is a video in flash format on that website and Skyfire is able to detect it you will get a pop-up window were you can click play and watch that video. For all other purposes the Skyfire browser is very slow and crashes too many times but... is still in beta mode so maybe this will change, but for now, no flash, no flash, no flash. But if you're looking to watch youtube videos, Skyfire will work just fine and better than any other youtube applications, so that's a good thing, and for any other purpose the default browser works just fine and is the fastest.3) You should also know that the battery lasts forever (well not forever but about 6 hours of constant use), I use my tablet all day long surfing the internet, checking my e-mail 100 times per day, downloading files and videos through out the day and at the end of the day I still have about 30% battery left. Nothing like most cellphones that you have to keep loading the battery every day; and if you don't use it as often as I do you wont have to load maybe in 2 - 3 days. Is the best feature of this device.4) Finally, you should also know that this device has Android 1.5 and that there's already a 1.6 and 2.0/2.1 versions and that "maybe" we will NEVER see an update to one of this newer versions from Archos unless someone at the archosfans forum creates a hack for it allowing the Android updates; something they have already done for the Android Market which you can't access from this device... but now we can, so there IS access to Android Market on this device... another good thing, and that's all.
Due to the company not supporting upgrades to newer versions of the Android OS, this product is rendered pretty useless as an e-book reader and for many other Android applications. It has great potential, but in the future I will be avoiding Archos products because of my experience with this product.
I have both 160GB Archos 7 and 8GB Archos 7 Home Tablet. The video playback performance on the old Archos 7 is WAY BETTER than the new Archos 7 HT. The LCD screen is of lower quality and the touchscreen is not as responsive as the old Archos 7. I'm returning the Archos 7 HT.
I ordered it knowing it's flaws and thinking I could live with them.  It looked impressive and felt really good.  If you've never used and capacitve screen you'd probably be ok with it.  I bought it thinking I could open up the market, which I did easily and that it could get the kids off my phone.  I ended up sending it back, not because it's bad it's just there is or willl be much better out there and I'm willing to wait.
While this device may seem like a great buy, it is decieving.  First of all, the user interface is very clunky, even after it is calibrated.  Second, it does not perform at the acceptable level of a computer.  Programs crash (force close) and it seems to drag when going from one activity to another.  Third, there is NO FLASH and no flash in the apps market.  That cancels out ALL VIDEOS on the internet.  The app market does not have native apps for must have apps like Facebook and Evernote.  I also felt that the Android version that it has is very outdated.  I recommend that you do not purchase this device.  Buy and ipad or save your money for the new droid tablets.
I was going to rate the Archos 7 as a great toy, but the touch tablet is to bad for that. It is hard to get around on the Internet and a lot of the Android applications do not work on the Archos 7. I would not recomend this to anyone.
I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter and was a bit worried, based on the reviews, but the price was right -- got it for $169. I did a bit of research and found that in order to view YouTube and other streaming videos you need some apps. I decided to get it set up and mess around with it a bit in advance of Christmas to avoid frustration on the day and was pretty pleased with what I found. The native Internet browser was pretty speedy and the sample video and music provided looked and sounded great. The apps that the company said were preloaded were there, but hidden in the Files section, but loaded with a couple of clicks -- an eBook reader with access to hundreds of free classic books, a radio service, an e-mail service that I didn't try yet, all loaded with a click or two.The official app library was there too and lets you view top apps and search for specific apps and download directly the Android apps they provide. I downloaded VideoBox, which lets you stream and download YouTube videos (worked pretty well once I figured out I could search it -- you can stream or download to view later, downloading was a bit slow).  There are tons of other apps on the Archos AppLibrary, but you can get others that it doesn't have from other sites. The Skyfire browser, which lets you view streaming video from other sites (though sadly not Hulu), was downloaded to my Mac from PandaApps, then transferred to the Archos with the provided USB cord in just a couple minutes. I was able to watch an episode of a TV show on the CW's website with no lag.  A Quicktime movie file I had on my Mac transferred easily -- just drag and drop, then open from Archos Files, and looked great.I also took the advice on tech reviews and downloaded a task killer to shut down apps not being used to keep browsing fast. All in all, a pretty good little device -- I work online and was able to access my work site and type easily on the on-screen keyboard, though it says you can attach one via USB. The touch screen worked pretty well, it calibrates on initial start-up, the only frustration is when scrolling down, it clicks on the items you're scrolling through instead, so took a few tries to get to what I was looking for on occassion -- a small price to pay.
This tablet is an exceptional travel companion with the WI-FI, very easy to access.  It works easily with secure system as well with it's own MAC address.  It does how ever lack two things that I expect to be supplied in the near future (I Hope) (1) is useability with AudibleBooks and (2) an upgrade to the OS for using flash for viewing. For less than $200.00 with these minor faults is one great buy. J&R; Music and Computer World  provides fast and excellent service - I highly recommend them as they have the best price on the net. I will always give them a try when making a purchase........Regards
The need for a home tablet such as the Archos 7 is debatable.  Everyone is wired(less) anymore and yet another screen that does the same thing as every other screen seems frivolous.  Considering I don't own a gadget that runs any kind of an app, I was curious if the tablet is even worth playing with. -Eventually after I was able to grab some WiFi I enjoyed what the limited but sleek and handsome Archos had to offer.  Most exciting to me was the idea of an Ereader while Aldiko is built in and you can grab some great old public domain material this thing isn't exactly the answer to the Kindle, plus a backlight screen that kind of flashed a little on the lowest light setting left me wanting more.  Next up the apps I barely know an app from an apple but I like games, and there are some fun free titles to be found on the service the squashing games seem to work best with this units inability to run many of the tilt driven games. digital music plays well on this unit and it plays FLAC files perfectly (a big plus for me).  The video looks spectacular but given the units somewhat limited intial memory  you will be deleting and transfering alot unit you grab a miniSD card.  The power on button stinks it took me a week to figure it out properly and the manual and documentation are kind of a why bother.  The ac jack and headphone jack are too close and can be confused for one another without close inspection.  GREAT SCREEN< BATTERY LIFE< CODECS seem to play every audio and video file I throw at it.  The browser works well and websites look great but I would use it only in situations where it was the only option.  The price is right and the screen is a beauty.  The real drawback here is touchscreen only controls that sometimes misfire, which a rubber tipped stylus seemed to remedy.  Overall pretty cool and great for traveling with movies as they still seem cinematic on the sharp scratch proof screen.
The android marketplace from Archos is severely limited, reducing the value of the device.  I use it to view lecture video while on the commuter train and it works fine for that purpose.
Ok, I've never owned a smart phone or used any kind of apps, but I thought I would give this a try.  Everyone seems to be making a big deal out of these things nowadays (great, I sound like a grandma!).Anyway, it was easy enough to start up when it arrived and charged pretty quickly.  Right away I had a hard time with the touch screen, it would highlight something that I wasn't even close to or scroll through things way too fast.  I thought it was just because I wasn't used to it, but it never did get better.I tried some of the preloaded apps first.  I didn't like the email app because it seemed like I could only delete the emails after I opened them, maybe there is a way around this that I don't know about, but it was annoying.  I get a good amount of junk mail and just wanted to delete it right from the inbox without opening the emails themselves.I tried the ebook app second, tried to search for some books that might interest me, but it just seemed to be book and writers I've never heard of.Tried getting on the web, this worked ok except one site I frequent uses Java and it was not installed, nor do I know if it's even possible to install on this.  Facebook also looks funky on it.  It's ok for news sites or craigslist, but not too much else to me.I then searched for Apps in the App Library thing, I couldn't find anything I wanted and it showed were free Apps.  Nothing to buy.  I thought maybe I could find something I like in the Apps that actually charge, but I could not find a way to get to them.Overall, I'm not liking this tablet.  I know there are some fixes for my problems by reading forums, but it seems like too much work.  I'm not a complete idiot, but it doesn't seem worth it spend the time trying to fix all these things when a laptop or netbook can just do it right away.Honestly, if I didn't get this through the Vine program, I'd probably end up returning it.
I've had the Archos 7 Home Tablet for about a week now. Takes a bit of getting used to. Archos' version of Android 1.5 is a bit weak compared to 1.6 or 2.0. No Google Apps support, but you can still get 75% of available apps through other sources. Members of ArchosFans.com have developed "unofficial" OS builds that support Google Apps, but this voids the warranty.I got it to play videos and music, and it has not disappointed. The 7" screen is heaven when compared to the Apple Touch (and it plays downloaded Flash videos). Battery seemingly lasts forever (not really, but I can spend the day watching videos, jam to mp3's, check my email 100x a day, do a bit of surfing and still have 30% battery power left).Wi-Fi connectivity is easy, so is email setup. I found the just released Opera Mini 5 does a far better job for both surfing and email, and you can sync data with your Opera desktop browser. Wi-Fi search is comprehensive, and if you have a home network it does a great job linking to it. You can map shared drives for file transfer (does not stream data)!Expansion is limited to microSD cards (max 32GB). Limit you app/email/e-book/etc collection until you get the additional SD card (get several if you can, it's easy to just keep adding music/videos/photos and data). Besides the case, accessories are wanting - nothing, zippo! USB cable (A to B) is file transfer only. Battery charging is by adapter only (although you can buy the USB charger for the Archos 3G and charge through desktop/laptop USB).Software is a bit wanting, as I mentioned. The Archos uses AppsLib (be careful as most developers do not provide details about their apps), do a Google search to get additional info before installation. Installed apps include: Aldiko (e-books), Alarm Clock, Calculator, Email, ColorNotes (notepad), generic Video Player, Photo Viewer, Audio Player, Sound Recorder, and Music (jukebox), and finally the crummy browser. Besides the App Window, there is also a 3-panel Homepage allowing plenty of room to layout your "desktops"!I guess my biggest complaint is the touchscreen. It a resistive screen, and calibration takes a lot of finesse! Take you time, try applying different pressures. If you get incorrect launches, or incorrect letters when typing, re-calibrate.Overall, it's a very nice product. It wasn't meant to replace your laptop. You need to understand what it does, and what it does not. Be weary of "puffing" sellers, go to [...] to get accurate info. Like any relationship you want to last, it takes time to get used to each other. Besides the cash, invest some time, the rewards are worth it.If you need something more robust and expandable, wait a few months more. Should be a slew of rollouts for more muscular tablets. But at $200, it's great at the beach or by the pool.The Archos 7 Home Tablet(HT) get a 4 stars our of 5!
I wanted to buy a Zune HD or an ipod touch. I wanted something with wifi. Then I saw this for the same price. The internet is almost exactly like a computer. The touch screen is responsive and if I'm not using wifi at all then it will last about 2 days. With the wifi on then about 1 day. Surprisingly it fits in my pant pocket. So far after a week of use, I LOVE it. I don't regret it at all.
I received this a few weeks ago, actually I received a bad one and then got one that worked well.  For my usage, I have never had to worry about battery life- I can do small tasks while I have breakfast or watch tv- like read the news, do my banking, check out my email, craig's list- videos from vimeo come in really good-- the touch screen isn't all that- maybe it's my massive fingers. What I really like about it is that I can switch out micro sd cards with movies and books or music whenever or wherever I like.
I was excited when the box showed up (my late Father's Day arrival).  However, the excitement didn't last long when I fired up the device.The BAD:- No native "gMail" app...on a Google-made OS?  Really??- No support for Google Calendars, Google Docs, etc.  ...on a Google-made OS?  Really??- No contact manager/address book, so even with third-party e-mail apps, you're limited to manually typing addresses for your recipients.- No native Facebook app- Less than 300 apps available of the 85,000 Android apps on the REAL Market- - (Even the bulk of the "free" apps I've downloaded are so stripped down they're useless)- Touch screen is never accurate enough for typing- NO YOUTUBE.  And I don't mean, like with most portables, "no flash."  My G1 and iPhone don't support flash either, but they both have the capability of downloading and watching videos.  Not so with the Archos 7.- No Bluetooth, so only wired headphones.- Very "tinny" sound from the built-in speakers.- No auto-rotation of the screen for portait/landscape viewing of web pages, photos, etc.The GOOD:- The display looks great.- The aesthetics aren't bad, though the reflexive screen makes navigation a bit slow and cumbersome.- Battery life seems pretty good initially, but I haven't yet put it through its paces.The bottom line is this.  I wanted this device (1) for it's Android-OS capabilities, (2) for it's convenience to grab, jump on the web/YouTube/Facebook, (3) multimedia capabilities for watching movies and videos on-the--go, and (4) presumed application choices (based on my other Android experiences - G1 & Cliq).  Instead, I find that this device is (1) missing many of the familiar Android capabilities, (2) unable to do even the most basic demands for a "home tablet" (as it is marketed to be), (3) more cumbersome than my iPod, G1, Cliq, or other mobile multimedia devices because of the lack of Bluetooth support, and (4) missing about 84,700 applications from the app store/market.In short, Archos, you missed the boat on this one.  I'll be getting a refund.
I have been a loyal supporter of Archos for many years.  I have purchased several products and have enjoyed all of them.  My wife suprised me with this item at Christmas and I was super excited.  All I can say is what a disappointment.You need to read all the reviews before buying.  I also suggest going into the forums (archosfans.com) and read what even the fans have to say about it.First, it's a very good looking product.  I love how it looks and feels.  The price point is great too.  If it could do everything it's supposed to do, it would be a steal. Unfortunately, it does not.1) Video - I mainly use my Archos products to watch videos.  With a family of six, including several video game players, it's hard to get any time on the TV.  So I use my portable devices to catch up on my favorite shows.  The Archos 7 could not handle most of the videos I threw at it.  THe video was choppy and dropped frames.  The audio stuttered. These were simple AVI files previous Archos players had no trouble playing.  I re-encoded one video and it did better but it took about 45 min to encode.  (One annoying thing is I haven't figured out how to delete a video directly from the device.  You have to plug it in to your PC and delete from there.  The user manual is very sketchy and of little help for any of the troubleshooting.)2) Resistive touch screen - lots of reviewers have commented on this.  Unfortunatley it's true.  It's not very good.  If you're used to an iPod you'll be very frustrated very quickly.  Just scrolling down through videos was a hassle.3) Unexpected Wake from Suspend - this is a serious flaw.  The fact that it wasn't fixed with a firmware upgrade is very disappointing.  I should be able to suspend my unit and not have it wake up every couple of hours to drain my battery.4) Android 1.5 - the unit is using an earlier version of Droid.  Most the apps you want to get won't even run on this unit.  The appslib won't even connect.  I installed a few apps by downloading them directly from the internet.  Others I tried installing wouldn't work.  One said "not enough memory to install app."  What a ridiculous error message, considering it's a brand new product and I had nothing on the unit yet.5) Surfing the internet is slow and frustrating. I'm comparing it to how quickly my iPod loads pages.  I would never use the unit for internet, which eliminates a lot of its functionality.Amazon is no longer selling this unit. That should be a HUGE clue. I expect they are getting a lot of returns.  Mine is going back for sure.  I'll wait for the Archos 8 or find some other product.  I haven't lost complete faith in the company, but this product is terrible.  I wanted to love it too.  It might be the first time I was truly surprised at Christmas.  Unfortunately, I was also truly surprised to learn how shoddy this device is, especially considering my track record with Archos.
After having lusted long for the Archos 5IT (with Android), I decided to get the 7HT. Bad choice. It's definitely not for the mainstream user. It's quiet buggy and there are rough edges all over the software. No doubt, it plays several formats of video and audio but that doesn't redeem its other shortcomings. There is no excuse for the lack of a capacitative touch screen. One has to constantly keep calibrating it, and even then, it's impossible to accurately select what one intends to.This is a definite demonstration of how companies take customers back several years with each new generation of device, instead of releasing mature, robust products. This kind of thing immediately obsoletes all previous investments in software, accessories and more importantly, data. I'm not even going to mention the customization and familiarity that one grows into to use gadgets effectively and smoothly.Back to the A7HT... here, I have a "new" device, with an already aging OS (Android ver 1.5), and outdated hardware and little that can be done to customize and "improve" it otherwise, because most new(er) Android applications don't work on it. Add to that Android is tuned for mobile phone type devices with a different form-factor and functionality. Bad choice, Archos!Some things do work though... the browser is ok, email has IMAP support... and the video and music. But there is no native streaming support (other than via the internet... no uPnP or shared file systems). The pathetic 8GB memory compounds the problem (of the lack of streaming support).People go gaga over the screen. But not so fast, people. It's barely adequate and totally inadequate for viewing photographs; it's like those old color monitors from the 80s - patchy and blotched. The sound... my 5 year old iPod shuffle is soooooo much better.It does work well as an eBook reader, but there is no Kindle support (probably resulting from the older Android version).People say that's what one should expect for USD 199. I say no.So, folks, there you have it. The Archos 7HT is an underwhelming device.
I was really excited about getting the Archos 7.  I did some research on Archos' website, and read some reviews here, and decided to purchase it.  It came quick from Amazon as always.  I opened the box up, turned it on, and was really impressed with the picture quality.  Unfortunately, that was the only thing to impress.Where to start:The Archos 7, has a 7 inch screen, which displays a great picture, but 7 inches is a little smaller than you might think it is, especially if your doing a lot of internet surfing.  The touch screen, which unfortunately is resistive, is a HUGE disappointment.  I understand that it keeps the cost down, but with everything moving to capacitive, it's really a let down.  You have to push the screen really hard to make a selection, and even then its hard to make a pin-point selection, i.e. a link on website.  It's very hard to scroll via a finger swipe, and I can't tell you how many times I clicked something I did not mean to click.  I knew when I ordered the Archos that it had the resistive touch screen, and I thought it wouldn't make much of a difference, but it makes a huge difference!  I think it has a 600mhz processor, which does ok, but once you start multi-tasking it gets bogged down rather quickly.  The virtual keyboard is OK, but again, with the resistive touchscreen, it is very difficult and SLOW to type something.  Also lacking on the Archos is the Android operating system it runs on.  Archos ships these units with Android 1.5, which is becoming a relic with 2.1 already out, and 2.2 around the corner.  I havn't heard anything about an update coming for the Archos, but it would be a lot better if they upgraded to the newer firmware.  Also lacking, is access to the android apps store.  Instead this unit ships with Archos' version of an app store called AppsLib.  It has a fraction of the apps that the android store has.  There is also no Youtube, app, and Flash is not supported in the 1.5 version of Android, so you cannot watch Youtube, or any other flash videos for that matter.That being said, the resolution on the Archos 7 screen is pretty stellar, videos and websites look great, as do mobile books and pictures.  The battery life is pretty good as well(and could only stand to get better with an operating system update), lasting about 7hrs with light use.  It also sports a kickstand, and mini sd card slot, along with a usp port(all be it mini usb), which even the Ipad doesn't have.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the good does not outway the bad in this case.To put it simply, if you want something you can surf basic webpage's with, read mobile books, and watch movies on the fly, for $200 this device might be good for you.  On the other hand, if you went to see an Ipad, but thought you would find an Android alternative, it may be too soon, and the Archos 7 just can't match up.  I would suggest waiting for the Dell Streak, or one of the many other Android tablets coming out this year.  I really wanted to like the Archos, but it just didn't live up.
I purchased this product to help get rid of my dependency on my laptop.  I have setup my calendar and emails to the tablet and allows for quick searching on the Internet.  The tablet has Android 1.6, which for me works.  I keep this tablet by me so if I hear a chime for new email or need to add an appointment I can quickly get that done.  The battery life is over 10 hours and the device is light and thin.I like this product so much that I am looking to purchase the 10 Archos Internet tablet.Thanks
Title says it all.The Good:Video ViewingMusic PlayingStandard Android Email AppWIFIThe Archos 7 works great as a "MEDIA PLAYER" it plays my mp4 and wmv files very well, there is no lag in viewing. The video viewer has an enlarging button to go into "full screen" mode, so even though my files were encoded for a much smaller screen i can still view them full size on the 7" tablet.The Not So Good:You will see this from most reviewers.The touch screen is a bit more difficult to use than the standard smart phones of today.android 1.6 browser is lacking (i downloaded the skyfire browser from their website).Archos Apps LIB is severely limited in selection.Applications launch slowly.Bottom Line: If you want an inexpensive video viewer, get yourself a DVD encoder and BUY THIS! However, if you want to do much more than view videos and check email, then i suggest you pony up a little more money and get something more high end.
I've used the Archos for about two weeks now.  My biggest complaint is the touchscreen.  I've learned how to fingertype really quickly on my iphone, so the Archos touchscreen is a real pain... you have to use a lot more pressure, which slows you down.  Another complaint is that the Android operating system is quite different from the iphone operating system.  The Archos scroll menus just didnt work like I expected them to, coming from an iphone environment.  I've also had trouble typing in text boxes on websites..the browser will pop in and out of the box.  I also found the Android application store to be confusing to navigate.  As others have mentioned, the power jack is far too easily confused with the headphone jack.  I've also have some trouble getting the device to turn on, even when plugged in with a full battery - the on switch doesnt seem to respond every time.  The screen is very pretty, very big, so I'm sure it would be nice to watch movies on.  But I was hoping for something that was a little more like a tablet computer, not a large ipod.
The Archos 7 8GB Home Tablet is an okay device for web surfing and decent for video viewing and listening to music. Its small size (about half of the Ipad) makes it convenient to use just about anywhere in the house, but the device has many drawbacks. The touch screen is not very responsive at all, you really have to work to type in letters or numbers on the virtual keyboard and scrolling down requires the accuracy of an eye surgeon, many times you open something on the page rather than scroll down. Less than desirable is the fact that there is no portrait mode, everything stays in landscape mode, unlike the Itouch or Ipad where turning the device will turn the screen. For $200 the price is decent but for another $300 the Ipad is much more responsive and my Asus Eee PC for $329 is a million times better. Save up and get a netbook or Ipad.
I received my ARCHOS 7 Home Tablet one afternoon and put it on the charger.  I didn't have time to read about the device so I just let it charge.  The following morning my wife was going into the hospital for surgery and I knew I was going to be there the whole day so I took the tablet with me to "play" with.  Even though I had read no instructions I turned it on, went through a few of the screens and saw the WIFI connection wizzard and hooked into the hospital guest connection.  I did the same thing for my email account.  I ventured out on to the web using some of the web addresses I could remmeber and Googling in some of the addresses I couldn't remember.  I saved a bunch of the addresses into the bookmark and started surfing.  It was great!!!! I had this little tablet that was doing all the things I would expect from a little laptop.  I was checking and sending email, checking stock market activity, did some online banking.  I watched a couple of the sample videos that came with the tablet and they were so clear.  I really like this and will be using it a lot.  I would have given it five stars but I found it went into a "force closing" on some of the internet sites and I couldn't figure out why that happened.  It may just be user error.. time will tell.  But even with that, it is a very nice device that I now look upon as a tool rather than a toy.  I recommend it.
The low down: This is an attractive, functional device suitable for web browsing, email, and multimedia in a home environment. It features 8 Mb internal memory, microSD card capability, a beautiful screen, and the Android operating system. It lacks access to the full Android marketplace, has some odd design elements, and (in my experience) has a few quality issues. The device is worth the cost, if it fits your needs.If you want more details, read on!----------I was excited to get this "home tablet". It is advertised as being suitable for a person who does not want the inconvenience of a PC / laptop, but needs more than a iPod or other small mobile device.Design:The device is made in France, and it shows in the design elements. It is beautifully made, with a satin steel backing, a large 7 inch wide-aspect screen (720p HD capable), and glossy plastic that somehow does NOT show fingerprints. However it also has some features that may be a bit odd to American consumers. For example, the device charges with a red light, but when charged the light turns YELLOW, not green as one would expect.Archos decided to use a custom USB port, even though there is ample room for a standard mini-USB port. Perhaps it would have spoiled the look of the device. Whatever the reason, a standard port would have made replacing the cable easier.The power system has some odd quirks. The supplied small power unit (with multi-national plugs) fits perfectly into the top round port on the side of the device. Unfortunately, that port is for the earphones! The power port is below the earphone opening; this works fine, but the power plug only goes in about 2/3 of the way, and falls out easily. When plugged in, the device powers on, instead of requiring the user to switch it on. I suppose this is useful in some cases, but it was annoying when all I wanted to do was charge the device - I had to wait for it to power up (about 20 seconds) before I could power it down!Speaking of the earphone port, the included earphones work well and sound nice, but the length of the lines after they split off of the main wire is very short. The wires actually press into my throat a bit, and are almost too short to use. I would expect to buy an aftermarket headphone for this model.The dual built in speakers are barely adequate, and I found them to sound somewhat tinny. OK for most uses, but not spectacular.The device has a support stand to allow it to be propped up for viewing - using one leg. This is not terribly stable, and since the single leg is on the opposite side from the "menu" area of the device (upper right corner), it is pretty easy to have the unit come down smartly onto the table or whatever. Caution is advised when using it vertically.The top of the unit sports an on-off-screen lock slide switch which is SHARP, and I don't mean nice looking. It comes to a point on the edge that the user will push, and is uncomfortable to use. There is an indent in the middle of the switch, so those people with fingernails will want to use it that way. Otherwise, be prepared for discomfort when sliding the switch either on or off (the switch has to be held against the force of the spring to function). Right next to the switch is the opening for the MicroSD card. When fully inserted, the card extends about 1/16 of an inch - just enough to make one hit that instead of the power switch. I have no idea why they didn't make it flush with the top surface.The unit gets a bit hot on the bottom when charging, which you will do pretty often - I found the battery to last about 2 hours in most circumstances. You could listen to a lot of music if you switch off the screen, which consumes a lot of power. It gets a bit hot underneath when the unit is charging, a bit less hot when it is running, but nothing too uncomfortable.The device has a resistive screen, which means that one has to push a bit hard to get a response. This is as opposed to the capacitive screen found in the iPhone, for example, which is requires less effort. I found that I had to swipe my finger a couple of times on many occasions to get a response. I don't know if this is due to slow computer response or the screen. It is sufficient for the needs of the device, but may bother some people.The documentation was VERY minimal, just a few pages with some of the basics. It came nowhere near explaining how to use most of the features of the device.Functionality:The device runs Android, which is a Linux derived OS. It works well, but for someone coming from a Windows environment it will take some time to get used to. The home screen has three "windows" for holding icons; one swipes the finger left and right to go between screens. A small tab slides out to reveal the applications installed.It plays media files well and synchronizes with the latest Windows Media player - so if you use the media player on your PC, your files will be transferred when you sync.The web browser is a custom built offshoot of Google Chrome, and works OK but is a bit basic. I liked the way they offered a multi-window view of open pages.The device includes access to the Archos "Applib", which has maybe 500 applications, and has a number of good games available for download, all free. Other applications are available but not as useful - they are pretty specific in nature. Some of the news programs were interesting, but one can get the same news (and more) off the Web. I found that the left hand side of the AppLib screen had what looks like tabs, but they only occasionally work. The Applib is being updated; I sometimes see new applications, recently including the Dolphin browser (a bit better than the stock one, but not so good as Skyfire).Access to the internet is via WiFi only; no 3G or other capabilities. In some ways this limits the usefulness as a purchase, but it also means there was no need to design in any compromises found in a more mobile device. There is no GPS capability (hopefully you know where you live!).There are some DRAWBACKS to the software:There is no task manager, so I was unable to switch between running applications, unless they were the sort of applications that showed an icon on the top bar (some did, some didn't). The question became how to close those apps. One of the "AppLib" programs turned out to be an application that closed other programs. I used it frequently. But overall the device works pretty well.The built-in file manager does not have a way to select multiple files, or any way I could figure out to create folders. One of the downloaded applications did have folder create functionality.The built-in browser will not run flash, and there is no U-tube capability, so many websites would not show video or other content. It is possible to download the SkyFire browser, but one must do a Google search on "skyfire download to PC", because almost all websites refer the user to the Android Market to download - which won't work on this device. After that one can click on the download install package. Skyfire does render pages and videos well.I found that many of the .wmv files downloaded from the web would not play on the device, even though they played on my computer. AVI files were fine. It will not play .rm files either. For music, MP3 files were fine.I could not find a way to make the media files go to the mSD card besides manually copying each folder to the card. After that it is possible to refresh the media list and find the files. This is tedious, and there should be a way to default storage to either the internal memory or the external card.The device does not use the latest Android version 2.x, and the CPU is basically adequate, not powerful. I had to wait a few seconds for some applications.There is NO access to the tens of thousands of Android applications in the Android Marketplace, and I was constantly finding web sites that mentioned software that I could not download. This is the biggest problem with the device, in my opinion.The 8 Mb internal storage is laid out such that there is a relatively small partition for the applications. One of my applications was leaving large temporary files in the applications file system, and the device warned me that I was low on memory. The internal memory was over 6 gigabytes - but not available to install programs! Anyway, there will be a hard limit to how many programs can be installed. But with only one "program" directory (accessed via a tab interface on the home screen), it would be cumbersome to scroll down to view the programs anyway. The device is designed such that one is expected to create shortcuts on the main desktop to frequently used programs.The email was easy to set up, but only shows about 10 emails at a time before one has to view the next set. I used both IMAP and POP functionality successfully. I didn't seen any capability of Exchange email, but that would not be expected in a home device. The AppLib has an application called K-9 that fixes all the omissions. It supports exchange, but I did not test that.Build quality:The device is pretty heavy for its size, and appears to be solidly constructed. Nevertheless, my unit malfunctioned for a day - it continually brought up the screen to shutdown the device, even though the hardware switch was moving freely and not stuck. I had to use the small reset button on the back to power on the device if I had powered it off. Eventually it stopped doing this, and I was able to use the tablet. So I avoided warranty repair, but now I wonder what else might go wrong. UPDATE: My device kept acting strange, so I finally did a "hard" reset to factory conditions. This appears to have fixed the problems.BOTTOM LINE:Is this device worth the cost? Overall I would say yes, if you are looking for this sort of capability at home. I found it quite useful in checking emails and doing basic web browsing. I mostly use the web for shopping, online banking, and news sites, so it fits my needs. I'm not sure I would use it for movies, but for playing music it is nice.
First let me begin by saying this a good, but not great product. What it has done though is show me how I would use a tablet device and what features I would like or not like in a device, all without me feeling buyers remorse for what i paid.Positive Attributes:-Fairly Clean Standard Android User Interface-Just Right Sized, Not Too Big, Not Too Small-Great Battery Life Around 7+ Hours Surfing with WiFi-Great Sound through Headphone Jack-Plays Ripped DVDs Flawlessly-Loads of Free Games for download around the internetNegative Attributes:-Somewhat Flakey Resitive Screen-Builtin Speakers Sound Terrible-A few Bugs that crop up every so often and require poking the reset button.Overall I am really enjoying this tablet and think it will hold me over till the next generation of tablets make it to market. I mainly use it for general web surfing, basic games (not 3d), music listening/pandora at home and on the run and for these purposes it serves me well.
I had been waiting for this for a while. I didn't want to spend too much money on a tablet and for the price and size the Archos 7 is perfect. If you are looking for something that will work like the Ipad this is not quite it, having said that everything the table is supposed to do like playing videos, music, pictures, reading books, ect. It does it quite well, and it only took me a few minutes to learn how to use it (even adjusting settings and installing apps) or loading media. I was looking for something that would give me a little more than an e-reader and this is exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately I retuned my Archos because there were several issues that I felt would not get resolved by simply exchanging the unit, because even though I'm not 100% sure from what I've been able to read, these problems may extend to more than one single unit. I really wanted to keep the Archos because I do like it a lot and because there isn't anything else out there to replace it with, I hope they come up with a better version of this tablet because I would buy it again.Pros1. Light weight, and the screen size nice2. Screen is very bright and sharp, very good resolution (but very reflective during the day) some people said they had a problem with the responsiveness I didn't feel like that was an issue3. The pre-installed apps worked very well I was able to watch videos, listen to music, and read books without having to install anything else.4. Battery life is not bad if I had to guess it is about as much as stated on the description5. The browser and AppsLib are pretty fast and the whole thing is easy to connect to a router.Cons1. The screen picks up a lot of glair during the day, not good for reading or watching a video outside during the day.2. This version of Android does not support the Android market, even if you download some apps from a different place they may not work with this unit.3. No flash player support, for what I've read there will probably not be any flash player on this item, unless Archos updates the OS which is not likely.( you can use the Skyfire browser but it is not an ideal replacement for flash.4. One issues with the hardware is that, the unit gets pretty hot relatively quick while using it and very hot while charging it which can become uncomfortable.5. My particular unit crashed with the first video I watched, I had to press the reset button to get it going again6. If you watch HD videos (higher than 720 dip the sound doesn't sync well7. It seems the tablet turns on by itself which kills the battery, and you cannot turn it back on even when plugged in, without pressing the reset button. The only reason I think it turned on by itself is that every time this happed the back of it was hot and I had not used it for several hours.
So far, I really like the Archos 7. It is what I expected.As everyone else comments, if you are expecting the Touch screen to perform like the IPAD, this is NOT the device for you. But, for the price, in my book, you can't beat it. (At least I don't know of anything else on the market yet that does)It plays videos flawlessly. The screen size is just right. I wish it had an accelerometer so that you could rotate the screen, but for what I use it for, this works.
I bought this unit hoping for a gadget that has the interface of a Droid phone and got something far less. It looks like the interface of a droid phone but the similarities stop there. The touch is is nowhere comparable to the droid. Basically I thought I was buying a Droid without the phone. Now, this is probably an oversight on my part. It does do the things it is supposed to do quite well. I just wish the touch screen was a ton better. It has a very large, nice screen and it looks stunning and great. The battery seems to be doing fine. I have yet to re charge it after the initial charge, but I have not used is frequent enough to belittle the battery life.Overall not a bad gadget. Need better or improved touch screen technology.
This is a good device. It is worth the money. When i first got it i didnt like it. When i learned how to install skyfire everything became better. You can watch you favorite websites because it had a flash player. I was on [...] the regular version not mobile watching highlights perfectly. The videos were even loading faster than my computer. Installing videos and songs are extremely easy. Everything that has to do with it hooking up to the computer and adding stuff is extremely easy. It plays many formats so you just have to drag whatever to the right folder. Make sure you download the task killer app because apps stay in the backgroung after u use them and make the device slower. With task killer, what you dont need open can be closed. Only reason for four stars is in my house the wifi gets weak in my room. I gotta go to living room to pick up signal then go to my room. It works then but can be annoying.
I'VE HAD MY ARCHOS 7 FOR ABOUT SIX WEEKS NOW AND LOVE IT. I OWN AN ARCHOS 5 AND THOUGHT THE BIGGER SCREAN WOULD BE EASIER ON MY EYES. I AM NOT AT ALL DISAPOINTED WITH THIS DEVICE. ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT AND TWEEK IT YOU WILL FIND IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO.WHERE CAN YOU BUY A TABLET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO $200.I PURCHASED A USB CHARGER CABLE CORD FOR ARCHOS 3G ON EBAY FOR LESS THAN $5.00 IT HAS THE SAME CONNECTION AS THE AC POWER CHARGER THAT CAME WITH THE 7 .ONE END  IS USB AND THE OTHER A STRAIGHT PIN.NOW I CAN CHARGE THE DEVICE VIA A COMPUTER.YOU CAN ALSO  USE IT TO CHARGE IN YOUR CAR IF YOU HAVE A PLUG THAT ACCEPTS A USB CABLE.I'VE TRIED BOTH THESE METHODS AND THEY BOTH WORK .JUST MAKE SHURE YOU PLUG THE STRAIGHT END INTO THE CHARGING PORT AND NOT THE AUDIO.ALSO YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF HELPFULL INFO ON THE ARCHOS FANS WEBSITE. GOOD LUCK.
You really can't beat this device for the price.  Video looks great, music sounds good.  The touch screen works well, being a resistive screen.  The only things that could have made this device better is if it came with Android 2.x and a better Market Place.  But, all in all a very nice device for general web and multimedia applications.
We were looking for a small video player for our daughter to use while traveling, as well as a tablet for my wife to use for light email and web surfing around the house, etc. I was intrigued by the ipad but thought it was too heavy and too expensive. This has turned out to be perfect -- I can convert DVDs to video files to play on here. And my wife finds the small size perfect for checking email or reading news and recipes around the house. Great little product.My only complaints are around the touch screen - I find that I calibrate it every few weeks. Also, I wish there was a way to have an extended battery of some sort for use when flying...
It is a very nice item. I had to get a replacement the first one I got was basically dead out of the box. It took some waiting but Amazon handled the return and replacement.Does every thing I need will surf the web. Handle Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF. Yes you need a third party app. (Documents to Go") Not all of the Droid apps will run on it due to the very large screen, which is nice. Have not really figured out how much battery I have. It seems sufficient. I wish it was removable though. Multiple web browsers to choose from. Skyfire, Opera Mini 5, Built in browser. Good memory size. Good Sound, USB is a CON because you need hardware to change it to host mode. For sale by Archos. easy to Flash to the latest firm ware. I wish the email client had a place to store contacts. I want to replace my Netbook with this thing but that is what I am lacking along with a Torrent app.
It doesn't matter if you can surf on the web, see movies with great image quality and read books with the fantastic aldiko widget if the joy of doing those things is so restricted in time due the battery life.Another issue is that the SO is Android 1 and it can't load flash 10.So I reduce it's usage to reading books, seeing movies and surfing on traditional webs.It could be fantastic if the battery could be replaced (or recharged by the USB port) and if Archos release an update of the Android System.But its so cheap...
If you're looking for a gadget that will blow your mind, the Archos 7 Home Tablet isn't it. That being said, it's not a bad little device for the price.As a newbie to Android, I found the interface and browser a little confusing if not intimidating. But, after working with it for a short time, it's not so bad. And, while with the basic browser the Archos 7 (running Android 1.5) comes with cannot run Flash - which means no video sites like Youtube, a download of the Skyfire browser fixes all of that. Setting up the device to store and remember email accounts is fairly easy as well.Downloading and installing applications is a little more complex than expected. It seems that most application creators for mobile devices aren't very clear on specifications and installing procedures. And, the technical support at Archos, or seeming lack thereof, as well as various user forums, are not very helpful.  So, it takes a lot of experimentation and guesswork right off the bat.The Archos 7's video playback quality is very nice. And, unlike many other portable devices, the large LCD screen is a major crowd pleaser.  And, with the 7 inch screen comes larger versions of web-based content and a virtual keyboard that unlike most mobile devices and smart phones, is actually adequate for typing. The large LCD also allows for great picture viewing and the ability to setup photo slideshows much like you would with a digital picture frame.The touch screen itself is of mediocre quality. In some cases it is too sensitive but for the most part it may take several touches or a heavy push to read the command it is given.And finally, on the multimedia front, what gadget would be complete without a music player? Undoubtedly the best asset of this little machine is its sound quality. It's impeccable! I've personally never found any device better in this regard and feel that I would be hard pressed to do so.Pros Overview:Affordable.Amazing sound quality.Very good photo and video display.Great size overall.Holds a charge for a long time.Some very good bonuses inside the box - 35 free mp3s and outlet adapters for different regions among them.Cons Overview:The base browser and interface leave a lot to be desired.The touch screen is not as reactive as it could be.Long charging time.The support stand it very difficult to pull out for the first time.Technical support is horrid.
The first one I received had a cracked screen. The second one was ok but when you press on the back slightly (near right side) the lcd would flutter. This tablet was clearly rushed to market hoping to make a quick profit before the avalanche of tablets of higher quality hit the market. Pretty soon the tablets will replace laptops and we'll have more of choices from better quality vendors. I will not buy the ipad because it doesnt have a user replaceable battery like this one. Wait for the other tablets to come out and then wait for them to go down in price. The touch screen on this thing will drive you mad!!!
I have had my unit for a few days now. My first impression was that the build good quality and design. For what you pay for this unit its awesome. The screen is not the best I have seen, but not to bad either. The tablet is not super fast, but it does what its supposed to do ok. If I need speed I will use my laptop. It does not include apps like facebook or twitter from the start, but there is no problem finding the apk files on the internet and installing it on your own. Archos version of the market is tragic. It does not have much good apps and is badly designed. But again, you can find about any apk file on the internet.The biggest disappointment with this tablet is that even if it has 8 gb internal memory. You can only use about 30mb of this for apps. The rest of the 8gb is used for a virtual memory card. I was totally bummed out by this. I know this is a problem on android phones with older version of android. But this thing has 8 gb internal memory. Why could not Archos give us 200 - 300 mb for apps. There would still be much space left.The touch screen is a old technology and is not really responsive. So you must get used to clicking 2 - 3 times before something happens some times.Looks like most of what I write is negative. But for what you pay for this unit I still think its money well spent. If you're going to use this for basic web surfing, reading ebooks, watching videos and playing music, this is a good buy. If you want a tablet to have 300 apps and games installed on it, I would not go for this tablet. This tablet is brilliant for what you pay, but if Archos does not fix so you get more space for installing apps. This tablet will not be a best seller.
I ordered the Archos 7 Home Tablet through the Amazon Vine program as a casual web surfing and email tool and as a media player. After playing with it for a few weeks I just can't recommend it for much beyond web surfing. It just doesn't do what I wanted it to do all that well and limited storage limits its utility as a media player. The first disappointment is the speed - it's slow.  Combine the slow speed with the very unresponsive hit or miss touch screen and you have a recipe for frustration. Page scroll flicks can be misread as selections and other times are just ignored. Touch a tab and maybe it'll go to that tab and maybe it won't.What it does do well is play youtube videos and it does a pretty good job with web surfing if you're not in a hurry. My internet connection is fast enough to take full advantage of 802.11g wireless but surfing is far from snappy. The screen is pretty darn good for its size and excellent for the price of the product, but virtual keyboard input can be a little frustrating. It works but takes a bit of patience. This device has a lot of potential but in my opinion it needs a bit snappier performance, a lot better touch screen, and Android 2.x and it would be a really handy gadget for surfing, watching youtube videos, and checking email while watching TV.
Can't use to view youtube. Tablet stops working in the middle of apps use. Tablet freeze alot.
I was very sorry I purchased this tablet.  It had no features.  I sent the first one back because it was defective.  It needed to be reset every couple of minutes.  The secind one I found didn't do anything.  If you want features then buy the Archos 5.  The 7 is a piece of junk. You can't do anything with it.
This was the product I wanted, it did all that I required, (ereader, net, notes etc.) but it kept turning on by itself.  This would occur a couple times a day when I would leave it in suspend.  I killed all apps that could turn it on and it still would do it.  I called support and they said return it.  I did and it took 11 days for the replacement to get here.  It sat in Federal Way WA for days but that is usps's review :-)  The new unit arrived and did the same thing as the first one so since I leave my units in sleep/suspend and can't have them turning on at the wrong time I returned it as well.Liked the unit very much but....
I bought this for our 8 year old daughter, I thought you could download alot of apps, i could only get about 20 on there. The screen is so so touchy which makes it hard to do anything, also i had problems with it shutting down, or saying unable to load with perfect signal with wi-fi! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE!!!!
This is not what it appears to be.  You cannot download hardly any apps for it at all and definatley none of the "fun" ones...Android is a great system but this apparently has the cheapest version of it.  I bought it as a gift for my Husband and luckily I took it out of the box to try it out first...I returned it immediately!!!  Save your money and time!
The Archos 7 takes some figuring out. It's mostly not that difficult to set it up, go online, that sort of thing, thanks to the very helpful instruction booklet anyway. However, as many have said, its best use is for watching videos. Trouble is, your videos have to be the right format. That means you may have to convert some of them by getting a video conversion program. As it turns out, there aren't many videos I am able to convert, either. It would be awesome if you could watch all the DVDs you buy on your Archos, but they are fixed so that you cannot convert them. Some people know how or have the equipment to be able to get around this, but not myself. All I can use the Archos for is watching material I once downloaded from file sharing programs. I guess you could transfer most bootleg DVDs too. Folks talk about watching YouTube on their Archos. That would be very pleasing to me, but the Archos 7 doesn't come ready to do this and you have to find a way to get around that too. I still haven't figured it out. So, basically, I'm very limited to what I can do with my Archos. I can look at pictures and a very small selection of videos that I converted and transferred to the Archos by my computer. It's neat, but it could be a lot neater. Being able to watch YouTube at least would make me very happy. At least I can check my e-mail and surf the net for text stuff. Anyway, the package is great if you are tech savvy and can work around those problems. It comes with a recharger and USB chord, and also a set of ear buds. Over all, it's cool, but I wouldn't be too happy if I had paid the full price for it since I haven't gotten around the YouTube problem yet. If you think you can though, and as long as you have a good computer and router, you should be able to get some enjoyment out of the Archos 7. It's a slick looking device too, and I appreciate the kickstand as well.
Considering the $200 price tag, this machine is loaded with features.  This is great for people like me who like their desktop, hate laptops but still want something to use on the go.If the description is not clear you must know;  Screen is single touch  No camera  No video outputThe app store is better them some reviews let on.  This product is great for people who want to use it to consume media and have a cell phone.  You can get an app to read books on the droid and i-phone but who wants to read a book on a 3-4 inch screen.
I awaited the arrival of the Archos 7, anxious to see if it was at least half an iPad. It's not even half. After extensive testing by my two teenagers and I, the best uses for it are as a movie viewer and a primitive game machine (focus on primitive like "connect the dots").Pros:Nice screen size for personal viewing of pre-loaded movies. (NOT over the net since the link is too slow and there is no flash)Accepts SDHC flash cards so it is straightforward to load aforementioned movies from your PC or Mac.The screen does look good (but not super)It has an integral "kick stand" to prop it up on a table in landscape modeThere is an apps web site and many of the apps are free. (Con: you wouldn't want to pay for most of them anyways)Included email and browser functions nomincally work, but ... (See below)Cons:The touch screen is a bit insensitive - barely tolerable. It can, and periodically needs to be, calibrated.The user interface is occasionally frustrating. Even after customizing it, there are items that don't end up being intuitively accessible.The wi-fi is slow. It feels like 802.11b. I don't know if the issue is the link itself or the processor, but it's faster to browse the net on my Blackberry Tour.The processor never feels snappy. For instance, photos display acceptably fast, but just barely. If you use this as a photo viewer, make sure you trim the photos to the Archos screen size because you don't want to wait for this baby to re-scale he photos as you view them. It will be just too slow.The power charger plug is not well attached and falls out a little too easily. It falls out easily enough that this is NOT just a safety issue to keep it from being dragged off the table, it's too loose.The Archos does not play flash, and it doesn't do Quicktime, and it has other format limitations for sound, movies and photos. If you are not a bit computer handy, you are going to be pretty limited. If you are handy, you are going to end up doing a fair number of format conversions.Does not support Mac. You have to transfer files using an SDHC reader/write or use the whole unit as a mass storage device connected to the Mac's USB port.The included headphones are of poor quality and should have been excluded and traded off for a motion sensor or camera capability or something we care about.The browser is vestigial. I ended up downloading Opera Mini v5 beta to replace the included one. Opera's caching system for mobile devices makes the Archos seem acceptably fast for many popular pages. Of course, if it's not a cached page, it's back to slow, slow, slow again ... The included browser is so bad, I would only use it once to help download Opera MiniThe email application works, and is just better than nothing. If you get five emails a day, it would be fine. If you get a 100 emails a day, this is just not going to work for you. One example: you can only select or delete ONE email at a time.BEST FOR LAST!! THIS THING CRASHES A LOT! It crashes enough that you will not want to rely on it for typing long emails, etc. Like I said earlier, not a bad photo and movie viewer, as long as you convert them to one of the formats this supports.SummaryThe Archos sells for about $200. Save the money for something better, like an iPad ($500). Or, get an iPod touch. Heck, you could get a laptop on sale for $399 with Windows and get more functionality as well as a better game and movie experience. Of course, it wouldn't be as portable as the Archos 7, but it is more likely to work and be able to be adapted to what you want to do.For our part, this item is being used as a movie viewer and to play "connect the dots", but it would have been returned for credit if it was not received as part of the Vine reviews program.
I received my Archos and set about getting it configured.  The screen calibration was very difficult until I used a stylus from a gps unit.  Once calibrated the screen remained a little unstable but usable. The unit seemed to lock up from time to time but it was actually sorting or downloading a large list of items.  The newer firmware I installed from the Archos website seemed to help overall.  I installed a few extra applications and connected to my WiFi effortlessly. Video playback was nice and most everything seemed to work as expected. All seemed good....I eventually had to return the unit because when unit was lying on desk untouched it would begin to select icons and controls by itself.  If you pressed reset it would work ok for a while then start back selecting itmes by itself.Others have noted trouble with display and I suspect the touchscreen portion of this unit is its weak point.  I decided to wait and replace after product matures a bit more.
Ultimately I found the Archos 7 Android based tablet to be an interesting idea but had way too many issues to keep the unit, so I returned it.Pros:The form factor of the unit is very nice, one can easily hold it in your hands and use your thumbs to type on the virtual keyboard. The touch screen, when it worked, was very usable.Sync with Windows 7 and Media Player 10 worked without an issue.MiroSD slot worked as "expandable" memory for the unit.Worked well as an E-book reader with the included app.Battery life seemed reasonable but drained quickly when watching video.Cons:I encountered many times where the touch screen would just stop responding and the areas around the edges cause the unit to do undesired commands. The touch screen does not support multi-touch.Lacks an accelerometer so it only works in fixed orientations.The Wifi required SSID Broadcasting to be enabled to connect to any network, even when hard coding the network info, and the reception was absolutely terrible even when 2 feet away from  my router. It would drop connections frequently or just not connect at all. The network "scan" feature failed to pickup any network in the area... I know from other wireless devices there are at least 3 networks within easy range. This is the only wireless device I've had trouble with reception on my networks. I have 2 Xbox 360's using wifi, LG wireless Blu-ray, wireless printer and laptops that all connect perfectly with outstanding wifi reception quality.The web surfing experience is more like a cell phone then the true web since it connects to most websites mobile offerings over the true website. There was no flash support on the unit, so forget about most every video offering on the web. I've read there is an add on available from Archos at an additional cost that allows this but it wasn't worth the extra money for this unit since I had so many other issues with it. Some sites, like Revision3, would stream video but the quality was horrible and basically unwatchable.Video playback from the local unit transferred by Media Player sync or just with file transfers with supported formats, ie MP4, to either the internal memory or the SD Card was full of artifacts and issues in both WMV and MP4 formats.Apps and the unit crashed often.Updates for the apps did not work correctly and would crash the unit.
All I really wanted was a MP3 player. What the tablet had in store for me was awesome! I love it! It's wonderful for videos. I use it on the go, at home, everywhere! It's really, really good. Better than iPod. Only con is no accelerometer.
Lets start with the good:The Archos 7 home tablet looks great - it feels great, and (on paper) it is a well spec'd tablet. It has USB host, a MicroSD slot, Wi-Fi, a kickstand, a 7" screen, long battery life and a whole host of Android applications.[...] ([...]).In reality, the Archos 7 is just a very basic Android tablet - very little effort was put into making the software experience anything to write home about. The Archos media player is probably the only good part, because it works well, indexes media nicely, and adds support for file formats not normally supported in Android.Sadly, that is where the "good" ends - the screen is dreadful, the touch portion is a hassle, the kickstand is a weak piece of plastic, and the USB host feature requires an additional cable.Performance is sluggish, the Archoslib market is a very poor replacement for the Google Android market (which you can't load onto it) and the selection of available apps is poor. Yes - you can load your own apps onto the device, but why put more effort into this?I do think Archos deserves praise for the Archos 7 - and I think Android has a future on tablets, just not products from Archos. They have a poor history of product support, and they tend to abandon products very quickly (just ask anyone with an Archos 9).The worst part of the Archos 7 is the Android 1.5 operating system - seriously, you are over a year behind the trend with this, and lose out on a bunch of features. And sadly, knowing Archos, you'll never see this thing move on to anything beyond 1.6.All in all - you really do get what you pay for. There are not many alternatives (other than the $[...] one I mentioned), but there are many on their way. So, if you have some time (and patience), wait for a while, and there will be much better choices.
I was excited about this item, even pre-ordered it.I get it, and 30 days later, it's broken.  Won't turn on.  Factory reset (pinhole on device case) didn't work.  Charging light still lights up when plugged in, but will *NOT* turn on.Don't buy this device -- wait for an android tablet that actually *works*--In terms of the device itself, here are some comments:  Touch screen works OK, for a resistive touch screen device.  But don't expect to be using your fingertip.  Screen calibration is tricky and expect to do this over and over.  Battery life is quite good, but app selection is horrible.  Even standard android apps such as Pandora don't work correctly on this 1.5 android OS device.  No Google marketplace support.  Onscreen keyboard is tricky to use.  Pretty laggy device overall.
I travel a great deal so I was looking for a 7 inch Tablet to help pass the time sitting around airports.Pro'sAs mentioned in other reviews.  The touch screen improves with use.Watching video's is quick and easy download to your SDcard.The Battery is a great surprise last most of the day ( 9 hours avg the 1st week )Internet is basic but works, it's fast and easy to set up email accountsWifi has a fair range and is simple and quick.It has a Kickstand  .. sounds simple but you will love the optionThe Con'sAppsLib is a few steps below Caveman Code... the AppsLip server often crashs from high traffic days such as weekends and holidays.  I would say it's down 40 percent of the time.Games .. really you should even consider this if you want to game ?? NO ...Games are on Par with with 1980's games so if you want retro your in .. if you want 3D games move up to the Internet TabletNo flash options : So no youtube.. none unless you root the system and then it's a coin toss.Overall it's great travel partner that doesn't take up a lot of room. I think it's great for watching movies, surfing the web and fit's perfectly on your tray table. But please it's not a Ipad so let's not compare them.
I have never reviewed a product before however I usually do my best to search reviews prior to a purchase.  I was recently researching a tablet for a Christmas list... and I stumbled upon this one... At the time, the reviews were mixed, but I went ahead and thought I would save my dad a few bucks and put this on my list.We went to Best Buy to look at one in store.  The store model would not turn on.  The sales rep told me they had some trouble with the sample model due to "in store abuse" and he was calling tech support.  I went to a different Best Buy and that store's sample worked.  It seemed to be a decent option for the money.  I should have taken that as a warning...Well, I received it yesterday on Christmas day.  I charged the battery and used it for 2.5 hours.  Then, the options for shut down just appeared... I repeatedly hit "cancel" and it continued to pop up...  I then finally said "shut down" and that is the last time it turned on.  So, after 2.5 hours of simple use (I didn't even download any apps...), I had a $200 paper weight.I promptly returned it to my local Best Buy this morning... and by the looks of the other reviews, I am not the only one.I have learned, Tablets are indeed "You Get What You Pay For".  I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab this morning and could not be happier.I hope this review helps... and please check all the reviews before wasting your money.
Bought this Archos 7 a week ago as an early Christmas gift for myself.Originally ordered at TigerDirect but purchased at Best Buy as Tiger was on backorder due to popularity of item.I gave this review only four stars because it did not come with the Google Market installed and I wanted to download apps; however, I installed appslib and slideme (SAM) which both offer plenty of apps.  If you are interested try appslib.com and slideme.org to view applications available before you buy.The Archos 7 is light, quite sizable and serves my needs for surfing net late at night without having to boot up my laptop.  Its also great for checking email although typing is quite cumbersome on the android keyboard.The apps make it handy, I like to check the weather, check whats on at the movies and stuff like that.It can also play video and music and display photos.  All these functions I use on a fairly regular basis.So for my needs its perfect: surfing the net, checking mail, listening to music, showing off pics of the family and using a handful of favorite applications.What makes it really neat and the main reason i bought was to read ebooks which I borrow from my public library and read.  The are in ePub format and are DRM protected.  I looked through appslib and slideme and found several ebook readers and ebook downloads (including wheel of time my fav); however, there was no kindle, no adobe digital editions, and no nook.  So I was stumped, until I went to the overdrive media console website which is the software my library recommended.  I used my ARchos 7 internet to browse to the site, clicked on the android download for overdrive media console for ebooks, and installed the application.  It installed perfectly, I opened it browsed to my library [...] and downloaded the 3 ebooks from my account. Books installed fine.  Overdrive does audio books too, which my library also offers.The only other negative thing about the Archos 7 is the learning curve using the screen, initially i would keep clicking on something when I was trying to drag the touch screen.  It was a little frustrating, but it got easier and now its hardly a problem at all.  I do use my finger nail though, as opposed to the fleshy part.Overall 4 stars - the price is great and the size of the screen is really good.  Good value for money.
I was very excited to get this item only to find out its performance was very poor.  I found myself almost pounding on the screen to get it to respond.  After a couple of days of frustration, I returned the tablet.  My advice is don't bother with this and get something more reliable.
thank you for the speedy delivery i like my tablet but since we are not doing to great this year for christmas i will be giving it to my son thanks once again
Purchased this unit with the intention of using droid apps and web browsing.  It was pretty easy to use and worked fine for browsing.  After loading some apps it quickly becomes sluggish and then freezes up either while loading apps or browsing.  I simply reset it with the reset button after the first time and second time, but on the third freeze (2 days into use) I just packed it up and sent it back.  Too bad because I liked the features, weight, size, and convenience.
I really wanted to like this tablet. I purchased thinking I could do basic functions, but I can't. The first tablet went back after 2 days because it got too hot and I could not hold it. It also developed a red dot on the screen. I received a replacement in 2 days (thank you Amazon), but the second is worst than the 1st one. I am trying to install skyfire and the tablet keeps telling me that does not have any space to download this application... its only 1.5 mb at this thing is supposed to be 8gb... I tried to update the firmware and the computer did not restarted after the upgrade, if was forced to press the reset button. Without skyfire I am unable to watch any youtube videos etc.I am very upset with this electronic. I can't download anything, it is going back. Others could probably have better luck than me with this.
EDITED Feb 2011***  This is a frustrating device, I did have hopes for it but after my daughter received an Ipod touch and I got an Iphone I see how flawed this is..They totally made this device useless as is and do not let you enjoy much at all.  They really limited you to only a few small things to enjoy, including a small amount of APS.It will not become a toy for our 3 year old, as he has fallen in love with his sister's Ipod touch.  but again we have hit a snag as it seems to say we have to space left but we have virtually nothing on the device-  It is CRAP.....*******I am a not very techie person, my hubby is a techie type.We also do not own any smartphonesDay one thoughts...Out of the box, it looks realy nice and was A comfortable size to hold.It started up and ran quickly.It was easy to navigate around the apps screen, and was easy to connect the Wi-Fi.Once I started playing around though I seemed to hit walls of limits right away.The "radio" that comes with it, deezer is useless IMO.I found once I started trying to go to websites I would freuently get errors.DOing a little research I discvered Downloading Skyfire to the device seemed to be a key to getting past these limits.I found out to DL the APK version to your computer first and then drag it into your Archos file while it is connected to the computer.Install it and VOILA the web is now open and ready to use. (my first day and I was enjoying the Vevo website featured on Skyfire).Skyfire lets you view websites in desktop OR mobile format.Hubby pointed out that too bad they did not make this a 3G item like my Kindle is.  That way you can surf the internet from anywhere not just YOUR Wi-FI spot, or trying to find hotspots.Before DL skyfire he was realy disappointed with the tablet as a truely mobile internet device.  It would only be good for DL your own music videos, ebooks, or apps, I was OK with it being good for that, but skyfire really gave it that extra enjoyment.I think it is worth the time to find help sites for the Archos 7 to help you get as much as you can out of this little device.I do find surfing the internet a little frustrating as what you would think is a "home" button on the top left brings you back to the multimeda page not an internet home page.This is also where the "cranky" touch screen can be a bit ummmmm irratating.Yes the touchscreen can be a bit "cranky", my first touchscreen device so I am still happy.My next goal is to figure out how to get some movies or shows on here for my 3 year old to watch while we are out and about..  That is something totally new for me.Update:Still trying to get mpeg 4 videos to play on my device.  I have spent days researching it and and have not had luck.My husband HATES this and finds it to be very frustrating.I am baffled that they seem to be taggina and marketing this item as a "Droid" tablet, but have taken away most droid access like the market place.This utterly confuses me, and it has render many useful applications for this item kind of useless.I know many people like this as an e-reader but I have a kindle and would not even want to think about using this as an e-reader comaperd to my kindle.The kindle's screen can be read anyplace you can read a real book with no glares or reflections, not true with this device.A few of the apps I have downloaded from the applib have not worked, like the .m4v videos.
The Archos 7 home tablet is good for checking your email while your setting on the couch watching TV. It won't replace a laptop, but it wasn't designed to. After using it for a couple of weeks, I realize some of its limitations and short comings. Overall, for the money, The Archos 7 does what it is suppose to very well.
May as well wait for Android tablets that have something newer than Cupcake on 'em. Terrible touchscreen, limited and lame apps. Navigation is pure garbage.
I was excited when I opened the box! And when it powered up I the android screens looked like my Android phone screens. But once I started trying to browse the apps library my excitement turned to frustration.First, the touch screen is way worse than my LG Ally Android screen. And that screen already sucks compared to an iPhone or iPod touch. Not even close. Every time (95%) I tried to scroll through the app titles, I accidentally opened the install screen for an app. In addition, I got this for my kids.. and I downloaded a ton of games, and all but one was a complete waste of time. Most do not even use more than a third of the screen. I went to third party sites mentioned in reviews as well and those apps are just as bad. This should not even be on the market.Nice looking and a nice screen but it would well worth your time to save up for an iPad.
I bought this mainly to research on Android and was vastly disappointed with it. Right out of box, I noticed the back plastic cover makes a squeaking noise and you can see it is poorly installed with a lot of air gap between the cover and the back panel. I am so annoyed by the noise I even want to peel the cover off! Other disappointments:1. Display is not sharp enough.2. Touch screen is terrible. I have to hit more than a couple of times to get the letter I want. If you used any iPhone, you would be hugely disappointed by the slow response and lack of sensibity of the touch screen. What makes it worse is there is no physcial scroll buttons to compliment that. So good luck reading any multi-page website and trying to page up or down!I will definitely return this junk if Amazon still allows a full refund and I strongly advice you not to waste $200 on this crap.best regards,kevin
I can't believe they're still trying to sell this model in 2013. They must have made a million of them, and have an overstocked warehouse.This was rushed to market in 2010, with an old version of Android that couldn't even access the Android Market (now called Google Play Store).They updated the operating system to 2.1, which is just ok, kindof a barebones. Still waaaay outdated by 2013 standards.Processor is really slow (600mHz ... when the slowest smartphone on the market today is about 1GHz). Small memory. Frequent crashes.The touchscreen is also an outdated technology - *not* like a smartphone, iPad, or most other tablets. You have to push really hard, drag really hard. Using a stylus is best. We tried to plug in a keyboard, then to pair a wireless keyboard - neither worked for us.To make this usable, you'd have to "root" it & install your own Android. But it's still got all the other limitations.I *might* consider using this as a toy for $30 or $40, for music, small videos, and facebook updates. But the current price ($150) is a joke. Look elsewhere if shopping for a tablet.
Thts was a gift for my grandson, who is a Web Designer by trade, he was disappointed in the short battery life, the slow response time and a not very sensitive touch screen.  So I had him return it and he purchased an Archo-5. Let's hope this one works out better.
Wow. What can I say. Specially price under200This is great device. Touch screen is very accurate and smoothScreen is clear and perfect,long Battery life, process speed everything is greatI highly recommand to anyone. Go get it now clickArchos 7 is the best device they ever made
I purchased this item mainly to watch videos on. The 8GB of internal memory was under 7 GB after the operating system grabbed what it needed.  That was fine with me because I intended to store my videos and music on a 16GB microSD card. Big mistake.I'm familiar with Android, but try as I might I couldn't get the thing to recognize any file on the microSD card. First I mounted the card directly on my computer and copied some videos over. The Archos didn't even see them and just said the card was empty. I then tried hooking the Archos up to my computer with a micro-USB cable and transferred files that way. Same result. I placed the files into a folder on the card.  The Archos showed me the folder but said there was nothing inside. Nothing I did could make it see any file on the card not even installing them via the sdcard folder in internal memory.Then there was the touch screen.  I knew beforehand it was a resistive screen, not capacitive, and that was fine with me.  What was NOT fine was the unresponsiveness of the screen.  I had to calibrate it multiple times before I got it to work, but even then the top and bottom edges refused to respond properly.  I had to take a stylus and shove it up hard against the top edge of the bezel to get the screen to respond.Finally there's the matter of Archos tech support, which is a joke.  I could could never get through to a human being in spite of their being open 24/7 (really?). Even at 2 AM all I got was the infamous "We are experiencing an unexpectedly high volume of calls. Please stay on the line and your call will be answered by the first available representative."So I give up.  I'm returning this thing and never buying another thing with the Archos mark. The home tablet is a piece of poorly-assembled junk.
This home tablet is a computer, television and great internet browser in one. Great for traveling and home use. The hardest part is just figuring out how to use it and hook it up correctly. For an electronic device, it's pretty handy and I think Ipad users would get a kick out of this.Katiebabs
this product fulfill my expectations, this product is functional, sincerely like so much, and is just that i need to my job!
Nice display, very bright however touch screen needs way way to much pressure.Lacking Blue-tooth. I can not stress enough how much of a problem the lack of Blue-tooth is. Does anyone use corded headphones anymore?? Even the most basic of MP3 players has bluetooth and yet this does not. It's sold as a multi-media player yet doesn't have this most basic of features??It's WiFi will not even recognize my rooted G1 phone yet I can connect to the phone with my desktop PC, my notebook etc. and they all can use the phone to connect to the internet. The Archos tablet doesn't even see it.Another odd thing that the tablet does. It will randomly turn itself on and stay on. Weather you just put it in standby or turn it off totally it will boot up, turn the screen on at full brightness and stay on until the battery is dead. Other times you cant turn it on at all unless you use a toothpick on the reset button on the back and that doesn't even work all the time. Very unreliable.
This tablet is only good to surf the web, watch movies and listen to music.  (I can do all that with my EVO and then some)  If you buy this tablet with the expectations that it would do as much as an EVO phone, an IPad or an ITouch then you will be extremely disappointed.  Don't waste your time and money, because this tablet will never even compete or come close to the current functionalities that these other devices have to offer.  Who at Archos came up with this idea?  Why are they still in business?  I am packing this S*** up and send it back to the store I got if from.  This unit needs a MAJOR upgrade.  The touch screen sucks, the WIFI signal is weak, that market place has hardly any applications available for it and the few that are out there don't work. The Market application itself looks old, its slow, hard to use and confusing.  The keyboard sucks (that's after calibrating the touch screen).  I can type faster on the small keyboard of my Evo and ITouch.  The setting menus look like a strip down version of an Android software.  It has no security features.  The only positive thing I can say it looks pretty and that's about it.
the archos is not a good system very slow get a eken 100 dollars it  is way faster mabe better cause of upgrades
Firstly, the shipping was excellent from Amazon.  I thought this would be a good media player as well as a game player for my travels, however it has locked up several times just switching between screens.  There a very few apps for this device.  When I opened a movie after transferring to device it was jerky and the sound and the place in the scene were not in sync. I had to turn the device off and on several times to fix it.  I have purchased Archos products in the past and sadly I say this has been the by far worst purchase.  The touch screen is the worst of any devise I have used.  Save your money this product is not worth buying at any price.
This will NOT run most Android apps!!!!!!!!It is not recognized by Google as far as meeting their criteria for approved devices.Apps for this are only available via Archos's app library (which is very very limited unless you want hot girls wallpaper), not the official Google Library.Does NOT do FLASHDoes not do NETFLIXIt is slow, you need to take steroids to use the touch screen, and apps freeze a lot.Yeah yeah I know its under $200.00, and if all you want to do is check email, surf non flash sites, and maybe watch a movie, I guess it's sorta OK.
Prosscreen sizebattery lifesound qualityvideo playerConstouch screen is hard.Older Android version.  Very difficult to found good AppsMusic player. far of iTunes. far of iPod.  not user friendlyNot good PDF readerNot office docs readerNot office docs writerNot charge from computerFrecuently crashes and it's necesary to shut downWhy Archos releases a poor tested product?. cheap isn't synonimous of bad.
The product looks cool, but that is as far as it goes. It is very slow, network has problems continually disconnects.After running it for a bit shut down and would not reboot.Sent it back after one day, it needs work.
I liked the look of it, but found it to be very slow and unresponsive, touch screen was very tough and after a week or so the product just died, I don't know why, your better off spending more money and getting an Ipad or waiting for another tablet to come out.
I bought it for web surfing from my easy chair and because it had a larger screen.It had poorer WiFi reception than any laptop in the family or my son's IPod. Browser was fading in and out in a location I have used many times beforeDocumentation/ op procedures are limited to an 8 page guide. According to their Help desk that is all that is available, so you are limited to trial and error.You Tube and most other streaming did not work. According to their help desk their app for that was not working properly and they were working on it.The 8XX- number for the help desk was discontinued causing use of a toll number. I was put on wait for ten minutes while they checked to see if they had a more complete manual.I returned it to Amazon. Very disappointing.
I am very interested in the Archos 7. I was going to give my current ipod touch 2g to my son and purchase a 4g touch...then i started looking at this.  I have a couple questions:1.  I am not sure if i am reading it right or not, but does it have a slot for added memory to upgrade the current 8gb to whatever flash memory i purchase?2.  the battery.  I hate the internal battery on the ipod touch.  I have returned my current ipod 3 times in the last 6 weeks because the battery keeps failing and everytime they give me a refurbished ,ipod touch, piece of cr@% that i have to keep returning.  Is the battery, on the Archos, easily reached and easy to put a new one in when needed?3.  is there a kindle app available for the archos?4. does the archos 7 have attachments available that can connect to TV's?Thanks!
Sadly this unit quit working right after receipt.  Returned free ups  pick upHighly satisfied with Amazon service.
I have purchased many Archos products since their first mp3 player, and have always been pleased with them. This, however, has been a huge disappointment, and I will be returning it shortly.The first problem I encountered was the plastic protector on the screen. When I removed it, it left glue all over the screen, and I have not been able to completely remove it, leaving the surface sticky.The sensors aren't very good, in order to select an item, I usually have to tap on it multiple times, using a lot of pressure. And despite having calibrated it several times, it often selects something other than what I am trying to open. It happens sometimes when I am trying to select an icon, but happens every time I am trying to enter text. I use touch screens on several other devices and have never had this problem before (in other words, I do not believe this is user error).When I attempt to connect to the internet (the whole reason I purchased this item), I get some message about how I can't connect to some google-related ad page. There is no place to enter a web address, and as far as I can see, no way to set a default page. Perhaps those things exist, but in light of the other issues I'm having with this device, I'm not even inclined to investigate further.This could be a great little device, unfortunately, Archos missed the mark as far as I'm concerned.
i love this product.it is so useful.i can browse the net and listen to music.it is great
This is not a bad tablet for the price, but not for anything serious.  Lousy touchscreen, very erratic andunresponsive, tap, tap, tap, tap, taptaptaptap..... :-( You get what you paid for.  Nice sound, nice picture, but taptaptaptap to get it to work.  At first Icouldn't get pass the touch screen calibration.  It would not go to 'next', so I had to go back.  I usethe included program to format a microSD card and afterwards, it would not recognize it.  Da?  A nicetoy for a young kid, but get serious, not for an adult.
Pro:Good lookGreat screenAndroidCon:Battery chargingFlimsy (stand leg is like 1/16" plastic etc)USB port is relatively square shape and micro USB connector goes in upside downPower connector sticks out 1/8" inchTouch screen does not work well and even opening apps drawer require finesse.Glitchy often, gently grabbing the unit for input causes random input.Sometimes it randomly wake itself from power off or sleep mode.First unit I got charge until orange (it supposed to charge and yellow), so slight bug.It was very glitchy first hour.  I attribute that to background sorting of tons of music I had on sd card.Battery went to 8% in 3-4 hours and took hour to go down to 3% and lasted hour more.I requested exchange and got it shipped.Unfortunately, next charging made unit hot and glitchy things got more frequent.With this, I would have ask for refund, but was too late.Second unit got here fast.  It did not charge fully, and stayed at red.And screen had flicker.Return number two for refund.Face of lcd screen is right at box surface and it was mailed without much packing material for mailing box.Before getting the unit, I thought people were little harsh or too critical.But I have to agree, this is good hobbyist home toy, not reliable consumer electronic.I am glad that I went through amazon rather than some mom and pop operation.7/9/2010:It seems that someone is manipulating reviews.  I suspect most if not all 5 star reviews are from people that want this unit to have higher ranking.  Look all that recommendations and how many negative recommendation I got.$199 price might have been pretty good but now there's tons of alternative android tablet such as m001 zto apad epad iped etc. which are cheaper.  Funny thing is it seems all of them are unreliable.  For example zto was on amazon for few weeks and no company is selling it now.  m001(and relabeled units)are getting bad reviews too.Lucky for me, I bought 8.9" cinepal for replacement.  It does not have internet, but it is solid and work very good as video player.  I have many computers, netbook, and smart phone so don't really need internet with it.  If you want a video player go for cinepal.If you want internet tablet, wait until android 2.2+ tablets with 512mb ram if you do not like over priced ipad or convertible tablet netbook.Dell mini 5 "streak" is 5" tablet/smart phone for ATT coming out later this summer too.Some people thinks usb charging is good idea.  I think it does not make any sense for a HOME tablet. Usb is not design to dish out lots of power so even in ideal condition it might take 6-10 hour to charge which is not desirable for most people.  Unfortunately, A7HT wake itself up etc. so it is doubtful that it can charge even to 30%.
I was so excited to get the Archos 7... While I can see how there MAY be some features that are great (IF THEY WORK, THAT IS) but this product does NOT do as advertised. Let me count the ways (can you tell I am upset?)I got the Archos to run video's for a very important work presentation... I spent hours, then my friend soent hours and my video's looked like they were stored in video's but they wouldn't play?  Well we found out that's because the Archos only plays a few selected format of video's... (btw - I couldnt even play You Tube video's).  And then I had the problem of the darn thing FREEZING constantly and there is no "alt control delete"... half the time the touch screen did not work at all...  and then after only a few hours of trying to play around on it IT WONT TURN ON NOW.I want to say.... I am not a person who returns things, i'm just not.... and even though this this useless thing only costed $200 compared to the Ipad I am sending this rotten product that shouldnt even be on the market BACK to Amazon! And as soon as I get my refund I will turn arounf and order the Ipad!
I could live with hacking this device if the touchscreen was half-way decent. It was so frustrating to use I just packed this unit up and sent it back.
Hi:I bought this little tablet thinking of use it for e-mail check ebay, amazon surf some gogle and play some videos .it freezes some time touch is bad ,and it performs as the price, please don't expect more than that, even loading pages is quiet slow ,so i suggest you think if you couldbuy an apple ipad  or conformed yourself with that perform, because is slow so you decided.
This device is totally and completely useless. I have never written a review in my life before, but I had to for this to warn people not to buy this.It basically doesn't do anything. You can't use the android ap store, so pretty much all the useful functionality of your droid phone you can't use. The touch screen is awkward and slow, so it's not useful for web browsing. None of the aps that it comes with are useful. You can't watch videos, you can't listen to music, you can't browse the web, you can't play games.I use it as an alarm clock.I ignorantly thought it would be a tablet version of my android phone. Wrong.Terrible.
I bought this, charged it according to the manual and finally it was ready.. but no dice. I booted it up and within minutes it crashed. I didn't have time to do anything but browse pictures and watch a few seconds of sample video. I am just flipping through menus and bamm it dies. boot back up? sure. Sometimes. when it does it may stay on for a second (literally immediately crashing)or a minute. I got it to stay on long enough to update the firmware to the latest from the archos site - no dice. Same problem. I got this as a gift for my wife, so I am double pissed. I see that some have had luck with it out of the box, but mine is a complete brick of a thing. cant even use it. And its not like I am going to get a replacement in time for her birthday, so I am probably just going to return this POS.
I want to thank everyone for their reviews. I was considering this as a cheaper option to the I pad, buy after reading I took the plunge and bought the I Pad. I figured that no one in my household had the patience to follow all your tips for better usage, and it was going to cause an untold amount of frustration.
Don't waste your money! Stick to your Motorola Droid if you like the Android software.
Long story short:This tablet is a case study in "you get what you pay for".  Yes, it's 40% the cost of an iPad, but it's 100% useless.  The software that comes on this device is terrible, and this device is not compatible with the Android Marketplace.  There's literally nothing you can do with it.Full Review:The build quality is solid, but that's about all I can say in its favor.  The Industrial Design is ugly, as is the the screen.  It runs an older version of the Android OS (1.5) as having an older touch screen technology which you will hate.  My thinking was, I would be willing to put up with this for a cheap platform on which to run Android apps but the deal breaker is this-- *NO* access to the Android Marketplace.They do provide their own app store but it is awful.  Many apps appear to be in foreign (Asian) languages.  To add insult to injury, the applications that come with the device are horrible and without access to the marketplace-- you can't find alternatives.I thought... It sucks as a ebook reader, music player, video player, internet browser, and can't download applications... Maybe it would make a good living room clock!  Alas, the only clock application is ugly as anything.  I do not know what the reason for not including the marketplace on the device was but it damns the Archos 7 to uselessness.
i bougth this item but its dont work i charge and never start up im really sad but this purchase
I borrowed one of these for a weekend, in response to a bet that it was "just as good as my ipad."That is like saying that a beaten down car that doesn't start is just as good as a new Ferrari.I played with Archos 7 for hours and although I was finally able to check my email (it took hours to get into my email -- compared to less than a minute to set up the ipad to check my email the and less than a second once the ipad was set up), I was not able to get the Archos 7 to do anything else.Just spend the extra hundred bucks and get a real ipad.
This item did nothing as advertised. I ended up purchasing an iPad from the Apple store which is what I should have done in the first place. This was a waste of money and will be given as a gag gift to a co-worker at the office Xmas party. My rating is actually 1/2 star but there is no provision for that low of a rating.
I've had my ideapad now for about three months and really enjoy it.  The keyboard is awesome and I really enjoy how low-profile the device is.  A lot of other netbooks have huge bezels around the screen - not this one.  This makes it easy for discrete use in a classroom or an office.I like the trackpad when I use it (I mostly carry around a mouse too).  I dont really understand those who put it down so much.  To me, it's perfectly functional and poses no problems whatsoever.I highly recommend this device.
I've had this for about a week, and I really like it, so far. I'm giving it a five star, for now, because I haven't run into anything I dislike about it, yet. Is it perfect? No. Being a netbook naturally means that there are going to be compromises. Every netbook I considered had 1GB RAM and a fairly small 5400rpm hard drive, which makes the computer a lot slower than its potential. But, I can't complain about the RAM or the hard drive, since I planned to upgrade both, even before I chose the particular model I would buy.The first thing I did, when I got the Lenovo home (and after playing around with it for about an hour), was to pop out the hard drive, store it in a safe location, and install a Seagate 500GB 7200rpm hard drive. The second thing I did was to install Red Hat's Fedora 12 on the newly installed hard drive. Linux tends to have a smaller footprint on the hard drive, than Windows, and doesn't require as much RAM, either. And without the ActiveX overhead, it's an ideal OS for a netbook. With those two upgrades installed, I saw an immediate and noticeable performance increase. The RAM upgrade will have to come later, since I've had to temporarily tighten my budget, due to an unforeseen expense, just two days after my purchase. But when I do upgrade the RAM, I expect to see another noticeable performance increase.Some of the things I really like about this little wonder:  - Seems very solid and well-made.  - Long, long battery life, even with the 7200rpm drive installed. I'm getting 6+ hours, before I plug it into the wall socket (and even then, it claims to have 1+ hours of charge left).  - Nice keyboard. Description says chiclet keys, but I don't think the copy writer knows what chiclet keys are. The resemblance to chiclet keys, in this case, is only superficial. The feel is nice and solid, like a real keyboard, not rubbery, or toy-like.  - Screen is clear and sharp. Of course, I'd like it to have a higher resolution, but it's one of those compromises I mentioned previously. Besides, a higher resolution would mean that the netbook would have to be bigger, which would defeat the whole concept, or else the screen text would be unreadably small.I may revisit this review in a month or two, as I use the netbook more, but as of now, I believe it is well worth the price I paid for it. I'm very satisfied.
My first netbook and I'll say that it gets the job done. I installed linux onto it since I haven't heard anything good about windows starter and I wasn't willing to spend an extra 80 for windows 7 home. The keyboard is great, you'll see no difference in any keyboard. Great size. The touchpad is probably the worst thing on this unit for me. It's a hassle to any menial task with this touchpad. I use a usb mouse instead, works fine. Don't expect anything from a netbook other than web browsing and any other simple applications.
Update: April 2011--I am beginning to travel, a lot, as I do every Spring and Summer and Fall, on business. It took almost no time for the rubber feet on the bottom of this netbook to fall off. I called Lenovo technical support and they could not help me, even though my netbook is still under warranty. They have no replacement feet. They would have to replace the entire bottom of the netbook which would require me sending it in. Looking around the internet, these lost feet seem to be a pretty common problem. I am not downgrading my rating because I still really like this computer, but I almost did.I bought this to replace an 8" Acer. The increased screen size makes a big difference. I travel a lot, and the weight of this netbook is minimal. The construction is much sturdier than my Acer and the almost-full-size keyboard is a great boon. The webcam is also far superior to the Acer, too.Now for a few negatives: The left-side USB port is so close to the port where the charger plugs in that any USB device of unusual size or design will not fit unless you want to run on battery power.Lots of bloatware, I wound up deleting almost all of it.Windows 7 Basic sucks, it is a terrible OS. I recommend upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium. I think it costs $79 to upload and well worth it.The battery time is very much exaggerated. Run it on battery for only a few minutes and the estimate drops from 7 hours to 4 hours.Get the RAM upgrade. Everything moved glacially until I installed the upgrade. Well worth the cost.Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT purchase the RAM upgrade from Crucial recommended by Amazon. That is the wrong DIMM. It is the wrong pin size, won't even fit. I returned it then bought mine directly from Crucial.Finally, the thing most wrong with this computer is the mouse pad. Most netbook and notebook mouse pads suck in some ways, but this mouse pad is the worst I have ever seen. The mouse jumps all around, and adjusting the mouse speed made very little difference. If you are going to use this computer and enjoy it, you must use a mouse, MUST.All that said, I do love this netbook. It is the best I have had (on my third) by far. I just took it on my first business trip and except for the mouse pad, everything was swell.Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3 0647-2AU 10.1-Inch Netbook (Black)
just got this computer this week and its relly nice good speed and great download times and the web cams ok quality:)the scroll pad is a bit odd its hard to drag and side scrollings kinda hard but not impossiblei relly liked the idea of the matte patteren (no finger prints) but mine was shiny and the mouse pad looks different not relly sure why but i still like it great little net book so far:)

 Length:: 6:35 MinsThis is a video review of the Lenovo S10-3t with Windows 7 Premium and 2 GB of memory.My overall impression is quite positive given the flexibility of using my existing PC applications and using it as a tablet for reading e-books, surfing the internet, and watching videos. One pleasant surprise is that the wide screen display gives me a much better internet browsing experience than my other existing netbooks. In my opinion, it does a lot more than an iPad with a similar price as its low-end model.The multi-touch experience is not the best but it works quite well after some training.Hope you enjoy this videoCheers
Two things: this model (-85U) comes with Windows 7 Home Premium and with a 4-cell battery. Home Premium, unlike Starter, has a ton of built-in touchscreen features that all work well with this machine. If you read the reviews of the -37U version of the S10-3T, you'll see that many people complained about the size and weight of the 8-cell battery.About speed -- I uninstalled most of the Lenovo "extras" and swapped the RAM for a 2 GB module (I used the Crucial only because it was Prime-eligible). The printed manual has clear instructions for replacing the RAM. At this point, the machine is quite snappy except when it isn't. That is, when Windows decides to do an upgrade or when some process runs amok, the machine becomes nearly unusable. The rest of the time, it is fine.I really wanted an Android tablet, but since no acceptable one yet exists, this was a good compromise solution. I like having Windows, with its unlimited supply of applications, but I don't like the larger size and weight nor the limited battery life (I think it may be less than 3 hours, but I haven't run it down yet). For the best info, search for Jesse B Anderson's stuff -- he'll help you decide.
...for what I was looking for.I read a lot of digital comic books and had contemplated getting an iPad so that I could once again read my comic books anywhere, rather than sitting in the basement at the computer desk.After learning how little space is on the iPad I started searching for iPad alternatives and the S10-3T came up.I got it about a week and a half ago and it is perfect for my needs.Not only can I read my comic books anywhere I want, I can do about 85% of the stuff I use my regular PC for. I find myself in the basement less and less. Still use the PC for photoshop work, development stuff, games, etc.I too upgraded to 2 GB of RAM...you just have to...it'll make or break your perception of the netbook. I also use the SD card slot for ReadyBoost, saw def improvements with that as well. I removed a ton of the 'bloatware' (mainly lenovo pre-installed applications) that came with it. Also made some tweaks via [...]......great site for getting the most out of your S10-3T.My 4 negatives (but by no means a deal breaker):No bluetooth (i ordered a usb one)No way (yet) to upgrade the CPUBattery only lasts like 3 hours with WiFi on, though if i had the 8 cell, a negative might be the weight...right now i can hold it with one hand while readingNo SSD drive....from what I have read it really increases performance. Once they come down in price for larger ones (250GB+), i'll upgrade mineAnyway...if you are not sure about the iPad, and don't want to wait for a legitimate Tablet PC, this will def be worth it.
I was surprised by the size and weight. I thought it would be larger and heavier, but it's about the same size and weight as the HP Mini 10.2". My unit has the 4-cell battery, but it has Windows 7 Home Premium already installed which is a great trade-off. I purchased the larger battery from Lenovo and am still waiting for it. I immediately installed the 2GB memory upgrade. It was very easy to do. The hardest part of that process was unscrewing the back. The screws are embedded in the lid and do not come out, so they can't get lost. The old memory card snapped out and the new one snapped in. The system recognized it and I was ready to go. The unit comes with functional versions of MS 2010 Word and Excel. You would have to purchase the full MS Office program if you want all the components. The Natural Touch program may take some getting use to. The Lenovo uses finger touch-a learning curve. I am very happy I can watch movies through an optional portable DVD drive. As soon as I can get to a wireless connection, I will download iTunes and transfer my files. The speakers exist, but the sound through headphones is great. Music sounds good and has good bass. My unit also came with the SIM card option. I will test that at a later date because I am overseas. I put a DecalGirl decal on the outside cover, but they only make them for the S10 and it is not the same size. Still, it is enough to protect the outside cover from scratches and fingerprints until they make one specifically for the S10-3T. If it weren't for the difficulty I'm having in calibrating for finger touch, I would have given this a 5-star rating. The other drawback is it has only 2 USB ports, but I can get around that with a hub. I am going through the programs and getting rid of the ones I don't want. I deleted MacAfee and installed Norton Antivirus. I originally purchased this through Best Buy online but it was on back order indefinitely. I watched the price on Amazon until it dropped to $397 and I bought it quickly. A week later the price jumped up again and stayed high due to high demand. Every store I went to was sold out. If I had known everything about this unit I know now, I would believe it was worth $500 but not more. A netbook should not cost so much. Overall, I'm glad I got this. I travel extensively and this is a wonderful alternative to lugging around a full laptop.
Received it in record time from Amazon.com and I'm really happy. If you know what you are looking for then this is a great device for you. Those looking for a cheap Ipad killer should keep waiting. Just get an Ipad when the price comes down or wait for improvements to the bevy of Android tablets that have been coming out of Asia. I wasn't however, looking for an Ipad killer. I was looking for a 7 to 10 inch touch screen device that would bridge the gap between my laptop and my PDA. It's a netbook that converts to a touch tablet. That's it. It's not and is not attempting to be an Ipad. Two different classes of device.I would have preferred the HTC Shift, a true UltraMobilePC, but it's still $750. Though too large to put in your pocket, the Lenovo S10-3t does well being carried in its little sleeve. It's been a conversation piece at the Dr's office.PROS: I needed something large enough to be productive while mobile and access my Windows suit of programs, yet light enough not to cause shoulder strain. The S10 is spot on. Although having the physical key board was a must for Word docs. I rarely use it when web browsing or reading e-books. If I'm using it in bed I can sit it down on my night stand with one hand in contrast to my heavy Dell Inspiron 1501. The touch screen has been surprisingly responsive. Flicks are becoming second nature.CONS: There was plenty of bloatware that I promptly uninstalled (Veriface, Natural Touch, etc). The speakers suck, so you'll need headphones if not in a very quiet place. It's a Windows OS, so even Windows 7 Home Premium gave me a Blue Screen of Death. Had to use OneTouch Recovery to reset to factory settings. Screen rotation could be faster. Has been working quite well though since.My primary use has been web surfing during this summer. However, when school begins. I plan to use it during class to access and annotate lesson plans on the go and to enter student assessment data or observation notes. I'll update this review to let you know how it handles.  I still love my PDA though.
I got my Lenovo Ideapad just a few weeks ago.  I have been bery impressed. I had doubts about the Atom processor and frankly,  I had doubts about Lenovo. I have been very impressed. The size and weight are what you would expect in a netbook,  but the "flip" and touch capability of the screen is great. It is a tablet and netbook in one. The touch interface is not quite as good as the iPad,  but the flexibility of also using it as a netbook with multiple USB slots and a full (real) keyboard, make it a great tool. I have tried the iPad and the Lenovo Ideapad beats it.
Very nice and portable machine. First thing is to remove most of the Levono software which does not add much feature-wise but decreases performance and is overall "buggy." Once stripped down the machine ran great and the touch screen experience is very well done.
This is my first netbook ever, and I have to say that Lenovo may be the only company I ever go to for netbooks/laptops in the future! I ordered the laptop on the fifth of August and used the 2 day shipping. The laptop arrived on the tenth of August. You should probably allow for about 3 days of processing, not counting actual travel time. I love the touch screen and the 180 degree screen rotation. The size is perfect for just carrying around all day. The only bad things I can say about this netbook are as follows:1) The battery life is small. Only about 3 - 4 hours.2) The RAM is only 1gb. I'm going to extend mine to 2gbs. to allow for faster speed in general.All in all, the problems I have encountered thus far are easily repairable and aren"t going to be much of a setback at all.
This computer is great for doing all the basic things like using the internet, Microsoft Office, etc, but it is a little slow.  The touch response seems to be a little sluggish as well.
Do Not Buy!!! I bought the Ideapad S-103t directly from Lenova. I had the product two weeks when the screen cracked while I was tutrning it to tablet mode. I did not apply any special force it just cracked during normal use. When I called tried to get it fixed under the warranty customer service said screen cracks were not covered and I would have to mail it back and pay to have it fixed at $80 analysis fee, $150 for screen, + labor, $250 - $300 total. That is over half the cost of the computer. I took it to the local service provider and got it fixed for $150. Bottom line - The flip between tablet to keyboard is cool but Lenova is selling a poorly built product and does not stand behind thier warranty. If you buy, plan on spending another $200-$300 replacing screen.
it's a netbook, dont forget that. it does just that - browse the internet well. you can also run games from the mid-nineties. :) be sure to get the extra ram, and format it as soon as you get it.
I bought this as my firs lenovo and my first netbook and had very high expectations. Don't waste your money. I brought it on a trip to Germany and it broke after a few days. There was a problem with the motherboard. Even before that it was slow. Luckily Best Buy gave me my money back. DON't BUY IT!!!!!!!
I had the tablet for a few months, and when I tried to shut the lid, the screen cracked.  Checking the forums, apparently this is a COMMON PROBLEM and a design defect.  However, Lenovo won't own up to it and wants $250 to fix their problem.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk or anything from Lenovo, they won't stand behind a known flaw in their products.  Spend your money elsewhere.
See my Amazon review of the limited edition Cosmic Night - many of the comments are equally applicable
This Tablet PC cost me several hours that I'll never get back. I so wanted it to work because I am tired of iPad's lack of Flash. With Windows, I know that I can get to Flash sites. This product simply doesn't deliver.* Integrated high-speed Wi-FiIf 4-minutes to load a simple text-only webpage is "fast" then okay. There seems little "high-speed" about this unit. Its touch screen is unresponsive. Type something and it takes a second or two for each character to appear. Press PAGE DOWN and you think the machine is stalled because it does nothing for a minute or two.* Genuine Windows 7 StarterNo, the unit that Amazon sent had Home Premium. It sort of made the upgrade to Home Premium that I bought a waste of time and money.* VeriFace facial recognition technology - a fun way to log in to your PCFun? Not so much fun actually. The setup for VeriFace tried scanning my face for 18 minutes before I gave up and went to do something else.* Get online in seconds with Quick Start 2.0Bogus marketing hype dreamed up by somebody who never actually touched the unit. There is nothing "quick" about this machine. What's more, the web part of Quick Start uses some proprietary browser. It isn't IE or Firefox or any mainstream name. The Quick Start name-server system (DNS) does not exist. "[...] does not exist" (really?) It forgets website locations between hops: go to page A on the site, and everything is great. Try to go to page B, the browser can't find the website. This is an awesome idea that could let you get into one or more common applications without booting the entire operating system. Unfortunately, Quick Start is unusable.
Best stand I've tried. The siliver finish is a greath match and the stand design fits the iPad perfectly. The weight of this stand is its biggest strength--I can touch the screen, operate the volume/lock buttons or press the home key without worry of my iPad flying off the stand (in either portait or landscape position). Some users may not static viewing angle (no adjustment features) but the angle works well for pretty much any type of use. I am considering buying another one for my desk at work.
Very well made stand for the iPad.  Specifically useful in the home office and during movie viewing.  Can be used without taking off most cases.
This stand is great.  I was concerned that it would not hold the iPad with the case but it does.  It looks sharp and it works great.I can use it while seated in the Living Room and as a music jukebox or digital picture frame in the Dining Room and mainly as a permanent stand in the bedroom so I can recharge it and use an Alarm clock app.  I will probably need another stand!The only problem I have is that $60 seems a bit much.  But that's just me.  I was going to give it 4 stars but since I got free shipping I bumped it back up to 5.A nice solid product.
This stand is great on a desk or table and really keeps the iPad in place.  I use the iPad for documentation and reference lookups when using my laptop or desktop and it used to keep falling over when I used the apple case with it.  Now I can touch it firmly without the fear of it falling over. The stand is heavy enough that most touches and gestures won't cause the iPad to shift.  My only complaint is the viewing angle is not adjustable.  It's not a big problem with my current working space, but I can see it possibly having some glare issues if there are a lot of overhead lights.  Aside from that little shortcoming I think it's worth the price and I'd recommend it.
I think this is a great sturdy stand.  You can put the iPad on the stand straight up or turn the iPad on the side and this stand will still hold it up.  The only thing that I wish was available for this stand was if it was able to adjust it's forward motion. The stand has no adjustability.  The stand sits back somewhat.
I got my stand yesturday and I have to say I love it it's a perfect match for the iPad. iPad fits in there perfectly.
First off, I'll apologize for writing a review after owning this tablet for only one night. I hate these kinds of reviews but I felt this needed at least one review from a real customer.In my few hours with it last night, I downloaded and installed several apps on it from GetJar, including Facebook and Kindle. I also downloaded several apps from my PC onto a thumb drive and installed them onto the tablet from that, which was very cool. I visited several websites that had flash banners and they worked flawlessly. I was also able to play embedded videos on sites including youtube.com and my facebook news stream.Pros:- USB port - I plugged an 8GB flash drive in and installed apps from it.- Micro SD slot - Haven't used it yet but plan to soon- HDMI port - Haven't used this yet either but it's a great option- Video looks great- Very responsive when touching links or rotating display- Browser is quick and displays flash- Great price for the specsCons:- Lack of good, working apps. For the A7, you get your apps from GetJar, instead of the Android marketplace. Some apps refused to install for me, like Angry Birds. Others installed but clearly weren't made to work on this size tablet. There isn't a netflix or skype app available (I was hoping to use the webcam with skype).- Pinch-to-zoom doesn't work particularly well. Seemed to always go way too far in or out. You're better off just double-tapping.- Scrolling - scrolling by sliding my finger seems to cause a lot of unintended clicks along the way. I think there's just a bit of a learning curve, being used to my ipod touch. It seemed to happen less as the night went on.- The fixed buttons aren't backlit so at first it's difficult to use in the dark. You quickly figure out where they are and it's not that big a deal- So far it's been hard to find any cases or accessories built for the A7- I wasn't able to set up my yahoo mail in the default mail client. Instead, I installed the yahoo mail app, which is basically a shortcut to the mobile yahoo mail site, which works fine.This purchase was for my wife, who wanted something like an iPad but at a size that fit in her purse. This is almost the exact same size as my 2nd generation Kindle (a little thicker). So far she's used it to quickly check and respond to things on Facebook, check emails and surf the web. Because of the speed and ease of use, it should supplant most of her laptop use, with the exception of sending long emails and working on speadsheets.I trust there will be more and better apps for android tablets in the near future. It looks like there are A LOT of similar tablets hitting the market now. For me, this tablet looked like the best specs for the best price right now and I imagine it will be even more fun to use as new apps are made for it.
Have had this device for 3 days now and I am more than impressed. This thing is blazing fast and very responsive. Sure there are issues  but developer is releasing  patch to address these by 12-24-12 according to their web site. Hopefully this fix will address the problems with wi-fi waking ,Nvidia drivers (not able to play angry birds.. etc). True the multi-touch and lack of market are a bummer, but what do you want for 300 bucks? So glad I did not spend double this price on a Galaxy tab that will be outdated in 6 months.pros-Fast, fast, fast-Screen res is great for the specs-Very responsive-HDMI out is awesome-USB and SD card media (Bite me Apple)-rooted out of the box-300 bucks!- Jetflicks streaming on 7 inch screen!-Flash player rocks (Bite me Apple)-Great readerCons-No Market (hopefully XDA developers will help with this)-Wi-fi fails to wake from sleep (workaround available and patch coming 12-24-10)-Nvidia drivers not up to date (patch coming 12-24-10)-Not true multi-touch ( not an issue for me, I have no plans on making this into a gaming rig)-Proprietary connector for dock (not a big issue since there is USB/SD card support)-Menu buttons have no back lighting
I have had the Elocity for two weeks now. It features cutting edge specs(as of December 2010): The Tegra 250 dual core processor is the reference for the upcoming versions of Android; Capacitive screen; 512MB RAM; Android 2.2; Flash 10.1; USB port; bluetooth, etc. I  We have had our share of frustrations in unlocking its' potential, which are common with these products when they are new. The improvements since launch are huge:Elocity's firmware update fixed many issues including wifi, Angry Birds installation, and multi-touch pinch to zoom (although there is still room for improvement there).XDA forum has made great strides with it as well including full Android Market access, Google apps including Gmail, Calendar, and Maps. Quadrant benchmarks are now up to 2400, which blows away any non-Tegra devices. I am loving this tablet more each day. The lack of backlit buttons is a little annoying when using in the dark, but I am memorizing their location. If you buy one, you really should visit the XDA thread to take full advantage of its' capabilities. [...]I also posted a couple of videos of it on YouTube in case you are interested.Is it the perfect tablet? No, but it has a lot going for it and if you want a tablet right now, it's a great choice that will be able to handle upcoming versions of Android.As the developer community grows, this tablet is just going to keep getting better,too.
There's a firmware update that came out Christmas Eve which makes this tablet into the device I thought I was buying to begin with.  [...]Out of the box this device was a real clunker, just too many bugs to be usable.  But with the update installed this beauty hums along wonderfully; I find it exactly as I expected it to be: absolutely enjoyable.  I understand that there will soon also be a workaround to get the official Android Marketplace to work on this tablet; that will be very nice.The update was very easy to install, I only had to download the .zip file on another computer and put it on the microSD card.  The update function was buried in some obscure place in Setttings.  And I lost all my data from the device, because, for one, the file system wasn't working right and wouldn't backup, and for another, the data might not have reinstalled properly after the update, even if I'd had a second card to do the backup on.  But after rebooting and waiting for the update to install, this was a different machine entirely; well worth the minor difficulty.There's more about installing the update at the [...]**Update:  It looks like Amazon stripped out all the links I provided.  If you want more info on the update, go to Elocity Now (dot com), the comany's officiall site, then to Support, then to Downloads, and there's a whole page of relevant info about  the fix, as well as the official elocity firmware update file. Android Forums (dot com) has a good thread, too, where I first heard about the update, titled "eLocity A7: Good News, and More Good News".**
First let me say I am a big fan of android. I had nexus one before and currently owning Archos 70IT.I really happy when Elocity released A7. It comes Tegra 2 processor, 512MB RAM and multi-touch (as company say) this sound like awesome deal...on paper at least.I ordered one, and very excited when I received my A7.Elocity A7 is speed demon, extremely fast and responsive, then I found out that A7 has no HARDWARE MULTI-TOUCH support.On their website says it support multi-touch, this is FLAT OUT LIE....this confirmed by xda member using multi-touch test program. It only register single touch, no more.You can pinch to zoom only on original browser that comes with it with jerky movement, other than that you are on your own.On top of that I also having issue with wifi, it will turn off by itself after device waking up. When I try to turn it back on, it goes back to airplane mode. The only way to fix this problem is rebooting it. This happened every time device goes to sleep.She is going back to her mama today :(From xda forum I read that elocity will release 2nd generation next year with real multi-touch support, until then I will keep my archos 70IT. Its getting better and better with update firmware :P
It shipped very quickly, which was great. But On the information page for the tablet an HDMI and 2.0 usb  cord is promised. There  was nether of the cords in the package. And i am pretty sure that i stilled payed for both of  those cords.Cons:The 5 "android" buttons are NOT illuminated, which is bad in the darkThose of you getting this device after owning an ipod touch, ipad, iphone will notice that the on screen keyboard is hard to type on quickly.There is no android market, which leaves you to use other sources to get appsPros:It has a  very responsive touch screenSim and microsd slotsQuick Flash player
This is my first tablet and overall i liked the tablet. Nice design and good quality (even though it is plastic) specially the back cover.I bought this tablet for my wife since she was looking for an e-reader to replace her sony Reader. Unfortunately, my wife did not like it because of the touch screen (is NOT multi touch), a little bit heavy, and it hangs when the tablet goes to sleep mode. My wife rated the product 3 out of 5.  We speak arabic language, the system does not support arabic language as well as Hebrew.Let me review it based on my perspective. This tablet is almost a complete Linux machine. It comes with Android Operating system version 2.2 (linux kernel 2.6).  Unfortunately, the hardware specification is more higher than the capability of the Android 2.2 (except touch screen). Android 2.2 DOES NOT support dual core processor as I read from Android website. I am pretty sure that Android OS is using one core instead of the two cores.  Moreover, Android 2.2 OS is designed for Mobile systems. As such, many games or programs are not optimized for big screen like 7 inch. All these issues have been addressed for the next Android: Gingerbread version 2.3 including the support of many international languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. (I don't beleive the engineering team in the company turnned on the SMP which is already supported in Linux 2.6.)Even with this limitation, the tablet is surprisingly fast. Watching movies is more fun with this tablet. I can move from one scene to another scene within a movie without any tiny delay (more fun than my own laptop). I watched HD movie perfectly in this little daemon.Amazingly, this tablet has no limitation as specified by the company. I can plug my USB keyboard. I can use my external hard disk (it will only recognize ONE partition which must be FAT32). If you are familiar with Linux, you can plug any hard disk (of ANY SIZE) in this tablet using ext2 or ext3 filesystems. I am not sure why the company limited to 64GB USB. C'mon..this is Linux 2.6. It should be able to recognize any kind of filesystems including NTFS or external DVD.I do believe there is another bug in the software (by the engineering team) that it cannot support USB with exFAT (64GB). I don't have USB with 64GB, but i partitioned my hard disk with exFAT filesystem (I assumed that USB with 64GB has exFat FS). The tablet DESTROYED this partition. SO BECAREFUL, IF YOU HAVE 64GB USB, IT MAY CORRUPT YOUR USB.(Initially and for some unkown reason, my 4GB USB drive did not work (recognize). I checked the setting in the tablet and realized that the USB already mounted, but the file manager did not display any file. If this happen to you, unmount the USB from the tablet and then reconnect. It will work!!!).Be aware, attaching Hard disk will drain the battery dramatically. So, use it when the tablet is connected to the charger.The only limitations of this tablet with respect to me are built-in SD card and built-in camera. The camera is terrible. I have 1.3MP web cam which is much more better than eLocity 1.3MP camera.  The 4GB that comes with the tablet is only 1.6GB in my tablet. It means the engineering team partitioned the SD CARD and only 1.6GB can be used by us. If you have the tablet, then look at the setting under "SD and external storage".I am not a game player. But i like to watch movies, surfing web and reading books. If this is your target, then this tablet is perfect. If you like to play games in 7" or more, then this tablet is NOT for you.Overall, the design and hardware of this tablet are excellent (super mini notebook) but it really ruined by the lack of appropriate software to utilize the underlying hardware. For multi-touch, it is not a big issue as long as the touch screen is very responsive.The remaining text is related to my experience with customer support. I ordered my tablet from Amazon.com and I could not find the Value Pack as mentioned by the representative who post a review here or as in [...]. I sent my info to the customer support 4 days ago. They did not reply to me yet!!!Hope that my review complements the other reviews in this site.
As a representative of the company let me point out Amazon failed to note in their offer that the eLocity A7 includes an Amazon exclusive Value Pack which includes a 6 foot HDMI CABLE, USB A TO A CABLE (VERY HARD TO FIND AT RETAIL) THIS ALLOWS YOU TO CONNECT THE A7 TO YOUR PC VIA USB , AND A NAME BRAND LCD CLEANING SOLUTION AND MICRO FIBER CLOTH.  THIS VALUE PACK IS VALUED AT $60.
I was really hoping that this would be the tablet devise that I would keep for the next few years. I had high hopes, with the Tegra 2 Processor and impressive hardware. Sadly, this devise is crippled by its software. I don't mean Android, which I love, but the manufacturer's implementation of the software. Aside from the web browser, which works great - fast and responsive - all else has short comings. I attempted to load about 12 games and apps onto the devise, Angry Birds (didn't work), Homerun 3D (this one worked), one of those car race games (didn't work), Google Sky Maps (loaded, but didn't run), Monopoly 3d (didn't work), and a few others, and only about 20% of them worked on the devise. I also own the Huawei s7 and about 90% of those same apps worked on that devise. Considering that the specs on both devises are very similar, I can only think that this is a problem with Elocity's configuration of the Android software on its devise.  Video playback was ok, but it coudn't seem to handle (with Rockplayer) any of the 720p mkv files I had. And while I understand that mkv is a more demanding format, the devise is meant to handle 1080 mp4s, so this lack of smooth surprised me..... In fact, it played video just about as well as the Huawei devise with its underclocked Snapdragon processor. I am returning this item today, after one day of use. If the apps don't work, what's the point of having this devise. I hope they address these shortcomings in the software, as it was an otherwise appealing looking devise.Maybe Elocity will get this review, and make some changes... I'd be the first to volunteer to beta test, as I really wanted this American company's devise to be a success.
It's not vapor, it's real, and it's truly going to blow away anything at this price-point. It won't take the guys @ XDA very long to start supporting it either, and that will be truly worth the wait. I'm sure gingerbread will LOVE this tablet as much as anyone who purchases it. Can't wait to order for my girlfriend and I!!! Stop mucking up the reviews with your single star when the only thing bad you can seem to say about it, is that it hasn't arrived... you ought to be slapped cold hard.
First let me say if u have never had droid or evo galaxy s or ipod/iphone u might like this but if u have ever used ne of these don't even think of buying this u will want to throw it at the wall it does not have real multi touch it lags and goes to the wrong place win u try it also there are like no games it gives u a app store but almost none of the games work and if they do they look horrible adobe flash however works great better than my droid 2 but besides that the product sucks its slow and and really just sucks
I tried holding out for the longest when I ordered this product. To many stories of vaporware, change in design, screen resolution size, and version of android. But Amazon started selling the Galaxy Tab and I ended up buying that and have a tablet that's gonna have better support. Really I think right now Tegra 2 processors are ahead of their time for Android and would probably better if they did wait till ginhetbread came out.  But it sucks to have an order in and see it keep getting pushed back when more known brand names products are about to hit. I hope the Elocity don't get lost in the Android rush that will  be hitting next year. Had a lot of potential. Marketing, however, sucks.
Already months late, unless released in time for the holiday gift season, this device will die at the hands of more capable devices to be released Q1 of 2011. Too bad, I was excited to buy one in October. I may still if released in time.
I purchased this from Borders in the middle of September as a birthday present to myself. I had at the time also purchased the Pandigital Novel and compared them. Liked the Cruz so the Pandigital went back. I really enjoy the reader for what it is. However, I have to admit I find it somewhat difficult to do things other than read. I have had to do a hard reset because it crashed once. I have been unable to figure out how I can get it to download books from my local library. I also am very discouraged at reading the other reviews and finding everyone enjoying the Nook and Kindle apps. I have been totally unable to find them or add them to my reader. Velocity has given me a way to get the Nook by downloading the app from an Android phone but I don't have an Android phone and have no potential for getting one so I'm going to my mobile provider with an SD card and appealing to them for the app.I have had to uninstall and install the Borders app 2 times. I am not very tech savvy so I'm going to have Velocity walk me through the firmware update.With all this I will say Velocity customer service has been really great with me and working with me on the help. I still feel it's the best out there as evidenced by the reviews its just me having a hard time. Hope that I can find help.
I have read a lot of negative reviews of this device. However, as an ereader fan, I have a different perspective. This is an ereader, not a tablet. As an ereader device, what it is meant to do, it works very well. In addition, it is color and it is back lit. As a bonus, it has web browsing capacity. So, if you are looking for a good ereader that can do that, this is for you. On the other hand, too many individuals are in the market for a tablet device that also reads ebooks. You will want something else. In fact, to you I would say, "Buyer beware!". And, look elsewhere.
I am a huge gadget person. I own 3 Archos (605, 5 and 5IT), a Sony PRS-505, countless mp3 players, etc etc. For a while I wanted a reader that would allow me to read my extensive collection of comics and magazines and I sure found it on the Cruz Reader! The jury was still out for the first couple of days, but as I got more familiar with the workings of the Android platform, I became more comfortable with the working of the apps.I am fed up and tired of people lambasting this device because it does not work like an Ipad; it doesn't because IT IS NOT AN IPAD!!! I think that for $150 (when I bought it; now it is $110)it is a pretty decent machine. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because the Cruz is not as intuitive or as easy to navigate (yet) as other electronics that I own. What I do believe though, is that you get a lot for what you pay for.I have had no problem connecting the Cruz to my WiFi at home, checking emails, updating my Facebook or Twitters, navigating online, and most importantly, reading my books. Key apps to install: all the major booksellers (Borders, Kobo, Amazon, B & N), YouTube, Aldiko and FBJ Readers, ACV (Android Comic Viewer), Adobe Reader for Android, Beam Reader (also for PDF's) and whatever other apps depending on your lifesyle.All in all, I can say that I am extremely pleased with the product and plan to enjoy it for a long time to come.UPDATE 20-DEC-10: I had more chance to play with the Cruz and found out that the best Epub reader is Moon Reader, hands down. It can open documents straight from the SD Card (internal and external) without having to put the books on a special directory for the program to recognize them. Not only that, the Menu Options are mindblowing when compared to Aldiko and FBReader. So I have uninstalled those 2 apps and stayed with Moon Reader.So, as of today, these are the apps to have in addition to all the major booksellers:Comic Viewer: Android Comic Viewer (ACV)Epub Reader: Moon ReaderPDF Reader: Adobe Reader for AndroidAs I continue playing with the Reader, I will continue to update this review. The search is on now for the latest YouTube app.UPDATE 26-JAN-11: On the lookout for a PDF Reader with the ability to set bookmarks. I tried downloading "textr", but the tablet keeps telling me that there is insufficient space on the tablet, although I have deleted all unnecessary apps. Any sugggestions?UPDATE 21-APR-11: I gave up to the fantasy and got the tablet "poisoned", so it now runs the full Android Market. This has opened up a full new world for this device; now it runs 3x faster and it is much more responsive. I now have a $150 tablet that runs like a $600 Motorola Xoom. Am I pleased? Very!! However, a word of advice for the amateur hackers, like me; for this, please seek the assistance of a professional, otherwise you could risk bricking the tablet.
I really wasn't expecting much when I fell upon this at BestBuy. It was on sale as a bundle. I got a case, screen cover, and another 4gb's of memory on an SD card. The price was only 119.00. So, I thought it would probably be an item that I would return but no way! This thing is awesome. If you know a little bit about the Android market and can find your way around, this item is excellent. It's sold as a reader but c'mon, this item is clearly a WI-FI tablet. And it is excellent. Super quick screen orientation, nice color, tons of available applications...I only have one book on it. I use Yahoo IM and the web and it's worth every penny. No, it's not an Ipad. It's not as fast and the touchscreen isn't as quick or sensitive but I have tried other tablets, Archos, JooJoo, Viewsonic...and this secret little gem is better, at a fraction of the cost. You really need to consider this if you want a tablet for next to nothing. I can't believe Cruz calls this a reader! It's an Android monster and the only reason it doesn't get five stars: sometimes you have to touch a letter on the keypad again because it seems to want you to use a little force. Seriously, I love this device and you would be silly not to check it out! Ipad and Cruz don't know it yet, but Cruz is gonna' catch Apple. Then pass them and blow them away. Hard for me to say because I own two Apple computers and an Ipad but I am serious!
I was not expecting the quality to be much more than mediocre, especially for the price; however, I was surprised with a quality and functionality that far exceeded my expectations. If you are expecting a device that is equal to the iPad, this item is not what you need, but if you are looking for a fun device to do the basics and still have some room for expansion then I would highly recommend this device.
Ok, I bought this a couple days ago, so everything is pretty fresh in memory.  I did my due diligence, reading every review in this thread, otherwise I would have bought it outright.First thing to note, I did not buy it on Amazon, I bought it at Borders.  They have a great special going on, 169.99, so it's what made me make the leap.  A word of caution though, Borders has ZERO return policy.  They will exchange a defective unit in 30 days, or you can buy a 2 year replacement plan for $50 which covers accidental damage, at least that's what the person I talked to said.The return policy is another thing that made me squeamish from the get go and helped cause a delay for a few days.However, that's all the bad I have to say.As a reader it's the perfect size, not large like an iPad, pretty much the size of a large paperback.  Since it's android, it has the ability to run all kinds of apps.  Thus it's not just limited to a reader, with makes it extremely handy for multiple uses.  Though my pimary usage is going to be as a reader.My main concern from reading the reviews in this thread was being able to port my collection of ebooks on my computer onto this and to have them readable.  The key is the in apps.  Kindle, Barnes, Nook, and borders are most likely essential if you plan on buying a lot online.  I understood this going in, but already having a collection, made me concerned for getting things read from my personal collection which has a lot of epub and pdf.  I personally found Laputa and FBreader to be best for my personal taste, especially for epub files.I tried to find a good pdf reader, but I didn't have luck.  I heard about ICviewer, but haven't, as yet, had any luck locating it.  However, I downloaded a free app called Android File Manager, and it allowed me to find a file on my sd card, and then by clicking it, it allowed me to pick a file that would read it.  Lo and behold, the office suite that comes with the cruz reads pdf, and does it well.  There is a small amount of lag when loading a pdf page, but it's the best I've found so far.So overall, I give this little Cruz high rating.  I like what I have seen so far.  But again, as anything like this goes, it's all in the apps and finding the rights ones for you.
To begin with. This device is not especially user friendly to the casual computer user except maybe to those who know the android phone os. And even here it is often incompatible with some common android functions(ie android marketplace app downloads). For those seeking a user friendly experience, nothing beats the Ipad (I own two!) albeit for $400+.As a gadget lover I purchased this "E-Reader/Tablet" for just over $100 to experience an android tablet. I will skip over listing all the faults that others have already noted. My take is this.1)  The hardware is impressive. This does NOT feel like a cheap knock off.2) While the resistive touch screen is not Ipad-like....it is plenty usable once you get the hang of soft yet firm taps.3) Wi-fi performance is very good . Probably not as good as Ipad but very comparable to many other phones,laptops,internet radios,media streamers etc I have owned. Connecting to your network should be easy enough.4) This tablet will function fine as an E reader (B grade) music (B+) and video player (B or better).5) with regard to apps.....If you are persistent it does appear that most android apps WILL work on this device.I have installed Youtube(reqs specific version-works flawlessly!)) skyfire browser,kindle and numerous android utilities and games. Learning the tricks (net searchs, apk app downloads to sd card then install) will take a day or two for most.6) Very decent internet browsing ability! For "flash/video" just use skyfire browser...works most of time.7) Perhaps the biggest letdown will be the lack of storage space-you will be limited to choosing smaller app files and only your favorites (unless they can be run directly off an sd card??? not sure of this....)All in All. For just over $100 (with present discounts available) you get a decent E-reader. Media player. wifi internet browser.  These sub $200 tablets will become more user friendly and capable over time. But for now this a bargain tablet for those who like spending the effort to customize it.
Just got this Ereader and very happy with it. The only downside is...needs a better user guide. The screen works best with a stylus. Setting up Wifi and email was a breeze. Screen resolution is good. Speed good. Internet connection good. Remember people, this is NOT an Ipad. So please stop comparing it to an Ipad!!! If you are not good with computers or high tech things...then stick with a book.
I purchased this at Borders. At almost $300.00 including 2 year warranty I was ready to read and view videos. Well couldn't view the youtube link because it didn't have the proper upgrade from Velocity. I formatted an SD card as requested. Downloaded the upgrade from Velocity and all it did was freeze my screen. I emailed Velocity and got a reply to register with them which I did. Then I was told they would email to confirm registration. Days go by with no reply and then I get an email from them saying they were closing my ticket because they hadn't heard from me. Over a week later they still hadn't confirmed registration. Then downloading books from Borders: First book downloaded after a few tries but the 2nd book only downloaded about 30 pages. Still waiting for Borders to refund me on this. I took the cruz reader back to Borders for a refund. The cruz reader wouldn't calabrate so the touch screen was useless most times. I understand you can get a bad product from anyone but what gets me angry is the lack of service from Borders.com and Velocity. I would not buy anything electronic from either again.
Went to Borders last week (2 hour drive round trip for me) and the clerks could not get the unit to turn on; nor could they answer too many questions - actually they could only repeat what was on the little display card and nothing else.  One stated that the cruz reader definitely had access to Android Marketplace.  Non-working showcase model -10 points.This weekend we were back in that area and I stopped again at Borders.  This time they had a working model.  I went prepared with my own SD card for testing.  After power the unit on I had to redo the wi-fi connection to browse the internet.  It was quite slow but I don't know what setup Borders has.  Funny that the signal strength IN THE STORE was only 70% but I get no better around my house so...  I went to [...] and poked around and the browser seemed to work ok.The screen resolution seemed fine; I could make things out pretty good in the browser and the app fonts were legible.The touch screen was a NGIHTMARE.  I don't know much about the differences between resistive and capacitive screens but this screen required a HEAVY touch and a long touch.  You had to MEAN IT when you touched something on that screen.  I assume resistive is what I have on my 10 year old Dell PDA, but it responds quickly to a light touch.  I almost felt I had to poke the Cruz screen. EDIT when I wrote this I was assuming that the screen on this cheaper unit (vs. the "Tablet") was resistive because I had read such negative reviews of resistive touchscreens but according to the spec page at borders it's capacitive.  Go figure.Video- on my SD card I had 4 mp4 test files.  3 were AVC mp4's in Baseline, Main, and high.  Only the audio played on any of the 3 files.  The 4th was another mp4 (MPEG-4 (Divx4 simple@1) and that wouldn't play at all - error message that it couldn't play this type of video.  I also had an old .avi (xvid) file from years ago and it wouldn't load that either.  So far -50 for video playback.Audio (mp3) file seemed to play fine but speakers were very quiet.  Didn't bring headphones to test volume.PDF- seemed to work but I only had a standard PDF (meaning older) so I didn't test reflow or any such thing.  I only use PDF for manuals myself so it wasn't improtant.ePub - First the only ereader software on the device is the Borders app.  You MUST be signed into an account to read a book.  I didn't want to do that on a public device so I was SOL.  I used the file browser to navigate to the SD card and managed to use office tools to open a .txt file but I couldn't open any of my epub files (said it didn't recognize type epub - maybe a file association issue?).  I tried to open an ebook I had that was in HTML format but the browser only popped up an error message about opening the file.  Blah blah blah nothing seemed to work worth a darn.  And the Borders reader app (as I tested it on my pc) is so terribly featureless compared so Mobi Pocket reader on the Dell.It was SLOWWWWWWWWWW also.  Very slow to do something once you tapped an icon.  My OLD OLD PDA is faster loading apps and multiple apps to boot.  I'd never think about a device like this to replace my PDA if my PDA had a 7" screen.  My eyes are getting bad is the reason I was looking in the first place.  Well that an web browsing; the browser on the windows mobile 2003 device is terrible and outdated; besides scaling stinks.I was after a PDA replacement for reading books; watching movies, listening to tunes  and surfing the web.  maybe the Tablet is better but then again if little brother is such a putz....?  I walked out of the store and never looked back. Has I bought it I would have returned it and waited for something better.  Looking at getting an ARhos 101 (but Archos has their own inbred problems with treating the customer like a person)>Danneauxs
dont get me wrong the cruz is awesome,  but it needs instructions! it took my husband and i all day to figure out how to get a book to show up that i bought on line. i still cant figure out how to delete books i dont want.
The internet connection is fragile at the best of times... like when downloading. The resolution is great. Understanding how to access all the goodies - hard to understand. Battery life - unfortunate. I know I purchased this right away and it will take time for  the info to catch up, but, I think the availability of a source of documentation should have been in place. Willing to wait and see. Reading Borders. Reading Kindle. Having fun fooling around. Want an extra battery - don't know where to find one, want more consistant internet connections.
Received Cruz eReader today. Initial setup was easy; wifi and email setup easy; over all quality was classy and sturdy. Then problems started: Got email quickly but opening email hung unit up; when I tried access to regular website frequently visited it hung up again; then the whole OS froze. Everything I tried, pushing on/off button, touching every icon at top of the screen did nothing. So I contacted [...] for support, 51 minutes later I got the tech. Had to remove back of unit to unplug battery; did this three time but the unit never did turn on again. I was really looking forward to having a reader with wifi capability. Problem with online hang ups was Droid's OS problem with Flash ....this conclusion by service tech. Only workaround was to get a "beta" app that helped to resolve the problem with Flash. Purchased from HSN, but TV Ad said nothing about Flash incompatibility. Returning it tomorrow!
I got one of these for my birthday!It was not working correctly and after calling the customer service we were told it may or may not work as advertised, there is nothing they can do. (we installed everything exactly the way the instructions prompted, it would not play videos and the audio books didn't work either, not to mention the nook and kindle app one supposedly can install.) We told them we had problems with other apps being unresponsive and were told not their problem.Most of the apps one can get fro free won't install, or if they do they lock up or give you a "stopped working" error.I am most bummed out that the customer service really did not seem to care. They had a snippy attitude and basically told us we were SOL. I felt like I got left out to dry.I am going to send it back tomorrow! I am out the shipping costs, not to mention what I paid for the apps in an attempt to make it work! Money down the drain! Hard earned money!If you ask me... not worth the hassle!
I'm very happy with the Cruz Micro e-reader and I'm only interested in it as an e-book reader. Now that that's out of the way...I first went to the site [...] which has support for the reader and updated the firmware . According to the FAQ on the site some Android apps are compatible with the Cruz e-reader including the Kindle app and the Nook app, so I tried to download and install them. What a exercise in frustration! I finally called the support line and after about 10 minutes I was talking to a native English speaking individual. After describing my problem I was informed that yes, the Cruz is indeed compatible with some Android apps including the Kindle app. However...you can't download and install them without some serious work at finding a site from which to download them. The Kindle app and the Nook app are not available on the Cruz app store...yet, they are on the Android app store, but you can't download and install them from the Android app store to the Cruz e-reader. IOW you can use them if you can find them!! The gentleman on the phone was very helpful and provided me with the sites to find the necessary apps but that should not have been necessary. The Cruz reader support site should have expanded on the fact that you cannot easily find and download them to use on the Cruz e-reader and is very misleading about how easily they can be downloaded and installed. I now have the Nook app, the Kindle app, and the Borders app.On the plus side the Cruz e-reader was pretty easy to get networked with my home Wi-Fi even with the router using WPA-2 PSK and Mac address filtering. Discovering how to find the Mac address can be a bit challenging and seems rather unduly convoluted.All in all this reader is definitely worth the [...] we paid for it when it was on sale.
I just received two of the three I ordered for Christmas gifts. It was partially charged and gave me enough time to get the Kindle App on and TuneIn App and a youtube clone that allows you to save videos. Video quality seemed good to me. The sound is a little low but not tinny. I'm sure headphones work better or speakers. Seems like a great little device. Had no trouble setting up wifi - and since a Droid user am familiar with the way it is set up with the Android operating system. Cruz store sucks - so recommend that you use try [...] android to find apps to download from your browser. You will need to adjust the text but it is easy to download from and has a lot more applications available. Thanks to another reviewer who provided the above link - just want to make sure everyone sees it!
The Cruz Reader is just that, a e-book reader. It is not a I Pad clone. It operates on the android 2.0 operating system but is not really meant to be used as a tablet. On the plus side, it has Wi-fi and you can surf the web and download apps from the Cruz market. On the negative side, the touch-pad is resistive touch which demands a firm push on the screen. I Pad and the Samsung Android clone, use capacitive touch which only requires a light finger tap. Again, this is a E-book reader, and in this area you can't beat the price. It comes with Border books app and you can download the Barnes& Noble e-book app, as well as the Amazon Kindle app. There is also an app for e-pubs, so you can get e-books from your local library. the battery last about 10-12 hours for reading books, which is great for plane trips... but the battery doesn't last anywhere as long as a dedicated nook reader or like device.
I am passionate about ereaders.  I started with the original Sony, then got a nook and now have an ipad.  I have also used a Kindle, so I know what great quality ereaders have as their main features.I love my ipad, but it is larger then ideal for reading books.  I am a very visual person though and the benefits of being able to scroll through my books by looking through their covers and also being able to view a book with two pages side by side, more then make up for its larger size.  The touchscreen is also so responsive, that it you forget you are not reading a paper book.I thought a smaller version would be wonderful for when my husband takes my ipad traveling.  I must admit, I got overly excited when I saw the cruz reader and bought it right when it became available.  It does have a nice backlit screen.  That is where my compliments stop.  The screen has to be gently pushed to recognize the commands and loading your own books sucks!!!  I compounded my mistake by buying mine through Borders (I didn't think Amazon would carry it) and Borders will not let me return it.So I will sell it on ebay and take the loss after only having it for 2 weeks.  I can't be more honest then that...I will take a $50 hit plus the sales fees to get rid of it because I dislike it so much.  If you have owned one of the other mainstream readers, stay away.  You will be constantly comparing it to them and finding it lacking.
After using the Cruz reader for a couple of weeks, I decided to return it. I liked the product but it needs a lot improvement. I feel this product was rush to the market by VM. If MV can improve these issues they will outsell other brands.Bad: No pdf readers, unresponsive touch screen, slow wifi, and little heavy.Good: great screen size, great price.
The thing's whole purpose in life is to connect via Wifi.  The wifi radio is the weakest thing I have ever seen, literally indicating a "poor" connection while RIGHT NEXT TO my wifi router.It is completely useless and I returned in within 24 hours.
I bought one for my daughter for her birthday.  The unit couldn't stay online.  NOT the Android Market!  The resistive touch screen is a pain.  It's not that great of a unit.  Returned unit!
I don't want to waste my time to write about a garbage, so be straight and simple. I have to touch with foot and million times to get a response and, in landscape position, when I type "L", I get a "P", "BackSpace" get a "L". Yes I did screen calibration which is another nightmare - had to press the 5 dots million times to get it through and then no difference at all.I've been using resistive touch screens for more than 15 years, so don't blame me for not knowing how to touch.Other than the touch part, it is a very good unit - very good building quality, very long battery life. Unfortunately it's a touch device and touch does not work.I thought there might be a new firmware that fixing the issue. I went to the site, but it forced me to register first to be able to see anything new. No thank you, I wont waste my time to register and give out my personal info to such idiots.The biggest problem among all is the erratic double-touch-to-zoom in web browser. I have to double touch millions of times to finally get a zoom. Web pages load too slowly, my Android phone loads much faster. And wifi takes a long time to connect and then keeps dropping.No, I did not get a defective unit because the display model in Borders does exactly the same and it has been updated to the new firmware just yesterday.If you want to get a feel on how bad the touch is, watch some video found in youtube etc. You'll see how many times they have to type 2 or 3 times to get a response. Or search "Three major problems with Cruz Reader" in youtube.
I found it difficult to get up and running.  I had to ask my computer savy son to do it.  It took a couple of hours to figure it out.  The book reader is cumbersome.  You have to touch really hard to change the page.  Today (day 2) the screen is frozen.  Velocity support page does not help.  Even following the instructions in the manual to go to a specific web page did not work.  I want to return this.
The keyboard was off by about a half an inch. By this I mean, when you press a key, you had about a 20% chance of the correct letter or symbol appearing, and that includes the space bar and the backspace key. "Impossible" does not even begin to describe the level of difficulty presented by this keyboard.I thought maybe it needed the oft-mentioned firmware update- nope. After 20 minutes not only was the keyboard still not fixed, the entire device was locked and frozen. I just want to read ebooks, not spend an hour a day on maintenance for this stupid thing.I wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy. It is flat-out, absolute, unadulterated garbage.
The Cruz Reader is a piece of junk. It is very good at randomly erasing SD cards; it is unresponsive and buggy, and Android 2.0 will not be upgraded by Velocity so you have a brick very soon after you pull it out of the box. Mine died after a week, so I returned it, but the battery charged. Yeah!.

 Length:: 3:25 MinsThis is a video demo and testing of the Archos 43 - 16 GB Internet Tablet. Overall, I am very happy with its improvements over the Archos 5 IT. I have also changed the rating to a 5 stars after updating the OS to Android 2.2 with the Adobe Flash 10 player installed. This gadget rocks !12/21/10 update- I have been using this gadget on a daily basis since my original post for checking emails and surfing the web for news in the morning while still lying lazy on my bed. So far so good and it has replaced my iPhone for such use as it is lighter and has a wider display for full web-site surfing. The only issue I have is the short battery life which I have to circumvent by disabling the Wifi when not in use.Overall feel and handlingThe unit is extremely light and fits easily in a shirt pocket. It is much more portable than the Archos 5 IT and even the i-Phone. The single-touch resistive screen works quite nice also. I also noticed that the camera has a small clear plaster cover on it which should be removed for better recording.OS and applications12/01/10 Update- Updated OS to Android 2.2 ! This gadget is a lot more stable and works faster after the update. We would need to reinstall the latest Google Marketplace app from the Archos fans site as the previous version does not work with Android 2.2. The Adobe Flash 10 player would also needed to be installed (from the Google Market place) in order to view flash videos from the websites.Archos 5 used to have an application called Thinkfree office installed which allowed us to view PDF, excel, and word document. I am not able to find this same application on the Archos 43. However, this application and the Adobe viewer could be downloaded from the Google Markletplace.  Do some research on the Archosfans website and you would be able to get the instructions on installing the Marketplace app.Video and displayThe display is very nice and sharp. In the demo video, I also showed a side-by-side comparison between an i-Phone and the Archos 43. The display area for the Archos 43 is 32% larger than an iPhone. Whereas the Archos 5 IT has a 65% larger display area over the iPhone with its 4.8" screen. Even though the display area is not much larger than the iPhone, the viewing experience is notably different. The video camera recording is of average quality. It does OK in well lighted area but the video is pretty grainy under poor lighting conditions. I also found some issues with the Amazon's Kindle viewer. The right side text was chopped off by the menu bar.SoundThe external speaker is much better than the Archos 5 IT and produced much more sound in comparison.WiFi and internet connectionThere are major improvements in the Wifi connection as I experienced no trouble connecting the WiFi to my home wireless network. This was the most annoying problem I had with the Archos 5 IT.BatteriesCharge time is much better than the Archos 5 IT. Took about 2-3 hours for a full charge. It lasts for about 2-3 hours of constant uses. If we leave the Wifi on, it seems to drain the battery charge  rather rapidly. I did another benchmark testing by playing only video with the external speaker at 50% volume. It ran for a good 6-7 hours on a full charge.It uses a standard micro-USB cable for connection to the PC.Overall, I am quite pleased with this gadget particularly its light weight and larger screen size than my iPhone.
The Archos 43 has a very sensitive screen for a resistive screen. You don't need to use your fingernail or a stylus. All in all a very nice device. I have to say after having the 43 for several days now I'm very happy with it. I have tried the HDMI out and it is excellent, no choppy playback and the audio quality is excellent with some samsung earbuds. Battery life is good, the wifi is good and the bluetooth is excellent. The camera isn't bad. I have paired it with a GPS and you can tether it to a phone of you want a mobile connection. And there is already an 3rd party app that allows you to use the Android app store. When Android 2.2 is released for it browsing with flash will be great.
The Archos 43 is near impossible to get. I was incredibly lucky to stumble upon it on amazon. It is fabulous. You don't realize it's true beauty until you actually get to see it in person. The screen is about the size of the whole ipod touch. It is huge! However it is not too big because it easily fits in your pocket. The kickstand is very nice, I ended up using it a lot more than I thought I would. One problem is that it does not come with the google marketplace out of the box, and the app store that comes on it is really bad. However doing a few searches for google market place on Archos 43 will show you how to put it on very easily. Once it is on there are a few slight problems, the calender app doesn't work. Also the icons on the side of the screen (search, home, settings, and back) don't ever go away in non-archos apps. So occasionally this will cut off the bottom of apps but this never causes any major problems. Doodle jump is one app that is a little bit strange. It still works great but the score is cut off on the top and in order to press a button on the home screen you must click below it. However everything else still works. Sometimes the Archos will freeze up for 5 seconds but this is rare. The video playback is spectacular, it plays so many different types of video. Also the screen makes watching videos look so much better. The Music app that comes on it is nice but nothing special. However the speakers are very loud, much louder than my LG Dare. If you are considering an ipod touch because it is easier to sync with iTunes. This is true it is much easier to sync with iTunes but there is an application for your computer called DoubleTwist that can sync iTunes with your android device and it works very well. This device is a lot better than an ipod touch if you are tired of all of the restrictions Apple has put on their products. You can sync the Archos 43 with any computer! Also videos are much easier to put on! On your computer the Archos 43 appears like a hard drive so you can actually view and add things to it very easily. If you have any questions I can answer them.
I was looking strictly for a portable media player, something that was NOT also my cell phone. What I found in this device is one of the best PMPs I've ever used - including the widest range of supported audio and video formats - and as a bonus, it's also a great little internet tablet.  You're not going to write your dissertation on this.  But for reading email, checking the weather/facebook/etc., even online shopping, it's perfect.  I've also found it a very comfortable, easy-to-use ereader.As a PMP, loading and organizing files is easy.  For videos, the 4.3 inch 16x9 screen is a great improvement over other "i" competition (even compared to the latest high-resolution version).  For music, navigating and creating playlists is no problem.I gave the device 4 stars for features (5 stars for all else) for two reasons. The first reason: I'd like to be able to tag songs for playlists (similar to iTunes Smart Playlists).  For instance, add "90's" to songs I like best from the 1990's and create a playlist that would play just those. The second reason is that it does not come with the Android Market installed.  The installed AppsLib from Archos is OK, but Market is better.  It can be sideloaded (and the APK file is easy to find), so it's not a big deal!
I actually bought this device from Best Buy, but I've loved it so much I've decided to review it.  I've had this device for two weeks now and they've just put out the firmware upgrade to Android OS Froyo v2.2.1.  This device is very competitively priced when compared with other devices such as the iPod touch and the Zune.  The coolest thing is how you can set up your email and have it auto-notify you when it comes to your mailbox.Sound quality and compatibility is excellent.  I haven't tried the HDMI output, yet though.  3d games work great with little or no lag.  I have no complaints about wireless reception.  Its pretty good quality.  Also, there's quite a few things that are automatic and are handled for you, but if you wish, you can turn them off in the settings (e.g. automatic typing suggestions).Since the software is open source, there is so much more freedom when it comes to applications and development.  Android market is available, but must be downloaded to the device and then run from the File explorer application.  Just google "android market archos 43" and it should appear.Also, for those who wonder about flash, it is compatible but they are working on making it certified.  This means that Adobe and Google are working to make it as compatible and nearly as fast as on a normal computer.  Its currently in its testing/development phase, but they are getting closer all the time.
I originally bought a Samsung ivory colored netbook from the store about a year ago. I can't recall the model but something similar to this one. But within a day I spilled a couple teaspoons of water into it and the key started malfunctioning. I also didn't like that other model because it came with this odd program that was really a nuisance as well I think it was called Hyper-something. (Sorry if some of the details are fuzzy! Bought it a year ago and only had that other netbook less than week.) I quickly returned it and did some more research and found this the Samsung NB30. It is shock resistant up to 30 inches and also water resistant up to something like 30cc as long as you wipe the liquid away immediately.I LOVE it. I have had it almost a year and it has been great. No major problems. And I have definitely dropped it and man-handled it a bit. It is also so light and easy to use. One of the things I especially like about it coming from having previously owned two Dell notebooks and two Acer notebooks is the screen and the speakers. On my old notebooks they all had a terrible problem with glare and I hated that. In addition, the most recent Dell notebook I owned had the worst speakers. I could barely hear my music playing unless I used headphones. My cell phone speakers were louder than the Dell! The NB30 has great sound quality. And it comes with Windows 7 which is miracle compared to Windows Vista. It also has an SD slot which has been useful and three USB slots.So one of the drawback is because this model is shock resistant for some reason the battery life is slightly less than other comparable models of Samsung maybe 6.5 hours versus 7 hours. I wish the battery was as long as some Asus models but the sleek design and durability totally make up for the lack of battery. Also, the screen is a bit small. Some of my netbook user friends have mentioned going for a models with bigger screens but I was in it for portability and durability. Lastly, the video streaming on NB30 is not great and I blame the ATOM processor. (Almost all netbooks have this processor. You can't avoid it.) This processor is not the fastest but it's so light and uses so little battery that one sacrifices speed instead. To make up for this I upgraded the RAM to 2G. (It's only expandable up to 2G. Too bad!) Cost maybe $50 to upgrade. Prob less now. This helped a bit. But the netbook is great for simple word processing, surfing the net, and doing my slide show presentations. I love how light it is so I can easily take it to class. It weighs less than most of my books and I often don't need the power cord which is convenient since many of my 3 hours classes are held in rooms without readily available outlets. I also purchased an external Samsung cd drive so that I can use and burn cds with my netbook. I haven't used it yet but will in the future.
Initially I bought a Cruz Reader which was not exactly friendly because of the touch screen. As soon as the Tablet came out I returned the reader and got the tablet.1- It is an excellent ereader with many more additions2- Video playing is very good, it accepts AVI as well as other formats3- WIFI a access is very good4- Access to Facebook, twitter, browsing the web, etc.. are a very nice plus for a traditional ebook readerFor me this is a very good product for travelling. It is a great ereader, plus you can watch videos,listen to music  and have access to the web and games.I would not compare the Cruz Tablet to the Ipad. They are different products for different markets. For what I was looking for I am very satisfied and I paid half the price than an IpadA nice feature is that you are NOT tied to Border books, I installed a Kindle reader and now I have access to the Kindle library which is very extensive. You can also shop around to compare prices on ebooks. I could not make the BN reader to work yetRegarding the apps, if you search around a little you can find many apk free, such as google maps ( no gps), games, youtube,email clients, etc. Some of the applications can not be installed since it is based on android 2.0 but I was not expecting the Cruz to be a full tablet since the beginning.For me this is a very good ereader with many PLUS benefits.I would have liked the possibility of upgrading to android 2.1 or 2.2, but the information says it is not possible
I bought this because I'd done a bunch of research on tablets and saw a lot of hype and anticipation over the release of the Cruz Tablet.  Then I saw Best Buy drop it's price by $50 -- OMG.  So I jumped at it.There are a couple of positives about it:1  It looks nice.  I doesn't look cheap or cheesy like some of the other tablets.  The lines are clean and the controls are where you'd expect them.2  Battery life is awesome.  I pretty much played with mine for 3 days, almost non-stop.  I only had to charge it twice.Other than that, I can't think of much that was good enough to comment on.Now for the negatives:1  CRUZ Market.  It's a joke.  The apps are provided by a freeware site, not affiliated with CRUZ in any way.  About 75% of the "apps" are web based apps -- not standalone.  The one app that is available from CRUZ (YouTube) is only available if you go to their support web site and download it onto a desktop computer first.  I attempted to D/L it from within the CRUZ tablet -- it failed.2  MIPS CPU.  Most other Androids use an ARM CPU.  The MIPS CPU in this means several things: a  Hacking it is nearly impossible (You can _never_ get Android Market because it depends on shared libraries that are for an ARM only  b) You will _never_ see an upgrade to Android 2.1, 2.2, or 3.0.  c) that also means you'll never have Flash.  d) can you say "slow?"3  Memory size.  The documentation is misleading (to me anyway).  I thought there was an internal 4GB SD card and an external 8GB SD card.  There is only one SD slot and both cards are external.  If you need to swap the cards, you have to quit all the applications that depend on any data on the current card, or you risk corrupting your card.  Not all the applications have a "quit" option, so you need to get a 3rd party app the will kill other apps.4  The screen.  There are several things I don't like about the screen.  It's not responsive.  For a capacitive screen, it sure acts like it's resistive.  Even if you're careful and use just your pinky nail, you can frequently select the wrong thing.  It's said to be glass... but I'm guessing it has a polycarbonate laminate so it scratches just like all the others.  And fingerprints... don't even get me started.5  Weight. I'm sure the battery capacity is because it's packed with batteries.  Compared with other tablets with similar battery life, this thing is a load.  It's thick too.  These two make it uncomfortable to hold for any length of time.6  No extras, No accessories.  It has no camera, no GPS.  There's a microphone so you can leave yourself voice messages, but skype doesn't work... so the microphone is pretty worthless.  The speakers are horrible.  Either they're not loud enough to hear, or they're over-driven (distortion).  There is a dock port... but no dock.7  USB.  They say the storage is expandable via USB.  The USB here is one way.  This is a rather lame complaint as there aren't many devices that have dual purpose USB ports.  But I read into this that I could connect my external 2TB USB drive.  You can't.8  File formats/File browser.  There are very few file formats that it understands.  MPEG isn't one of them.  If  you have anything in MPG or MPG2 format, you'll need to transcode it first into something it recognizes.  The file browser isn't any help when trying to load files it doesn't understand.9  SMB/CIFS -- Nope... doesn't have it.  It has NFS, but there isn't any way to configure NFS mount points.  And really... who set's up an NFS share on their desktop or laptop?  It would be nice to be able to remotely share the documents on your desktop/laptop without having to load them on an SD card, or D/L them using a USB cable.10  Video is horrible.  Even though you can get YouTube from the CRUZ support web site, it's not worth having.  Playback in the YouTube app is choppy at best.  Most of the time, I'd see a blank screen and hear the audio.  The app isn't fully functional because you're missing google provider services and extensions.  Playback of local videos are choppy, studderish, sometimes out of audio/video sync.11  Photos. If you wanted to use this as a very expensive E-Photo-Frame... I'd reconsider.  The CPU power necessary to convert a 10MP picture to fit on the screen is more than this CPU has.  Hence, transitions are even worse than it's video playback.All-in-all, I was disappointed.  There are a bunch more things I could have ranted about.  In then end, I regretted spending the $250 this cost.  I was thankful that BestBuy was willing to take it back without charging me a restocking fee... although I was willing to part with the 10% - 15% fee I was expecting to pay.UPDATE (12/20/2010):At the time of writing the above review, when I attempted to access the "CRUZ Market" (or freewarelovers.com) from the Cruz Tablet, I found the number of apps to be disturbingly few.  Today, when I access freewarelovers.com from my PC, I see there are many of the apps I was interested in getting.  And... it appears the apps can be D/Led to the PC and side loaded using a USB cable or SD card.  As I no longer have, the Cruz Tablet, I can't verify that these apps will actually load or run.  I also can't determine if these apps are "browsable" from the Cruz Tablet.  But... I can see there are about 1500 android apps on freewarelovers.com including kindle, skype, and various other tools I spent my 3 days searching for.UPDATE (3/31/2011):To those who feel the need to post insulting comments based on the information in the above review:The facts presented in the above review were true to the best of my knowledge as of the date the review was written.  Many things have changed in the "World of Android" since that time.  While I have kept informed about the "World of Android" in general, I have not followed the progress of the CRUZ tablet that I reviewed.  If you have information about changes that might help a prospective customer make a knowledgeable decision about buying a CRUZ tablet, I would invite you to post that information in a reply here, or in your own review.UPDATE (11/7/2011):Based on a response from one of the people who has replied to this review, I have seen the Cruz Tablet at a very reasonable price point -- $69.  I believe the Cruz tablet is worth significantly more than that.  As one person pointed out, at this price, you can buy a bunch and give them to your kids at Christmas.  At the time I purchased the tablet (a year ago), there were a number of issues I had with a it.  Velocy Micro has addressed many of those issues.  In the above review, I indicated that the OS would never be upgraded.  This was based on information directly from VM.  Since then, VM has posted an upgrade to Android 2.2 -- a significant improvement.  While there are tablets out there, and more coming that will have more features, better battery life, and maybe a better price/performance ratio, this tablet is still a pretty good buy.  It is certainly very durable.If on the other hand, you feel the need to post insulting comments.... BITE ME!
I have had the reader now for 2 weeks. I was able to add kindle (from FREEWARE LOVERS .com)slideme marletplace (from cnet downloads) alkido books and several games..As a traveling companion its excellent..plays clear movies and music..You can buy movie in ipod format from moviedir.com..they play fine and dont take up alot of card space.Directions leave much to be desired.. Any android tablet would be for someone with computer abilitys..Android is a telephone format that has been adapted to tablets.because of this some downloads dont work..Tablets are being denied access to the android market by google..and possibly android updates.Long car rides, my wife can play solitaire or packman..It won't play angry birds or do live wallpapers..Ive got 6 hrs of battery life playing movies on the plane..
I bought this have had had it for a couple days.  Overall it's a great reader with some extras.  I have a 30 day return policy and I'm still arguing with myself if I want to return this or not.  I would suggest if you are going to buy this buy it from a place that has a 30 day return policy and you can easily get your money backPro'sGood reader (day/night mode)Borders app installed (I am partial to Borders)nice email applicationGood web access(see cons regarding youtube/flash).great touch screen, very responsiveGood customer service via phone and email (sucks I had to call and email)expandable memory up to 32 GB, comes with 4 GB and 8 GB SD cardWireless NI usually get 10-15 hours of battery life split between reading, movies, music, websurfing etc.Plays movies, need to convert them from whatever you have movies as on your PC to MPEG 4Great price for what it does, from my research it's the best under 300.00 thing out there that calls itself a tablet.  However if you want the full PC experience and don't want an IPAD suggest you wait for something other than the Cruz and be willing to fork over more cash.con'sNo 3GNo youtube or flash, even the free flash app doesn't work great, has an add watermarked over the video.  The skyfire (skyfire.com) web browser offers a better video experience but still nothing like Windows.No access to Android MarketCruz market has as many apps as I can count on my handsAndroid 2.0 OS with no intention to upgradeHad to reset it 3 times my first 2 dayNo user manual you can find it online, or download the manual to your tabletCan not get the Kindle app installed for whatever reason. I use Borders however I am writing a reveiw on Amazon so figured Kindle maybe important to some peopleIt's a weird hook up to your PC.  I still have XP and you have to plug in the tablet then on the tablet click a "Mount" button.  The PC does not automatically recognize the device.No accessories yet.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I preordered the Cruz Tablet thinking that Android 2.1 would be installed (As Advertised) and it would perform well. The unit comes with Android 2.0 installed. The apps and network connection are extremely slow and froze at times.  The recorder application was not installed. Flash does not work--No YouTube or anything else that uses flash. The technician with Velocity Micro technical support was courteous and informative. The technician worked with me looking for solutions. The result was the tablet operating system is NOT going to be updated, they do not know where the recorder app is, flash cannot be installed and Velocity is already working on a replacement for this Tablet (Remember that I just received this direct from the warehouse once they were drop shipped from China). I was told there would be a 15% RESTOCKING FEE. The technician was extremely honest and stated that they released the product before it was ready. I will send it back and take the 15% hit just to get rid of this paper weight! Unfortunately, I will not trust any products from Velocity Micro due to this unfortunate experience.
and the Velocity tablet supplied it. Color, browser capabilities, email, Facebook, Twitter. I wasn't expecting an iPad, didn't need one I have a laptop that works just fine but it's a little bulky for everyday travel. Waiting at the doctors, riding in the car, suffering with a bit of insomnia, I've got books, games and apps to keep me busy all wrapped in a small, easy to carry package.
I thought that I was upgrading from an Augen 74 tablet, but this is pretty much the same thing:  Another Android tablet without Market or Flash support.  Spoke with Velocity Micro and was told by the representative that he would like to provide support, but has been directed to advise that none will be provided.  The device has a nice feel, a capacitive touch-screen, and long battery life, but that's about it.  The action sensors are too easily activated,  and the Wi-Fi regularly hangs up, sometimes for over a minute. (That does not happen on my Gentouch74 on the same network.)  Worst part of the deal for me is that Sears will not refund my purchase without charging 15% "restocking fee", so I'm stuck.  Granted, if I'd found a review similar to this one beforehand, I would likely have not bought the device.  It was nice that to learn that Velocity Micro was up-front about their plans to not provide upgrade support, and that really is a shame, because this device has great promise.
Evaluated this as a gift for xmas 2010.  First time on a tablet.  I am generally a strong PC user and was interested in seeing what value I might get from a tablet.  Evaluated for:BROWSING WEB:  Perhaps there are websites that have or will have custom interfaces for tablets, but I couldn't find them yet.  So hard to browse in a font size 6.  I have big fingers, so a capacitance touch means missing the mark and going somewhere else unwanted 25% of the time.  The double tap to zoom in they suggest helps, but some sort of active touch is really a required feature to make a small screen browser work - and they don't have it.  Also I kept waiting and waiting for updates to show.  This is the same wireless I use that updates in seconds on the laptop but takes anywhere from 20 to 40 seconds on this tablet.FILE ACCESS:I opened the user guide in a pdf form.  Ok.  But I could read/scan an entire page in 6 point font faster than the next page would load.  I really am impressed on how it's so slow.  Seems like file transfers, save open are ok to manage.MOVIES:I tried to access Amazon videos and Hulu, where I get movies.  But they are all flash driven which will never be supported on this device.  I read that 780p will run, barely, if you have the formats supported.  Hulu would not even deal with Android, but showed a message they were working on a solution.  So perhaps in the future?Email:Other than webmail services, can't see anyway to access my standard pop3 account.Microsoft Office:They advertise a viewer with no edit/print/etc functionality.  I suppose a viewer is good now and then.APPs:I'm not a social network person - don't have the time.  So I did not try the installed apps out to see what's up with these interfaces.  Could not access the apps store in ten minutes trying, so gave up.E READER:I did not connect to the Borders APP.  My impression from research is that it works.  I'm not sure how big the library is, but I read that people can eventually connect with Amazon.  I also concur battery life is days - good.  But then they are competing with kindle that goes for weeks.SUMMARY - I think this is an eREADER product with sufficient battery life.  It would double as an inefficient social network and browsing tool.  For most other uses, if you put any value on your time, clearly the CRUZ would be dominated by other leading tablet products.  Eventually I think there will be more easily found mainstream online video solutions to use this to view videos - but not today.  This is a short term throw-away product for probably every function but eReader and torturous browsing as improvements in the user experience and cost of the alternative tablet products in about 8 months will make continuing usage of the device impractical.
My son had a Christmas gift wish list, on it was and IPAD.  Money is tight, budget wouldn't allow it, so I found you get what you pay for!  Very frustrating, extremely time consuming and a complete disappointment to my son on Christmas day.  Please, stay far, far away from this product!
OK. From what I could find, as far as reviews go, on the Internet, about this unit, the little available was basically worthless for making any kind of informative opinion as to whether this item would be a good buy.So, after researching what I could of the various Android OS Internet Tablets out there (most with terrible reviews of hardware issues), and considering the purchase price, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the Coby unit. I was at first leary of buying something of this nature which is made by Coby, a manufacturer of basically cheap, low end electronics.I purchased this unit (K-Mart, $149.95(save $30) in 12/12/10 - 12/19/10 AD - I also bought an additional year replacement contract for under $18 - a good idea on new electronics!), and immediately plugged it in to charge the battery (it notified of full charge after 1-1/2 hours). I decided to play with the unit a little, since I could not resist. I will say, I was impressed with the quality of the unit, it seems very sturdy and well built. It powered up fine and I found it very easy to navigate thru the functions (both on screen and the case side buttons). Of course, I recommend that you visit coby.com and download the manual in PDF format (as I did several days ago).Now, as far as the touch screen, it functions excellent in my opinion. None of the quirks other mention about this unit or other units being sold. And forget about HAVING to use yor fingernail or the stylus to select or scroll. It works great with my finger tip, better than even the stylus. I admit, the finger swipe method to scroll thru lists or menus takes a bit of practice, but that may be only me, because I have never used a touch screen device of this type before. Oh, and the actual look of the screen (800x480 TFT), very nice. Again, better than expected. Enough about that. It just works.Setting up a wireless connection was simple and effortless (using my own home wireless connection). Surfing the Internet was easy too, once you get used to seeing "mobile device formatted" versions of web pages. All my favorite web pages loaded quickly (I mean fast) and problem free. (For those interested, even Facebook loads and works fine - I tried it). The Ap for Youtube works great as well. Youtube videos load as fast as my desktop PC and of all the 10 or more that I tried, they played without any delay, chopping or buffering. Way better than I expected.Using the Email AP, I very quickly set up a POP3 account and sent and received messages effortlessly (all verified).File transfers to and from my PC went smooth, using the included USB cable (to the Coby's internal 4GB memory - I have yet to buy a mini SD expansion card).The included Ebook reader works perfectly too.And, the built in accelerometer works nice. The screen will automatically change from portait and landscape mode, with only perhaps a 1 second delay. (The screen self-rotates 360 degrees - upside down, etc).The only thing I can mention, which was not expected, is that when you go to the Apps Library onine for additional Aps, many are listed, and listed as free too. But when you choose them (all that I tried) and download them, the start up screen for the Ap gives mention that you can purchase it or continue with 15 day free trial. To me, that is called "limited shareware", not a Free Ap! Perhaps some are indeed free, but I did not bother to search thru the hundreds and hundreds offered, and there is no advance way to know if they ARE indeed free. I am not really an AP person, so none of that really matters to me. The unit does, as it is, what I expected and bought it for, and it does it well.*One note. If you purchase one of these, there is a firmware update on Coby's site, with a Youtube instruction video as well. You WILL need a mini SD card (8Gb or less in size) to install the update file onto first, as the update takes place in the Coby unit itself (from the memory card). (I have not yet done this, but will next week). After this update, the site states that the unit will show even better performance.Battery life is stated to be 7 hours (we will see), with it's rechargeable 3200 mAh battery (a larger capacity than most other brand tablets).That is my experience with this unit. I purchased it for the small, light form factor (no more clunky laptop), the wireless Internet, Email function, Reader and MP3 player, things I use often on the move (outside on lunch break at work, in bed at night or anywhere in the house or workplace, etc), but hate being tied to a power cord or a heavy laptop. So far, it has shown to serve this purpose with flying colors. (Some people have cellphones to do these tasks, but I hate cellphones and believe they are the leading cause of added stupidity in this country).Included is a vice semi-hard protective case, wall charger, ear buds, USB Host cable (for thumb drives, mouse, etc) and a USB transfer cable to connect to a PC or laptop.I realize I have not covered everything pertaining to this unit, but I wanted to post a good and a truly honest review for prospective buyers. I hope it will be of help to someone.I love it and look forward to being productive with it. Merry Christmas to me!
The problem most negative reviewers have here, is what so many others run into before buying something with hopes and expectations. Simply put, you have to do your homework before purchasing anything in order to keep from getting let down by false hopes. I have 3 of these coming in the mail for my kiddo's, and spent about 4 to 5 days researching all of the current Android tablets available in this price range before picking anything. Out of all devices under $200, this Kryos has the best performance, and hardware options available. There are a few that run right up there with it, but still cost $30 or more per unit.I already know what to expect as the positives and negatives of these devices, primarily the resistive screens that are not as nice as our Moto Driod's Etc. But with facts in hand, the tons of functionality they offer, and the extremely low price tag, I was very comfortable purchasing three of these as Christmas gifts for my loved ones.If you have considered an iPad, and are looking at one of these Android tablets as a cheap alternative, then you have already set yourself up for upset. These do not perform the same way. The screens are not the same technology meaning they do not recognize a soft swipe of the screen, or multi touch like most of their mobile phone brethren. They are resistive screens much like the older Windows mobile phones that react to pressure on the screen. A stylus is going to be more precise of course, but not always needed to operate the touch screen.As for browsing, it is only as fast as your wireless connection will allow it to be. Many of the reviews others have made during test drives of the Colby show excellent response times loading web pages. But just like any device including your high performance notebooks, wireless signal strength, internet speeds, and many other factors come into play when you decide to hit a website.I can honestly say, that these are by far the funnest little gadgets you can pick up for this low of a price, that offer so much features and functionality. They will and should never be a comparison to a high dollar iPad with a ton more hardware resources available. But at a third of the price, I am much happier playing my HD movies and MP3's, surfing the web, checking email, etc on an Android then paying the price of an Apple.And I must correct all those out there bashing the lack of Android's mighty marketplace. This is not missing due to not having mobile connectivity, or even funnier, "an obscure legal loophole" LOL! This is due to the fact that Google requires high cost licensing from manufactures against their devices to allow access to their Market. The Android Tablet arena is still very new, and has not reached the sales yet needed to take on the cost of this licensing, and still produce a profit worth production. Once these devices are welcomed into the community, and sales become profitable, most manufacturers will have the leverage they need.For most, the offerings of these tablets will provide allot of satisfaction as a media and internet device in your home. For those with little patience, you can't save money and be happy at the same time. Whip out that wallet and go get yourself something more expensive so we don't have to hear your whimpers of an another poorly researched purchase. And for those who are driven heavily on performance, and not scared by technical challenges, get out there and upgrade this Kryos and you will open up tons of limitations and performance from the hardware and OS.Hope this helps some out there. Good luck, and happy smart shopping for the holidays!Some of the great resources I used: (remove spaces in URL)-Colby Kyros MID7015 Hands on Review (Unbiased)[...]-Competing Android Tablets Test Drive Comparison Data[...]-Colby Kyros MID7005/MID7015 Resource Page (Contains bugs, apps, and mods)[...]-Manufacturers Site (Contains Manual and Firmware Update)[...]-Excellent video on Home Shopping Network showcasing what it offers (if you can get past HSN's cheesy sales guys)(very biased of course)[...]
I have been using this tablet for almost a week now. Here are my first impressions:It is quite thin and light. Ignore other reviews as they are talking about the model 7005.It comes with a protective case, USB cable and USB mini-to female connector. The latter is very useful to mount USB drives. Be warned the tablet mounts it as the 'scsi' drive.The battery life is quite decent (capacity is 3600mAh).It has only 256 MB memory and the available memory is usually vey small. So you need to kill the backgroud apps from time to time.It plays Angry Birds (with some font problems) and other 3D games quite well. Looks like there is a support for 2D and 3D acceleration. However, the Quadrant Benchmark marks around 300. Compare it with Galaxy Tab around 900 and Viewsonic gTablet around 1800.No problem with any book readers. Actually can be a decent book reader considering the size and weight.No Google Market as it has no Phone support. Not a big deal as I was able to install apps/games from various web sites.Wi-fi support is good and Wi-fi stays on without any problems.The is a manufacturer's support web site (cobyusa). It has the latest update zip package and installation video alongside with the online user guide. So you are not alone when it comes to update this tablet.The screen response is OK if you know how to deal with a resistive screen. You should not use your finger , but the tip of your finger nail or the stylus provided.Overall a decent tablet, very compact and light (again this is 7015 not 7005) and performs well within the price range.
I got this Coby Kyros Android Tablet for $139.99 at Kmart during the Black Friday Deals that went on. Everything with this tablet works good, I especially love this Pad compared to Apple's iPad which has limited functionality and is priced at several of hundreds of dollars compared to the Android Pads because I only need something like the iPad for the internet, checking email, reading books, and playing movies but was surprised that it can do a whole lot more than just that!This Pad uses Android v2.1 OS, it has AppsLib which is a marketplace for apps to install specifically on Android Pads and not Android Phones. The reason why Android Marketplace is not on this Pad is because it does not have Phone capabilities, the Android Marketplace has apps that are for every feature for the Android OS. Other than that, the AppsLib is for Android devices that would not have phone capabilities, hence, Android Tablets. I assume they weeded through the apps that would work on Android Tablets and just created AppsLib. The HDMI output for the device works great! I bought a 16GB microSD card for this and works good. I played a couple of movies with HDMI out in DVD and 720p Quality to an LCD TV and it looked great, sound was great, and there was no delay, lag, or anything wrong with the video! The Pad seemed to play every video format I have thrown at it. I've also used the USB port on this Pad and it recognized my 4GB PNY, 8GB Kingston, & 16GB Patriot Xport flash for additional storage which is a big plus!The only issues I have had with this Android Pad though is that most games I have played on it so far, the G-Sensors (Accelerometer) are reversed on it. When I play a racing game such as Asphalt or Raging Thunder, you're suppose to twist the Pad to the right or left to turn right or left and it's reversed. This is a big disappointment for me and I hope a fix is released for this. Another problem also is every application I install on this Pad, only about 75% of them will work, and this goes for games and apps.Overall... the Pad satisfies what I basically need it to do so far and everything else is just a plus for me.
I am an IT Director and Developer and have owned or demoed many tablets.  This tablet is very good for the price.  It does not have multi-touch (though there are some forums where people are trying to get multi-touch on this resistive screen to work), it does not have bluetooth, it does not have GPS, it does not have cell-phone functionality...but it's a ~$150 "Internet Tablet".I immediately flashed this to support Android Market (AppsLib is like a generic newspaper stand compared to the vast library that is Market).  You can find copious help on xda-developers dot com forum.  I followed the directions (using the Terminal Emulator) and it's been a wonderful experience ever since.  Since the device does not natively support Froyo, Android 2.2., there are several teams of developers (including me) working on Froyo support.  If you are interested in helping, google Android Development Unsupported Devices.  Seeing the amount of interest and all-out effort being put into getting this tablet to support Froyo and 3.0, I firmly believe it will only be a matter of weeks.You can install flash, look for Android 2.1 Flash 10 apk.  The HDMI output is absdolutely stellar...now don't laugh, but Avatar looked pretty damn good coming from the media player on this.I highly recommend at least getting an 8GB micro SDHC card (yes, SDHC).  Some apps don't recognize the actual directory location of the sdcard, instead, some apps are looking in the NAND folder.  Understanding this helps alot (for example Amazon's Kindle for Android software looks for docs in the NAND folder, but not the sdcard folder.)Angry Birds works, but sometimes the words/text are whited-out. I found that if you play "Seasons" and let the Halloween intro load, then go back to the main Angry Birds screen, *most* of the text and 3-stars will magically appear...looks like a Rovio developer bug (damn Finlanders! (Olen Suomalainen!)We recently purchased another of these tablets (Coby 7015) for my girlfriend's 11 year old girl (she loves it!)and I did not immediately flash it...guess what, it was still stable and loaded good...I was even able to get flash 10 installed...then I flashed it to the Market release.On CobyUSA's Website you can download a flash update, just follow the instructions in the video and you'll be fine.  I can't post links because Amazon just deletes them anyways.Overall, a great device for what it does, and for the price.  Kids love it, it works well as an ebook reader (Aldiko is not that bad but I like the Kindle App better), you can download NES, SNES, GBA (Gameboy Advanced), and other games to play...I recommend ROMSGrabber...most games play amazingly well though the lack of multi-touch takes the fun out of some games.The USB allows the use of most USB Keyboards and Mice, I threw a Logitech wireless combo and it recognized the mouse and keyboard (the usb keyboard is required for any Terminal Emulator (geek stuff) that I've used so far).  There are folks working on getting USB to Bluetooth and USB Camera support...so hang in there and keep searching the forums for updates and hacks/mods.Oh yeah, it does have a microphone, one with poor quality, but it does have one.  The "hole" for the built-in microphone is about 1/4 of an inch to the right of the headphone jack (3.5mm or 1/8 inch headphone jack).  I downloaded a couple of recording and loops tracks, and then learned of the microphone's existence.  However, Google Voice Search does seem to crash from time to time.I fully intend on purchasing yet another Android tablet, though I will hang on to this one for it's size and convenience...and as a development device.
I purchased this (COBY KYROS MID7015) android tablet from another retailer and ended up getting it for $149.97 (A Steal). I mention the model clearly because I have noticed many negative reviews on what I am sure is the previous model Coby Kyros 7005. I say that because the newer 7015 was just relesed on 12/1/10 at the earliest. You will see that many negative reviews were posted saying they had the COBY MID7015 before it was even available. If people want to post a negative review of a product they at the very least, SHOULD KNOW WHAT MODEL THEY ARE REVIEWING. That said, in my opinion this Coby MID7015 is an outstanding product. It does everything it claims it can do, and very well in fact. If you take your time and read the simple instructions it is very easy to set up. Even the internet runs very fast on this tablet, (decent wifi connection required). All other applications that come pre-loaded, and even the ones I have loaded myself, run great as well. The bottom line is this. For a full color e-reader (as good as my Daughters brand new $250.00 Nook color), and an amazing media player that plays everything I have thrown at it with ease, plus an android internet tablet with tons of free applications available, this one is a tough cookie to beat. At this price point this is a no brainer in my opinion :)
It worked perfectly right out of the box.  Being a Windows only user, it took me a short a while to learn swiping and tapping, but after a few days I think I got the hang of it.  Installing apps is easy.  The included browser is easy to use.  The screen quality is very good.  It plays nice with my Windows PC.  And most of all I love the long battery life.  The included e-book reader app is very nice and easy to use.  The only major drawbacks are the lack of GPS, a camera, and Bluetooth. And because of the missing features, many apps that depend on them won't work on this tablet.  But for the price, I'll take this any day over the iPad.
I was reluctant to purchase this initially because I am not familiar with the Coby brand but because of a Black Friday event, I could not resist.  I was debating between an ipad or an android tablet so I decided to get this just to try it out for not a lot of money.  It works pretty good, it reminds me of my Sprint Evo without phone capabilities.  I like the fact that I can download the Kindle app and review all of my books on it.  There is also a great app called Jorte, which is similar to an actual paper planner and I can check my Google mail, when I'm in a wifi accessible area.  Here's why I gave it 3 stars, the issue I have had is the screen has gone out a few times and I've actually had to reset this thing twice. Also, my screen kept fading in and out, only giving a view of colorful lines!  I'm not sure what happened there but it appears to be working fine now.  I have 30 days to return it so I will continue to use it for a few days and decide if I want to keep it our not.
Coby Kyros MID7015 7-Inch Android  Internet Touchscreen Tablet - BlackI had been researching for a android device that has good reviews and falls below the cost of an iPad, almost all the android tablets that i had been researching had some or the other issues that was debatable and the most were *un-branded tablets with no support information; with a bold move Coby Kyros was my preferrable choice and costed me about $130 and the main reason for selecting this is because of the support Coby USA site offered; almost immediately i upgraded my tablet to newer firmware android 2.1; now about the device i absolutely love it because the 7 inches screen size is so slick and easy to handle with one hand and it has got a very responsive display to all my touches; wifi doesn't seem to be a problem and watching youtube videos and browsing webpages were awesome; now to get into the R&D; section i was so in need to instal android market place because the market place offered by Coby's version wasn't broad and good (i dont blame them for that) so with community help I was able to root my tablet and get the android marketplace installed along with google! my tablet is now loaded with more application and still runs like a champ; finally i wrote this review with my usage (2-3 hours a day and have about 12 MBPS internet).UPDATE: 06/03/2011I sold my Coby Kyros back to amazon thru trade-in program because now that I own a Dell Streak 5, I was not determined to have 2 devices doing the same job! Coby Kyros remained to be a good start up tutorial for me in getting accustomed with the android world I would still recommend this over any other device for the price its being sold for!
Really people?  What did you expect for $150?  We have people here comparing this to 300-600 dollar devices.  Really?  People who leave a review that is totally false.  It would help if you actually used the device before leaving a bad review.Ok now thats out of the way.  I do not think this device deserves a 5 star rating, I rated as such to offset all the 1 star reviews from people that have no clue what they are talking about.To the person comparing this to an Ipod touch or an Iphone or even an Ipad, guess what, Iphones cost more and require a cell phone contract not to mention having a smaller screen.  Same deal with a Ipod touch smaller screen and around the same price if not more.  Also no removable media, if you want pictures or movies they are on the internal memory only whereas with this device you can use removable Micro SD(up to 16GB)  We wont even discuss the Ipad becuase its 4 times the price.  Show me a 7" tablet in this price range right now.To the person that says they cant multi task because of the back button, tilt your device forward slightly, look on top.  You will see 2 buttons, one says menu, one says home.  Open an app, run it, now press the home button.  Wow see what I did there, input from someone that actually took the time to use the device before posting a negative review.Ok on to the review.  First off, know what you are buying before you purchase it.  This not capacative touch it is resistive.  These are the types of screen that were used on older devices, PDA's etc.  The newer devices like the droid phones, Ipad etc use capacative touch.  Now with that being said, this is probably one of the nicest resisitive touch screens I have used.  Rarely do I need a stylus, and it works well just using my finger tips.  There are a few times when I will mistakenly click comething I did not intend to but it is much better than I expected and works pretty well.You will not get the full Android market with this device.  Google has already stated that no tablets will be given full market access until Android v 3.0 is released which will be optimized for tablets.  This device is also not capable of being updated to 3.0, so what you see is pretty much what you are going to get as far as the OS is concerned.  If you want the full market on this device it requires some tweaking, information on this can be found by searching the web, and some shred of technical knowledge will be required.The buttons on this device are similar to the ones found on a standard android phone.  All the buttons are present with the exception of the search button.  On top of the device you will find the menu and home buttons on a rocker switch and the back button is the large gold circle that is visible on the front of the device.I read one review that stated the device locked up all the time.  As far as lockups are concerned, they were few and far between for me.  I think I used the reset button one time when I got stuck in an application.  Most of the apps provided and downloaded worked pretty well.I had no issues connecting to and surfing the web and the speed, while not as fast as my laptop, was sufficient enough for me for web browsing.  Not what I would consider to be slow as some have said.With all that being said, I will revert back to my original statement.  Research and know what you are buying before you buy it.  If you are looking for a 150 dollar Ipad or Galaxy tablet, you will be sorely disappointed.  This device works well for playing some games, reading some books and watching some movies as well as surfing the web.
Pros:-It does everything it claims too, plus some-It is quality built; the device is very sturdy-Comes with a very nice case (as good as griffins for archos)-Touch screen is responsive for fingers as well as stylus, no problem playing games-Device is fast, plays full 1080p mp4 movies no problem-Can multitask: always have music or IM in background and receive email updates no problem-Can download and install any APK file, don't have to go through app library for everything-Read ebooks easily and has a large database of free onesCons:-Case doesn't open flat, but only minor inconvenience-Internal gyro / accelerometers are a bit sensitive, good for some games, bad for others-Touch screen picks up fingerprints; they include a nice microfiber clothRecommended Apps:-Dolphin Browser HD - for better tabbed browsing-Astro File Browser - so you can actually search files on the deviceNotes:Make sure to apply firmware update available on site as soon as you get it, part of the process is to wipe the system.Don't expect this thing to end world hunger or replace your computer or even do your math homework for you. It is an amazing device for how much it costs and what it does!
I actually bought this unit for only 149.99,  and i must say its well worth the price. I was very iffy about it at first,  considering its a coby product, but after a week of use, its an media device i cannot go without. It was very laggy and force closed alot,  but once you get the update from the coby website, it works like a charm. Just a word of advice, download applanet,  because applib sucks as a market in itself (most apps are in chinese), otherwise its a great tablet
This is a nice entry level tablet for it's price.While it doesn't use the standard Android Marketplace it does have access to a wide variety of apps.  And there are many other sites on the web where more apps can be found, though for that you will need a computer with SD card for transfer.Took about 25 minutes worth of tinkering with it's internal settings, and my router settings to get the WiFi set up.  Though it does have a fairly good interface for that.The touch screen is very responsive, and you only have to use minimal pressure to get your point across.  It does come packaged with a nice extend-able stylus that has a screw on end-cap lanyard.  Which is a bit on the small side, but nicely portable.  The built in case for it is nice quality.  Held in place by 4 small screws it is removable for those who want to use a different case.  It does however double as a built in stand for hands free video watching.(By simply flipping the top back, and placing the outer clasp back into the holder.) Built in speaker isn't too bad, but a bit on the small side, does get a bit crackly when you max out the volume.On board memory of only 4 gigs is a bit on the small side, but plenty of room there for all the apps you might need.  A secondary SD Card should be used for storage of other media files.I can't rate it's HDMI output, but if you're buying a tablet I'd expect you're not going to plan on tethering it much anyhow.I have found it works great for video watching, music, and even comic book reading by using the right apps.  I will say that it takes some tinkering with the system setting to get it to behave the way that you might expect it to.All in all a good bargain for a tablet that isn't a no name import knockoff.
I recently bought the Coby Kyros tablet. I must say that it is a GREAT tablet. It has everything the iPad doesn't and is overall fun to use. When I was talking to another owner about it, he mentioned the tab was a bit sluggish when loading up the apps. While there is a 3-5 second loading period, it isn't a major drawback. I've had no freezes yet and it is an overall fun device. Sure, there is no Bluetooth, but most things don't use that anyways. Can't wait for the next software update!
Purchased thru Amazon and have been using for about two weeks.Not too bad for price and performance.  Would agree with other positive reviews of this and Mid7015 device which the two are very similar.  I would also point out too that you do have to realize this is not intended to be a high end device like the iPad.Pros:-Quality build, good plastic and metal-Comes with nice case, manual, earbuds, HDMI cable, etc. that you would expect-Touch screen is responsive for fingers as well as stylus, no problem playing games-Fast and responsive, no problems with touchscreen-Default web browser, video/audio players worked no problems - even 2GB mpeg4 movie files-Able to find and download/install apps from browsing internet-Seems as good as anything else I've seen for reading eBooks-Good tinkerers device, see my notes belowCons:-I did have some crash, auto reboot issues-Battery for me has been about 3-6 hrs depending on useNotes: After about 3 weeks research this seemed to be about best device for lower cost and ability to tinker with it.  I've been able to easily root ("hack") the device using readily available information on the internat to solve above problems in Cons area, add the Google Market, and other nice items that have really increased the value of it to me.  Plus, why spend $600 on a device that none of us will probably be using in 2 years anyways.
Ok I just bought mine yesterday so I have only had a day with it but so far I love this thing.  The screen is nice and bright.  It works well without a stylus.  I spent the night playing Angry Birds and all the 3d games with the tablet.  Great Great deal.  The ereader is basic and works great.  I found a great site about putting the full android market on here and it works well.[...]It is everything I wanted.  Love it.
I got this for someone as a Christmas gift, and I should have paid better attention to the other reivews that came before this one.  The interface is extremely difficult to use, and when trying to load the aps from the APSLIB, it simply sits there and goes nothing.  All in all, it is better to do without than to use this thing.  For the money, go out and buy a small ITOUCH.  We are sending this back as soon as the post office opens on Monday morning
I purchased the tablet for my children after extensive review and research. The tablet has one major problem, it has an adult content tab on the app page. Two-clicks and your children see adult images. I called Koby to see if it can be removed or hidden, but there is not. This device has NO parental controls! I returned to Toys R Us and spoke with the manager there to make sure they were aware of what they are selling at a children's store. NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN!!!

As a current iPad owner who also uses the Droid X, I must say that after spending 15 minutes with this thing I absolutely love it. The size is fantastic in that its a signifcantly improved viewing experience over the 4.3 inch Droid X screen (which is also great) and it is easy to hold with one hand and navigate with the other - an added bonus is that it also fits in a suit coat pocket.The Microsoft Exchange integration with email/calendar/contacts is seemless and allows for almost all of the functionality provided via a laptop. One of the drawbacks of the iPad is its poor integration with Outlook (couldn't delete, move emails while one a plane working offline - not a problem with the Tab).The screen is gorgeous, speed is quick and the Google location services (GPS, Latitude, Maps, Place and the list goes on and on) are fantastic.I would highly recommend this product.Update - after 1 week of ownership, I love it even more.  As someone who travels (4 cities over last 5 days), I'm considering leaving my notebook home on business travel with future trips.  The benefits of the form factor can't be overstated - it fits in my jeans pocket when out casually and in my suit jacket during business.  It also smartly switches from WiFi to 3G when a WiFi network is not within reach and vice versa (so that you don't unnecessarily consume data via your cellular carrier).  I also watched a movie on my East to West coast trip - 3 hour and 13 minute move burned less than half the battery time.  It's also great to be able to modify .xls documents when needed - seamless integration with outlook / attachments.Absolutely love this thing...
I ran out and bought the Galaxy Tab from T-Mobile the first day it was released.  I have been using it to take notes and read on the Kindle app since.  I have a Droid X, which filled the need till the Galaxy Tab was released, but it is so much easier now with a 7 inch screen.  The Galaxy Tab is basically the size of three Droid X screens, so much easier to type and to read.I haven't found any apps developed for the Galaxy Tab specifically, but most android apps I use seem to work ok or even better on the larger form factor.  I am hoping, just like some developers have built apps just for the iPad, that soon apps will come out built to take advantage of the additional screen size.It fits well in my hand, but with the case it does not fit in my pocket. I also find that even in landscape mode that I can not really type with both hands.  I hear there is an optional qwerty keyboard you can buy, but I haven't gone that route yet.I have tested out using Skype as a phone and it seems to work fine - at least when calling people in the US.And with T-Mobile there is no additional charge to the Galaxy Tab as an access point!
Review update: Initially my belief was that Samsung has crippled this device, but in fact it has been done by Verizon. The Verizon web site explains that NONE of their mobile devices includes the ability to use a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. Moreover, the T-Mobile model has been reported to work fine with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. I also briefly tested a Sprint model with a Bluetooth mouse, and it seems as though it should work -- there was a menu option to connect to the mouse and use it as a HID (human input device), an option that is not even available on the Verizon model. I wasn't actually able to connect to the mouse, but it's possible that it was a mouse incompatibility issue (it's a Targus N2953), or my batteries were too low.Steer clear of the Verizon model of the Galaxy Tab. And since this review is under the heading of the T-Mobile model of the Tab, I am changing my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.I'm surprised Samsung lets Verizon do this, owing to the bad press it's giving Samsung.Original post follows.----------It's an amazing little tablet. Quick, responsive, light, bright screen, and all the Android apps I've tried run very well on it. It even works as a WiFi-to-3G hotspot out of the box. This tablet is impressive. Too bad it's been deliberately crippled by Samsung [edit: it was Verizon, not Samsung].The problem is Bluetooth, which on the Galaxy Tab is usable ONLY for file transfers (the supplied USB cable is used for the same thing). The ability to use the Tab with Bluetooth HIDs (human input devices) has been DISABLED. Google put it into Android, and Samsung [edit: no, Verizon] took it out. That means you can't use wireless keyboards or mice with it. This tablet has the ability to replace a PC if only it could use a keyboard and a mouse (but then that's probably why Samsung [Verizon] has disabled it: politics, lawsuits, myopia, inbreeding, whatever). I have also tried 3rd party Bluetooth drivers, but they don't work. Not yet, anyway.Bluetooth headsets are also reported not to work, but what's the point? Samsung [edit: might really be Samsung] has also disabled the Tab's phone capability.European users do not have these restrictions placed on them by Samsung [edit: by whomever]: their units work well with keyboards and mice, and as phones. Check YouTube for some videos of this.From the technologizer web site:"Will the Galaxy Tab support Bluetooth HID? Will it support Bluetooth headsets or keyboards?No, and no, said Kim Titus, a Samsung representative. Looks like Samsung's keyboard dock accessory is your only option."[edit: T-Mobile & Sprint users should be able to use Bluetooth HID with no problem.]My advice? Should BT HID remain unattainable (I'll report back if I can find a way to fix it), resist the burning temptation to buy this beautiful and extremely usable but very expensive tablet, and wait a few months for the 7" tablet competition to ramp up [OR get the T-Mobile or Sprint model] -- there are several on the horizon. Features on other tablets will increase in number, and prices will drop. Apple will release the iPad 2 in 2011, which will undoubtedly have a camera and other nice features you've been waiting for (the iPad already supports the Apple BT keyboard, but no mouse). Samsung will eventually cave in and provide BT HID support in a software update for the Galaxy Tab, but it will be too late. Potential users will have taken their money elsewhere.
This product is really good. Carrying a stock android of 2.2. Although it feels almost like a  pound but its just the right size for your pocket or purse. Samsung really made promised on overall graphics of the tablet. i still haven't fully dug into the tablet all the way. Only one thing I can really point out is the internet with this device on carrier 3g network. I gave it four stars for it for that reason. The internet is horribly slow. IThe internet can also drop as well. Thats why wifi comes in all the way. Very fast on Wifi. As for games is really great. I usually have all my movies and tv shows on itunes, so theres no need to buy any from the media hub unless theres a reason if my show or movie isn't specified on itunes. The box comes in black. A set of headphones, the tablet, and a few manuals. There is no case or cover which left me disappointed about it. Samsung should have least put cases in the boxes just like t-mobile and their mobile devices. Battery power is awesome. Charged very fast charging. From a half a charge in about an hour. I'd say two hours for a full charge. As for camera, it's no that bad. As for orientation portrait and landscape mode, it is a little sluggish when turning the tablet either way. I'd say that I am waiting for honeycomb update for the tablet itself to experience the full force of a tablet. 2.2 is a good build on it, just not perfectly set for the tablet. There are apps that aren't adjusted for it. But all developers will jump on track as soon as this tablet sells more often. Thats it for my review. Its a great tablet. It will not or cannot replace a laptop. And its a lot like and android phone, just bigger. I do recommend buying this tablet if your interest in one for yourself. If you have any questions regarding this feel free to ask me. I'll answer the best of my ability. As I dig deeper into the this tablet, I'll post more information regarding this over the next few days. Please to read all post for more understanding about the tablet.Update November 5th, 2010Media Hub, now I'm not an apple fan, I'm just a customer to them. But to say the very least is that the movies on the media hub is a little more expensive. Like the dark knight almost 17.99. Others 19.99. And the itunes price 8.99 movies. I would say to use itunes than media hub. Does not support call capabilities. North America strip that from the tab when it crossed into the states. Does support texts. You can get unlimited. If you want to root your device for the call capability there is a site for it. But I wouldn't recommend right now considering the device it is still new.December 7, 2010Sorry Im a bit late on my replies, just been busy for the holidays.WIFI TETHERINGEveryones been asking me about the mobile connection with the galaxy tab internet usage. Well here it is.As this have been a month of playing with my tab, its been surprisingly good. Though I am still waiting for Honeycomb in early next year.  Internet connections using the Galaxy Tab: I have just recently used the internet connection for this device under settings: Wireless & Networks; Mobile Ap. This activates the wifi on the device for internet use for mobile and/ or laptops. This is more faster than 3g network and is free. I tried this using my Nexus One and MacPro. Connections were good. I usually have internet at home, so I think this is a feature to burn up your tablets life quicker. Or unless you want to pay $9.99 from T-Mobile or $14.99 for tethering. Added extra updates:  Music: As for the music, it is loud and clear to understand. I used DoubleTwist to download my music fast and convenient. The music app separates your music into the categories of artists the songs that go under them.  As for game loft games, the Hd is superior on it. [...] for more games for the galaxy tab. You do have to pay for them, $4.99 or you can have it charged on your phone bill after you downloaded the demo game. The game is fully downloaded into the tablets memory card 16gb. You just have to buy it if you are interested in the expansion of the rest otherwise uninstall. I only have Asphalt. The thing about this game is that when your driving, the steering wheel seems to stop turning therefore, you crash into a wall or turning around. Using the sensor was a bit difficult for me.  So some game controls from gameloft is a bit sluggish, but its still good.  Slacker Radio: This app is pretty good when it comes to listening to music. You can upgrade for the full version or just keep the demo. The demo, you do have options of switching stations only six times, then you would have to wait an hour to change them again. Though this app will sometimes take awhile to load the radio station thats because its the demo app. One month: $4.99 or $3.99 monthly thats $47.88 annually. You don't have song lyrics in the demo and there are ads.This device is just a magnet for fingerprints, Luckily I have a spare nylon cloth.More Updates coming soon.
Just want to say that I bought the Samsung Tab outside the US, so it might not be the same as US units.  It is unlocked, and all the functions such Bluetooth are fully operational.  This is not a review by an IT pro, but simply an end-user's initial thoughts after a week of using the machine.I put off buying an iPad because it seemed to be just an oversize iPod without the functionality of a laptop.  I reckon that Samsung has produced exactly the machine that the iPad should have been.  It has all the bells and whistles, including front facing and rear facing cameras, Bluetooth, internet, wireless, GPS, micro-SD slot, etc, etc - oh, and it's a really good cellphone.  The Android 2.2 operating system is terrific and seems to be as intuitive as the Apple OS. I have all sorts of documents loaded on the Tab including Pdf's, Word, jpegs, etc and they all open easily.  The screen is sharp and is easy to read even in sunlight.  The email function is really good, and attachments open without a problem.  I have not tried the video function yet, so I cannot comment on that.  However, the camera is nothing to rave about,as the resolution is pretty grainy, but I didn't buy the Tab to take photos. The virtual keyboard is responsive and easy to use, however the unit is too large to do typing with both hands,and anyway, I plan to get a Bluetooth key board for use in the office.  I have not tried the rear facing camera, but will do so as soon as I can load Skype.  All in all, this seems to be a well-designed, quality built piece of kit.  I think this has raised the bar for Apple, and they had better hussle to get an upgraded iPad to market.
I bought the T-Mobile version because it has more internal storage (16 GB vs 2 GB) than the other networks' versions, but wirelessly tether it (for free) to my HTC EVO on the Sprint network and avoid a monthly bill and a contract.  I did a ton of research and spent a lot of time deciding between the two before I made a final decision on the Galaxy Tab vs the iPad.  I played around with each device for several hours and went through each and every feature with a fine tooth comb to ensure I was making the right call.  Here are the highlights of what I found:At first, I much preferred the bigger screen of the iPad vs the Galaxy tab.  It seemed to generally make the web browsing experience a little better having the big screen and bigger keyboard.  However, after using the two extensively, I ended up liking the smaller, more compact Galaxy because the iPad is too big to type two handed by holding it, and it is too small to type on like a regular keyboard.  With the Galaxy tab, you type on it like you would a big cell phone, which isn't a bad thing...it makes it easier to two-thumb type when holding vertically which is difficult to do on the bigger screen of the iPad.  The smaller, more compact design also makes the Galaxy easier to carry, as it fits easily in my suit pocket, and even the pocket of a pair of jeans.  Ergonomically, after extensive use, I think most would find the more compact Galaxy much better and comfortable.Then comes the operating system.  I find the iOS that runs the iPad is simpler and generally more responsive and smoother than the Android OS that runs the Galaxy Tab.  For many people who just want to get to the point, they may appreciate the simplicity of the iOS.  However, I much prefer the Android OS for the same reasons I switched from the iPhone to the Evo with the Android OS.  iOS is very bland, boring, stale, and juvenile compared to the Android OS, which in contrast is FAR more capable, customizable, and fitting to personal use.  Apple controls everything on the iOS and locks everything set in stone, making the experience very plain.  Android OS however makes the device unique, and personal which I love.Some features that are on Android that are not on the iOS are:Expandable storageFree navigation built in to the phone with google maps (seems useless if you have a navi in your car, but this works so much faster and easier to look up addresses and POI's...I use this exclusively over my car's navi because it is much faster and easier to use)One-touch navigational shortcuts.  Touch one button to go home, work, airport, wherever you defineWidgets.  These are icons on the homescreen that provide shortcuts to just about anything on your phone, such as your clock, weather, calendar, wifi, ringtone profiles, favorites for calling (see picture)True multi-tasking.  Apple has made an attempt to do so, but doesn't compare to the integration that Android has done and allows for multiple apps like skype, pandora, etc to run in the background.Customizable in so many ways, but most importantly in ergonomics like customizable keyboards which makes the overall experience more fitting to individual typing styles, finger sizes, etc.Better integration with facebook and google accounts...all mail, calendar events, and contacts in one place and synced wirelessly to your phone and updated with facebook pictures and statusReal file management.  Allows you to cut, copy, move, delete files as you would on your computer.  Very important for working on the go or just to manage your files.  This combines great with apps like dropbox where you can sync all of your files together between computers and mobile devices...Very easy to unlock features such as wireless tethering...normally a $30/m feature, but easy enough to unlock on an Android device.  POSSIBLE to unlock a similar feature on iPhone, but with bluetooth tethering vs wifi.  Also doing so on an iPhone is much more difficult and dangerous since iphone is built to be unlockable in every way, whereas android is built to be easily unlockable and customizable.Open-source operating system:  This is where the fun begins and allows users to do all sorts of jazz like overclock, install custom operating systems, etc.  Of course, MOST won't bother with this, but the open source is what drives innovation and features from concept to reality.  This is why the gap between features on Android OS and iOS is growing exponentially.I am surprised that Apple's OS lacks the features that Android OS has, because Apple's Macintosh OS is known for having the most features and customization of any other OS, however, their OS on their mobile devices have by far the fewest and blandest features of the competition's OS on the mobile platform.Nonetheless, the Android OS, and thus the Samsung Galaxy Tab, is packed with much more customization options and features than the iPad and was the clear choice for me.
i have both an ipad and the galaxy.  And the galaxy is way better.  No website restrictions like on ipad, so i can get on websites that run flash like fancast and youtube. (on the ipad you need an app to watch videos on youtube, and they have to be videos that were made to be seen on the apple, which means many aren't apple ready).  The keyboard is a lot fater to use.  Out of the box it comes with some great apps.  I dont have to link to itunes to transfer files.  On the galaxy I can download files from email and open them just like a pc, unlike apple where i would need a special app and link to itunes to see files. its more portable than the ipad.  I got it unlocked and i can use my phones sim card on it...  overall a better product than the ipad and without the apple restrictions.
I've owned this since 10am when the Verizon store opened (I know this is the tmobile version for the review, but they are the same device on different networks).I've had it for a couple of days now and I must say everyone who sees it is envious (and they should be).  The tablet is running Android 2.2, which naysayers complain about.  I've had nothing but good luck with it.  Two of the more important features of the tablet are email and calender, which have both been revamped by Samsung to be tablet friendly.I also run Dolphin HD as the browser, which is awesome on this size screen.  Swiping left to get your book marks doesn't take up the entire screen like it does on my phone!  I also run LauncherPro Plus instead of the standard Samsung TouchWiz UI.  Not that TouchWiz is bad, I just am accustomed to LauncherPro, and it does have some great features.Overall, the size is perfect.  I use it as an ereader, browsing randomly while watching TV, and same games (Angry Birds! Fruit Ninja!).  It has been perfect thus far, and I can't wait to see what new versions of Android bring to the table.
Samsung Galaxy Tab(Verizon version) is a great device, I returned this beautiful device to BestBuy where I bought it however due to BlueTooth issue. I plan to replace my laptop with the Galaxy Tab for remote administering with Citrix receiver or VPN(I haven't tested yet), hence I need a keyboard (and a mouse or stylus). After struggling for about an hour BestBuy agreed that my Apple bluetooth KB could not pair with the Galaxy Tab. It appeared that Apple bluetooth KB was paired successfully but no reaction on the Tab.I still plan to own Samsung Galaxy Tab when the issue is resolved.
WOW ! A few weeks ago I was in Best Buy and almost bought an IPad. I then remembered all of the problems they had earlier so I just walked away. Well three weeks ago we saw this quick tv ad for this new tab and it was at T mobile  and so we went to just see their sample. Well after the demostration the sales clerk told me to try it.  I did and I tried all kinds of apps including the navagation one and I loved it . It was about $600.00 but when you get the two yr plan it is  $399.00 . We have used it countless times without any problems . If I could give this Galaxy tab my personal rating it would be a six star rating.  The Galaxy is great and even the reviews are all positive.

I spent a few months researching various tablets before buying this one - on its release date of 11/11.  I've had it for well over a month now, and am still very happy with it.  First, I don't use HDMI so the lack of a port is not an issue for me, and since I don't tether it to my computer I don't mind the cables either. Blue tooth works very well on the Tmobile version.The form factor is very comfortable and the size is great in my hands.  It's easy to put in a pocket or in a purse.  The buttons work very well, and do light up when you tap the screen.  Web over WiFi is very fast, and is a joy to use.  Video playback is of good quality, and the tablet does record decent videos as well.  Multi touch is very precise, and I use both pinch to zoom and double tap which are both responsive.I do have Skyfire web browser installed, and that gives me the ability to have the Tab recognized by websites as a pc - which works well for sites like Amazon and eBay. I also have Docs installed, and can view and edit any word or excel document with ease.  Paired with the Apple wireless keyboard, I can do anything on the tablet that I could do on my laptop. I do not have it paired with a wireless mouse, since I don't see the point. The touchscreen on the tablet works well enough while typing.  I have paired it with a blue tooth headset and have made Skype calls with the tablet as well.  That works great too - but I wouldn't use this as a phone on a regular basis.Games play well on the tablet, and it's functionality can't be beat.  I did check out the iPad in person before buying this tablet, and found it to be too big and too cumbersome.  Not exactly portable,since it's 10 inches, while the Galaxy tablet is very portable.I really can't recommend this product enough.  Sure it's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for - and in this case you get a lot.
I have had  this device now for about 3 days. So far it has done everything that it is marketed to do and has exceeded most of my expectations. I wanted it as an entertainment device, to use as an e-reader and to have in place of carrying a net-book around. The main reasons I didn't get an ipad are the size of the product and the inability to run flash applications on the internet. This tablet is smaller in size, which for many reviewers has been a negative thing, but I enjoy that it is a more compact device.While I am a fan of many Apple products and I do not knock them or the iPad at all, I went with Samsung Galaxy Tab, for the reasons I listed. The main reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of it's weight. The device itself is not 'heavy' per say, but one of the main functions I was interested in, was being able to use it as an e-reader with the Kindle application for Android. While it has the app and it works well, the tablet does get a bit heavy if you are sitting and holding it to read. I have solved the issue when I am at my desk by getting a 'Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry Play Book' for it.. and a case.. but it is still a bit heavy to actually hold while reading.. sitting in bed as an example. .I know this is version 1.1 so to speak and it will only get better. I am a fan of Android devices and have been since the Google G1. I currently own a G2, which also made the transition to this device a breeze.. because it's the exact same operation system as the G2 phone, (Android 2.2). Again, alot of reviewers have listed this as a drawback, at least on sites like PC World and CNet but I love that its simple and easy to control.It is a welcome addition to my entertainment arsenal. I have read that the T-Mobile version is the most complete version of the device, (as compared to the fully decked out euro Model,) and I have T-Mobile as my Cell phone carrier so it was an easy choice for me.I hope if you get one you will enjoy it also!
This is my first Tablet.  I have played with an Ipad, loved it, but because I have never been part of the Apple Eco System, I didn't do it.  Plus, I already own a Galaxy S phone so it seemed a good move to go with Galaxy style Tablet.First of all it's a bit heavier than I expected.  Maybe because the Galaxy S is so light, it surprised me.  The screen is bright and very responsive.  I love watching video on it.  I love Slacker Radio now which I never listened to with my phone. The big album art and other features make it a great tablet app.Other things look great on it like Pocket Legends (an online MMO), Angry Birds, and other built in apps like mail and Kindle.I agree with some of the bad reviews, but I think it's a serious tablet and is pretty affordable.  At T Mobile it was 599 with no contract, and I can pay it off over 20 months with no interest.Love my Tab.Adam
I replaced my ipad with Samsung Galaxy tab. It's a better option for sales executives who are on the move. I can edit and share documents with my clients and business associates on the go. The external bluetooth keyboard and mouse is very helpful when taking notes, and as well as the super fast multi tasking functionalities. It has all the applications / software one could need when travelling. It's light weight and easy to tag in my coats pocket, and much easier to use in meeting rooms than that bulky and heavy iPAD. Most importantly, I can take calls during meetings while recording my minutes, something I could not do with ipad. On the other hand, the video and picture quality is exceptionally good, compared to other phones I had. I am indeed happy to find a replacement to my ipad.
Bought it yesterday without a contract. Cannot describe how good the Samsung Galaxy Tab really is! For all of those who were patiently waiting for an iPad-like device that runs Froyo 2.2, this is a winner. I have it on my home WiFi network and the internet download speeds are fast. My Droid Incredible will download the same pages slightly faster, but the difference is neglible. The stock browser is fine. It does not center the text nicley like Incredible does when I pinch in and out. Otherwise, it works well and is nicely laid out.All the Apps so far run fine and look great. I put Advanced Task Killer on the tablet. Interestingly, when I activate the Task Killer, very few apps get killed (single digits). With the (non-rooted) Incredible usually 30-40+ apps get the axe. I would surmise that Samsung put far less Bloatware on the this device than I have seen with other Droids.I read the review on Gizmodo before buying the device. Not sure what was going on with the Gizmodo reviewer. There are several possibilities: 1. They were having a psychotic break. 2. They are an employee of Apple. 3. They are new to Android and not the sharpest tool in the shed. The only thing that was correct in the review was the power supply is a bit unusual.I have an Apple iPhone (that I just replaced with my Droid phone secondary to poor reception), an iTouch, iPods and a Mac Book. I don't have anything against Apple and I use their products daily.My best advice with the Samsung Galaxy Tab is to pick one up for a few minutes at a store and play with it. See for yourself.
The best of this device is witheld from the public by the service providers.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab is also serves as a cell phone which is not widely known or being released in the USA by the service providers.  Most people think this device is just a wireless or 3G tablet but is has cell phone capability built in the device.  It's the largest display (7") cell phone in the world that I am aware of.  I have now been using the device for the past week and it's fantastic both as a tablet and as a cell phone.  It takes a little getting used to after being a blackberry addict for the past 3 years but I now carry them both but using the Samsung Galaxt Tab more and more each day. The GSM cell phone calls are of great quality with no dropped called experienced.
I've been using an iPad since it came out and now switched to the Galaxy Tab.  For me, the 7" screen is a perfect size for reading or playing games.  It's very responsive and so far have received good battery length.  After using this for a while, I picked up the iPad and wondered how I was able to carry that around before because it felt 100% heavier after using this lighter tablet.  I do miss a few applications that I had on the iPad but there are plenty of applications to try and if you don't like, you can get an automatic refund from most at the Android Marketplace.  The size format won't fit into any pocket but when you get a case for it, it is easy to carry around.  I picked my unit up direct from T-Mobile and couldn't be happier.
Exceeds expectations.  Fast, gorgeous.  My needs are web, email, and a few apps.  No complaints at all.  The size is a great advantage - can carry it with me easily.
A technological marvel? A generation-defining device? A complete rip-off of the iPad? Answer to all that is best left to the debaters.When Apple announced its next genre-defying device, and we could all bask in the awesomeness of the few leaked images of the tablet of reckoning, I was torn. I asked myself in a few moments of so-called redneck-ism,  "What the hell is that? Is it a phone? Can you even carry it in your pocket? Where the hell is the keyboard to that notebook?" Little did I know that styli had been done away with completely from a type of computer I never knew existed, and the tablet computers were making their triumphant return (debut) in the already cluttered market of electronics. Thanks, Jobs, just what I needed, another must-have i-Thingy.Much as Apple has impressed me with its myriad trend-setting consumer products, this time the skeptic in me rang a pre-show alarm-bell. This was just ridiculous. The advantages of buying an i-Pad were far too few and in-between to trump the many disadvantages. That is the one thing you don't want in an electronic product. Huge screen size? No phone? No Android? No Google? What about 3G? No? You know, you can make HD trailers of people getting impressed with their new economic conquest all you want, buddy... I ain't buying. Bite it, Apple.A genre, once created, can only justify its name when it has more than one members. Monopoly is just a dream. The only question was who was going to come with a tablet worthy of standing up to the huge American coup. Europeans are just sleeping. (What's going on, Nokia? I believed in you!)And then the Koreans did it.When I first came to know about the Galaxy Tab, I was disheartened by people predicting its failure, firstly due to its lower size and similar cost to iPad, and secondly due to people calling it an overgrown smart-phone. Look guys, you can hate all you want, but I need to have a choice of screen-size when you force me to carry the damn thing by hand! 7 inches does not cause trouble in browsing, and easy to carry around! Like a little diary, even! Yay!Android phones are the best gadgets around. With the huge amount of apps flying around, you can use your phone to do about anything.(Many phones claim to do that. Anything. Android phones can actually do anything.) But in my opinion, the screen size of the Tab brings in a huge change in perspective by which to look at the apps. I didn't know what I hated about the apps in small smart-phones until I got my Tab. Believe me, Tab wins.The SIM card functionality is where Tab can really justify its rightful place as a competitor to the big-Huge Apple. WiFi as the only option for Internet? Phwah! I intend to turn my Tab into a GPS attached to my car (you can do that), and "WiFi, won't you stay with me, just a little longer?" cannot bend the will of almighty signals. I use my phone's 2G or 3G functionality to access internet everywhere! (Americans. People exist who cannot afford WiFi. It's not about money. It's about availaibility.)Camera! The quintessential smart-phone's got one. Why not i-Pad? Too much of a good thing, eh? Samsung's got two - one for video calls and another for, you know, camera purposes. Technical jargon alert - Tab has twice the RAM of an iPad, and 32 GB extendable. IPad is limited to internal memory. Multitasking can Tab but not iPad.Apple's hatred for third-party apps or software or firmware is legendary, and restricts its product usage to people who have grown up with Apple. C'mon Apple, by now you are like the rich kid in the sandbox who will let friends look at his cool new toys, but won't let you play as you want with then. This technological fascism must stop! If on the other hand, you work with a larger crowd, Tab is for you. I would recommend Tab over the iPad any day, and this I will also say, if by now, you still religiously buy all of Apple's new products, you either work for Jobs, or you are just trying to impress somebody. Rebel. You are too good for Apple. Not the other way around. Tab up your life. Just make sure to get a good screen guard.
I have tried the iPad, the Nook and the Kindle 3...this blows them all away. Do yourself a favor, get one, and start watching your movie library, surf the net and read some books from both Amazon and Barnes & Noble etc... Awesome device...
Great gadget, as yet the only thing i find the ipad better at is initial ease of use - i find android a bit fiddly at times, but i am used to IOS.I wont go into great detail as there are millionof proper revies out there written by the pros, but i will stick my 2 cent in!Once you get your head around android, it becomes very easy to use, you can make calls if you feel the need, texts etc.  Smaller unit enables you to fit it in most good sized pockets, certainly a jacket pocket easily enough so its more portable than the iPad.  Your not held to randsom by iTunes... a positive for any device!You can EDIT office documents... so its become useful as a business tool as well, enabling me to edit excel docs on the go and being able to access the file structure is handy for transporting files, sending attachements etc.Try it... give it a day to get used to it and youll love it, i dont go anywhere without mine! (buy a case to protect it, its all shiney plastic, noone likes scratches!)
I spent about 15-20 mins with this tablet in the Samsung showroom today. So my review is limited and doesnt cover all features/aspects:1) Form Factor - gadget looks really sophisticated and is built well. for some reason i was expecting it to be larger in size but with a 7inch screen it surprised me.2) Screen - very bright and crisp. i saw few videos and they looked really sharp.3) Speed - i was surprised to see how fast the apps loaded and the touch screen was over responsive (in a positive way)4) Android - some reviews say that its clutterred and i would agree with them. wow factor which comes after seeing the hardware did not come when i used the interface. i found the ios much more sophisticated and appealing to look at.5) Weight - i dont know how much it weighs but for this size it does feel really heavy. after 15 mins i was feeling tired holding it. i tried to play one NFS game which was installed and that was it. i didnt want to use it any more. while the size is almost perfect to carry around, its weight is a definite problem for me.6) price - at $650 i think most people will give skip buying this. no doubt its a great device but i dont think it worth this much.overall i think its a great product. one should wait till the prices drop.
Pros:Small, fit in jean back pocketPretty fast for 1gzVery nice looking displayDual camera,microsd slot.DROIDGood battery lifeCons,3G is slow, only getting 1-3 bars average.$30 plan get you 300mb, I almost use it up the first dayPretty thick, bezel too.This will get old after next Spring.I really give this 4.75 stars.
I did a ton of research on the various tablets and this definitely lives up to all expectations and then some!  I highly recommend this over the Apple iPad.
I purchased my first, on the first day it was available for sale at T-Mobile...WOW...I then bought 3 more (4 days later)one for wife and two kids...Its a Game Changer...best electronic device I have ever owned...It is absolutely amazing...Fast and limitless applications...My kids are 16 and believe they should have it to compete in the world...I CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT! Gorgeous screen and easy to use...I love gadgets...if you do to...get it!
Honestly I had the Tab for 24Hrs and I ahve nothing to say about the device itself. It's stylish, fast, smart, well built, slick and feels nice holding it. But I had a problem with T-Mobile 3G Network which I never had before. After 30 Minutes of browsing the Web, I couldn't go anywhere except to the T-Mobile site. And every time I try from there, it loops me back to a T-Mobile secure login page. I was on the phone with T-Mobile for 2Hrs, spoke to 6 people and nobody seems to know what was causing the device or the plan to do that to have my web browsing limited to T-Mobile site. I took the Tab to the store and they aslo couldn't explain the problem. They offered me another Tab, but I lost the desire of getting a Samsung Tab, asked for a refund and got an iPad instead. I really do recommond the Samsung Tab if you can't afford an ipad. BUT NOT WITH T-MOBILE. I say try Verizon.
i finally got hold of a t-mobile person, he didn't know himself, but transferred me to another dept and stayed on the line in case i was dropped into dial-tone land againThe answer from T-Mobile  is the pre-paid no contract, no discounts $700 plus with tax t mobile galaxy tab that is wi/fi and broadband capable  will have to purchase a prepaid broadband  plan, and use our $$  broadband for many of the services and features, including slacker radio,  and downloading apps . Registering and using many of the pre-installed apps,including email is crippled by t mobile undwr wi-fi  and  I must pay for broadband usage even though wi fi is readily available. My brother has a ipad and i was able to do  everything wifi,, the apple store guy said that many people were getting the Mi-Fi devices and using it as  a wireless router and running all their devices on wifi from it, in places where only broadband was availableIt is going back, i can only browse the web with a lousy  proprietaty  browser for over $700 with tax.
Look, it's great and android 2.2 but honestly I guess I'm a dumb apple guy who just wants it sleek and simple. I think apple products feel much higher quality to hold and use. Galaxy screen is so slick and sprint white plastic back so slick it almost feels greasy. Don't like android so much. it's just too chaotic for me. meep it clean and simple.anyway, I'm not trashing this thing at all sorry if it seems that way. but if apple did a 7 i'd be all over it. tab just feels kind of cheap and way overpriced for a 7 (im rationalizing that it has camera so that's worth the extra 200?)i think this product is worth maybe...300, if sony did one it would be cooler and worth 400-450, apple - 450-550600 is too much period!may return it and get a viewsonic or archos 7 can they really be 300 dollars worse? maybejust my opinion.
If you dont mind it locking up all the time, and you don't mind the fact that it operates no differently that a big phone, and don't care that it looks and feels cheap, then it's just ok... (Buy an iPad).
If you want an Android tablet running the latest version, able to play all the latest apps and flash video, don't buy this tablet. If you want an Android tablet you can root or upgrade, don't bother, you will not be happy. If you want it to be an Ipad, forget about it.However, if you want a $250 color e-reader that has a stable OS, long battery life, and a seven inch 800x600 touchscreen you will be pleased. You will be more pleased with the capability to surf the internet, check e-mail and load simple apps. The Cruz comes preloaded with the Kindle reader and most other e-readers can be downloaded from freewarelovers.com.  The screen size, the rubber back, touch screen, wifi, and all day battery life make this an excellent e-reader that compares well with the Nook color. The new version of the Android Kindle app (which can be downloaded from freewarelovers.com) also allows you to download magazines in color.As an e-reader with expanded capabilities the Cruz is a great product and I am very pleased with it. Out of the box, the software is very stable, the battery is 75% charged and the Kindle app is ready to go. As a cutting edge Galaxy or Ipad competitor, the Cruz falls short, but it is much cheaper than those devices. I describe the Cruz to my friends as a  Kindle version of the Nook Color. A "Kindle Color" is the best way to describe it.I have loaded my Cruz with the following apps, all obtained from freewarelovers.com or the web, and they all work well: Kindle, Overdrive Media Console (for library e-books), Kobo Reader, Aldiko Reader, Wapedia, Newspapers, Reuters, Iheartradio, Skyfire browser and Dolphin browser.
I recieved this device for Christmas, and was a little concerned given all the negative reviews I've seen. But I must say, after having it for a while now, I really like it. And this is totally honest, and I don't work for VM. It does everything I wanted it to do. It's an awesome e-reader, it has excellent video playback, I can surf the web easily and I've been able to install a ton of apps from Android Market alternatives.My only con would be not having flash and You Tube video access, but that was not my primary reason for wanting this item. I think too, people are extremely critical without knowing enough about the device or not really playing with the device enough before judging. I'm sooooooo glad I didn't spend $400-600 on an Ipad, when all I wanted is what is on this device.I would suggest, that before you purchase, go to the website and read the manual. Find out if it does the things you need it to do, and if it does, it will be a great purchase. If not, buy an Ipad.
I gave this to a seven year old for Christmas because she was always using my phone to play games.PROS:Kindle app is great on this device.Movies look and play great, i was surprised how good they look and it's really easy to put them on the SD card and play them.Plays MP3s, again easy to put the mp3s on the sd card and play.Free simple games that she likes and it's better on the bigger screen than on my phone.Battery life is great, I was surprised how long it lasts even on the internet and playing movies.She has all her pictures on there and she can show them to her friends, etc.CONS:Slow processor, doesn't support any newer games.Android 2.0 - old OS is slow and doesn't support newer games. Update: They now have an update on their site to Android 2.2 and it is much better.No access to app market and finding apps is tedious especially since a lot of them don't install.Doesn't support flash, though skyfire browser lets you play flash.No camera.Mixed feelings:Capacitive touch screen - although better than any resistive screen I've used, it's not as good as other capacitive screens I've used, probably because of the slow processor.The stand is nice but it was designed to use with a charger that has a 90 degree bend and not the straight one that comes with it.I am fairly happy with it. For the price it replaces a book reader, movie player, mp3 player, and she can play games on it. She loves it, but I would need more if it was for me. It's a good introduction device for her.
As mentioned in a prior review, the T301 does not link to the Android market.  So although it runs a now outdated version of Android, selling it as an Android tablet is somewhat misleading.  If all you want is a color e-reader with a couple extras, then this product may do the trick.  If you're looking for an iPad alternative you will likely be very disappointed.  And it sounds like the tech support is lacking, though I have no personal experience with this myself.There have been a few fake reviews that were recently removed from this product page...so beware that overly positive writeups may in fact not be from actual users not employed by VM.
Okay I admit without the support of the android market app to download any good apps it's not a good deal but most of the games and other apps are scaled to fit a smaller screen so they do not look well on the 7" or even worst on a 10.1" screen.. The product is to new for any judgment negative or positive, this item has great potential.. I like mine fits in a pocket too small for anyone to notice and wanna steal it. I like it almost as much as my EVO not restricted to use ITUNES load music or movie play's AVI files no problems.. We need developers to start scaling up the apps to fit I am able to load most APk files and install it straight from the SD card
Unfortunately, the store that sold ours to us, no one there really knew a lot about it at the time, so when I had problems, calling the store was not helpful.  It did not come with a manual, and it had problems connecting to the internet right off, and error messages in the programs.  I contacted support and was told to download the program from the website and reload the reader.  After finding a brief manual at the cruz website, reloading the program, I still have problems.  I am sad to say I have downloaded 12 books and no pictures, no music, no other programs and it is telling me I am out of space already.  I find this not user friendly.  Maybe I got a lemon..I hope to take it back for a refund.  sorry to be so down on it because I was really excited about it being able to download and search the web.
I do not understand why these devices would bother packaging obsolete versions of software.Android 2.0 is significantly slower than 2.2 and upward.  You would have to hack this thing to make it work as fast as it should.
I was really looking forward to liking this tablet. Immediately, however, it began to disappoint. First, it's really thick!  Also First:  this is not a multi-touch tablet. My bad, I should have caught that when I ordered it. I should not have assumed.Second, the keypad touchscreen interface is very, very awkward. Missed letters and slow response make typing painful and error-prone.Third, the UI is downright ugly. It really looks like my experimental Linux desktop after I spent hours getting it installed and running 8 years ago - sparse and clunky. Just a couple of apps.Fourth: The browser is really a dog. It reminds me of the browser my Nokia clamshell phone had in 2004. To zoom in, you double-touch. To zoom out - same. That's it. No variable scaling. Did I mention there is no multi-touch? OK, getting over it.How about I play one of the tens of thousands of games on the android market? Ummm, let's see, where's that Android Market app? Sorry - no Android Market. There is the Cruz Market, though, so that's gotta have the same apps I like, right? Nope. In fairness, I didn't search for Czech HangMan, just those Angry Birds, which were nowhere to be found.Other problem: The touchscreen started randomizing the calibration points. Once that happened, the unit wouldn't even unlock, as I had to guess where to touch the screen. That required a system reset, but in the meantime provided a modicum of entertainment.It's an unfair comparison, given the 2.5x cost difference, but I was given an iPad this Christmas, and while the roads on the Apple-only Turnpike I'm forced to drive on collect frequent tolls, at least the roads are paved. That iPad personal entertainment device sure does handle nicely.So I prepare for return my sad Cruz Tablet with all the technological flash of a pre-gladsnost Moscow taxi, with its lonley sparse desktop and nowhere to get decent apps.  Shall I keep it and hope that I can find something to do with it?  Why Bother?Back to Cruz with you, my sad friend. Do Svidaniya.
I was excited to get the Cruz Tablet and after a couple weeks of use I find it to be an expensive e-reader that you can also use as a paperweight.  The functionality is extremely slow, the touchscreen is very unresponsive and about as sensitive as a rock and the application store is nothing short of a joke.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone for the simple fact that you can spend an extra 200 dollars and get an i-pad which makes this tablet seem like a 20 year old piece of technology.  Please save your money and get an i-pad or dell has a great new laptop that doubles as a tablet.  I've used both and they are amazing products.  This Cruz Tablet is nothing more than a 300 dollar book reader that you can check your email on.
A friend of mine who owns a Velocity Micro computer suggested that I buy a Cruz tablet.This product allows me to view my books just about anywhere with the benefit of having Wi-Fi so I can browse, check eMail and listen to streaming audio while doing other things. Wi-Fi works very well, and the device is portable enough that I can take it anywhere.The built in Kindle application is amazing and works very well.I have only dabbled with the video playback, but it seems rather smooth with clear sound.The eReader functionality works great and the device has a very clear screen.
Well, I really should have read the other reviews more carefully, but I guess I was just hoping my experience would be better.  I got this b/c I didn't like the limitations of the kindle and I didn't want to spend the 600 bucks on an ipad.  But this thing didnt do anything except turn on.  My husband played with it for a couple of hours and he couldn't even get magazines to download.  we couldn't even test the battery life!  Its too bad b/c its a nice looking device and the color and screen were beautiful but it didn't do anything is the bottm line.  Sorry Velocity Micro T301 cruz, this is not a good device.
I have yet to purchase a tablet, but I am doing constant research for what I want to get in a slate.  The Cruz Tablet is just about what I am looking for.First, if you know nothing or very little about smartphones, computers, etc., then don't get a slate and then complain about it.  Learn about it first then buy one.  And don't ever ask a salesperson about any kind of electronic device.  They only know enough to make a sale, not serve as tech support.Second, yes the Cruz Tablet has an outdated software version.  Hack the tablet and load up what you want, or stop complaining about the software.Third, fake reviews or not, an Android device will have its ups and downs, just like an Apple device and a Microsoft device.  Given the current state of the tablet slice of the market, I believe a lot of companies have done good with delivering some decent tablets.Fourth, and last point, if you want a tablet to do what the iPad does but are looking for an alternative, just bite the bullet and buy a doggone iPad!
It does everything I wanted it to do, and better than I expected. Web surfing is quick and effortless. Plays videos and MP3s very well, nice loud speakers.  Overall, for a 1st generation Android-based tablet, this is a really nice piece and deserves a close look. Accessories are far from plentiful, but hopefully that will improve over time.
I new very little about Velocity prior to purchasing a gaming PC for the first time.  I recently evaluated their T301 Cruz tablet and was very pleased.  Versatile and well-built.  I had a support issue after purchase and was helped right away.  I would recommend this tablet.  So far, Velocity has treated me very well.
Battery Life:  Personally, this has to be on my top 2 priorities.  I own several toys/gadgets, great as some may be, once the battery goes out, I'm sorely disappointed.  Hate the several hours of wait time for them to charge back up.  So they either get very little use or go back in the original package and into the closet.  Now this Galaxy Tab I've been using heavily over the past 3 days, during last week's long X'mas holiday, and it still has about 10% charge left in it.  This said, it only took about 3.5 hours to re-charge and power it back up to 100%.  Excellent.Portability:  Perfect size, perfect screen size for yours truly.  I can finally and easily now see a lot of things as compared to my tiny smartphone screen.  Fits tightly in my jeans back pocket, but fits nicely in my cargo pants pockets.  I now carry it or have it nearby for use all over the house.  Also, a quality built, solid product in my humble opinion.Display:  Awesome, just beautiful, 1024X600 pixel res.  Turn on any of the live wallpaper screens and its better and/or comparable to my home LED and Plasma TV displays.Touchscreen:  Outstanding.  I'm a desktop, mouse-kinda-guy, but am now a touchscreen newbie convert.  Go ahead and try this touch pad Tab out at  BestBuy or any one of the phone carrier's stores.Internet:  Super fast WiFi surfing.  I'm benchmarking this in comparison to my HP 14 inch, 4 GB RAM, dual core, laptop.  Excellent on AT&T;'s basic speed, lightning fast on Cox cable and AT&T;'s higher U-verse setup.  Google search also works on voice command.  Haven't had a need to switch to an alternative browser such as Dolphin since the basic browser works just fine for my purposes.  Also haven't signed up for a data plan; still using WiFi for everything I've needed or wanted to do.Front Camera:  1.3 MB only; sweet for taking self-portraits and more using the front display screen.  Device is an eye catcher, conversation piece at the clubs & dive bars.  LoL.  You also can visit YouTube for the vids & how-to's using Fring, Qik, and Skype.  Great shame though that all the US carriers dissected the voice calling feature on this device.  I am not doing away with my smartphone, but AT&T; voice calling service on the GT would have been a nice extra, just in case.  Also, note that this AT&T; device has a removable/swappable SIM card port.Back Camera:  3.0 MB only; good indoor quality, better for sunlight/daytime pics.  Sample Galaxy Tab pics available at Yahoo's Flickr.  Biggie:  This is the only tablet out there with an autofocus camera that comes with a flash feature!Storage:  16 GB internal with up to 32 GB removable/swappable miroSD card; already installed an 8 GB microSD card in my Tab.  Prefer using the external card memory for all my stuff versus using the internal available limited storage.Bluetooth:  Super sweet!  Easily paired up with GF's and my laptop and our Nokia smartphones.  Have moved a bunch of my pics over, both from my smartphone and laptop.  More to move over.  The Gallery app is great.  Thing is, because of the Tab's hi-res screen display, any of the low-res pics I've taken clearly shows the image imperfections when zoomed out.  An analogy would be like watching a VHS tape on my 1080 LED screen, not a good quality output display.  I now just have to start taking digital pics with my other camera, set maybe at 5 GBs or more res.Android Apps:  Have checked these out some and yet have to find one I'd want to download in the GT.  100,000+ apps; who's got the time for this mega searching?.  Not into games, might load a Chess game, but that's about it.  Comes installed with 2 icon pages of AT&T;'s apps, i.e., Maps, Navigation works both touch type or voice command, music, video, MyFiles, Flash support, QikOffice, etc.  Also, found very usable loaded Widgets to place in my homescreen, i.e., one-touch for WiFi connection, Bluetooth, refresh, etc.  Signed up for a Gmail account, great app for sending out my txt messages and e-mails.Voice/Video Calls: I've downloaded both Fring and Skype on my Tab to make voice calls or video calls (I'm using WiFi for this). Both apps are loaded in the "Market" app of the Tab. Free calls to other signed up/members. Some charges apply to non Fring or Skype folks. Its all explained in their respective web sites.Media Hub:  Limited movies and not exactly cheap to purchase one.Lastly, AT&T; has excellent on-line GT tutorials & I've also downloaded the user's manual for just about all the important info I need to know.  Check out the GT's specs and all it has to offer.  If any or all of the above features appeal to your liking, BUY ONE! I highly recommend this product.  & you'll also help push to get the economy going!.  :^)  For the Naysayers out there:  There is no such thing, or ever will be, a "perfect" product.  Not even Einstein could find a Universal Theory.Excerpt from CNET's GT review (Oct 2010):  In fairness, what we enjoy most about the Galaxy Tab is that it's not trying to exactly copy the iPad's blueprint for success. Sure, Samsung's notepad, calendar, and photo apps look like pixel-for-pixel reproductions of the iPad's, but let's not overlook the fact that the Tab is half the size of the iPad. It's a different type of product that presents a different use case, one geared more for portability. That said, the Android smartphone market seems to cover a lot of this territory already. The Tab is also reaching out to all of the people who winced at the iPad's lack of Adobe Flash support, video camera, memory expansion, and drag-and-drop file support. If these are the features that have been holding you back from purchasing a tablet, then the Tab should be a perfect match.
I have had this AT&T; GT for 4 days now and it is a keeper for me, I would have given it 5 stars but read on.  I have had a few Droid phones and currently use a Droid2, I also have a 7" rebranded Haipad 701 running 2.2.1 so I have a fair amount of Droid experience.  Right out of the box this unit runs very solid and smooth, the capacitive touch screen is so easy to use in comparison to the 701's resistive screen.  That is what I hoped for; flicking, scrolling, tapping, choosing accurately etc is a big frustration on the 701 but very nice on the GT.  WiFi works great, I was on line within minutes of opening the box.  There are many apps that you can install to make your GT suit your use/lifestyle, great versatility.Obviously I really like this GT but that does not mean it is perfect, therefore the 4 stars. It has some Samsung issues and AT&T; has done their best to cripple it to their advantage which is a shame, but all the vendors cripple their GT's (like they do their phones) just in different ways.1st Issue: The included Browser is really clunky and just plain bad.  If you run Flash on it, the Browser slows way down and scrolling pages is jerky and....L.S.S.: just download Dolphin Browser from the Market, problem solved.2nd: AT&T; has it set up to stop all app loading unless the apps are from the Market-there are ways around it though (Google to get help).3rd: Euro carriers allow it to be a phone in Europe but this has been crippled in the States, I don't want this feature myself but there are ways to get that functionality (Google it).4th: US carriers have, naturally, cut off the ability to wireless tether it to a rooted phone running the "Wireless Tether" app, there are ways...(Google it).5th: All carriers load a lot of bloatware on the GT (not surprising) you can get rid of it if you want to.There are other things that need attention too but I can't think of any that can't be cured with a little, or sometimes a lot of careful research and implementation (except the current price). Unfortunately some of these changes can void your warranty.  It is a shame that Android, the supposed "open" OS is saddled with Samsung and US carrier crippling.  But for some people overcoming these obstacles is a challenge.
I received the Samsung Galaxy Tab as an early Christmas present. This device is hands down brilliant! I absolutely love it. It has a great, big, bright screen. Surfing the web, reading books, watch HD videos, it excels at all of these tasks and more. The battery hold a good charge and lasts for hours. The software is very stable and quite responsive. The tablet also works perfectly with my Microsoft Bluetooth keyboard.There are a few things about the tablet that are kind of annoying:1. AT&T; as always has put a bunch of bloatware applications on the tablet that I haven't been able to remove. I have not rooted the device yet, and I'm sure once I do I will be able to remove the applications, but the point is I shouldn't have to root it to get the crap off it. Update, I was able to Easily root this device with Z4root (from the market), and I was able to rid out all the AT&T; apps that I didn't want.2. There is a front mount camera, but there are no applications that allow for tablet to PC video calls.All in all I do think it is a great Android tablet and I definitely recommend it.
I gave this as an early gift to my partner and he has not put it down since receiving it. The screen is brilliant, the Wi-Fi excellent, and AT&T; 3G is great for on the go web surfing. You will not regret purchasing this tablet. it is easy to hold in one hand and type in the other, unlike the iPad which is too big to do this. You get all of the apps in the Andriod Market and they look surprisingly great. I had read some reviews that stated the apps weren't made for a tablet screen but you sure can't tell by looking at them on this high-resolution screen. Amazon is perfect as always.
I just recieved the Galaxy Tab today and activated, haven't put it down yet for about two hours, haven't even eaten yet....lol...But anway if you're looking for a great experience on the big screen from your cell phone this it...The only thing I personally don't like which I'm sure everyone else agrees with me is the fact that you can't use it as a phone...The only version that can use this tab as a phone is Europe for now....Hopefully it'll come to the US soon....I have the iphone 3G and the Samsung Galaxy tab now, which I downgraded my iphone plan to 200 mb instead of 2GB which I purchased for my Galaxy since I'll be on it more now....So for my recommendations I HIGHLY recommend this tablet for anyone, young and old....
I like the Tab and its really cute for video.  I like playing a few apps but wish there were more.I like the feel and ease of use.  Texting is ok but not like the smartphones.  I rather attach a keyboard as mention which is a bit stupid since I have to pick it up to make a phone call.  Its a bit weird in that sense.  I haven't rooted this yet and I wish i could take off the bloat crap thats on there.Overrall, if you have one of the smartphones HTC, EVO, etc... This cannot compare.  Its not what I expected.  I don't like the images and I wish they remove the back camera.  The front camera is awesome but can't find any program to do face time or anything.  I love taking this tab on the road but I don't have anyone to face time with yet so... I guess it will take some time for Samsung to get everyone up and running.I wish there was more.  I wanted this to be my main on the go phone, netbook, and ipad.  But its not.I like it but willing to sell!!
I've been playing around with the Zii O for a couple of days by now. It's not a perfect device, but it's really good for the amount i paid.First up - I've been looking for a tablet to watch my movies without bringing my Macbook along. I'm a real TV/Movie buff, and i have tonnes to catch up on. That's a huge reason why i didn't want to get the iPad; It's expensive, required tiresome video conversion, and i thought it was too heavy after playing with it in the stores.The Good:- Supported movie formats are more than what i need: Most of mine are in the usual .avi formats, and i used to spend about 6 minutes on each episode using Mac's iSquint to convert them into accepted .mp4 formats. With this tablet, all i need to do is to just drag and drop it. Everything just works and plays great.- MicroSD Card Slot: I have a 32GB MicroSD to go along with the 8GB Zii O. It's really convenient because 32GB can hold alot of videos and music, and the tablet allows direct playback from the microSD. You don't need to copy it to the on-board memory in order for it to work.- Apps: Here's a key point - You'll need to go into Settings > Apps to allow installation for non-Android Market Applications. It wasn't enabled by default. Once you enable this, just google around for Android installation files (.apk) and you'll be able to install stuff smoothly. So far, i've installed Evernote and Kindle; Everything syncs and works perfectly.Some of you may have concerns about there not being support for the Android Marketplace. It wasn't that big of a deal for me because a friend pointed me to getjar.com, and there was a whole lot of .apk files to download. Just use the Zii O browser to access the site, download, and they'll prompt you for installation. No need to use your computer at all. (If getjar prompts you to select your device, just select any mobile device. It'll work fine.)- This may be controversial, but i like the resistive screen. It's not fancy like those capacitive touch, but it works with my gloves on, and even better with the provided stylus, so i'm happy about it.- Other stuff i like: Audio quality is really good. HDMI TV-Out to my 42-inch screen works, though the video looks a little pixelated, something to blame on my original source file.Things Which Can Be Improved:- No Android Marketplace integration. (A small issue, but solvable through my above-mentioned point)- A little stingy on the package contents; I appreciate the stylus, but would have been nice to include a pair of earphones, or even the TV Out cable.- There are 4 touch-buttons at the bottom for easy access to "Home", "Back" etc buttons. They should be backlit so that i can see more clearly in the dark.---I hope i've provided everyone with an objective pro/cons list. Personally, i like it, and i think it's great for anyone who's looking for a low-cost tablet which just works.
Got this as a gift and spent a few days with it. I do own an iPad.Pros- My media files do not need to be processed by iTunes, I can just drag and drop to the ZiiO after it was recognized by my PC as a USB drive.- I can play all the video files I loaded to it, even up to 1080p trailers, play it back on the HDMI on my large LCD TV and it looks great.- The player is much lighter than the iPad.- The micro SD card slot is very convenient, after loading it with media from my PC, pop it in and had no problem browsing through the files.Cons- Resistive touch. I got used to it, it was not that bad.- Display is not as good as iPad. But then given that the unit is about half of what an iPad sells for, it is very usable.- Android 2.1 only, I expect they will offer an upgrade to Android 2.2 in the future.Ran the Quadrant benchmark and got a score of 2037! That is more than the Moto Droid X 2.2+.I was able to run Kindle and download books on it. No problem with Maps and Street View either.I am a happy camper!____________________________Updated: April 8, 2011I upgraded my ZiiO to the latest firmware release(Froyo) and I am still a happy camper as it supports Flash now. I hope they will release an accelerated Flash plug in soon then it will be awesome for the value of this tablet!Oh, I just bought an iPAD2, still frustrated that there is no Flash support. Probably will return it or put in on eBay as it is not such a big improvement over the first gen iPAD._____________________________Updated: Sept 22, 2011Looks like Creative finally posted a new firmware (2.00.14) and the accelerated Flash Player to go with it. I upgraded it and it works fine.
I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife but, while it was in transit, she told me she wanted a kindle instead! I intended to send it back to Creative but I opened it up and have been playing with it for the past few days. It's great. The browsing experience is excellent, I just sit on my sofa and browse away. There's a pile of apps available, more than I could ever use. I love the BBC, Time and NY Times apps so far. The resistive touch screen is absolutely fine, very responsive...I don't see what all the fuss is about. The buttons on the bottom should be backlit, especially as I change orientation of the screen I tend to lose track of those buttons. The ebook reader is nice but I can't read text too long on backlit screens (I have a kindle for that). All in all, very nice.
I have owned the ZIIO 7 for only a few days and normally it takes me more time to form my opinion.What I was locking for is a video player with more than a cell phone screen. I am also interested in ebook readers. Thirdly, price, the iPad attracts me but is priced as much as a very good netbook computer that can do as much (and more) than an iPad.The Ziio is a good video player with excellent sound and an adequate sized screen for VGA resolution. I find the touch screen responsive and precise. Had I not read that it is "older" resistive technology I would not have noticed because it works and it works well. Navigation is easy and it is easy to add Android apps.Wireless communications is supported better than many higher priced tablets. Another feature that I appreciate is the multitude of audio and video files type that are supported without a slow and messy conversion software. As for ebook reader, you can get an app to read pdf files and the result is better than the 6" Amazon kindle (I own one) and with a free app you can import books designed for the kindle and have a good reader (in color). I give Kindle the edge because I like the daylight e-ink reading ability and the Kindle has far longer battery life. Another advantage the Kindle has is its weight, the ziio weighs almost as much as the iPad whereas the Kindle is much lighter and less tiresome to hold. I would tolerate the heavier ziio for a hundred dollars more than the Kindle because you get many other entertainment and productivity options. Ziio has a good free hand pen pad that lets you take notes freehand. With a camera and video support with an accelerometer to keep you pointed up.I like the ziio and it appears to be a sturdy and well made product with plenty of Android apps (many free) on Creative's web site. Creative makes quality and value priced electronic devices and they support what they sell. You don't need to make an appointment at the "genius bar" to get your questions answered.
This is probably going to be the most acurrate review of the Creative ziio out. To start with the screen quality is very good especially for the price. The touch screen isn't bad at all considering its resistive. Very usable though in fact I've yet to use the stylus. The browser and internet is pretty good.I added opera because its my favorite android browser. The audio is also very good. It would defanitlly benifit  from android market and android 2.2 . Sometimes the tilt on the screen isn't allways smooth but a future update should take care of that. Battery life seems decent. For the price its pretty good considering Samsungs tablet is like 600.00 dollars and apples is like 500.00 dollars.  Videos look good too. I wanted a tablet but didn't want to spend a boat load on one im pretty happy with this Creative Ziio . I install apps thrue creatives site with opera because there browser didn't seem to let me download the programs.
I was looking for an inexpensive Android-based tablet just to play around with. The price was right for this, but after an hour of struggling with it, I packed it up for return.For one thing, it's only Android 2.1. I knew that going in, and I don't know how much difference it made. So I can't criticize that.What I can criticize is the fact that it seemed very buggy. The buttons at the bottom of the screen were difficult to activate. The unit froze a number of times and had to be rebooted. The screen itself was not particularly responsive.The worst aspect though was the lack of an Android Market application. Even worse, when I tried to install a couple of apps--Evernote and Kindle--it was impossible to do so. They (Creative) have their own market, apparently, and they have a "trap" that diverts you to that market when you try to install anything directly. And in the case of the two apps I mentioned, installation was blocked by their software. They say you can download to a PC, and copy to the unit, then install from there, but there was no real way to do that, as the file explorer application on the unit didn't display the folders that I could see from my PC.I'm not a computer wimp. I'm willing to put up with a lot. But this definitely wasn't worth the trouble.
This is a terrible product. Don't waste your money. It is a buggy mess; it should not have been brought to market yet.
After mulling over the Archos 101 back in October, and increasingly frustrated with their delays, I found this gem in my local SEARS.  It has a Nvidia Tegra 2 chipset, which you will probably be hearing about increasingly in 2011.  A really nice device overall, but it's not without its faults which I will summarize.  First, the hardware....Hardware Pros:- Tegra 2 chipset dual-core with 512MB RAM.  Bleeding edge hardware, so much that the software has not caught up, yet (see more on that, below).- MicroSD slot, which supports up to 32GB.- A full USB port. You can hook up peripheral devices to it, such as a USB keyboard.- Micro USB port (not proprietary) , for mounting to your PC.  Forgot your cable and you're at a friends house?  No worries, just use any micro USB and you are in.- Front facing camera.  It's not the best, but it works.Hardware Cons:- The LCD.  Yes, ironic given that this is packaged by a company known for its displays.  The 1024x600 10 inch screen is essentially a netbook screen.  It's actually not bad at all when looking at it straight on, but the viewing angles are not very good.  This is critical if you were planning on using this as a gaming device where you'll be moving it around.- h264 support is limited.  This is confusing to some, as technically h264 works in certain configurations.  1080p "high profile" encoded videos do not work, whereas "main profile" does work.  The bottom line here is that you might find issues with certain high-def videos that will be very choppy or flat out crash the device.  My understanding is that this is a limitation of the Tegra 2 chipset itself.The hardware is very impressive, overall.  However, where this device loses a full point is the software that is supplied out-of-the-box.  Although it's Android based, the stock launcher is replaced with a interface called "Tap N' Tap", which is actually a third party vendor.  I don't particularly like the interface myself - it's slow, buggy with a tendency to "Force Close" very often, and the Marketplace that's been recently added is very different than the Android Marketplace you might be used to on your phone (and not in a good way).  Overall, it's just plain bad.If you are technically inclined or don't mind thinking outside the box, there are already several alternate firmware replacements for the device that can be found by Googling "Viewsonic G Tablet xda-developers". These mods can turn the device into something you are more familiar with, if you use an Android phone.  But, keep in mind that these alterations are not supported by Viewsonic and you could void your warranty.  So buyer beware.The other major problem is that Android itself is not built for tablets, yet.  But version 2.3 is about to be released, which could change things considerably in the next few months.  Whether or not the GTablet eventually gets an official 2.3 release, or a more Android-looking interface that is fully supported by Viewsonic is anyone's guess at this point - so, just know what you are getting into.12/21/10 EDIT:  The next official firmware slated for release this week by VS should allow the user to bypass the Tap N' Tap homescreen, and use a more vanilla Android interface.  This is a step in the right direction, imo.04/17/11 EDIT:  I've gotten some heat for the title of "Next Gen Hardware".  Remember, this was written in December - that's an eternity in technology terms.  The GPU is actually still up-to-date as of this writing, but Android devices with better screens are starting to show up (ie. the Xoom and soon the Transformer).  So just keep in mind when this review was written....04/23/11 EDIT:  I'm hearing reports that these new Amazon GTablets MIGHT be arriving with the latest Viewsonic firmware - this firmware adds a lockscreen, Adobe Flash and French / Spanish languages and a few other things.  You can tell if you have this new firmware if you go into Settings -- About Tablet and check the TapUI version -- "1.2" means the new firmware, and "1.1" means the old firmware.If you have a "1.2" firmware, please be careful with mods on XDA (as of this writing) as they are generally built around the "1.1" firmware, only.  Or, alternatively, you can try the few 1.2-based mods at Slatedroid (just Google "Slatedroid Gtablet 1.2" and you'll find them).  You can downlevel your firmware from 1.2 to 1.1 - but there is a small chance that you could soft-brick your device, especially if you don't read directions carefully - there are specific steps to take.  Just be careful, and have fun with your new tablet!7/28/2011 EDIT:  VS has recently stated that there will be no Honeycomb support for the GTAB.  However, there are unofficial mods on both XDA and Slatedroid.com, if you are willing to risk it and void your warranty of course.  And 1.2 based firmware has become much more common on XDA, since April.  If you do plan to mod your GTAB, just be aware of the differences between these branches so you don't risk a soft-brick.2/10/2012 EDIT:  There is a new update (build 5699) for the Gtablet that's now live, but still Froyo-based.  However, Viewsonic has now officially (and since this is now a week old I'm guessing there's no going back) moved to a 1.2 firmware base.  Again, I would be wary of any older mods that are 1.1-based as you could soft-brick your tablet.  But, given that this has been a known factor for almost a year now, hopefully most of the mods have taken this into consideration - best to read the mod's release notes to be certain.Also, there is an unofficial ICS beta for the Gtablet, care of TeamDRH (teamdrh.com will get you to their site).  As with any mod, use at your own risk but for a beta product I've found it to be fairly stable.  Kudos to that team for their hard work!
I own a G Tablet.  I like my G Tablet.  Let me tell you why no-one is raving about the G Tablet.The electronics exceed the iPad at time of writing.  The form factor is nothing to write home about.  The viewing angles on the screen are sub-par, which is surprising given the device's provenance.  The Tap n' Tap user interface is a disaster.  I say again, a disaster.  Slow, inelegant, and insufficient.There is good news.  First, the price is right.  It can be had for as little as $380.00, a far cry from its competitors.  Second, the user interface can be replaced.  There are communities of individuals (XDA), who have very graciously put their hard work and talent into producing replacement ROMs for this device which override the existing software with something that is much closer to the standard Android OS and that interfaces correctly with the Android App Market.  It is DIY, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-dig-into-it work to install a new ROM and get it running properly.  Even then there will be charming bugs to fix.  Expect this to become a minor hobby.In conclusion, the G Tablet is a conditionally five-star device.  It is inexpensive, the hardware is perfectly solid, and a technically minded individual who is willing to spend some time tinkering with it can turn it into a very useful tool.If you are Viewsonic, or work for Viewsonic, or know somebody who's cousin might work at Viewsonic, then please tell them; ditch Tap n' Tap as soon as humanly possible.
I purchased this unit in Dec 2010.  Out of the box, the unit is horrible.  The software that Viewsonic loads it with is slow, clunky, and really unusable.  However, it is extremely simple to flash any number of Android roms on the device. This gives the device FULL Android functionality and, perhaps more importantly, speeds the device up far beyond other tablets.  I highly encourage potential buyers to search the internet for videos showing the device running other roms (there are also videos explaining exactly how to load the roms on the device).The only other downside to this unit is the screen.  When viewed straight-on it looks fine, however if viewed at an angle it does not.  But for about $200 less than a comparable iPad you'll still have a device that runs blazingly fast, has Android market access, and the power of Android...if you take the time to load a rom on it.
Viewsonic has recently updated (mine was updated yesterday 12-23-2010) the software and added functionality to their G-Tablet which now makes this little tablet computer a complete winner. If you are interested in a 10" tablet, get this one asap. I've played with all three major tablets, Ipad, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Viewsonic. The Viewsonic competes or beats all three in almost every category. The biggest rap against the G-tab is probably the viewing angle on the screen. You pretty much have to be right in front of it to see the screen clearly. But overall you can go where you want to go and have a great internet experience with the G-Tablet.I bought the Viewsonic Gtablet right around Thanksgiving because it had (or was supposed to have soon) everything I wanted in a tablet computer...that is, a tablet I could use like a PC. Back then the Viewsonic did not have the updates it has now, which is what makes this little tablet such a bargain. Waiting for Viewsonic to deliver proved to be a good move. While many people tweaked theirs to make it better, many others who are not as tech savvy returned theirs. This could have proved to be a mistake if demand now exceeds supply. My patience was rewarded with a great little device.Is it perfect? No, but it just blows the doors off the competition re overall function (it's fast, has flash and a clean user interface with enough apps to keep me busy (yes, even Angry Birds) as apps are added) and price (you won't find a Galaxy Tab or Ipad for anything near $399.) Once people realize what a deal this tablet is compared to the Galaxy and the Ipad, they may be more difficult to find and purchase.SUMMARY: Viewsonic stumbled badly in their rush to get this tablet to market, but they've made it right. And, updates will continue to be made which will make this tablet PC even better.
I reviewed this tablet expecting a powerful ipad killer (yeah I said it) that needs some modification to work well.After getting the G-Tablet I immediately flashed cyanogenmod 6.1 beta 4 onto it.  If you don't know what flashing a ROM means or you haven't heard of cyanogenmod then this tablet just isn't for you.... yet.  Perhaps Viewsonic will solve the software issue that plagues this powerful device, but until then its a piece of junk out of the box.The G-Tablet feels pretty solid.  It has a 10 inch screen, however it is not the same size as the ipad.  The G-tablet is longer than the ipad and not quite as wide.  It gives more of a widescreen view and the screen isn't completely centered when turned long ways.  One side has a deeper indent (refer to the picture).Pros:-good build quality-great hardware for price-bright screen, good resolution-mini usb and standard usb-multi-touch screen-battery life is great!Cons:-viewing angle is good from 3 sides.  However, when tilted (indented side up) the screen darkens considerably.-no hdmi-the android buttons (home, back, options, search) are not lit.  So frustrating at night or in the dark!-have to replace stock software (tap n tap is terrible)UPDATE*found case that fits the gtablet.  Its a kindle dx leather case sold by Senyx on the Amazon marketplace.  They shipped it super fast and it came the day after they shipped.  Its only about 20 bucks.*Trevsource
I purchased the Gtablet from a local retailer. Out of the box, it is not usable. I was excited to purchase it seeing the hardware specifications. It seemed exactly what I was looking for.Then I turned it on.The Touch 'N Tap software is unusable and slow. You cannot change the home screen (or at least I could not figure out how). It would crash left and right.Android Market: This device does not include Google's Android Market. Only a shortcut to a web site that contains some apps. I believe the only tablet with Android Market support currently is the Samsung Tab. It may be this way until Android OS officially supports the tablet form factor.Now, for those that are computer savvy... no, computer experts, you can put a community created firmware on the unit to make it run very fast. I was able to do it but it was not easy.I was going to use it as a book reader too. For this, the screen is not ideal. The viewing angle is not great causing one eye to see different colors on the screen than the other.In the end, I returned my to the store. I will either get the Samsung device or wait for early 2011 for new devices
When I first got this tablet it sucked then after a little work it works way better than the ipad. The only thing I don't like about this tablet is the screen angles. It has flash, and YouTube working. But the thing almost never lags!
I bought this tablet on Thanksgiving day. Back then it was slow and clunky and I had to run a third party home screen to make the tablet usable. NOW however, after a Christmas Eve system update, the tablet is fast and responsive. The new update let's you switch between the slower Tap N Tap UI and the "classic" home screen. The classic home screen allows you to set your background and have live wallpapers (love the grass blowing in the breeze). I still haven't heard when (or if) the gtablet is getting Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), but that really doesn't matter since I'm REALLY looking forward to Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) coming out early next year. The hardware on the gtablet is the recommended hardware to run Honeycomb.
I have this tablet for a week now, I agree with other reviewers, the default software is half-baked. With the help of xda developer, I was able to tun this so-so tablet into something can be better than the ipad. The CPU is so powerful that I get over 2300 from the qaudrant test.  With a little work,I was able to run market and flash.On the other hand, ipad is better in several areas such as screen, look, accessories.If viewsonic can fix the software issue, it could be a great buy.
After reading the other reviews, I bought one of these planning on running some third party ROM. The ROM out of the box certainly justified that decision - troubles connecting, most applications force closing, and in general just a major pain.Updating to the latest software - apparently released just before christmas - fixed almost all of that. The wifi became reliable, the applications were usually solid, and the system behaved very well. It was arguably the best of the four ROMs I tried.However, it is *NOT* a Google Android Device. The Google applications are missing: contacts don't sync with google contacts, the calender doesn't sync with the google calendar, etc. Most notably, the market is the HandanGo market, not the google application market. Not only is the selection poor, but the apps I tried were all badly out of date when compared to the versions on the google market.Looking at the TapNTap software they provide - and the startup sequence - this tablet is clearly meant to replace the whiteboard in the kitchen, or something similar. You enter family members as part of the startup, and get displays of news/weather, or calender & todo lists entries.As a sop to those wanting an Android device, it's possible to switch to a more classical Android home. You can even install other Home screens if you can get to them - but you want to choose one that lets you set the # of rows/columns on the screen & in the app drawer, otherwise it'll be the 4x4 array of a stock Android phone.Bottom line: if you want a tablet for sharing with your family, this actually works reasonably. If you want an android table that interoperates with your Android phone - this isn't the tablet you want. Wait for gingerbread.
I'll keep this short and simple; if you don't know how (or don't want to) install a custom ROM on this device, DO NOT buy it.If you are considering this as an iPad alternative because of the advertised Adobe Flash support, DO NOT buy it.As of December 20, 2010 there is no Adobe Flash support.  While the box proudly and falsly displays the "F" Flash logo, you should assume that Viewsonic is giving you a different type of "F".As is, this device will punish you with a user experience low-lighted by sluggish, choppy, and frustrating software.  You'll tap on icons and wait.  You'll swipe a screen and wonder if it was recognized.Hardware-wise, this is a powerhouse.  Tegra 2, 16GB, 512RAM, strong WIFI, etc.  Conversely, the screen is about the equivalent quality of a cheap digital picture frame.  The iPad's infinitely superior IPS display underscores just how poor this display is.  The G tablet's viewing angles are just not sufficient for a tablet that will be used in so many different environments.What's the future look like?Viewsonic is currently addressing the software concerns via Twitter and is promising a couple interesting things:1.  A software update to address many of the abovementioned concerns regarding speed, response, etc.2.  Releasing the kernal.  With this, the growing user community that has already produced greatly superior Android ROMS for this device will be able to refine the software even further.This is a project or hobby tablet, not a out-of-the-box, intuitive consumer device.
While I did not by my g-tablet from Amazon, I bought it from an office supply place locally. It is loaded with bugs, and it doesn't have FLASH installed, and I am still looking for a way to get it installed (might have to root the device). It doesn't use the traditional Android Market Place, it has its own. The only thing I am using it for at this time is to listen to Pandora Radio. This is also the worst version of the Pandora Application I have seen; but it was on this devices market place. There have been at least two updates applied to the device. It still is very clunky, in that it is slow to context switch and to respond to key presses. With each update it does get a little better; but this thing feels like a generic port of the Android 2.2 OS. I have a Droid Incredible (un rooted) and it is far superior as an Android device. The other annoying thing is the default application/desktop/wallpaper, maybe again with rooting it may be possible to change the settings, and get the traditional Android Market Place. After I first powered the device up I had it get into a situation where the browser would crash all of the time, and this thing is heavily dependent upon the browser. The situation was fixed by doing a hard power cycle, and it hasn't acted up since. The display on this thing is bright; but a very limited viewing angle, maybe +/- 45 degrees of perpendicular.This thing has a lot of the specs to be a top notch tablet (except the display); but that is if the manufacturer puts some resources behind updating and adjusting the port of the Android OS. It feels like it was intended to be something like the Sony Dash which costs a lot less money. As a owner I hope it gets better; but I would not recommend this to somebody wanting a device like the iPad. For somebody wanting a android toy to hack on, this could be the device.
The Viewsonic update on 12/24 put tghis device in the fast lane. A simpledownload (not a ROM) turns it into a screamer that blows away the ipad
The Pros: Nice sized display, nice features like a built in camera and usb port unlike the ipad.The Cons: Android 2.2 not very intuitive or ergonomic.  Doing the simplest things seem impossible or a lot harder than it should be.  Lacks flexibility as in how you can manipulate or customize the GUI.  Worst of all, it's very buggy.  Two of three apps that I downloaded and installed would crash every time.  Also, for some reason, the same apps I would have on my phone would cost twice or three times as much for tablet and would not work properly.  I could not get a refund as easily I would on my phone.  I ended up returning the tablet the next day.  Wish they would just use the platform as the phones do.  Very disappointed =(
In response to the other review complaining about the price; Amazon does not currently have this item in inventory, therefore they haven't set the final price.  When it becomes available, I'm willing to bet the price will be competitive or better since I don't usually have to pay tax on Amazon.  I don't defend Amazon but I am annoyed at ignorant reviews.  One thing the previous reviewer was accurate on is that Sears has the Viewsonic G-tablet for $380.  I played with one at Staples the other day and it certainly is a slick looking device; responsive and attractive.
I ordered this tablet, my first Android device, and I was kinda wondering what I would receive...So far I'm really pleased with this thing!Being a Palm and iPod Touch user and early adopter of what people call "smart phones", I wasn't sure if I wanted a large-format device.  I have friends who are pushing their Apple tablets at me and I'm an iMac user myself... but I just wasn't sure if I needed (read that as wanted) a tablet.I bought this on "speculation" to see if I could have a little fun and perhaps learn something new.I'm having the fun part right away and I can see that some learnin' is headed my way here with the Android operating system this tablet uses.  Not hard learning, but with the "open-ness" of Android I expect to be finding new stuff to do for a good while.Out of the box I received a durable-feeling device with a nice large screen.  It turned-on first try and responded to the battery charger just like the (little) owner's manual predicted.  There is a great deal more going on with this thing than the little booklet speaks of, but the manual is complete enough for anyone to realize all but the nuts and bolts of Android... I believe the manual was not intended to tech Android to a user but to simply expose the buyer to the capabilities of the tablet.  The manual is a translation, but a good one with pictures and diagrams. Easy to read and understand.I haven't done much with it yet, but I have connected to the net using my WPA-2 WiFi "Apple Airport Extreme" and had no problem with the setup.  It reminded me of getting a Nintendo DSi connected... it was that easy. I am using MAC address filtering and that posed no problem after putting the tablet's MAC address in my list.The Localization settings were easy with the only "snag" as yet being the temperature display in the Home screen is in Centigrade and I can't (as yet) figure out how to switch to Fahrenheit.  It even "found" my little home town to use as the target city :)The only other thing I haven't figured yet is if the operating system is consuming part of the 2 gig of memory, leaving only 1 gig free or if the device shipped with only 1 gig of memory.I think this problem is my lack of familiarity with Android :)I will attempt to provide a better review as time allows, but for now I'm happy.One final note, the device is called a "MID" in the Owner's Manual and the following information appears in the "About Device" screen on the device it's self;Model Number: debFirmwear Version: 2.1-update1Kernel Version: 2.6.32.9 hzhao@emma #1Build Number: deb-r2.1.1170There is another tablet listed on Amazon called a "MID" but it does not seem to have a camera or a GPS receiver.  This unit's GPS "antenna" is external and I think the little hocky-puck is both an antenna and receiver combined.Update: (12/26/2010)Liking the tablet! The hardware is working great, no problems at all, no glitches or silly business from the device or the Android "build" as is installed.The only things I'm watching are;- The "Home" button on the front is not indexed exactly right under the front cover. Not a problem but there was a moment where it was trying to get stuck.- One of the tiny little "plugs" covering the cabinet screws has fallen out. This is no problem at all as there will come a day when I want to take those screws out myself and those plugs are going away on that day. As a side note, this tablet survived a drop from my desk top to the plastic carpet protector under the desk without a glitch.- The Android "build" has a little trouble when rotating the screen.  Two issues so far 1.) When you use Google's Star application, the Horizon is oriented incorrectly and does not correct even when you try the adjustments for screen rotation in Android or in Google's application. Weirdly, the names of planets and stars continue to rotate (to the wrong angle) even if you turn-off all the rotation controls. 2.) When you use the device in the "Landscape" orientation there is a very useful "Back" button in the screen in the top right... when you rotate to "Portrait" orientation that button goes away and you have to use the hardware buttons. Not really a big deal but the behavior of the on-screen "Back" button and the hardware button are not exactly the same in all applications.- About keyboards, mice, and memory devices. USB supports all these but does not recognize anything else.  I am using a Bluetooth "dongle" and my Apple "Magic Mouse" but my HID Bluetooth keyboard and Bluetooth GPS are not recognized.  So far I have not found an application that can pair any Bluetooth devices that are not physically incorporated in the device (that's none so far). The Bluetooth dongle I have states it is a wired equivalent of a mouse and keyboard.. but that HID keyboard is not working.That's all for now. It's worth the $230 to me so far but I'm new at this so I might not have the expectations a more seasoned Android user might have.Update: (1/7/2011)The people I got my tablet from are fantastic!  I used email to talk to them about getting a registration number for the Android release on my tablet and they were really warm and responsive.  It was like they actually liked the product!I no longer see them listed as sellers but I will look for them the next time I want something from China.(Beijing Ning Rong Technology Development Co. Ltd)I Learned some stuff.- There are a lot of "Widgets" and "Gadgets" that fail when used on a tablet... perhaps it's just this one, but I suspect the large screen is giving them trouble.- You can use an Apple Magic Mouse and Apple Wireless Keyboard (Retail Packaging) by first pairing them on your desktop machine and then moving the Bluetooth "dongle" to the Flytouch. I use an IOGear USB 2.1 Bluetooth Micro Adapter GBU421- The "Escape" key on the keyboard functions like the "Back" button on the screen.- F4 seems to first, put the device into "sleep" then shortly it will re-boot.- F1 acts like the "Menu" button.Still have not found any applications that provide USB support for other than keyboard, mouse, and memory. I hope the developers of Android see the tablet as a "future" for Android and start providing full support for USB attached peripherals.The display is really nice indoors. Outdoors it's washed-out but usable.Price jump. What's this about?!?I'm a little disturbed that this tablet has jumped in price. I kinda was thinking about a second one for a friend but at this rate, she's probably going to get something else.  Too bad, we like this one. :)Update: (01/19/2011) - Sorry if this is turning into a "blog"...An update to the Android OS has come out, not a big change like version 2.2 or anything, but it allowed me to see what and how upgrades look like and are done.It did not go so well.  I had to go onto the Internet and find the proper file myself and load it again using a micro SD card. After that everything was back to "normal".  I had to find and re-load all the applications I had loaded and every setting had to be re-entered.  I later found out that you can back-up these things and save yourself some time.  Considering the changes to the Android OS, I will wait for a major update before going with another minor one again... too much hassle for not so much gain.The tablet is still a winner! I have it running for several hours a day and am even now watching a DVD TV show (converted using "Handbrake" for the Mac). Playback is smooth at 720 x 400 and around 1100 bits per second (m-peg4). See, this thing is making me learn about stuff like Android OS and video data rates :)Still can't set the Weather widget to Fahrenheit, but otherwise I'm still happy with the purchase.Update: (06/01/2014) - Amazon still lists this tablet on their site.Beware of the following issues;1.) This tablet is no longer supported by the manufacturer. NO UPDATES TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM.2.) The Amazon Appstore no longer functions correctly on this device. NO MORE APPS CAN BE INSTALLED.3.) You are lucky if you installed a suite of useful applications because Amazon Appstore and Google Play are unavailable to you with this device. You can "side load" the old Android Market but it is severely "broken" and will likely not even allow you to browse applications.Good while it lasted! This tablet was my first Android device and it still functions as it did when it was new. A good device left to fallow by an supportive vendor. Beware that if something you buy lasts beyond the 30 or 90 day warrentee period you are likely to be "on your own" from there on out.
